<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Grant Ritchie and Devinder Sivia present an easily accessible account of <i>Physics for Chemists</i>. The book, which to the best of our knowledge is the first ever introductory physics text specifically targetted at chemistry students, explains and illustrates in simple and chemically relevant terms the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is essential knowledge for any practising scientist. This Primer will be of interest to all students of science (and their mentors).</p>
