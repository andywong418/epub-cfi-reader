<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The synthesis methods used in the preparation of inorganic materials, many of which have extended lattices rather than discrete molecules, are quite different from those used by organic, organometallic and coordination chemists. Rather than altering a single functional group or ligand attached to a molecule, the materials chemist works with complete lattices, either building or modifying them. The techniques used to do this and their application to inorganic materials synthesis are discussed in this chapter.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.1">
<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>High temperature reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The most widely used method for the synthesis of inorganic materials follows an almost universal route that involves heating the components together at high temperature over an extended period. Many of the inorganic materials discussed in this book are complex oxides, i.e. materials containing more than one metal in addition to oxygen. These compounds include ternary phases such as BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and quaternary oxides, e.g. YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-<i>x</i></sub>. In such cases the direct high temperature reaction of the component oxides frequently yields the desired complex oxide phase. This direct method of preparation is, however, equally applicable to other inorganic material types, for example the following syntheses</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The process of the reaction between solids</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to illustrate a typical synthesis in solid state chemistry the preparation of the ternary oxide, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, will be used as an example. Simple binary oxides are generally available commercially as polycrystalline powders with typical particle dimensions of a few micrometres. In the synthesis of SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, SrO and TiO<sub>2</sub> would be ground together in the correct stoichiometric proportions (1:1 molar ratio) using a pestle and mortar. A representative reaction would then involve pressing the mixture into a pellet, transferring it to a crucible and placing this in a furnace at 900&#176;C. The crucible is normally constructed of an inert material such as vitreous silica, recrystallised alumina or platinum.</p>
<a id="page_27" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 27, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a>
<p class="indent">A schematic view of the reaction mixture, magnified many times, is represented in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig 3.1a</a> and consists of particles of the constituent oxides, separated mainly by voids, but with some contact at particular crystal faces. Reaction between the binary oxides occurs by migration of ions between the pure oxides across these interfaces and formation of the new structure of the target ternary oxide. A representation of a partially reacted mixture, derived from that in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>a is shown in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>b. In reactions between oxides the most mobile ions are normally the cations, as these are usually smaller than the oxide ions, and it is these ions that diffuse through the oxide and between the reactant blocks.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The need for the high temperatures required in the synthesis of mixed oxides can be rationalised by consideration of the energetics of the reaction process. In comparison with organic and organometallic chemistry where a typical reaction will involve the breaking of <i>one</i> bond and the formation another, sometimes simultaneously, the solid state reaction involves a complete disruption of the structure. The cations in an oxide material are normally coordinated to a large number of oxide ions ranging from 4 for the smallest ions, e.g. Li<sup>+</sup>, to 12, or more for ions such as barium. In order for these ions to migrate to the interfaces/grain boundaries and form a new structure, considerable energy is required to overcome the lattice energy. Hence, the typical reaction temperatures of oxide chemistry in the range 500-2000&#176;C. At the lowest temperatures, ions with a low charge to radius ratio, for example Cs<sup>+</sup> and other alkali metals, which have the weakest interaction with the lattice, will undergo reaction. So, for example, the reaction</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a>proceeds reasonably rapidly at 400&#176;C. Small, strongly charged cations, which interact more strongly with the oxide lattice, require higher temperatures to produce significant reaction. For example the reaction</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">would normally be carried out at temperatures above 1400&#176;C. Increasing the temperature of a solid state reaction will speed up the process as the rates of diffusion of the various ions increase. The limit of this behaviour is seen when the mixture of solids melts and the ions become highly mobile. Occasionally the reaction to form a new complex oxide may be carried out in the melt; however, as discussed in <a href="#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>, crystallisation of a molten reaction mixture will often not give the desired product.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides raising the temperature, other methods can be used to enhance the reaction rate between solids. Consideration of the schematic reaction mixture in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>a helps illustrate these. To improve the reaction rate, the number of interfaces at which the reaction can occur needs to be maximised. This may be achieved by both reducing the particle size and pelletising the material. Thorough grinding of the metal oxide mixture will produce a homogenous distribution of the two oxides ensuring that each oxide particle is surrounded, as far as possible, by oxide particles of the other type. Pelletising the material, normally carried out using a hydraulic press, reduces the inter-particle void space (typically to less than 10%) producing many more interfaces over which the reaction can take place.</p>
<p class="indent">After the reaction has proceeded for some time a volume of the product builds up along the interface between the reacting crystallites. Further formation of the ternary phase requires the cations to migrate over longer distances, though this distance is minimised by reducing the particle size in the initial grinding. To facilitate further reaction the partially reacted powder is normally reground at intervals, this has the advantage of introducing pristine reactant crystal faces to each other.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.3">
<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Precursor, solution and gel methods</h2>
<p class="noindent">The reduction in the particle size by grinding the reaction mixture, even mechanically, can only achieve a limiting level of grain diameter, at best about 0.1 &#956;m. However, chemical methods can be used to effectively reduce particle size still further and so enhance reaction rates at a particular temperature. One valuable method is the use of precursors that decompose at moderate temperatures to generate the reactant oxides; such precursors include metal carbonates, hydroxides and nitrates. When the crystallites of these precursors disintegrate with the loss of gaseous species they break down to yield fine, very reactive particles resulting in faster reaction times. An additional advantage of precursors is that they are normally air stable while many oxides are hygroscopic and/or pick up carbon dioxide from the air. A commercial sample of BaO normally contains Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> and BaCO<sub>3</sub> and will continue to react with water/CO<sub>2</sub> in the air whilst being weighed out in the<a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a> laboratory. This makes the stoichiometry of a reaction involving BaO difficult to control. BaCO<sub>3</sub>, however, is perfectly air stable, and is frequently employed for reactions involving barium, though it needs to be heated strongly to ensure complete decomposition to the oxide.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to produce very homogeneous mixtures the solid state chemist can employ solutions where the reactant ions are dispersed on the atomic scale. Precipitation from mixed ion solutions will produce a solid containing the required ions, though care must be taken to ensure that the precipitate is of the correct stoichiometry. A typical reaction would be</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-4em;">

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">where the highly insoluble oxalates are precipitated from a 1:2 molar aqueous solution of zinc and iron. Heating the mixed metal oxalate product in air above 800&#176;C results in its decomposition to yield the ternary oxide, ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, in just a few hours.</p>
<p class="indent">Precipitation methods have considerable advantages, it is, however, difficult to ensure that the precipitate has the desired stoichiometry. In the preparation of complex oxides, such as YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, the correct conditions, for example pH, to precipitate a 1:2:3 Y:Ba:Cu complex from solution are difficult to determine and one ion may be left, to some degree, in solution leading to an impure product. This may be overcome using gel methods. In this technique rather than precipitating and filtering to produce a solid, the whole solution is solidified through complexation and/or removal of water producing a gel. Such techniques have been widely used for the synthesis of ceramics including the high temperature superconductor, YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Dissolution of yttrium, barium and copper as their nitrate salts in water is followed by addition of citric acid and ethanediol. Heating of this mixture and evaporation of water results in the formation of a gel that may then be heated further in a crucible to form the complex oxide. The final stage, due to the mixing of various ions at the atomic level, can be carried out at temperatures as low as 700&#176;C and requires only a few hours. This should be contrasted with a direct reaction of oxides which typically requires temperatures above 900&#176;C for several days.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Sealed tubes and special atmospheres</h2>
<p class="noindent">The direct reaction discussed above is widely used for the synthesis of complex oxides, fluorides, chlorides, phosphates, silicates and sulphides, and is generally carried out in air. However, the reaction environment may need to be controlled if a particular oxidation state or reaction stoichiometry is targeted. In such cases the reactions are carried out in a controlled atmosphere, using a tube furnace, where a particular gas can be passed over the reaction mixture during heating. An example of such a reaction would be the use of an inert gas to prevent oxidation, as in the preparation of the thallium(I) compound TlTaO<sub>3</sub></p>

<p class="indent">High gas pressures may also be used to control the reaction product stoichiometry. For example the use of oxygen under high pressures, several hundred atmospheres, permits the formation of Sr<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> (Fe(IV)) from mixtures of SrO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This should be contrasted with the formation of compounds containing Fe(III) under ambient pressures.</p>
<p class="indent">Another problem encountered in direct synthesis is the volatility of one or more components of the mixture at the high temperatures required for reaction. In such cases the reaction mixture is normally sealed in a glass tube, under vacuum, prior to heating. Examples of such reactions are</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The application of solution methods is extended by using hydrothermal techniques where the reacting solution is heated in a sealed vessel above its boiling point. Such reactions are important in the synthesis of open structure aluminosilicates (zeolites). The preparation of zeolites typically involves crystallisation from a strongly basic aqueous solution containing the<a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a> tetrahedral structure building ions ( NaAlO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> ) plus a templating ion that is frequently an organic base. The shape of the templating ion directs the crystallisation of the aluminate and silicate tetrahedra and determines the structure of the zeolite product. The crystallisation process is frequently slow and hydrothermal methods act to speed up the process. An example of zeolite preparation is that of ZSM-5, a material discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. A mixture of silicic acid ( SiO<sub>2</sub>.<i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O), sodium hydroxide, aluminium sulphate, water, <i>n</i>-propylamine and tetrapropylammonium bromide is heated in a hydrothermal bomb at 160&#176;C for several days. The organic template ion directs the formation of the structure as shown in <a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a> with the alkyl groups filling the channels. The template ion may be removed from the cavity by heating the product in air, oxidising the organic cation and leaving intact the aluminosilicate framework.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Phase diagrams and synthesis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The direct reaction of components to form inorganic materials is generally carried out below the melting point of the system despite the process being extremely slow. Ideally the materials chemist would like to use molten phases T where reaction rates are much faster due to the more rapid ion diffusion. T However, cooling a molten mixture does not normally yield the desired product in a pure form and to understand this behaviour a knowledge of phase diagrams is required.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 3.3</b> Simple binary eutectic system.</p>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Phase diagrams are very useful to the solid state chemist; they illustrate the behaviour of multi-component systems as a function of temperature by delineating the ranges of stability of various phases in terms of the stoichiometry of the mixture and temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">A simple two component system phase diagram is shown in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> with the <i>x</i> axis denoting the relative proportions of two components A and B and the <i>y</i> axis the temperature. A and B do not react together, i.e. there is no compound A<sub><i>a</i></sub>B<sub><i>b</i></sub> in the system; an example of this behaviour would be CuO and CdO. The diagram has four regions. At low temperatures both A and B are solids and a mixture of the two consists of discrete particles of the two solids. At higher temperatures A and B melt and, depending on the stoichiometry of the mixture temperature/composition, regions occur where solid A exists with a liquid, solid B exists with a liquid or the whole system is molten. The composition/temperature point E, i.e. the stoichiometry which is totally liquid at the <i>lowest</i> temperature, is known as the eutectic point and this composition is the eutectic composition. The curve separating totally liquid from solid+liquid regions is known as the liquidus.</p>
<p class="indent">The above case is of little interest to the synthetic chemist as no compound is formed in the system. However, the simple eutectic system behaviour is found in more complex phase diagrams such as that shown in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>. In this case the components A and B react together and form a compound of stoichiometry AB with a different structure. This new compound is represented in the figure by a vertical line. A feature of this type of phase<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a> diagram is that if the compound AB is heated then on reaching the temperature <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> the compound melts to produce a liquid of the same composition. This is known as <i>congruent</i> melting. For this type of phase diagram the overall behaviour is that of two simple, binary, eutectic phase diagrams joined side to side. Hence, the left-hand side of the diagram is a binary eutectic between A and AB and the right-hand side one between AB and B. In a binary system that adopts this type of phase diagram the synthesis of AB from the components A and B can be undertaken very easily. A 1:1 stoichiometric mixture of A and B is melted; on cooling the melt, if fully homogeneous, will crystallise to give pure AB.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="width:70%;"><b>Figs. 3.4 and 3.5</b> Two component phase diagrams forming a phase AB with congruent and incongruent melting respectively.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The other type of phase diagram that occurs for a two component system forming a compound AB is shown in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.5</a>, where the behaviour of the compound AB on heating is somewhat different. In this case when the compound AB reaches the temperature <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> it <i>partially</i> melts to yield some solid A plus a liquid that will be richer in B. On further heating the solid A dissolves in the liquid until at temperature <i>T</i><sub>3</sub> the system is completely molten and the liquid is of the composition AB. This behaviour, where AB does not melt directly to give a liquid of the same composition, but deposits one component, generating a liquid richer in the other is known as <i>incongruent</i> melting and has profound effects regarding synthesis. In this system if a molten 1:1 mixture of A and B is cooled to temperature r<sub>3</sub>, solid A will crystallise out and the liquid will get richer in B, its composition following the liquidus curve. On reaching the temperature <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> the compound AB is now stable and the reaction</p>

<p class="noindent">can occur. However, this reaction involves a solid and, as has been described above, will be very slow, particularly so as solid A will have settled out on the bottom of the reaction vessel. In addition as the particles of A start to react back with the liquid, to form solid AB, the product will coat the solid A inhibiting further reaction. If the system is cooled extremely slowly, typically over many days then the reaction between solid A and liquid B will occur and pure AB can be obtained. However, faster cooling causes the liquid rich in B to solidify before the reaction with solid A is complete yielding a mixture of AB and B plus some solid A which crystallised out initially.</p>
<p class="indent">Hence, for this type of phase diagram, with incongruent melting, heating the system above <i>T<sub>2</sub>,</i> known as the peritectic temperature, the maximum temperature at which the compound AB is stable, is unhelpful. In such systems the preparation of AB is normally carried out below <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> where AB is stable but both A and B are solid, that is, the typical, direct reaction of solids discussed above in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.</p>

<p class="noindent">The synthesis methods described above are applicable to most solid state reactions where a new structure is built from the reactants. This generation of a new ion or bonding arrangement requires considerable energy, demanding the high reaction temperatures common in solid state chemistry. However, some reactions of solids can be carried out at much lower temperatures, at or just above room temperature, and involve <i>modification</i> of a material's structure. These reactions include intercalation or insertion where an ion or molecule is added to a compound leaving the basic structure of the solid unchanged and ion-exchange when one ion within a material is replaced by another.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Insertion compounds of metal oxides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Insertion reactions involving large molecules normally require a layer type structure in order for sufficient room to be generated, by increased separation of the layers, to accommodate the guest species. Very small ions, e.g. Li<sup>+</sup>,<a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, The synthesis of inorganic materials</a> may be inserted into three-dimensional structures, such as oxides, provided there is sufficient room. In the case of alkali metal insertion into transition metal oxides this process occurs with reduction of the transition metal. One example is the insertion of lithium into rhenium trioxide via the reaction</p>

<p class="noindent">This reaction may be carried out by grinding the two solids, anhydrous lithium iodide and rhenium trioxide, in a pestle and mortar. The rhenium trioxide structure is sufficiently open to allow rapid diffusion of lithium ions to empty sites and the metal oxide framework remains intact throughout the reaction. The rhenium is partially reduced from Re(VI) to Re(V). Other transition metal oxides including WO<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> undergo similar insertion reactions with lithium and other small ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Ion exchange</h3>
<p class="noindent">Structures of the type described above, with strongly bonded layers or frameworks containing weakly held guest molecules or ions, frequently undergo facile reactions at low temperatures in which one weakly bonded species is swapped for another. This ion exchange behaviour of zeolites is well known. For example, the process</p>

<p class="indent">Similar reactions can occur for other materials that have ions weakly interacting with a strongly bonded framework. One example is LiTiNbO<sub>s</sub> which has a layer structure of the type schematically shown in <a href="#fig3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>. The lithium ions may be exchanged with other ions such as sodium and potassium by stirring the solid with a solution of the desired cation.</p>
