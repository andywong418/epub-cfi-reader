<p class="noindent">The first row transition metal monoxides TiO to NiO adopt the rocksalt structure shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. This would be predicted from the ionic radius ratio, <i>r</i><sub>M2+</sub>/<i>r</i><sub>02-</sub>, between 0.414 and 0.732, and filling of the octahedral site in a close-packed array of oxide ions. Many of these materials are non-stoichiometric existing over a range of composition and this behaviour is described in detail in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. The electronic properties of these compounds which range from metal to insulator are discussed in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. CuO has a structure formed from linked CuO<sub>4</sub> square planes, a more typical geometry for Cu<sup>2+</sup> than the octahedral sites found in the rocksalt structure. Few second and third row transition metals form monoxides.</p>

<p class="noindent">The majority of transition metal dioxides crystallise with the rutile structure, shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.2</a>, though in some materials the structure is slightly distorted. Materials of this stoichiometry exist for Ti, Cr, V and Mn in the first row transition metal series and for Zr&#8211;Pd and Hf&#8211;Pt in the second and third rows. The rutile structure is again predicted for the majority of transition metal dioxides on the basis of radius ratio rules and filling of sites in a close-packed oxide structure.</p>

<p class="indent">The rutile unit cell is tetragonal with the metal atoms lying on the cell corners and body centre; however, because the oxide ions are not related through the body centred condition the unit cell is primitive. The coordination geometry around the metal ion is approximately octahedral, but four metal to oxide ion distances are, in general, slightly different from the other two.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">MO<sub>3</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">Few transition metals adopt the +6 oxidation state in oxide and, therefore, oxides of the stoichiometry MO<sub>3</sub> are rare. ReO<sub>3</sub> has the structure shown in <a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a> which may be easily constructed by linking ReO<sub>6</sub> octahedra through all vertices. This gives rise to a primitive, cubic unit cell. WO<sub>3</sub> adopts a slightly distorted variant of the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure, but still contains solely corner sharing octahedra.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ternary oxides</h2>
<p class="noindent">The structure of many binary oxides can be predicted on the basis of the relative sizes of the metal and oxide ions and filling of holes in a close packed oxide lattice. Such predictions of structure are more difficult for ternary phases. The combination of two or more metals in an oxide generates a wealth of structural possibilities dependent on the relative sizes of the two metal ions and the oxide ion. In addition the stoichiometry of the ternary oxide may be changed by varying the proportions of the two component oxides and, for transition and lanthanide elements, the oxidation state. For example, at least twenty ternary oxide phases are formed between strontium and vanadium including SrV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, Sr<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SrVO<sub>3</sub> and Sr<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>. The structural chemistry of ternary and more complex oxides is, thus, an extensive subject. There are, however, a few structures which are widely adopted by ternary oxides and many materials from these structural classes have important technological applications. These ternary oxide structures are also used as units in building more complex oxides, such as the high temperature superconductors, <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The perovskite structure</h2>
<p class="noindent">The perovskite structure, frequently adopted by materials of the stoichiometry ABO<sub>3</sub> is, perhaps, the most widespread ternary phase. Perovskites are named after the mineral CaTiO<sub>3</sub> which was identified by the Russian mineralogist L.A. Perovski. Several hundred materials of stoichiometry ABO<sub>3</sub> adopt the perovskite structure or a slighted distorted version. In the notation ABO<sub>3</sub> the A cation is conventionally the larger of two metal ions so, for example, in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> [ <i>r</i>(Sr<sup>2+</sup>)= 1.52 &#x00C5; and <i>r</i>(Ti<sup>4+</sup>) = 0.745 &#x00C5;)] strontium would be denoted as the A cation and titanium as the B cation.</p>
<a id="page_39" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 39, Transition metal oxides</a>
<p class="indent">The perovskite structure is shown in <a href="#fig4.4">Figs 4.4a</a> and <a href="#fig4.4">4.4b</a> with the A and B cations at the unit cell origin respectively. The coordination geometry of the smaller B cation is octahedral while that of the larger A cation is 12 fold.</p>

<p class="noindent">The relationship of the structure to that of ReO<sub>3</sub> is readily appreciated by reference to <a href="#fig4.5">Figs. 4.5</a> and <a href="#fig4.3">4.3</a>. The BO<sub>6</sub> octahedra link all vertices forming the same cubic framework as in ReO<sub>3</sub>.

<p class="indent">The range of oxides adopting the perovskite structure is delineated by the relative sizes of the cations A and B, provided that their overall charge sums to six. The dimensions of the sites accommodating the A and B cations mean that the perovskite structure is frequently found for ternary ABO<sub>3</sub> oxides formed with one large and one small cation. Some examples are given in <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a></p>
<p class="indent">In some complex oxides the perovskite sites may be shared by two or more cations. A complicated looking formula such as La<sub>2</sub>MgRuO<sub>6</sub> may be rewritten as La(Ru<sub>&#x00BD;</sub>Mg,<sub>&#x00BD;</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>, which is a perovskite with La on the A site and a random mixture of Ru and Mg on the B sites.</p>

<p class="noindent">For ternary and more complex oxides, including perovskites, the size and coordination preferences of three or more ions need to be satisfied simultaneously by the structure; it is, however, rarely possible that all these preferences can be accommodated perfectly. This can be illustrated for the perovskite structure by deriving a relationship between the radii of the various ions. Consideration of <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a> yields the expressions</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">Note that these ranges only apply to Shannon and Prewitt radii: for other systems, e.g. Goldschmidt, the perovskite stability ranges for <i>t</i> are quite different.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">For a perfect fit for the two ions into the perovskite structure <i>t</i> = 1; increasing deviation of <i>t</i> from unity indicates increasing strain on the perovskite structure in terms of the ions being too big or too small to fit on their allotted site. Ionic radii normally used in the above expression are those of Goldschmidt as these provide the best predictive power in terms of defining the stability of the perovskite structure for different cation sizes. However, other systems of ionic radii can be used to illustrate how well the two cations fit into the structure and, for consistency, those of Shannon and Prewitt used elsewhere in this primer will be employed. Taking the values for Sr<sup>2+</sup> (<i>r</i>= 158 pm ), Ti<sup>4+</sup> (<i>r</i> = 74.5 pm) and O<sup>2&#8211;</sup> (<i>r</i> = 126 pm) yields a value of 1.002 for <i>t</i> indicating that the coordination distance preferences for both strontium and titanium are met. As the values for <i>t</i> depart from unity increased stresses are built up in the perovskite structure as one or both of the cations occupies a site of non-ideal dimensions. This may be overcome by a distortion of the perovskite structure and for <i>t</i> values in the range 0.85 &#x003C;<i>t</i>&#x003C;1.06 a perovskite structure, or a distorted version thereof, is frequently adopted by compounds of the stoichiometry ABO<sub>3</sub>. Using the Shannon and Prewitt radii, for 0.9&#x003C;<i>t</i>&#x003C;1.0 the structure is often cubic, above 1.0 and below 0.9 the structure is normally distorted. For <i>t</i> values outside the range 0.85&#8211;1.06 the perovskite structure cannot meet the coordination requirements of the two cations and other structures are normally adopted. For example, LiNbO<sub>3</sub> and FeTiO<sub>3</sub> have <i>t</i> &#x00AB; 0.9, as the cations are of similar sizes, and the perovskite structure is not formed; the structure of LiNbO<sub>3</sub> is described in <a href="#sec_4.5">Section 4.5</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">BaTiO<sub>3</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">For BaTiO<sub>3</sub> a tolerance factor of 1.06 is obtained; this value, greater than unity, indicates that the titanium ion is occupying a site that is larger than it would prefer. Above 120&#176;C BaTiO<sub>3</sub> adopts a perfect cubic perovskite structure; at these high temperatures the extensive thermal motion of the various ions makes packing considerations in terms of ionic radii less important. On cooling, BaTiO<sub>3</sub> undergoes a series of phase changes as summarised in <a href="#tab4.2">Table 4.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">These phase changes are a result of the structure distorting from the perfect perovskite description so as to develop a more acceptable co-ordination geometry around the titanium atom. This is shown in projection <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Transition metal oxides</a>in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a> with the barium ions at the unit cell corners. In the tetragonal phase the major positional shift is that the titanium ion becomes displaced from the central site towards one of the oxide ions in the cell faces; smaller displacements of the barium and oxygen ions also occur. These displacements make the lattice directions inequivalent such that <i>a</i>=<i>b</i>&#x2260;<i>c</i>, that is the cell symmetry reduces to tetragonal, though the distortion is quite small with <i>c</i>/<i>a</i> = 1.01. However, this distortion is readily observed in the powder diffraction pattern, <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2.</a> The indexation of the powder pattern from BaTiO<sub>3</sub> was carried out in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.6">Section 2.6</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">One effect of this displacement of titanium from the central site of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> is on the charge distribution in the unit cell. If charges are formally attached to the various ions as Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Ti<sup>4+</sup> and O<sup>2&#8211;</sup> then the centres of negative and positive charge in the cubic form of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> coincide at the cell centre. However, in the tetragonal phase, owing to the large displacement of titanium ion, the unit cell charge centres are no longer coincident, <a href="#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>. This polarisation of charge gives the unit cell a high dipole moment.</p>
<p class="indent">The displacements of the titanium ions in the large number of unit cells which make up part of a crystal or <i>domain</i> of tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> can be arranged such that in neighbouring unit cells the displacements are in exactly the same directions. The result of this is that the individual unit cell dipoles all line up in the same direction, <a href="#fig4.10">Fig. 4.10a</a>, and this behaviour means that tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> is termed a ferroelectric. Ferroelectric crystals are non-centrosymmetric and display a long range ordering of the dipoles below a characteristic temperature known as the Curie temperature. In the absence of an external electric field, the ordering of the dipoles within the various domains (sections of the crystal) produces a spontaneous polarisation of the crystallite. Following the application of an external electric field the direction of polarisation in the various domains can order so that they all line up with the external field. The polarisation of the crystal results in a very high dielectric constant for BaTiO<sub>3</sub> and it is widely used in capacitors.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">Centrosymmetric structures have an inversion centre at the origin, that is for every atom on a site <i>x,y,z</i> in the unit cell there is an equivalent atom at <i>&#8211;x,&#8211;y,&#8211;z</i>. In ferroelectric crystals, therefore, no inversion centre is present leading to a relatively low crystal symmetry.</p>

<p class="indent">Charge separation in distorted perovskite structures is a common feature though the interaction of ion displacements in neighbouring unit cells may<a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Transition metal oxides</a> occur in a manner different from that observed in BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. In the tetragonal phase of PbZrO<sub>3</sub> the lead ion displacements in adjacent unit cells are in opposite directions, <a href="#fig4.10">Fig. 4.10b</a>, and this material is an antiferroelectric.</p>

<p class="indent">BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, in common with a number of other ferroelectrics shows what is known as piezoelectric behaviour. A piezoelectric material develops an electric polarisation on the application of stress. Compression of a crystal of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> causes further distortion of the tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> unit cell, a further separation of the charges and a higher degree of polarisation of the charge. This may be used in a number of ways to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy; examples include applications as record player needles and in gas lighters.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Insertion compounds and perovskite structures</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a> the reaction of Lil with ReO<sub>3</sub> to give Li<sub>0.3</sub>ReO<sub>3</sub> was discussed. The perovskite and ReO<sub>3</sub> structure are identical except for the filling of the A sites in the former. The reason for the ease of this reaction can now be readily seen in that the structure of the product, Li<sub>0.3</sub> ReO<sub>3</sub>, is a perovskite with a proportion, 30%, of the A sites filled. Owing to the small size of Li<sup>+</sup> the perovskite structure distorts slightly by tilting of the ReO<sub>6</sub> octahedra so as to bring oxygen ions closer to it. The insertion of lithium ions into ReO<sub>3</sub> merely involves diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> into the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure through the faces of the unit cell cube. The Re&#8211;O bonds forming the framework are unaffected allowing this solid state reaction to progress at room temperature. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Li<sub>0.3</sub> ReO<sub>3</sub> and ReO<sub>3</sub> are almost identical, as they are dominated by scattering from the rhenium (due to the high number of electrons), except for a small shift in peak positions caused by a decrease in lattice parameter.</p>
<p class="indent">Tungsten trioxide is another material which undergoes insertion reactions of this type. WO<sub>3</sub>, with a slightly distorted version of the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure, forms the compound Na<sub>1.0</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>, adopting the perovskite structure. Ho<sub>0.6</sub>WO<sub>3</sub> synthesised by inserting protons into WO<sub>3</sub>, has a structure of the perovskite type, but the hydrogen atoms, instead of sitting isolated on the perovskite A sites, form OH groups with the oxide ions along the unit cell edges.</p>

The lithium ions may be displaced within the octahedral sites and LiNbO<sub>3</sub> is a ferroelectric.

<p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 4.12</b> The spinel structure.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The spinel structure is rather more complicated than those discussed earlier though one helpful representation is shown in <a href="#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>. The structure is based upon a cubic close packed arrangement of anions in which a proportion of tetrahedral and octahedral sites is occupied. With <i>n</i> close packed anions, <i>2n</i> tetrahedral holes and <i>n</i> octahedral <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Transition metal oxides</a>holes are generated. In the spinel structure one-eighth of the tetrahedral holes and one-half of the octahedral holes are occupied in an ordered manner throughout the structure. The A cations normally occupy the tetrahedral sites and the B cations the octahedral ones giving the stoichiometry A<sub>2<i>n</i>/8</sub>B<sub><i>n</i>/2</sub>X<sub><i>n</i></sub>, which is equivalent to AB<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The unit cell in <a href="#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a> shows the tetrahedral and octahedral co-ordination of the A and B cations. Rather than considering the structure as the filling of holes in a close packed anion array one alternative is to draw the structure as a face centred cubic array of A ions into which smaller cubes of stoichiometry B<sub>4</sub>X<sub>4</sub> and AX<sub>4</sub> are added. The AX<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>X<sub>4</sub> cubelets alternate in the structure and the unit cell contains four of each giving the unit cell stoichiometry 4(AX<sub>4</sub>) + 4(B<sub>4</sub>X<sub>4</sub>) + 4A ( from the cell corners and faces) = A<sub>8</sub>B<sub>16</sub>X<sub>32</sub> corresponding to the formula AB<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>. The structure is face centred cubic; consideration of any ion in the unit cell will show other ions in identical environments with translations of +(&#x00BD;,&#x00BD;,0), +(&#x00BD;,0,&#x00BD;) and (0,&#x00BD;,&#x00BD;). The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a spinel, for example <a href="#fig4.13">Fig. 4.13</a>, shows the typical general absences for a material crystallising with a face centred cubic structure.</p>

<p class="indent">This arrangement of the A and B cations over the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure, that is A<sup>t</sup>B<sub>2</sub>&#176;X<sub>4</sub>, where the superscripts refer to the coordination geometry, is known as the <i>normal</i> arrangement and the structure as the <i>normal</i> spinel structure. The B ion, which exists at twice the level of the A cation, occupies only octahedral sites within the structure. In some compounds adopting the spinel structure, known as <i>inverse</i> spinels, a different arrangement of cations exists corresponding to B<sup>t</sup>(AB)<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>X<sub>4</sub>, where all the A cations occupy octahedral sites and the B cations are distributed equally over the two coordination geometries.</p>
<p class="indent">Why some materials adopt the inverse spinel structure rather than the normal one is a result of a number of factors including the ion charges. The <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Transition metal oxides</a> following discussion applies to the most common formulation (A<sup>2+</sup>B<sub>2</sub><sup>3+</sup>)X<sup>2&#8211;</sup><sub>4</sub> but the arguments can be equally well extended to the (A<sup>4+</sup>B<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>)X<sup>2&#8211;</sup><sub>4</sub> system.</p>
<p class="indent">Ionic size is one parameter, though flexibility in the position of the anions in the spinel structure permits a range of cation sizes to be coordinated at their preferred contact distances. The higher charged B cations are generally smaller than the A ions, whilst the tetrahedral sites in a close packed anion array are significantly smaller than the octahedral holes. This would point towards the smaller B cations preferring to occupy the tetrahedral sites i.e. the <i>inverse</i> formulation B<sup>t</sup>(AB)<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>X<sub>4</sub>. However, the oxide ions are not fixed and positional displacements are possible, to some extent, to accommodate differently sized ions.</p>
<p class="indent">The ion size factor is generally outweighed by lattice energy calculations; probably the most important parameter in determining the cation distribution. Calculation of the lattice energy of spinels with the same cations, but with the two different distributions, shows that the normal spinel often has a slightly higher lattice energy than the inverse description. The simple reason for this is that lattice energies are determined through summation of all the Coulombic interactions of the ion pairs in the lattice. That is,</p>

Placing a highly charged cation on a high coordination site contributes strongly to the lattice energy and produces a greater lattice energy than other arrangements. This lattice energy consideration indicates that the majority of (2+,3+) spinels should adopt the normal structure. In practice for non-transition metal systems, where the third factor, discussed below, is non-operative, inorganic spinels, for example MgTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, are generally found to adopt the normal spinel structure.</p>

<p class="indent">In spinels which contain a first row transition metal, a third factor, partial occupancy of the d-orbitals, is of importance in determining the cation distribution. This is the crystal field stabilisation energy of the various ions in the octahedral and tetrahedral coordination geometries. The occupancy of the d-orbitals on Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in a spinel on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites is shown in <a href="#fig4.14">Figs. 4.14a</a> and <a href="#fig4.14">4.14b</a>. In an octahedral site the d-orbitals are split into two groups, the t<sub>2g</sub> set ( d<sub><i>xy</i></sub>, d<sub><i>yz</i></sub> and d<sub><i>xz</i></sub>), which point between the ligands, and the e<sub>g</sub> set (d<sub><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>&#8211;<i>y</i><sup>2</sup></sub>, d<sub><i>z</i><sup>2</sup></sub>), which point towards the ligands. The t<sub>2g</sub> set are stabilised relative to the e<sub>g</sub> set by an amount &#x0394;<sub>o</sub>. In the tetrahedral case the arrangement is inverted and the separation of the t<sub>2</sub> and e sets is &#x0394;<sub>t</sub> where &#x0394;<sub>t</sub> &#x2243; 4/9&#x0394;<sub>o</sub>. In oxide spinels the splitting of the t<sub>2g</sub> and e<sub>g</sub> levels is fairly small as oxide is a weak field ligand. This leads to oxide spinels being high spin materials where the electrons are distributed in the d-orbitals with the maximum number of parallel spins.</p>
<p class="indent">With Cr<sup>3+</sup>, a d<sup>3</sup> ion, on an octahedral site only the t<sub>2g</sub> set of orbitals are occupied, <a href="#fig4.14">Fig. 4.14a</a>; owing to the lower energy of these orbitals this octahedral configuration is <i>stabilised</i> relative to the case where the ion is non-coordinated to a level known as the crystal field stabilisation energy (CFSE). In terms of A<sub>0</sub> this CFSE is 3x2/5&#215;&#x0394;<sub>o</sub> = 6/5x&#x0394;<sub>o</sub>. This may be compared to the case where chromium occupies a tetrahedral site, <a href="#fig4.14">Fig. 4.14b</a>; here with a high spin electron distribution, e<sup>2</sup>t<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> the CFSE is 2x3/5&#x0394;&#8211;2/5&#x0394;<sub>t</sub> 4/5&#215;&#x0394;<sub>t</sub> (&#x2243;&#x2153;
&#x0394;<sub>o</sub>). This is much less than the octahedral case and the CFSE considerations imply that Cr<sup>34</sup> would very much prefer to occupy an octahedral site than a tetrahedral one in a spinel. In a spinel, such as MgCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the CFSE considerations reinforce the lattice energy support for the normal spinel with the cation distribution Mg<sup>t</sup>Cr<sub>2</sub>&#176;O<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The difference between the CFSE in octahedral and tetrahedral geometries is known as the excess octahedral stabilisation energy and the values for various first row transition metal 2+ and 3+ ions are given in <a href="#tab4.4">Table 4.4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The high excess octahedral CFSE for Cr<sup>3+</sup> of 158 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (corresponding to 6/5&#215;&#x0394;<sub>o</sub> &#8211; 4/5&#215;&#x0394;<sub>t</sub> ) was demonstrated above and supports these 3+ ions on an octahedral site. If another spinel, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is considered, the use of CFSE's to stabilise an inverse spinel can be demonstrated. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can be rewritten as Fe<sup>2+</sup>Fe<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, fitting in with the general spinel formula. The excess octahedral CFSE for Fe<sup>3+</sup> is zero; as a d<sup>5</sup> ion in a high spin environment the distribution of the d-orbitals, which each contain one electron, produces no CFSE in any coordination. However, for Fe<sup>2+</sup>, a d<sup>6</sup> ion, there is a small excess octahedral CFSE of 17 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>; this indicates that this ion would rather occupy an octahedral site in preference to the tetrahedral site that this 2+ ion would be allocated in a normal spinel structure. In Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> the excess octahedral CFSE <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Transition metal oxides</a>for Fe<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to overcome the lattice energy mandate and the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions occupy octahedral sites giving the inverse spinel (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)<sup>t</sup>(Fe<sup>2+</sup>,Fe<sup>3+</sup>)&#176;O<sub>4</sub>. With Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> occupying identical sites in the lattice, electrons may readily hop from one iron site to the next and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a good electronic conductor.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">In most spinels other than Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> the excess CFSE would need to be somewhat larger than this to overcome the lattice energy preference for a normal arrangement.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The zero excess octahedral CFSE for Fe<sup>3+</sup> means that many transition metal spinels containing this species are inverse, as most 2+ transition metals have some preference for octahedral sites. Hence, CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are also inverse spinels. Other inverse spinels in 2+, 3+ systems are rather rare as there must be a significant CFSE driving force to overcome the lattice energy preference for normal spinels. One ion which does frequently form inverse spinels is Ni<sup>2+</sup> which has a high excess octahedral CFSE of 86 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. In NiAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> this demand of Ni<sup>2+</sup> for an octahedral site produces the ion arrangement Al<sup>t</sup>(NiAl)<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>O<sub>4</sub>, an inverse spinel.</p>
