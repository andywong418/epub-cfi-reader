<p class="fmnoindent">Solid state chemistry has undergone a renaissance in this country in the last ten years. Synthetic methods, characterization techniques and underlying theories have now been developed that make a wider range of problems accessible to the chemist. Many of these deal with technologically important and intellectually demanding problems that make this an essential component of an undergraduate course.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing material that would usually be covered in an 8&#8211;10 lecture course. As well as giving up-to-date information, this series provides explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry. Mark Weller presents the reader with an authoritative description of modern solid state chemistry, and the role of X-ray diffraction in it. Few if any standard inorganic textbooks can offer the kind of treatment that is achieveable by an expert in the field.</p>
