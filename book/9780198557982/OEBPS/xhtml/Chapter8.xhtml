<p class="noindent">Many of the recent advances in inorganic chemistry have come in the area of new materials. The chemistry of high temperature superconducting phases, in terms of the synthesis and structure of these compounds, lies within the area of this text. More recently the structural chemistry of C<sub>60</sub> in its ionic compounds is also relevant, though the chemistry of this species is developing rapidly in many areas</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_8.1">
<h2 class="h2">8.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>High temperature superconductors</h2>
<p class="noindent">Superconductivity was first observed by K.Onnes in 1911; on cooling a sample of mercury below 4.2 K the resistivity of the metal suddenly decreased to an immeasurably small value, <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>. Since then many metals and alloys have been found which have zero resistance below a certain critical temperature, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>. The progress in terms of raising <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>, in metals and alloys since 1911, is summarised in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Above <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> superconducting materials show a finite resistance in common with other compounds. This electrical resistance results from the interaction between lattice vibrations and the conduction electrons as they move through the structure. This interaction or scattering of the conduction electrons strengthens as the atomic vibrations increase in amplitude, that is, as the temperature of the system increases. Hence, the resistance of metals rises as they are heated. In superconducting metals and alloys it is believed that the electrons move through the lattice in a <i>concerted</i> fashion with the lattice vibrations, resulting in no electron scattering and zero resistance.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Not all superconducting materials are pure elemental metals and their alloys. By 1985, zero resistance at low temperatures had been observed in many compounds, for example metal oxides Li<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>= 13.7 K (spinel type structure), sulphides PbMO<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>= 15.2 K and organic metals formed from charge transfer compounds (up to 13 K); all of these systems exhibit metallike behaviour in terms of their conductivity above their <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i> In general though the critical temperatures of these compound types are fairly low, mostly below 10 K.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1986, J.G.Bednorz and K.A.M&#252;ller published work describing the observation of anomalously low resistance in a mixed metal oxide system containing barium, lanthanum and copper. The compound was later shown to be La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, with a critical temperature of 35 K, and Bednorz and M&#252;ller<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Some recent developments in inorganic materials chemistry</a> were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery. Since then progress in developing new inorganic materials with higher <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>&#8217;s has been extremely rapid. These new materials are all complex copper oxides and, at the time of writing, the critical temperature in bulk materials has been increased to 134 K with reports of even higher T<sub>c</sub>&#8217;s under high pressures and in thin films. The structures and chemistry of the most important of these superconducting phases are discussed in the following sections.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The non-stoichiometric YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-&#948;</sub> system has been the most widely studied of the superconducting materials. This is a result of its ease of synthesis and moderately high critical temperature, 93 K, which lies reasonably above the boiling point of nitrogen (77 K). One complicating factor in this system has been the control of the oxygen stoichiometry which is important in determining the critical temperature. The best superconducting properties are observed when &#948;&#8776;0, YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.9-7.0</sub> with <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 93 K, as &#948; increases then <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>falls rapidly as shown in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>. In the synthesis of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> it is, therefore, important to control the oxygen stoichiometry which requires a two stage reaction process. The direct high temperature reaction of BaCO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CuO at 940&#176;C over a period of days followed by quenching to room <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Some recent developments in inorganic materials chemistry</a>temperature gives rise to material deficient in oxygen with a stoichiometry of about YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> <sub>7</sub>. A material with a similar stoichiometry may be prepared using the gel methods described in Chapter 3. In order to produce the optimum oxygen content these oxygen deficient materials must be annealed in pure oxygen, at temperatures of 400&#8211;500&#176;C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Under these conditions the material takes up additional oxygen and &#948; falls close to zero.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is derived from that of perovskite. Stacking three perovskite unit cells, of the stoichiometry ABO<sub>3</sub>, directly on top of each other, as in <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5a</a>, gives rise to a material of stoichiometry A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub> (3 &#215; ABO<sub>3</sub>). If the A type cations are replaced by 2 x Ba and 1 x Y in the sequence Ba-Y-Ba-Ba-Y-Ba-Ba-Y in the tripled perovskite, and the B cations are designated as copper then the compound stoichiometry, shown in <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5b</a>, becomes YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>. Oxygen is then removed from the (00&#189;) site in the structure adjacent to yttrium and the site in the basal plane at (&#189;00) giving the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> structure shown in <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5d</a>. The cell parameters are based on those of the original perovskite cube with <i>a</i>&#8776;390 pm in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, <i>c</i> is approximately treble <i>a</i> and, because of the selective removal of oxygen from the sites in the basal plane, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are different. The crystal system of YBa2Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is thus orthorhombic with the lattice constants <i>a</i>= 385 pm, <i>b</i>= 388 pm and <i>c</i> = 1140 pm.</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration of <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5d</a> shows that YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> contains copper in two different coordination environments, those with fractional coordinates near (0,0,&#8531;) in square pyramidal sites and those at the origin in square planar sites. A polyhedral description of the structure using the copper coordination geometry, <a href="#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>, makes this clearer. The linking of these sites leads to them being referred to as forming chains and planes.</p>

<p class="noindent">The oxygen stoichiometry in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7&#8211;&#948;</sub> may be varied with 0&#60;&#948;&#60;1 and in terms of the structure this is achieved by removing oxygen from the other basal plane site, (0,&#189;,0). Complete removal of this oxygen yields YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>.

<p class="noindent">Most of the highest <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>&#8217;s observed in bulk materials have been found in the system of thallium barium calcium cuprates. A series of materials with differing numbers of CuO<sub>2</sub> layers have been prepared in the homologous series Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>n-1</sub>Cu<sub>n</sub>O<sub>4n+2</sub> with <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 3, 4 and the structures of these materials are shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>. The structure of Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (2212) consists of two layers of CuO<sub>2</sub> square nets separated by a double thallium-oxygen layer, T1<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The copper&#8211;calcium&#8211;oxygen layer may be considered as being derived from a perovskite block, with oxygen vacancies, whilst the T1<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> layer has an arrangement of ions similar to that of a portion of the rocksalt (NaCl) structure. As <i>n</i> increases in the formula Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4<i>n</i>+2</sub> then additional CuO<sub>2</sub> layers are incorporated into the structure, thus Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> and Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> have three and four cuprate layers respectively. All these materials have tetragonal unit cells with a&#8776;3.8 &#197; (380 pm) but different <i>c</i> parameters; as the number of CuO<sub>2</sub> layers increases so <i>c</i> increases.</p>
<p class="indent">A series of materials with only a single thallium-oxygen layer separating the CuO<sub>2</sub> sheets is also known. For example, the structure of TlBa<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub><a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Some recent developments in inorganic materials chemistry</a> may be derived from that of Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> by removal of one of the TIO layers.</p>
<p class="indent">The critical temperature behaviour of the Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4<i>n</i>+2</sub> system is very complex and depends upon the exact compound stoichiometry, synthesis conditions and subsequent annealing treatments in different atmospheres. One trend is apparent, T<sub>c</sub> rises as n increases from 1 to 3, 80 K in Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>6</sub>, 105 K in Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and 125 K in Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>; for the next member of the series, Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, however, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> falls back to around 115 K.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4<i>n</i>+2</sub>, <i>n</i>=1, 2, 3 and HgBa<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub></b></p>
<p class="noindent">A series of compounds analogous to the thallium-barium-calcium-copper oxide superconductors, but containing Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rather than T1<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> layers, has been synthesised. As the Bi-O distance is slightly larger than the Tl-O bond length, the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> layers fit poorly between the cuprate sheets causing some structural distortions; the compounds adopt orthorhombic unit cells and critical temperatures are somewhat lower than the thallium analogues.</p>
<p class="indent">The compound HgBa<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> was reported in early 1993 with a <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of 134 K. Its structure is similar to that of TlBa<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, but with a single HgO layer separating three CuO<sub>2</sub> planes. The compound is difficult to make as a pure phase, but illustrates that further upward progress in <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> is still possible; indeed under pressure the <i>T</i>c can be raised to 160 K.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Superconducting cuprates &#8212; general points</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Consideration of the several superconducting systems described above shows two features in common. They all contain planes of the stoichiometry CuO<sub>2</sub>formed by linking CuO<sub>4</sub> square planes (elongated CuO<sub>6</sub> octahedra in La<sub>1.8</sub>Ba<sub>0.2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>) at all vertices, <a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>, and they all have an average copper oxidation state in excess of 2+. These CuO<sub>2</sub> sheets are separated by &#39;charge reservoir&#39; layers, e.g. CuO chains in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and the T1<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rocksalt layers in Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4<i>n</i>+2</sub>, which seem to ensure the correct charge or electron concentration on the superconducting sheets.</p>

<p class="noindent">The chemistry of C<sub>60</sub>, <a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>, has crossed many of the conventional borders of chemistry and physics with interest in this molecule covering many areas.

<p class="noindent1"><b>C<sub>60</sub></b></p>
<p class="noindent">The first crystals of C<sub>60</sub> were grown from benzene solutions and contained solvent molecules. With the correct purification methods, using sublimation to eliminate the solvent molecules, pure C<sub>60</sub> crystals may be grown. The compound adopts a face centred cubic array of the C<sub>60</sub> molecules shown in <a href="#fig8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>, which is equivalent to the close packing of C<sub>60</sub> molecules. At room temperature the thermal energy available to the molecules allows them to rotate freely on their lattice sites and they can be considered to be spherical. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of polycrystalline C<sub>60</sub>, shown in <a href="#fig8.12">Fig. 8.12</a>, is typical of the face centred cubic lattice though due to the high symmetry of the spherical molecules, reflections with Miller indices <i>h</i>00 have zero intensity and are not seen. The lattice parameter of 14.17 &#197; obtained from the powder data yields a contact distance of 14.17/&#8730;2 or 10.02 &#197; for the C<sub>60</sub> spheres, which is made up of the diameter of a C<sub>60</sub> molecule, 7.06 &#197;, plus a van der Waals distance of 2.96 &#197; between the molecules. This van der Waals distance is slightly smaller than the value in graphite, corresponding to the inter-layer separation, of 3.35 &#197;.</p>
