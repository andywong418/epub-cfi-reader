<p class="noindent">The preceding chapters have dealt mainly with the structure and properties of metal oxides, an extremely important group of compounds which illustrate many of the aspects of inorganic solid state chemistry. This chapter provides an introduction to some other widely studied inorganic materials which have significant applications and properties.</p>

<p class="noindent">The zeolites are a group of compounds, many of which are naturally occurring minerals, named after their property of evolving water when heated ( Greek, <i>zeo</i> to boil, <i>lith</i> stone). These materials are widely used for their ion exchange, absorption and catalytic properties.</p>
<p class="indent">The compounds are characterised by open structures which may incorporate a range of small inorganic and organic species. The frameworks forming the channels and cavities are constructed from linked tetrahedra and many elements, which form TO<sub>4</sub> groups in their structural chemistry, can take the part of the building blocks in zeolites. Examples include AlO<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>4</sub>, PO<sub>4</sub>, BeO<sub>4</sub>, GaO<sub>4</sub>, GeO<sub>4</sub> and ZnO<sub>4</sub>. The most common zeolitic materials are based on silicon and aluminium MO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra linked together. The different ways in which these tetrahedra are connected in three dimensional space give rise to the multitude of different zeolites. At present over 200 aluminosilicate framework structures are known; about 40 of these are naturally occurring minerals.</p>
<p class="indent">A general formula for zeolites may be obtained by starting from pure silica which in its various structures, quartz being one example, consists of SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra sharing all vertices. Replacement of some of the SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra by AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra can occur provided that charge balance is maintained by simultaneously incorporating cations into the structure, that is &#8216;SiO<sub>2</sub>&#8217; is replaced by &#8216;MA10<sub>2</sub>&#8217; or &#8216;M<sub>05</sub>AlO<sub>2</sub>&#8217; where M is a mono or divalent cation. The cations introduced alongside the aluminate tetrahedra are frequently hydrated leading to a general formula for zeolites of</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a> can be used to represent schematically a zeolite with the cavities and pores, formed from the tetrahedra, containing the hydrated cations. Following dehydration of a zeolite, readily accomplished by heating under vacuum, the cations migrate to the edges of the cavities and channels, interacting more strongly with the framework oxygen atoms. The cavities in zeolites, particularly once dehydrated, may absorb small molecules other than water. The larger the cavities and pores formed by the framework the larger the molecules which may be absorbed inside the zeolite.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">The nomenclature of zeolites is rather unsystematic. Some materials, e.g. sodalite and faujasite, are named after minerals, others e.g. ZSM-5 and VPI-5 were named by researchers during a programme of work to synthesise new frameworks. Thus ZSM was the fifth product of the Zeolite Socony-Mobil project. Zeolites are often described in the form M-[zeolite] where M refers to the cation in the particular [zeolite] framework.</p>

<p class="noindent">The linking of the TO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra may occur in numerous ways to produce the huge variety of zeolite structures, but a number of structural features are common to these materials. Linking of the tetrahedral species may take place <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Zeolites, intercalation in layer materials and solid electrolytes</a> to form four, six and eight membered rings as shown in <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a> and these units are then used to form the three dimensional zeolite structures. The wealth of zeolite structures is derived not only from the multitude of ways in which the tetrahedra can be linked, but also from the flexibility of the T&#8211;O&#8211;T bond angle which can assume values in the extensive range 120&#8211;180&#176;.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig7.3">Figure 7.3</a> shows a &#223; or sodalite cage produced from four and six membered rings. This cage frequently occurs itself as a building block in the structures of other zeolites such as zeolite A, <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4a</a>, faujasite, <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4b</a> and VPI-5, <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4c</a>. In this series of materials the sodalite cages are separated by increasing distances. In sodalite the &#223; cages form a body centred array sharing six membered rings, in zeolite A the &#223; cages are separated by four membered rings, in faujasite by six membered rings and in VPI-5 by double four membered rings. This has the effect of opening up the structures <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Zeolites, intercalation in layer materials and solid electrolytes</a>and increasing the sizes of the cavities and pores. Hence, in the series sodalite, zeolite-A, ZSM-5, faujasite, VPI-5 the largest channel diameter increases as 260 pm, 410 pm, 540 pm, 740 pm and 1020 pm (2.6-10.2 &#194;) as the number of tetrahedral units forming the outside of the channel increases from 6 through 8, 10 and 12 to 18, <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">The open nature of the zeolite structures allows small molecules to be absorbed into their structures; the size and shape of molecules absorbed will depend upon the geometry of the pores. Zeolite A with relatively small pores can absorb molecules such as water and oxygen but larger species, for example ethanol, are barred from entering the cavities. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>. Note that the type of cation present in the pores can also affect the dimensions of the molecules which can be absorbed. Replacement of sodium <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Zeolites, intercalation in layer materials and solid electrolytes</a>in zeolite A by the smaller calcium increases the effective pore dimension allowing methane to be incorporated.</p>
<p class="indent">The ability of an aluminosilicate zeolite to absorb water is related to the nature of the ions forming the framework. With a high number of aluminium atoms in the framework and, therefore, a correspondingly high concentration of charge-compensating cations in the zeolite channels, the structures are highly hydrophillic. Materials, such as sodium-zeolite A, with a silicon to aluminium ratio of 1:1 and a high level of sodium ions in the cavities are widely used to dry gases and solvents. The dehydrating capacity may be regenerated periodically by heating the zeolite and driving off the absorbed water.</p>
<p class="indent">Materials such as silicalite, a derivative of ZSM-5 where the framework consists almost totally of SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, have few cations in the cavities and are hydrophobic. These materials readily absorb non-polar and weakly polar molecules into their cavities.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Ion exchange</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cavity cations in zeolites interact weakly with the framework and may, therefore, undergo ion exchange reactions readily at room temperature. The sodium ions in Na-Zeolite A rapidly exchange with calcium in aqueous solution</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The particular ion exchange characteristics of a zeolite are determined by the sizes of the cages/pores and the coordination environments present within the zeolite. Ion exchange processes are widely used in water softeners and the new 'micro' detergents. In the latter, zeolite A has replaced the polyphosphates previously used, with the environmental advantages of decomposition to soil-like minerals.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Catalysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">The acid derivatives of zeolites, H-zeolite, are excellent catalysts and are widely used industrially. This form of the zeolite may be obtained by direct ion exchange with acids. More often, because many zeolite frameworks are slowly attacked by aqueous acids, they are obtained by exchange with ammonium ions followed by heating to 500&#176;C, driving off ammonia, and leaving the proton</p>

<p class="indent">The catalytically active acid zeolite can either be in the Br&#246;nsted form with protons attached to the framework tetrahedron (<a href="#fig7.8">Fig.7.8</a>) or Lewis form obtained by dehydration of the Br&#246;nsted acid.</p>
<p class="indent">The acid zeolites, once they have absorbed molecules into the cavities, catalyse reactions typical of very strong acids. The major reaction types are<a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Zeolites, intercalation in layer materials and solid electrolytes</a> dehydrations and rearrangements. A special feature of zeolites which makes them such superb catalysts is their shape selectivity. Zeolites are crystalline materials with controlled channel geometry and fixed environments for the active sites. The shape selectivity may arise in three ways: reactant selectivity, product selectivity and, probably of lesser importance, transition state selectivity. Reactant selectivity arises from the ability of only certain molecules to be absorbed into the zeolite cavities and thus reach the active acid sites. Product selectivity is derived from the fact that only certain products are of the correct dimension to escape rapidly from the zeolite along the channels once they have been formed. This is illustrated for the isomerisation reactions of dimethylbenzenes in <a href="#fig7.9">Fig.7.9</a>. The 10 ring channels of ZSM-5, with a dimension &#8776;5.4 &#197;, allow rapid diffusion of 1,4-dimethylbenzene, but not the 1,2 and 1,3 analogues; the diffusivity of the 1,4 derivative is about 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than its isomers. This difference is a result of the effective diameters of these species; the 1,2 and 1,3 placements of the methyl groups make these molecules about 0.6 &#197; wider than the 1,4 arrangement and diffusion through the 10 rings is hindered. Once a mixture of dimethylbenzenes has entered the ZSM-5 structure, protonation of the benzene ring allows migration of the methyl groups around the ring, equilibrating the isomers. However, the greater mobility of the 1,4 dimethylbenzene arrangement permits this isomer to escape from the zeolite while the other isomers are likely to undergo further protonation and transformation.</p>
<p class="indent">Transition state selectivity relies upon the fact that certain intermediates, which are required to be formed during a chemical pathway at the active site, will not fit in the channel/cavity; such a reaction process is barred from occurring and the reaction will proceed along a different route to a different product.</p>

<p class="noindent">The largest pore sizes synthesised in zeolites are of the order of 10 &#197;. In an attempt to increase this further, and allow larger molecules to be absorbed into inorganic structures, chemists have turned to pillared clays.</p>
<p class="indent">Clays such as bentonite and montmorillonite have layer structures such as those shown in <a href="#fig7.10">Fig. 7.10</a>.

</figure>
<p class="indent">In the pillaring of clays the species exchanged into the inter-lamellar region is selected for size. Ions such as alkylammonium ions and polynuclear hydroxy-metal ions may replace the alkali metal as shown schematically in <a href="#fig7.11">Figs. 7.11a/b</a>. The most widely used pillaring species are of the polynuclear hydroxide typeand include Al<sub>13</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>28</sub><sup>3+</sup>, Zr<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>l6&#8211;n</sub><sup>n+</sup> and Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>12</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>; the former consists of an A1O<sub>4</sub> tetrahedron surrounded by octahedrally <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Zeolites, intercalationin layer materials and solid electrolytes</a>coordinated aluminium. This pillaring reaction is readily followed by powder X-ray diffraction; expansion of the inter-lamellar spacing, corresponding to the <i>c</i> lattice parameter, results in a marked shift of the 001 reflection to a lower 2&#952; value.</p>
<p class="indent">Once an ion such as Al<sub>13</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>28</sub><sup>3+</sup> has been incorporated between the layers, heating the modified clay results in dehydration and linking of the ion to the layers, <a href="#fig7.11">Fig. 7.11c</a>. The resulting product is a pillared clay which has excellent thermal stability to at least 500&#176;C. The expanded inter-layer region can now absorb large molecules in the same way as zeolites. However, because the distribution of the pillaring ions between the layers is difficult to control, the pillared clay structures are less regular than zeolites. Despite this, pillared clays have been widely surveyed for their potential as catalysts and they act in a similar way to zeolites promoting isomerisation and dehydration.</p>

<p class="noindent">Intercalation between the layers of graphite has been described in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a> but graphite is only one member of a wide range of compounds which have layered structures and are, therefore, able to incorporate guest species.

<p class="indent">Intercalation reactions of metal disulphide layer compounds generally involve a redox process where the metal sulphide layer is reduced and the intercalating species oxidised during the reaction.

<p class="noindent">The diffusion of ions through solids is generally very slow, as is apparent in the slow reaction rates of solids (<a href="Chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>). This is a result of a lack of pathways in solid structures along which ions can migrate; for example for a sodium ion to diffuse through the perfect sodium chloride structure it would have to move through the solid between the sodium and chloride ions on their fixed lattice sites using interstitial positions. Such a migration would have a high energy penalty in disrupting the lattice. One possible pathway for ion<a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Zeolites, intercalationin layer materials and solid electrolytes</a> diffusion through a material with the sodium chloride structure would be by making use of defects in the structure such as Schottky defects (<a href="Chapter6.xhtml#sec_6.2">Section 6.2</a>). Sodium ions may diffuse through the structure using the vacancies, <a href="#fig7.14">Fig. 7.14</a>. As the number of these defects increases so the rate of ion diffusion increases and just below its melting point sodium chloride is a reasonable ion conductor, with a conductivity of 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> &#937;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Similar behaviour may be found with anions and ZrO<sub>2</sub> is a good conductor of oxide ions above 600&#176;C.</p>

<p class="indent">The diffusion of ions through solids is thus facilitated by the presence of suitable vacant sites to which a diffusing ion may migrate. In some materials the presence of a large number of suitable sites within the structure for ion migration, even at low temperatures, allows facile diffusion of ions and these materials are known as fast ion conductors. Their conductivities reach values in the range 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>&#8722;10<sup>1</sup>&#937;<sup>&#8722;1</sup>cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> comparable to ionic solutions. Typical structural and chemical features exhibited by fast ion conductors are vacant sites to which ions may migrate and small cations with a low charge; these interact weakly, in electrostatic terms, with the rest of the structure and form low coordination number environments. Some of the best ion conductors are, therefore, based on silver and lithium.</p>
<p class="indent">One example of a fast ion conductor is &#945;-AgI. At 146&#176;C silver iodide adopts a structure based on a body centred array of iodide ions shown in <a href="#fig7.15">Fig.7.15</a>. The silver atoms are able to occupy a range of sites throughout this iodide matrix close to the face centres and movement between these positions is facile.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the best fast ion conductors consist of a stable framework constructed from octahedral or tetrahedral metal oxo species which form channels or pathways along which cations can migrate. These channels are somewhat smaller than those in zeolites as only small ions, typically alkali metals and silver, need pass along them. Examples of fast ion conductors of this type are NASICON (<span class="underline">Na</span> <span class="underline">S</span>uper<span class="underline">I</span>onic <span class="underline">CON</span>ductor) which is Na<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>PSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, and Li<sub>14</sub>ZnGe<sub>4</sub>O<sub>16</sub> (a lithium ion conductor) and a number of derivatives of the two dimensional material &#223;-alumina.</p>

<p class="indent">The NASICON structure, <a href="#fig7.16">Fig. 7.16</a>, has channels, formed from Zro<sub>6</sub> octahedra and SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, containing the sodium ions. There are more possible sites for sodium to occupy in the channels than sodium ions present and by hopping between these positions sodium ion diffusion along the channels is possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The &#223;-aluminas are a class of compounds of the general formula M<sub>2</sub>O.nAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> where<i> n</i>=8-11 and M is a very wide range of cations which includes Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, NO<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>+</sup> and Ln<sup>3+</sup>. The structure, <a href="#fig7.17">Fig. 7.17</a>, consists of blocks which have structures similar to that of the spinels separated by oxide ion deficient regions in which reside the cations, M. The sections containing the M cations provide a large number of possible sites and migration of these ions is rapid within these layers. At 300&#176;C the conductivity of sodium &#223;-alumina is about 0.1 <b>&#937;</b><sup>&#8722;1</sup>cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>
