</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">All crystalline materials contain a certain number of defects, that is their structures are not perfect. The description of unit cells used in Chapter 1 was based around a perfect, ordered array of atoms and molecules. However, real materials do not have structures with a flawless arrangement of atoms and the reason for this can be illustrated by thermodynamic considerations. Consider a crystal into which a number of defects, examples would be a misplaced ion or a vacant site, are gradually introduced; the free energy of the system (&#916;G) will fall initially before rising as shown in <a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>. The reason for this behaviour is the competing effects of the enthalpy <i>(&#916;H)</i> and the entropy <i>(&#916;S)</i> of introducing the vacancy. Removing ions and molecules from a structure will, typically, reduce the lattice energy; lattice energies are dependent upon the total of the electrostatic attractions between all atom pairs. Hence, the incorporation of defects into a structure will have an enthalpy penalty and <i>&#916;H</i> climbs steadily as the number of defects increases. Introducing defects randomly into the structure will produce disorder, so AS will be positive. AS for each defect is large at first, as the perfect lattice is strongly disrupted, but as more and more defects are introduced further disruption of the lattice is less marked. The overall variation in AG, as a function of the number of defects, shows that there will be a certain number of defects corresponding to the minimum in the plot.</p>
<p class="indent">For materials such as NaCl and MgO, with high lattice energies and thus a large enthalpy penalty for defect formation, <i>&#916;H</i> rises very rapidly and the minimum in AG lies at a relatively low number of defects. At room temperature the number of defects in NaCl is about 1 ion in 10<sup>15</sup>, though as the temperature rises <i>T&#916;S</i> becomes more significant and the number of defects increases rapidly. In other materials the lattice energy costs of introducing defects may be much lower and the equilibrium number of defects consequently rather higher.</p>
<p class="indent">Two types of defect are commonly found in ionic inorganic solids and because they do not affect the stoichiometry of the compound they are known as <i>intrinsic</i> defects.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Schottky defects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Schottky defects, <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>, are <i>vacancy pairs:</i> ions are removed from their lattice sites and, in order to maintain charge balance, this must be carried out for cation/anion pairs. The pairs of vacancies may associated with each other on neighbouring sites or be quite well separated. This type of defect is commonly found at low concentrations in alkali metal halides.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Frenkel defects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Frenkel defects, <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.3</a>, are <i>interstitials,</i> that is, a displaced atom, ion or molecule that occupies a site within the structure that is not normally filled; the displaced species leaves behind a vacant site. In order for an ion to fill an interstitial site it needs to be small and, because it is quite often close to ions of the same charge, polarisable. Typical materials exhibiting Frenkel defects are the silver halides where Ag<sup>+</sup> forms the interstitial. Again the defects can occur in pairs, that is, a vacancy and interstitial close to each other, or they may be separated by larger distances.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Split interstitials</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the description of Frenkel and Schottky defects no account has been taken of what happens to the lattice around a defect once it has been introduced. In fact the lattice relaxes to accommodate the vacancy and/or interstitial. In the case of an interstitial the ions surrounding the additional ion will move, in so far as it is possible within the constraint of the crystal structure, to fit around it. In some materials the interstitial and an atom displaced from its normal site occur as a pair; this is known as a <i>split interstitial,</i> <a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Non-stoichiometry</h2>
<p class="noindent">In non-stoichiometric materials defects of the type described above occur but to a much larger extent. In addition, the vacancies and interstitials which exist are not formed in pairs. For example, cation vacancies are not balanced by an equal number of anion vacancies as in Schottky defects so, for an overall charge balance, one component of the lattice, normally a metal ion, must be <a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Non-stoichiometry</a>oxidised or reduced. Introduction of additional anions on to interstitial sites in UO<sub>2</sub> to form UO<sub>2+<i>x</i></sub> with <i>x</i>=0.1 requires the uranium oxidation state to increase from 4 to an average of 4.2+. The occurrence of non-stoichiometry is, therefore, restricted to compounds containing a species which is readily oxidised or reduced. Non-stoichiometric behaviour is most frequently found for transition metal compounds though it is also known for some lanthanide, actinide and B metal compounds.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Non-stoichiometric materials are characterised by two criteria. From a thermodynamic standpoint, the free energy of the system depends upon both the composition and temperature. A more useful criterion in that the behaviour is readily identified by experiment, is that the lattice parameter of the system varies smoothly as a function of composition, e.g. <a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>. Thus, as defects are introduced into a structure, the lattice parameter will change <i>gradually</i> between two end members of the non-stoichiometric system. This means that across the full composition range of the non-stoichiometric material the same structure is adopted and that the defects are <i>randomly</i> distributed throughout the material. This behaviour should be contrasted with a series of phases of different fixed stoichiometry that may be formed between two elements, e.g. V<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub>, VO<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>0<sub>5</sub>, all having different structures and, hence, lattice parameters.</p>
<p class="indent">The methods by which defects, either vacancies or interstitials, can be introduced in to a general binary compound AB are summarised in <a href="#tab6.1">Table 6.1</a>. All these types of non-stoichiometric material are known and examples of each type are discussed in the following sections.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Systems in which the metal is oxidised are by far the more common and the level of non-stoichiometry is frequently much larger. The reasons for this are thermodynamic. Oxidation of the metal results in a much smaller enthalpy penalty for the inclusion of defects as, with an increased metal charge and (consequently) smaller metal ions, the lattice energy of the solid increases to partially outweigh the energy required to form the defect. Hence, in <a href="#fig6.1">Fig 6.1</a> the <i>&#916;H</i> line rises less rapidly than in the case where the metal is reduced and the equilibrium number of defects is, in general, much larger.</p>

The immediate environment of this site shown in <a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a> consists of eight existing oxide ions at the corners of a cube. The distance from the cell centre to these oxide ions is about 2.00 &#197; which is somewhat shorter than twice the ionic radius of O<sup>2-</sup> indicating that even this site is too small to accept, directly, an oxide ion.</p>

<p class="indent">Investigations of the structure of UO<sub>2</sub> using powder diffraction techniques have located the oxygen positions in the unit cell of UO<sub>2+x</sub>. Two observations were made: vacancies existed on the normal oxide sublattice and two types of additional oxide ions were located close to (&#189;,&#189;,&#189;) but displaced in the 110 and 111 lattice directions. <a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>. shows the two interstitial oxide positions, termed O&#8242; and O&#8243; respectively, which, by consideration of the ionic radii, must be associated with vacancies on the adjacent normal oxide ion sublattice. Interstitial oxygen may, therefore, be accommodated in the fluorite lattice but at the expense of oxide vacancies. In order for an overall increase in oxygen stoichiometry these interstitials and vacancies must cluster together. One possibility is shown in <a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.9</a> with two vacancies being <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Non-stoichiometry</a>associated with two O&#8242; type and two O&#8243; type interstitials. The overall composition of this structural block, consisting of eight UO<sub>2</sub> units (&#39;U<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>&#39;) is, therefore, increased by two oxide ions giving U<sub>4</sub>0<sub>9</sub>. This agglomeration of interstitials and vacancies is termed a <i>defect cluster</i> and represents an energetically favourable way of incorporating large numbers of defects in a non-stoichiometric compound. Other possible clusters are possible; for example extension of <a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.9</a> by an additional vacancy would permit two more O&#8242; type interstitials to be incorporated into the defect cluster.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Fe<sub>1-x</sub>O system is probably the most extensively studied non-stoichiometric system despite the fact that Fe<sub>1-x</sub>O is metastable at room temperature. This means that the phase, formed only at high temperature, requires quenching (cooling quickly) to room temperature in order to leave the iron and oxygen atoms locked into the Fe<sub>1-x</sub>O structure. With increasing temperature the range of non-stoichiometry in this system increases; at 600&#176;C, <i>x</i> can only adopt values to give the range Fe<sub>0.93</sub>O to Fe<sub>0.94</sub>O, at 1000&#176;C the range becomes Fe<sub>0.87</sub>O to Fe<sub>0.96</sub>O.</p>

The method of incorporating the iron defects is not simply a matter of removing iron from the normally fully occupied sublattice. Powder diffraction measurements on Fe<sub>1-x</sub>O have shown that some iron atoms occupy interstitial sites within the sodium chloride structure and that the level of iron vacancies on octahedral sites is greater than would be required by the compound stoichiometry alone.

A number of vacancies are created on the normally occupied octahedral sites but over the whole structure this number is greater than required by the compound stoichiometry. The additional iron required occupies tetrahedral sites adjacent to the vacancies. In order to maintain charge balance the interstitial iron is oxidised to 3+ and a number of iron atoms surrounding the defect but on normal lattice sites must also be oxidised to Fe<sup>3+</sup>.

One example of a reduced metal system is Zn<sub>1+x</sub>O but <i>x</i> is very small, &#8776;10<sup>-5</sup>, and moderate values are found only at high temperatures where the formation of defects is favoured through entropy considerations. When zinc oxide is heated the compound loses oxygen from the surface forming Zn<sub>1+x</sub>O; charge balance requires the zinc atoms to be reduced to Zn<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>0</sup>. These ions migrate from the surface to interstitial positions within the lattice as shown in <a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>. As the concentration of these interstitial ions is so low, structural studies have been unable to locate their position, but consideration of the wurtzite structure adopted by ZnO and the larger size of these ions, Zn<sup>+</sup>/Zn<sup>0</sup>, would indicate that they would probably occupy octahedral holes. The formation of lower charged zinc ions/atoms permits an electron transfer process between the various zinc centres. The energy of these transitions occurs near to the visible region of the spectrum giving rise to the yellow colour of hot ZnO.

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Non-stoichiometry in more complex systems</h2>
<p class="noindent">The four non-stoichiometric systems discussed above in terms of their structures, illustrate the major ways in which large compositional variations can be incorporated into materials through defects and interstitials. Non-stoichiometry is a very widespread phenomenon in solid state oxide, sulphide and halide chemistry, but it is also a feature of intercalation chemistry by the nature of the synthesis process.</p>
<p class="indent">In more complex oxides, for example ternary phases, and insertion compounds, a detailed level of structural information, as discussed above for a number of binary systems, is often not available and the structures of compounds are often described in terms of an <i>average</i> distribution of ions or molecules. To illustrate this a good example is provided by the ternary oxide system Sr<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7-y,</sub>0<sub>&#60;y</sub><sub>&#60;1</sub></p>
<p class="indent">The structure of Sr<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is shown in <a href="#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a> and can be considered to be blocks of perovskite separated by layers of SrO with the rocksalt structure. The oxygen stoichiometry of this material may be reduced drastically by gradual removal of oxide ions from the site within the perovskite block. Complete removal of oxygen from this site results in the composition Sr<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> with reduction of the iron, from Fe<sup>4+</sup> in Sr<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, to Fe<sup>3+</sup>. The coordination geometry of the iron decreases from six in an octahedral arrangement to five forming a square based pyramid. For the intermediate compositions in this system, Sr<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7-y,</sub>0<sub>&#60;y</sub><sub>&#60;1,</sub> the structure would be described in terms of partial filling of the oxide ion site between the two iron atoms. Throughout the structure there would be a random distribution of linked FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra and FeO<sub>5</sub> square pyramids.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar changes in the oxygen content of materials, through partial filling of a site, is important in the chemistry of the high temperature superconductors discussed in Chapter 8.</p>

<p class="noindent">The overall stoichiometry of the resultant compound depends upon the frequency of occurrence of the crystallographic shear plane throughout the structure: indeed by changing this frequency the stoichiometry can be varied. If the crystallographic shear shown in <a href="#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a> is separated by ten normal MO<sub>6</sub> octahedra the compound stoichiometry becomes M<sub>10</sub>O<sub>29</sub> and this structure is adopted by W<sub>20</sub>O<sub>58</sub>. A separation of nine normal MO<sub>6</sub> octahedral blocks would result in the stoichiometry M<sub>9</sub>O<sub>26</sub>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Intercalation compounds &#8212; staging</h2>
<p class="noindent">Whilst many intercalation compounds are truly non-stoichiometric with a random distribution of intercalated species over a proportion of sites, the insertion compounds of some layer systems exhibit a phenomenon known as staging. The potassium intercalates of graphite clearly illustrate this behaviour. In C<sub>8</sub>K, the highest potassium intercalate or first stage compound, the potassium ions occur between <i>all</i> the carbon layers on sites shown in <a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The other compounds in the potassium-graphite system have the stoichiometrics C<sub>24</sub>K , C<sub>36</sub>K and C<sub>48</sub>K. In C<sub>24</sub>K rather than removing a portion of the potassium ions from all the layers, alternate potassium layers are removed completely and one third of the potassium ions from the remaining strata. The potassium ions are disordered within the layer and this compound is known as a second stage intercalate, <a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>. The C<sub>36</sub>K and C<sub>48</sub>K compounds, third and fourth stage intercalates, <a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>, have potassium ions every third and fourth graphite layer respectively. This behaviour is known as <i>staging</i> and is clearly demonstrated in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns. The layer structure of graphite leads to a strong 001 reflection which is readily observed in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The position of the 001 reflection for some of the staged compounds is shown in <a href="#fig6.20">Fig. 6.20</a> and corresponds to the <i>c</i> lattice parameter marked in <a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>.</p>
