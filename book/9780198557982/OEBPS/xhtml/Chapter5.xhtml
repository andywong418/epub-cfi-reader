<p class="noindent">The electronic properties exhibited by solids are crucial in a large number of inorganic materials applications. These unique electronic properties result from the extended structures adopted by many inorganic materials, where strong interactions between the atoms, ions or molecules occur throughout the lattice. In terms of conductivity, behaviour ranges from insulating through semiconducting to metallic and superconducting. Similarly, the interaction between the unpaired electrons in inorganic material structures gives rise to magnetic properties characteristic of the whole solid rather than the individual atoms. Finally, the potential for concerted ion displacements in neighbouring unit cells produces ferroelectrics and optoelectric materials. This chapter provides an introduction to these co-operative phenomena.</p>

<p class="noindent">In simple molecules the interactions between the atomic orbitals on the various atoms forming the compound give rise to molecular orbitals. The number of molecular orbitals generated in a molecule is identical to the number of atomic orbitals used in forming them. This may be illustrated by consideration of the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals formed in a series of long chain alternate alkenes, <a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In ethene, <a href="#fig5.2">Fig 5.2a</a>, the p<i><sub>z</sub></i> orbitals on the two carbon atoms interact to form one bonding and one antibonding configuration. If the number of carbon atoms and <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals in the chain is increased to four, producing 1,3 butadiene, <a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2b</a>, the four carbon <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals can interact to give rise to two bonding and two antibonding orbitals. Further extension to an eight <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a>carbon atom chain produces four bonding and four antibonding molecular orbitals. With continued extension of the chain, every pair of carbon p<sub><i>z</i></sub> orbitals added to the molecular orbital diagram provides one bonding and one antibonding combination. The molecular orbitals, within the bonding and antibonding groups, become closer and closer in energy, and this continues until such time as the chain has an almost infinite number of orbitals, when they form a practical continuum. In such cases, rather than drawing all these energy levels as separate lines, they are replaced in the energy level diagram by a <i>block</i> representing a continuous <i>band</i> of energy levels. Hence, in the case of an infinitely long chain of <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals, corresponding to (CH)<sub><i>x</i></sub>, the energy level diagram consists of two bands, one bonding in character and one antibonding in character.</p>

<p class="indent">This behaviour of atomic orbitals in infinite structures, forming continuous bands of energy levels, is frequently found in inorganic materials where there is overlap between the atomic orbitals. The simplest case is that of an elemental metal such as sodium. The electronic structure of a sodium atom is ls<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>1</sup>; the core levels with principal quantum numbers one and two are held close to the nucleus and extend poorly into the body centred cubic lattice adopted by sodium. However, the 3s orbital extends out from the nucleus and can overlap with similar orbitals on neighbouring sodium atoms. In crystalline sodium metal, with an almost infinite lattice and the number of orbitals approaching Avogadro's Number 6&#215;l0<sup>23</sup>, the overlap of these 3s orbitals gives rise to a band. Other atomic orbitals on sodium which are sufficiently diffuse, and overlap with similar orbitals on neighbouring atoms, will also give rise to bands, for example, the 3p levels. The band structure of sodium metal derived from the 3s and 3p levels is shown in <a href="#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. The width of the individual bands derived from the 3s and 3p orbitals is such that they also overlap.</p>
<p class="indent">Remembering that each atomic orbital gives rise to one molecular orbital and, hence, one level in the continuous band, the four orbitals on each sodium atom ( 3s, 3p<sub><i>x</i></sub>, 3p<sub><i>y</i></sub> and 3p<sub><i>z</i></sub>) will, within the final band structure, give rise to four levels. Each level can contain two electrons as with the original atomic orbitals on the sodium atom. In an infinite lattice of <i>N</i> sodium atoms <i>4N</i> energy levels are generated. Each sodium ion contributes only one electron to<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a> this band structure, shown in <a href="#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>, which can hold eight and, therefore, the band is only partially filled. It is this partially filled band which gives rise to the electronic properties of metals such as high electrical conductivity and lustre. Any inorganic material which has an arrangement of atoms, ions or molecules that produces <i>partially filled bands</i> would be expected to demonstrate the physical properties of a metal.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Metals</h3>
<p class="noindent">In all solids with effectively infinite structures there will be an interaction between atomic orbitals with the potential to give a band structure. The electronic properties of a solid depend upon the nature of these bands in terms of their width, separation, the number of electrons they can hold, and the number of electrons in the system. The width of the bands depend on the degree of overlap of the orbitals which interact to give rise to them. Strongly overlapping atomic orbitals give rise to wide bands whilst weakly interacting orbitals give rise to narrow bands. This can be illustrated by reference back to molecular orbitals. Weakly overlapping atomic orbitals give rise to bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals with energies close to those of the original atomic levels, that is with little dispersion in energy terms; with strongly overlapping atomic orbitals the bonding and antibonding combinations are more spread out along the energy axis. The electrons in the wide band can be considered to be dispersed over the whole lattice whilst the electrons occupying a narrow band are more strongly associated with the nuclei.</p>
<p class="indent">Band structure diagrams are frequently drawn to represent the number of electrons which may occupy a band. In the band structure derived from the (CH)<sub><i>x</i></sub>, chain there will be a large number of energy levels near the centre of the band and much fewer near the edges. Evidence for this build up of energy levels at the mid point of the energy scale can be seen in the molecular orbital diagram of C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>18</sub>. The information on the number of energy levels at any particular point in a band can be represented in a density of states diagram such as <a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a> where <i>N</i>(<i>E</i>), the density of states (or energy levels) is plotted as a function of energy. Filling of the bands by electrons in such a diagram can be denoted by shading of the band. The level to which a band structure is filled is denoted as the <i>Fermi level</i>, <i>E</i><sub>F</sub>. If this Fermi levels falls in the middle of a band then a material can be expected to exhibit metallic properties. The band structure of magnesium metal is shown in <a href="#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">If the Fermi level lies at the top of a band it is normally drawn mid way between this band and the next, which will be empty, <a href="#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>. This band structure is that of an insulator which crystallises with an infinite lattice; diamond is a good example. The separation of the filled and empty bands, the <i>band gap</i>, is large, typically greater than 3.0 eV.</p>

<p class="noindent">With semiconductors, a similar band diagram to that of insulators is obtained; however in these materials the band separation is much smaller, typically less than 3.0 eV. Silicon crystallises with the same structure as diamond and the band structure is very similar. Differences arise because the atomic orbitals on silicon are higher in energy than those on carbon and also more diffuse; this modifies the band structure to produce wider bands and a smaller separation between the filled (valence) band and the empty (conduction) band. In silicon and similar materials with a small separation of the filled and empty band there is sufficient thermal energy at room temperature to promote some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These electrons, and the holes in the valence band that they leave behind, give rise to the moderate conduction properties of semiconductors. The smaller the band gap and the higher the temperature then the greater the number of electrons which can be excited into the conduction bands. This results in higher conductivity in materials with small band gaps and the increasing conductivity seen in semiconductors with increasing temperature.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><b>Figs. 5.7 and 5.8</b> Rocksalt structure and the overlap of the metal t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals in the unit cell faces.</p>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The colours of the majority of transition metal monoxides are quite different from those normally found for the same metal ion in octahedral coordination <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a>complexes. This is particularly so for the early transition elements, for example, V(H<sub>2</sub>0)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup> is violet whilst VO is black, but for nickel the oxide is the same colour, green, as Ni(H<sub>2</sub>0)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>. For the early transition metals this would indicate that the electronic structure of the oxides is quite different from discrete octahedrally coordinated 2+ ions.</p>
<p class="indent">The first row transition metal oxides from TiO to NiO adopt the rocksalt structure shown in <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>, though many of these compounds are non-stoichiometric as discussed in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>. The coordination geometry of the metal ion is octahedral and the d-orbitals on the metal ion will be split energetically into two sets as in typical coordination complexes. The e<sub>g</sub> levels, corresponding to the d<sub><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>&#8211;<i>y</i><sup>2</sup></sub> and d<sub><i>z</i><sup>2</sup></sub> orbitals, point towards the oxide ions in the structure and the t<sub>2g</sub> levels, formed from the d<sub><i>xy</i></sub>, d<sub><i>xz</i></sub> and d<sub><i>yz</i></sub> orbitals on the metal, point between the oxide ions. Looking at these directional properties of the t<sub>2g</sub> levels in relation to the structure of the monoxides, <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.8</a>, shows that these orbitals point towards identical orbitals on neighbouring metal atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In TiO the Ti<sup>2+</sup> d-orbitals are very diffuse as the effective nuclear charge felt by these levels is low. This results in good overlap between the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals along the (110) directions in the crystal. Hence, rather than considering discrete t<sub>2g</sub> levels in solid TiO, the electronic structure should be described in terms of a band. The bands formed from the overlap of the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals will be able to hold up to six electrons from each contributing titanium ion; Ti<sup>2+</sup> is a d<sup>2</sup> ion and these two d-electrons will <i>partially</i> occupy the t<sub>2g</sub> band, <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9a</a>. TiO, therefore, exhibits metallic behaviour with a high electronic conductivity of about 10<sup>3</sup> (&#x03A9; cm)<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. Similar electronic behaviour occurs with other early transition metal monoxides, for example VO.</p>

<p class="indent">The behaviour of the latter transition metals is quite different. As the first row is crossed, increasingly poor screening of the d-electrons by each other results in a rapidly increasing effective nuclear charge. This causes a marked contraction of the d-orbitals and consequently the overlap between the t<sub>2g</sub> levels decreases significantly. Rather than forming a band, the t<sub>2g</sub> levels on the nickel ions within NiO should be considered to be discrete levels. In addition, the increased number of d-electrons for nickel, Ni<sup>2+</sup> d<sup>8</sup>, means that the t<sub>2g</sub><a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a> levels are filled and it is the e<sub>g</sub> metal orbital set which is partially empty, <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9b</a>. These e<sub>g</sub> orbitals point towards the oxide ions and cannot overlap with those on neighbouring nickel ions to form a band structure. NiO therefore shows no metallic properties. It is an insulator and the d-orbital energies are very similar to those in the hexa-aquo ion, leading to similar d&#8211;d transitions and, hence, visible spectrum.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Trioxides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The contrasting electrical properties of WO<sub>3</sub> and ReO<sub>3</sub> can also be rationalised in terms of their band structures. WO<sub>3</sub> is a pale yellow, insulating solid whilst ReO<sub>3</sub> is a beautiful, lustrous, red metal. Both materials crystallise with the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure described in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#sec_4.1">Section 4.1</a> though that of WO<sub>3</sub> is slightly distorted by twisting of the WO<sub>3</sub> octahedra. The octahedral co-ordination of the metal produces the same d-orbital splitting observed in the monoxides, producing the t<sub>2g</sub> and e<sub>g</sub> sets. The p-orbitals on the oxide ions are also divided into two sets; one p-orbital points towards the metal ion whilst the other two, p<sub><i>x</i></sub> and p<sub><i>y</i></sub>, are perpendicular to the M&#8211;O&#8211;M direction. The t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals on the metal ions and the p<sub><i>x</i></sub>, p<sub><i>y</i></sub>, orbitals on the oxide ion overlap as shown in <a href="#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a> producing a band which can contain up to six electrons. In WO<sub>3</sub>, W<sup>6+</sup> d<sup>0</sup>, this band is empty but in ReO<sub>3</sub>, Re<sup>6+</sup> d<sup>1</sup>, the one d-electron partially fills the band giving rise to the metallic characteristics of this material. At room temperature, ReO<sub>3</sub> is as good a conductor of electricity as copper metal.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Graphite intercalates</h3>
<p class="noindent">The band structure of pure graphite is shown in <a href="#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11a</a>. A particular feature of this diagram is that the valence and conduction bands touch but there are no energy levels at the Fermi level. Another way of considering<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a> graphite is as a zero, band gap semiconductor. Due to thermal energy a few electrons are excited from the lower valence band into the conduction band and the Fermi level in graphite, above absolute zero, lies slightly into the conduction band. As a result graphite is a moderate conductor of electricity. However, removing or adding electrons to the graphite band structure will produce a Fermi level well inside either the conduction or valence band and this can be achieved chemically through the insertion chemistry of graphite.</p>
<p class="indent">Reaction of graphite with potassium to yield C<sub>8</sub>K transfers electrons from potassium metal on to the graphite layers; these occupy the valence band and the density of states diagram in <a href="#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11b</a> results.

<p class="noindent">As with the electronic properties of solids the important magnetic properties of inorganic materials result from the interaction between the atomic centres in the extended lattice.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Transition metals in the majority of their compounds have partially filled d-orbitals and frequently a proportion of the electrons occupying these orbitals are unpaired; this gives rise to the magnetic behaviour. Where discrete metal centres exist, for example solutions of transition metal compounds and in many simple, molecular compounds, the unpaired electrons are normally orientated randomly on different metal centres. This random orientation of electron spins and their associated magnetic fields is known as <i>paramagnetic</i> behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent">However, in solid materials with ordered lattices, the unpaired electrons on individual metal centres can interact, resulting in particular alignments. Paramagnetic behaviour, <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12a</a>, is observed in the majority of solid inorganic materials at high temperatures where any interaction of the electrons between metal centres is removed by thermal disordering.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The ordering of the magnetic moments in solids may occur in a variety of ways. If the unpaired electrons align such that their magnetic moments all orientate in a parallel manner the material <i>is ferromagnetic,</i> <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12b</a>. One alternative is that the magnetic moments may align on neighbouring metal centres in opposite directions or antiparallel, <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12c</a>, with the overall magnetic moment averaging to zero: such behaviour is known as <i>antiferromagnetism</i>. A third type of behaviour, <i>ferrimagnetism,</i> is where the alignment of magnetic moments produces an overall magnetic moment, but not all the individual electron spins are parallel; <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12d</a> shows one example.</p>
<a id="page_56" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 56, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a>
<p class="indent">The magnetic interaction between the various centres in a solid is normally relatively weak and is readily overcome by thermal energies. Hence, many materials which have magnetically ordered structures at low temperatures become paramagnetic on heating.</p>
<p class="indent">The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials is shown in <a href="#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>. The magnetic susceptibility is a measure of the magnetisation of a material when placed in a magnetic field. The positioning of a paramagnetic material with randomly-orientated, individual, magnetic moments in an external magnetic field results in their partial alignment parallel to the field; this acts against thermal effects which tend to disorder them. High alignment of the individual magnetic moments in a sample parallel to the external field produces a high magnetic susceptibility. Hence, as a paramagnetic material is cooled the energy available for thermal disordering of the individual magnetic moments is reduced and such nuclei align more readily parallel to the external magnetic field; <a href="#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13a</a> results with an increasing susceptibility with decreasing temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">If the material undergoes a transition to a state where <i>all</i> the individual magnetic moments align, that is a ferromagnetic material, there will be a surge in the magnetic susceptibility as all the electrons attempt to line up in the same direction. The temperature of this transition is known as the Curie temperature, <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> ; the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of a material which becomes ferromagnetic on cooling is shown in <a href="#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13b</a>. Note that above the Curie temperature the compound acts exactly as a paramagnetic material.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Superexchange</h3>
<p class="noindent">One mechanism which causes magnetic ordering in inorganic materials is superexchange and is illustrated in <a href="#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>. Many inorganic systems, for example oxides and sulphides, contain metal centres separated by an anion. A good example is MnO which adopts the rocksalt structure where overlap of the metal e<sub>g</sub> d-orbitals with the p-orbitals on the anion can occur along each of the cell axes. Mn<sup>2+</sup> has five d-electrons in a high spin configuration and two of these occupy the e<sub>g</sub> levels. An unpaired electron occupying an e<sub>g</sub> orbital on Mn<sup>2+</sup> can interact with an electron in the oxide p-orbital forming a pair of antiparallel spins. The other electron in the oxygen p-orbital is necessarily of opposite spin orientation and this can in turn interact with an e<sub>g</sub> electron on the next manganese ion. This chain of interactions can run throughout the structure and will produce alternating spin orientations on all <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of inorganic materials</a>neighbouring manganese ions. At low temperatures the strength of these superexchange interactions through oxide ions is such that this magnetic ordering process occurs and MnO is antiferromagnetic below 122 K, <i>T<sub>N</sub>,</i>S <a href="#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>. Above the N&#233;el temperature the thermal energy is greater than the interaction energy between the unpaired electrons and the electrons on adjacent manganese ions become randomly oriented.</p>

<p class="indent">Similar behaviour to that of MnO is seen with other late first row transition metal monoxides; Fe<sub>1-x</sub>O, CoO and NiO, all adopting the rocksalt structure, with <i>T</i><sub>N</sub>&#39;S of 198, 293 and 523 K respectively. The increasing N&#233;el temperature across this series may reflect the decreasing lattice parameters and increasing overlap between the metal and oxide ion orbitals.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Spinels</h3>
<p class="noindent">The ferrite spinels of composition MFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, M = Fe, Ni, Zn, have important magnetic properties which have led to their use in transformer cores and in magnetic recording media. The distribution of cations in the spinel structure has been discussed in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#sec_4.6">Section 4.6</a> and spinels containing Fe<sup>3+</sup> because of its zero excess octahedral CFSE are often inverse. This results in structures which contain Fe<sup>3+</sup> on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. In Fe<sub>3</sub>0<sub>4</sub> the iron ion distribution is that of an inverse spinel, (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)<sup>t</sup>(Fe<sup>2+</sup>,Fe<sup>3+</sup>)<sup>0</sup>O<sub>4</sub>, and all the metal ions have unpaired electrons. The superexchange interactions between the various sites is complex but the overall effect, in the magnetically ordered phase, is to align the magnetic moments of all the octahedral sites in one direction and those on tetrahedral sites in the opposite. Fe<sub>3</sub>0<sub>4</sub> is, therefore, a ferrimagnet.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Non-linear optical materials</h3>
<p class="noindent">The interaction of laser light with the electronic charge distribution in non-centrosymmetric crystals gives rise to observable non-linear effects which may be used for the amplification, modulation and conversion of the laser frequencies. Frequency conversion is particularly useful as it extends the range of available laser frequencies. In designing inorganic materials as non-linear optic materials the relationship between the charge distribution, dictated by the structure, and the optical properties is paramount.</p>
<p class="indent">The interaction of light with the electronic charge distribution around an ion induces oscillations of the electron cloud. With light of relatively low intensity the induced polarisation, the displacement of the electron cloud or dipole moment per unit volume, P, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the electric field of the light wave, <i>E.</i> That is</p>

<p class="indent">Non-linear optical crystals are generally insulators transparent to the laser light of interest. Non-linear optical effects occur in non-centrosymmetric materials with highly polarisable crystals which also have a high refractive index; a number of non-linear optic crystals develop polarisation as a result of the displacement of ions as in ferroelectrics.</p>
<p class="indent">Two important non-linear optic materials are LiNbO<sub>3</sub> and KTiOPO<sub>4</sub>. The structure of lithium niobate was described in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#sec_4.5">Section 4.5</a>. This material has a high refractive index and a high polarisability as a result of the lithium ion displacements in the ferroelectric phase and <b>&#967;</b><sup>(2)</sup>, relative to KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>=1, is 13. Applications of lithium niobate in optical devices include frequency doublers and waveguides. KTiOPO<sub>4</sub>, has the structure shown in <a href="#fig5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>, and is constructed from linked TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra and PO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. The potassium ions occupy cavities within this framework. In the ferroelectric phase the potassium ions are displaced from the centres of these cavities producing a high dipole moment. This material also has a high refractive index. The combination of these properties produces a high value for <b>&#967;</b><sup>(2)</sup> in <a href="#eq5.2">eqn 5.2</a>, of 15, relative to KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>=1, and potassium titanyl phosphate is rapidly developing in non-linear optic applications.</p>
