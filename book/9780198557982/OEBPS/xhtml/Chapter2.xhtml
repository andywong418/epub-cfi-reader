<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General</h2>
<p class="noindent">The form of the powder X-ray diffraction data obtained from a material will depend upon the crystal structure it adopts. This structure is delineated by the lattice type, crystal class, unit cell parameters and the distribution of the various ion and molecule types within the unit cell. The number and positions, in terms of 29, of the reflections depend upon the cell parameters, crystal class, lattice type and wavelength used to collect the data, while peak intensity depends upon the types of atoms present and their positions.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of the enormous range of different structures which materials adopt, nearly all crystalline solids have a unique powder X-ray diffraction pattern in terms of the <i>positions</i> of the observed reflections and the peak <i>intensities.</i> In mixtures of compounds each crystalline phase present will contribute to the powder diffraction pattern its own unique set of lines. The relative intensity of line sets from mixtures will depend upon the amount present and the ability of a structure to scatter X-rays.</p>
<p class="indent">The effectiveness of powder X-ray diffraction has led to it becoming the major technique used for the characterisation of polycrystalline, solid inorganic materials. <a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a> summarises some of the applications to which the technique is put and the most important of these are discussed in more detail in the following sections.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Identification of unknowns</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many of the powder diffraction data sets collected from inorganic, organometallic and organic compounds have been compiled into a data-base by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). This data base which contains over 50 000 unique powder X-ray diffraction patterns may be used to identify an unknown material from its powder pattern alone.</p>
<p class="indent">With simple materials this can be done by comparing two or three intense lines from the powder diffraction pattern with listings of the most intense lines in book form. For more complex materials a computer can be employed to look for coincidences between the experimental data and the data-base. For many solid materials this technique provides a rapid method of identification. Drawbacks are that the compound must have previously been made and its pattern entered in the data-base and that the compound must be crystalline.</p>

<p class="noindent">In a mixture of compounds each crystalline phase present will contribute to the overall powder X-ray diffraction pattern. In preparative materials chemistry this may be used to identify the level of reaction and purity of the product. The reaction between the two solids Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MgO to form MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> may be monitored by powder X-ray diffraction, <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. At the start of the reaction a mixture of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MgO will produce an X-ray pattern <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, The application and interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction data</a> combining those of the pure phases. As the reaction proceeds, <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> patterns (a) and (b), a new set of reflections corresponding to the product, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, emerges and grows in intensity at the expense of the reflections from Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MgO. On completion of the reaction the powder diffraction pattern will be that of pure MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. A materials chemist will often use powder X-ray diffraction to monitor the progress of a reaction in this way.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">Amorphous materials have no long range order but short range correlations produce broad diffraction maxima around positions corresponding to the interatomic distances.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The powder X-ray diffraction method is widely employed to identify impurities in materials whether it be residual reactant in a product, as above, or an undesired by-product. However, the impurity must be crystalline, even a high level of amorphous phase would not be detectable except maybe as an increase in the background of the powder pattern. Also, the ability to detect a second, impurity phase will depend on how well the two components scatter X-rays though normally it is possible to detect a few per cent of an impurity phase. As X-rays are scattered by electrons, materials containing heavy elements, e.g. second and third row transition metals, diffract X-rays strongly and will produce, in general, strong reflections in the powder pattern. Materials containing light elements, e.g. organic compounds and first and second row oxides, will produce weaker patterns. As an example consider the reaction of Li<sub>2</sub>O and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to form LiNbO<sub>3</sub>. It would be easy to identify a few per cent of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> as an impurity in LiNbO<sub>3</sub> but Li<sub>2</sub>O would need to be present at a much higher level for its pattern to be observed in the powder diffraction data from a mixture of Li<sub>2</sub>O, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>s</sub> and LiNbO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">If Miller indices can be assigned to the various reflections in the powder pattern it becomes possible to determine the cell constants; these are directly related to 20 and <i>h,k,l</i> through the relationships derived from the combination of Bragg&#8217;s Law and the <i>d</i>-spacing expression and summarised in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml#tab1.3">Table 1.3</a>. This assignment may be readily achieved for cubic crystal systems with a simple relationship between the diffraction angles and lattice parameters. However, as the cell symmetry decreases, the number of lines in the diffraction pattern increases rapidly as the relationship between 2&#x03B8; and the cell constants becomes more complex. In these cases indexing the powder diffraction data becomes a computational problem.</p>

<p class="noindent">as both <i>a</i> and <i>&#955;</i> are constants. Sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values for the various reflections can be readily obtained from the diffraction angle 2&#x03B8;. These will all be related to each other through a common multiplier A as <i>h, k</i> and <i>l</i> can only take integer values. Note that this will only be true for cubic systems; the more complex expressions for the <i>d</i>-spacings in terms of the lattice parameters in the other crystal systems means that more than one multiplier will be required. This argument may also be reversed in that <i>if</i> all the reflections in the powder diffraction pattern can be related through their sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values by a single, common multiplier then the crystal system must be cubic.</p>
<p class="indent">The process involved in indexing data from a cubic system and obtaining the lattice parameter is, therefore, straightforward and is illustrated in <a href="#tab2.2">Table 2.2</a>. Once sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values are tabulated they can be inspected for the common multiplier A; the ratio for each peak is the sum of the squares of the Miller indices.</p>

<p class="indent">Obviously, assigning these ratios to particular peaks can be quite difficult. However, the method can be illustrated for a tetragonal system by consideration of a system where there is only a slight distortion from a cubic unit cell; that is, the lattice parameters <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> are very similar. In this case the relationship between the reflections seen in the powder diffraction pattern of a tetragonal material to those of a cubic phase is shown schematically in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. The 100 reflection of a cubic material is made up of diffraction from the (100), (010), (001), (&#8211;100), (0&#8211;10) and (00&#8211;1) lattice planes which all have an identical d-spacing. The number of planes which contribute towards a reflection is termed the multiplicity, in this case the multiplicity is 6. The sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values for all these reflections are identical as they depend only on (<i>h</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>). In a tetragonal material with slightly different <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> lattice parameters the constants <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> will be very similar. Hence, the sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values for the (100) and (001) reflections will diverge only marginally and these maxima will be observed at only slightly different 2&#x03B8; values in the powder diffraction pattern. In <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a> the peak doublet near 22&#176; can be assigned as deriving from the 100 reflection of the cubic material and these two reflections indexed as 001 and 100. Lattice planes contributing to the (100) peak will be the (100), (010), (&#8211;100) and (0&#8211;10) giving a multiplicity of 4, those contributing to the (001) reflection will be the (001) and (00&#8211;1) giving a multiplicity of 2. The multiplicity is reflected in the peak intensities which have a 2:1 ratio, <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this slightly distorted material, assignment of Miller indices to all the other reflections has now become easy. Once the 100 and 001 reflections<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Application and interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction data</a> have been indexed, values of the constants <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> can be obtained using <a href="#eq2.3">eqn. 2.3</a> and the other observed sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values assigned using the possible ratios shown in <a href="#tab2.3">Table 2.3</a>. Again, following full indexing of the data, the values of <i>A</i> and C may be used to calculate the <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> parameters. For the compound in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, the values obtained are 399.5 pm (3.995 &#197;) and 403.4 pm (4.034 &#197;).

<h2 class="h2">2.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Lattice type and systematic absences</h2>
<p class="noindent">In indexing the powder patterns it has been assumed that all the possible reflections are observed, that is, scattering from each of the different lattice planes is sufficiently intense to contribute to the diffraction profile. This is normally so for a primitive lattice, but for body centred and face centred lattices restrictions occur on the values that h, k and 1 may take if the reflections are to have any intensity. This results in certain reflections not being observed in the powder diffraction pattern and these are known as systematic absences. The origin of these absences can be illustrated with regard to <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. Consideration of diffraction from the 100 plane of a cubic material with a body centred lattice shows that X-rays diffracted at the Bragg angle from the 100 planes (the faces of the cube) will be, by definition, in phase. However, halfway between the 100 planes, as a result of the body centring, there is an identical plane of atoms shifted in the x and y directions by (&#189;,&#189;). X-Ray diffraction from this plane, the 200, will have a pathlength difference relative to that from the 100 planes exactly &#x03BB;/2 out of phase and will, therefore, destructively interfere with it. In a body centred<a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Application and interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction data</a> lattice there is one lattice point in the 200 plane for every lattice point in the 100 plane and overall there will be total destructive interference for the 100 reflection. Note that it does not matter where the atoms or ions actually are in the unit cell, it is the fact that they always occur in pairs (at (<i>x,y,z</i>) and at (<i>x</i>+&#189;, <i>y</i>+&#189;, <i>z</i>+&#189;)) generated by the body centring that causes the destructive interference.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;"><b>Fig. 2.3</b> Origin of 100 absence in a body centred lattice. The scattering from the lattice point at the cell centre is 180&#176; out of phase with that from the cell corners.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Extension of these considerations to other possible values of <i>h, k</i> and <i>l</i> in a body centred structure show that for a reflection to be <i>present</i> then <i>h+k+l</i> is even. Alternatively this may be expressed as the condition, <i>h</i>+<i>k</i>+<i>l</i>=2<i>n</i>+1 is the systematic absence for I lattices. Similar considerations for a face centred cubic lattice show the following restrictions on <i>h, k</i> and / for a reflection to be observed: <i>h+k</i>=2<i>n</i>, <i>k+l</i>=2<i>n</i> and <i>h+l</i>=2<i>n.</i> This restriction may also be expressed in the terms, <i>h, k</i> and <i>l</i> must all be odd or all even. <a href="#tab2.4">Table 2.4</a> summarises which reflections are observed for the various lattice types in cubic systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Using this information it is possible, once a data set has been indexed, to determine the lattice type from the systematic absences. The existence of these absences can be a complicating factor when attempting to index cubic systems. If a material adopts a face centred cubic lattice then the common ratio between the sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values may not be immediately obvious. For this F lattice the first few peaks, if all are observed, will have sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values in the ratio 1.00 : 1.333 : 2.666 : 3.666 : 4.00. However, there is still a single common multiplier giving the integral ratios 3:4:8:11:12 for the first few reflections corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) reflections.</p>
<p class="indent">In a body centred cubic system the systematic absences can also be misleading in terms of indexing. The sin<sup>2</sup>&#952; values of the first few lines will be <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Application and interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction data</a>found to have the ratios 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8 corresponding to the ratios of the sums of the squares of the Miller indices. The presence of a line with a ratio of seven, points to these lines originating from a body centred system as there are no values of <i>h, k</i> and <i>l</i> which square and sum together to give seven. The common multiplier must be adjusted, by being halved, for these lines to give the ratios 2:4:6:8:10:12:14:16 corresponding to the Miller indices (110), (200), (211), etc. These are the first reflections found for a material adopting a body centred cubic structure.</p>

<p class="indent">Other symmetry elements in crystal structures can also give rise to absences in the powder diffraction pattern and sometimes peaks are not observed experimentally, as their intensity is so low that they cannot be distinguished from the background noise. One case where peaks have such a low intensity as to give rise to apparent absences in the powder diffraction pattern can be illustrated by consideration of KCl. X-Rays are scattered by electrons and isoelectronic species such as K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> will scatter X-rays to almost identical degrees. Therefore, in the face centred cubic sodium chloride structure adopted by KCl, <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>, the ion positions all scatter X-rays to an almost equivalent degree, that is, the potassium and chloride ions are practically indistinguishable to X-rays. Hence, the lattice repeat <i>observed by</i><a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Application and interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction data</a> <i>X-rays</i> is much smaller than the true one and is the smaller cube outlined in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. This unit cell is, if the corner atoms are considered identical as they are to X-rays, primitive and the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of KCl can be indexed using a primitive cubic unit cell of dimensions half that of the true face centred cubic unit cell. In essence the scattering equivalence of K<sup>+</sup> and CI" has made the reflections with odd Miller indices from the face centred cubic structure so weak that they are not observed. It is then possible to re-index the peaks with even Miller indices (by halving them) using a smaller common ratio which corresponds to the smaller (half size) unit cell, <a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>. The fact that the powder pattern of KCl, and other similar compounds with isoelectronic species, for example MgO, can be indexed using a primitive unit cell is merely a consequence of the origin of the X-ray scattering which makes such species indistinguishable.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Peak intensities</h2>
<p class="noindent">The peak intensities of the various reflections in an X-ray diffraction experiment are controlled by the atom types and their distribution in the unit cell. Measurement of these intensities allows the crystallographer to work out the structure of the crystalline material which produced them. This structure determination is, normally, carried out using the <i>single crystal X-ray diffraction</i> technique. In a single crystal experiment the diffraction data is collected using a detector or film covering two dimensions and the orientation of the crystal being studied can also be adjusted. Using this technique the intensities of all the individual reflections may be obtained and employed to determine the full crystal structure.</p>
<p class="indent">In the powder X-ray diffraction experiment, because all the reflections occur along the single 2&#952; axis, reflections frequently overlap, particularly at high 2&#952; values. Extracting intensities for the individual reflections, essential for the structure determination, becomes very difficult. Structural information may still be obtained from powder diffraction patterns using a technique known as the Rietveld method. In this method, a trial structure (in which likely positions, in the unit cell, are assigned to the different atoms present) is used to calculate intensities for the various reflections. These intensities may then be combined with the various factors controlling the form of the powder pattern, e.g. lattice parameters, radiation wavelength, to generate a &#8216;calculated&#39; powder pattern based on the trial structure. Comparison of this profile with the experimental one can then be undertaken and adjustment of the trial structure parameters carried out in order to obtain the best fit between the experimental and calculated data. This then provides reasonably accurate information on the atom positions in the unit cell. However, as stated above, a trial structure is required before the technique can be employed.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Crystallite size</h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to observe sharp diffraction maxima in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern, the crystallites need to be of sufficient size to ensure that slightly away from the 20 maximum, destructive interference occurs. The requirement is for a sufficiently large number of planes that summation of the diffracted waves, which are only slightly out of phase between successive planes, eventually produces destructive interference. In materials with very small crystallites, with few planes, the diffracted X-ray intensity slightly away from the Bragg angle does not totally destructively interfere and this leads to broadening of the reflections, <a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The Scherrer formula relates the thickness of the crystallites to the breadth of peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern:</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">where <i>t</i> is the crystallite thickness, <i>&#955;</i> the X-ray wavelength, &#952; the Bragg angle (half the measured diffraction angle) and <i>B<sub>M</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>s</sub></i> are the width in radians of diffraction peaks of the sample and a standard at half height. The standard peak width is obtained from a highly crystalline sample (with a diffraction peak at a similar diffraction angle to that of the sample under investigation) and represents the instrumental broadening.</p>
<p class="indent">The Scherrer method of determining crystallite size from powder data is of wide application. For materials which are of plate-like habit, for example clays, the size of the crystallites in the different directions may be ascertained by consideration of the peak widths of the various (<i>h</i>00), (0<i>k</i>0) and (00<i>l</i>) reflections.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Variable temperature studies</h3>
<p class="noindent">Combination of powder X-ray diffraction equipment with a furnace or cryostat allows powder diffraction patterns to be collected over a large temperature range. Studying the evolution of the pattern as a function of temperature allows rapid identification of phase changes, which cause marked changes in the pattern as the material adopts a new structure, and the determination of thermal expansion coefficients. For the latter, the peak positions are monitored as a function of temperature, allowing determination of the lattice parameters and unit cell volume.</p>
