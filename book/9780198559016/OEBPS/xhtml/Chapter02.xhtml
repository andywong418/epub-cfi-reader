<p class="noindent">Having examined the physical basis of X-ray crystallography and its expression in mathematical notation, we consider now how the method works in practice. In this chapter the various successive steps are described in general terms with appropriate examples; in the next chapter several case studies are presented to illustrate the complete procedure.</p>

<section id="sec2.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2"><b>2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The preparation and selection of samples</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The sample must be a <i>single crystal</i>, in which all the unit cells are identical and are aligned in the same orientation, so that they scatter cooperatively to give a clear diffraction pattern consisting of individual X-ray beams, each in a definite direction. Outward appearance such as regularity of shape is not important, but rather the internal regularity of the molecular arrangement on a well-defined lattice; many single crystals have an unpromising irregular shape, while polycrystalline and even non-crystalline materials such as glass may have beautiful external forms.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">In reality, all crystals have faults in their internal structure, so unit cells are not exactly aligned.The range of misalignment is called the <i>mosaic spread</i>, because the slightly misaligned sub-microscopic blocks of a real single crystal resemble the tiles in a mosaic (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). For a good quality single crystal, the mosaic spread is only a fraction of a degree.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The intensities of X-rays diffracted by a crystal are proportional to its volume (more electrons give more scattering), but X-rays are also absorbed by crystals and this effect increases exponentially with crystal dimensions; absorption affects the measured intensities, introducing a systematic error, for which a correction may need to be made (see later). The amount of absorption depends on the X-ray wavelength and on the chemical composition, and can be very high when heavier elements are present. Systematic errors are also produced if the crystal is not completely bathed in the incident X-ray beam throughout the diffraction measurements, and most X-ray beams are less than 1 mm in cross-section. A typical acceptable crystal size is a few tenths of a millimetre; a smaller size and uniform dimensions are preferable for samples containing heavy atoms, and very small crystals can be examined with intense synchrotron radiation. Such crystals, much smaller than the popular image, usually need to be examined and handled under a microscope. A microscope with polarizing filters provides some useful optical tests of the quality of a crystal, but the ultimate test is the X-ray diffraction pattern. Crystals can be cut with a sharp scalpel, but this sometimes adversely affects the crystal quality.</p>

<p class="indent">Suitable crystals are sometimes produced in the initial synthesis of a compound, but often recrystallization is necessary. This process can be difficult, unpredictable, frustrating and time-consuming and is not guaranteed to succeed. The objective is quite different from that of recrystallization in synthesis&#x2014;good quality single crystals of suitable size, with high yield not a priority&#x2014;though both aim for a pure material, and special techniques have been devised. It is not uncommon for a crystal structure to incorporate molecules of solvent, so the solvent itself is one of the conditions which can be varied in the quest for suitable crystals.</p>
<p class="indent">One single crystal is separated from the rest of the sample and is mounted on a device which will hold it firmly in the X-ray beam; a precision of hundredths of a degree is required. Since the diffraction experiment involves rotating the crystal in the beam during exposure, as explained later, lateral adjustments need to be available to position the crystal accurately on each rotation axis. For some less commonly used equipment, it is an advantage if one unit cell axis can be aligned in a particular direction, so there may also be provision for angular adjustments. Such a device, known as a <i>goniometer head</i>, is shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. Apart from the sample itself, no crystalline material should be in the X-ray beam, so the crystal is usually glued (with a minimum quantity of an amorphous glue) to a fine glass fibre attached to the goniometer <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Chapter 2 The method step by step</a>head (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>). The glue and glass contribute to general background scattering but not to the sharp diffraction maxima.</p>

<p class="indent">Samples which are air-sensitive or which degrade by loss of loosely bound solvent require special treatment. Handling them in an inert-atmosphere glove-box is possible but difficult. They may be sealed in thin-walled glass capillary tubes, an operation which is considerably easier if brief exposure to the air can be tolerated. Alternatively, the crystals can be coated with an inert viscous oil and then manipulated without difficulty under a normal microscope in the open atmosphere; if the X-ray examination is to be carried out at a sufficiently low temperature that the oil vitrifies to a glass, it can be used simultaneously as an adhesive and a protective coating, and this provides a particularly elegant and simple solution for materials of even extreme air sensitivity.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>X-ray photography</h2>
<p class="noindent">As noted in Chapter 1, diffracted X-rays can be recorded on photographic film. The diffraction conditions represented by the Bragg equation are severe, and will be satisfied for only very few reflections for a randomly oriented stationary crystal in an X-ray beam, because few of the lattice planes will fortuitously be oriented at the correct <i>&#x03B8;</i> angle, so the pattern recorded on film will show only a few spots (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>(a)).</p>
<p class="indent">In order to bring more lattice planes into a reflecting position, the crystal must be rotated in the X-ray beam (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>(b)). Recording the whole of the diffraction pattern on one film, however, leads to severe overlap of the reflections occurring at different stages of the rotation, because three- dimensional information is being compressed into a two-dimensional record, and its measurement and interpretation are impossible (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>(c)).</p>
<figure>
<img class="center" src="../images/fig2.5.jpg" alt="images"/>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Instead, selected portions of the diffraction pattern need to be recorded separately on different films. The interpretation of them is greatly assisted if the rotation of the crystal is about the direction of a unit cell axis, and further simplification results from some types of correlated movement of the film with that of the crystal, and/or from the use of film held in a cylindrical mount rather than a flat one. Assigning <i>hkl</i> indices to the individual reflections is then</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">An <i>X-ray camera</i> is an instrument for recording X-ray diffraction patterns on photographic film. A <i>diffractometer</i> is an instrument which records diffraction patterns by means of some kind of X-ray sensitive detector other than photographic film, usually involving the conversion of incident X-ray energy into an electronic signal.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">a simple matter of counting along obvious rows of spots. Several types of <i>X-ray camera</i> have been developed over many years to achieve such effects, each operating with a particular geometrical combination of crystal orientation, film shape and film movement. The use of film methods for recording X-ray diffraction patterns has declined in recent decades as diffractometers have become more widespread, but they do offer the advantages of a permanent durable record of the whole diffraction pattern and its background in compensation for their slowness and non-digital output, which requires further optical measurement before it can be fed to a computer. The geometry, symmetry and intensities of the diffraction pattern can all be obtained from a suitable set of photographs, and many earlier crystal structures were determined in this way.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec2.4" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>X-ray diffractometers</h2>

<p class="noindent">From around the 1960s, computer-controlled <i>diffractometers</i> became the standard means of collecting diffraction data. Instead of photographic film, an electronic device is used which is sensitive to X-rays. The most commonly used detector, a <i>scintillation counter</i>, contains a material, such as thallium-doped sodium iodide, which produces light in the visible region when X-rays fall on it. The light is detected and the signal amplified by a photomultiplier, so that the overall effect is an electrical pulse for each X-ray photon incident on the face of the detector, which is typically a few millimetres in diameter. In this way the intensities of individual reflections can be measured For each one, the detector must be moved round one axis (usually vertical) to the correct 2<i>&#x03B8;</i> angle. Because the detector can see only reflections which occur in the horizontal plane, more than one axis of rotation is needed for the crystal. The most widely used type of diffractometer has three rotation axes for the crystal, giving more than enough freedom, so that there is even a choice of settings possible for many of the reflections (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). With one of these <i>four-circle diffractometers</i> reflections (positions and intensities) are observed one at a time, the crystal and detector being moved under computer control from each one to the next in sequence.</p>

<p class="indent1">More recently, X-ray detectors have become available which record over a considerably larger area and are position-sensitive: a number of incident beams can be recorded at the same time, and their positions as well as intensities are known. There are various types of <i>area detectors</i> based on different technologies, each with particular advantages and disadvantages of size, sensitivity, spatial resolution, speed of read-out and cost, and this is a topic of considerable current development; they can be regarded simply as electronic equivalents of photographic film in many respects. An area detector can replace the scintillation counter of a four-circle diffractometer, but it is also possible to reduce the number of rotation axes for the crystal, because of the size of the detector (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>); it is no longer necessary to bring all reflections into the horizontal plane in order to record them.</p>
<p class="indent">After many years of relative stability in the design of diffractometers, the introduction of area detectors has brought considerable change and opened up exciting new possibilities (see examples later).</p>
</section>
<section id="sec2.5" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Obtaining unit cell geometry and symmetry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Both photographically and with a diffractometer the unit cell geometry can be measured from a subset of the complete diffraction pattern. The key step is assigning the correct indices <i>hkl</i> to each of the observed reflections. From these and the measured Bragg angle for a few reflections, the six unit cell parameters can be calculated via the Bragg equation and modified versions of it appropriate to the geometry of the particular camera or diffractometer being used.</p>
<p class="indent">With photographs, one unit cell axis is aligned in a particular direction relative to the incident X-ray beam and this produces a regular pattern of spots on the film, to which indices can easily be assigned by counting along rows. Several photographs are required to give the full three-dimensional geometry, and each may take several hours.</p>
<p class="indent">With diffractometers, the crystal is usually mounted in a random orientation, and this has to be determined as well as the unit cell geometry. Some reflections of moderate to high intensity are located by simply driving <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 2 The method step by step</a>the various motors while monitoring the detector output for a signal significantly above background (a blind search, all under computer control), or by taking short exposure Polaroid photographs and measuring the positions of spots on them. From these positions, perhaps one or two dozen of them for a four-circle diffractometer, rather more for an area detector, the crystal orientation, unit cell geometry and reflection indices have to be determined simultaneously, by calculations which are not simple and are usually regarded as computer &#x2018;black-box&#x2019; methods, but they are all based essentially on the Bragg equation. A diffractometer will often give a unit cell and orientation for a crystal in less than an hour; a few minutes are usually enough with an area detector.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">At this stage, it may be possible to assign the correct space group by comparison of intensities which are equivalent by symmetry, and by noting that certain special subsets of reflections have zero intensity (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>), which is an effect of symmetry elements with a translation component (glide planes and screw axes), but the decision is made more reliably on the basis of the complete data set later. We have already seen examples of how this may provide some information about the structure, such as molecular symmetry or presence of solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the initial examination of a crystal with X-rays also shows the quality of the diffraction pattern, from which a decision is made whether to proceed with the full experiment or look for a better crystal.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec2.6" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>The measurement of intensities</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although diffraction intensities can be measured from photographic films, this is now rarely done. It involves estimating the degree of blackening in each spot, which can be achieved either by visual comparison with a calibrated scale or by measuring the absorption of a beam of light passed through the film. Some reflections are too weak to be seen above the general level of background scattering on the film, and these are labelled as &#x2018;unobserved&#x2019;; usually no numerical value is recorded for their intensities, and they are not used in the successive calculations. The process of estimating intensities may take several weeks, depending on the size and symmetry of the structure (and hence the number of photographs required to record the complete data set) and the overall intensity of diffraction.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-left" id="fig2.9"><b>Fig. 2.9</b> A reflection profile observed on a diffractometer as the crystal is rotated.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A conventional four-circle diffractometer measures intensities one at a time in an automatic, computer-controlled process. For each reflection the crystal and detector are driven to the appropriate positions to satisfy the Bragg equation and bring the diffracted beam into the detector in the horizontal plane, and the total &#x2018;integrated intensity&#x2019; is measured while the crystal is rotated through a small angle from one side of the Bragg position to the other to allow for the mosaic spread of the crystal, which produces a peak profile of a few tenths of a degree rather than a sharp spike of intensity at one angle (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>). Some diffractometer systems carry out a detailed statistical analysis of the reflection profile shape, which provides more reliable results for weaker reflections.</p>
<p class="indent">The crystallographer must make some decisions about the data collection procedure. These include the maximum Bragg angle to be measured (reflections at higher angles are generally weaker but add to the precision of <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 2 The method step by step</a> the final structure if they have measurable intensities), the time to spend on each measurement, and whether to measure only the <i>unique set</i> of data (a fraction of the total pattern depending on the space-group symmetry) or to include other reflections equivalent by symmetry, which takes longer but again improves the quality of data overall and gives a confirmation of the symmetry. The time taken to collect the intensity data on a four-circle diffractometer depends very much on these decisions and on the size of the structure; a larger structure gives more reflections to the same maximum Bragg angle. It takes at least overnight and usually several days.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The <i>unique setoi</i> data, up to a particular maximum Bragg angle, is the total set of reflections which are independent of each other by symmetry. Application of symmetry to the unique set produces all the reflections which can be measured. For example, in the centrosymmetric triclinic case the diffraction pattern has only inversion symmetry, and the unique set is exactly half of the total available data: each reflection <i>h, k, l</i> is equivalent to the reflection <i>h, &#x2013;k, &#x2013;l.</i> For a centrosymmetric monoclinic structure, the unique set is one quarter of the total, and for centrosymmetric orthorhombic it is one eighth.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">With an area detector diffractometer, many diffracted beams are recorded simultaneously. Usually the crystal is rotated about one axis and each exposure covers a small angular range, the details depending on the particular characteristics of the detector: those with rapid read-out of the image can efficiently measure diffraction patterns with relatively narrow angular slices, but slower read-out demands fewer, wider angular frames. In general, reflections are spread over more than one frame and sophisticated computer analysis of large quantities of data is required. Among other advantages, area detectors can provide a high degree of redundancy of symmetiy-equivalent data and of the same reflections measured more than once. Data collection typically takes only a few hours, independent of the size of the structure, since a larger structure just gives more simultaneous reflections, but longer exposures are advisable for weakly scattering samples. Here the use of synchrotron radiation brings a substantial improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">The result of this process, from whatever equipment is used, is a list of reflections, usually thousands of them, each with <i>hkl</i> indices and a measured intensity. In addition, from diffractometer measurements, each intensity <i>I</i> has an associated <i>standard uncertainty</i> (s.u.), <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>I</i>), which is calculated from the known statistical properties of the X-ray generation and diffraction processes, and is a measure of the precision or reliability of the measurement.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A previous term for standard uncertainty, still in wide use, is <i>estimated standard deviation</i> (e.s.d.). It is an estimate of the spread of values which would be obtained if the measurements were repeated many times.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">We have previously seen that the intensity of an X-ray beam is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude. The measured intensity is affected by various factors, however, for which corrections must be applied. The conversion of intensities <i>I</i> to &#x2018;observed structure amplitudes&#x2019; |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| (o = observed) or <i>F</i><sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup> and, correspondingly, of s.u.&#x2019;s <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>I</i>) to <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>) or <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>F</i><sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>) is known as data reduction and has several components.</p>
<p class="indent">There are corrections associated with the data collection process, which are geometrical in nature. These are a function of the geometry of the equipment and so are instrument-dependent. There is also a correction needed because reflected radiation is partially polarized (a phenomenon exploited in the use of Polaroid sunglasses, for example). These geometrical corrections, known as <i>Lorenz-polarization</i> factors, are well known and easily made.</p>
<p class="indent">A correction may also be needed for changes in the incident X-ray beam intensity or in the scattering power of the crystal during the experiment. The former is important for synchrotron radiation, which decays gradually and significantly and can be directly monitored, and the latter may be caused by some decomposition of the sample in the high-energy X-ray beam. The effect of both is to make intensities measured later in the experiment weaker than they <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 2 The method step by step</a> should be relative to earlier ones. A correction can be made on the basis of reflections which are measured repeatedly at intervals during the data collection.</p>

<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:9em;">In reality, of course, intensities cannot be negative, but the weakest reflections from a diffractometer may be insignificantly above background and, through statistical variations in the measuring process, may be recorded as below background, i.e. apparently net negative. These would be &#x2018;unobserved&#x2019; by photographic methods. The fact that they are weak is actually valuable information in structure determination.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Where absorption effects are significant a further correction must be made. Each reflection is affected differently by absorption, because the absorption depends on the path length of the X-rays through the crystal, and this varies as the crystal orientation is changed (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>). Many different types of absorption correction are used. Some are based on careful measurement of the crystal shape and dimensions and calculation of path lengths; others are based on comparison of intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, which should be equal but are not because of absorption effects.</p>
<p class="indent">The data reduction process also includes the merging and averaging of repeated and symmetry-equivalent measurements in order to produce a unique, corrected and scaled set of data. This calculation affords a numerical measure of the agreement among equivalent reflections, which is one indication of the quality of the data and the appropriateness of the applied corrections.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same time, statistical analysis of the complete unique data set can provide an indication of the presence or absence of some symmetry elements, particularly whether the structure is centrosymmetric or not, though this is not infallible; and the observed overall decay of intensity with increasing (sin0)/A, gives an average atomic displacement parameter.</p>
<p class="indent">The various corrections for the intensities are applied also to their s.u.&#x0027;s. The result of this whole process, which usually takes only a matter of minutes on a computer, is a list of reflections as <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>|, <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>) [or <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <img src="../images/in2_11.jpg" alt="images"/>, <i>&#x03C3;</i>(<img src="../images/in2_11.jpg" alt="images"/>); the advantage of retaining the squared form is that no special treatment is required for intensities measured as negative].</p>

The amplitudes |<i>F</i>(<i>hkl</i>)| have been measured, the final exponential term can be calculated for the contribution of each reflection <i>hkl</i> to each position <i>xyz</i>, but the phases of the reflections are unfortunately unknown, so the calculation cannot be carried out immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">The result of adding even just two waves varies from the sum to the difference of their amplitudes depending on their relative phases (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>), and to apply trial-and-error methods to thousands of waves is a task of impossible proportions.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall see in the next step (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.9">section 2.9</a>) that knowing part of the structure, i.e. the positions of some of the atoms, especially those with the most electrons, is often enough to help find the rest. The question is, where to begin?</p>

<p class="indent">Of the various methods used, two are by far the most common and important. One works best for structures containing one atom or a small number of atoms with significantly more electrons than the rest (&#x2018;heavy atoms&#x2019;), while the other is more appropriate for &#x2018;equal atom&#x2019; structures.

<p class="indent">The Patterson map looks rather like an electron density map (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>), in that it has peaks of positive density in various positions. These are not, however, the positions of atoms in the structure. Instead, it turns out that the Patterson function is a map of vectors between pairs of atoms in the structure. For every pair of atoms at positions (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>) there is a peak in the Patterson map at (x<sub>1</sub> &#x2013; x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> &#x2013; y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub> &#x2013; z<sub>2</sub>) and another of the same size at (x<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; z<sub>1</sub>). In other words, for every peak seen in the Patterson map (at, say, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>), there must be two atoms in the structure whose <i>x</i> coordinates differ by <i>u, y</i> coordinates differ by <i>v</i>, and <i>z</i> coordinates differ by <i>w.</i> The Patterson peaks show where atoms lie relative to each other, but not where they lie relative to the unit cell origin, which is what we really want to know.</p>
<p class="indent">Peaks in an electron density map are, ignoring vibration effects, proportional in size to the atomic numbers of the respective elements, since these are equal to the number of electrons. Patterson peaks are proportional in size to the product of the atomic numbers of the two atoms concerned.</p>

<p class="sidebar">For example, for ferrocene Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Fe&#x2013;Fe peaks, Fe&#x2013;C peaks and C&#x2013;C peaks have relative heights 26 &#x00D7; 26 = 676, 26 &#x00D7; 6 = 156, and 6 &#x00D7; 6 = 36; these are in the <i>ratio</i> approximately 19 : 4 : 1. Peaks involving H are even smaller. The few large Fe&#x2013;Fe peaks (more than one molecule per unit cell!) will be clearly seen among the many smaller overlapped peaks. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.14">Figure 2.14</a> also shows a small number of large peaks and is otherwise relatively featureless.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In order to see how the Patterson function can be used to locate some of the atoms, we note some of the properties of the Patterson function, which follow from its definition.</p>
<p class="alphahang_11">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Every atom forms a pair, and hence a vector, with every other atom, including with itself. So a unit cell containing <i>n</i> atoms gives <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> vectors. Of these, the <i>n</i> self-vectors (each atom to itself) have zero length and all coincide at the origin (0, 0, 0). This is always the largest peak in any Patterson map. There are <i>n<sup>2</sup> &#x2013; n</i> other peaks.</p>
<p class="alphahang_11">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>The vector between atom A and atom B is exactly equal and opposite to the vector between atom B and atom A. This means that a Patterson map always has an inversion centre, even if the crystal structure itself does not.</p>
<p class="alphahang_11">(c)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Patterson peaks have a similar shape to electron density peaks, but are about twice as broad.</p>
<p class="alphahang_11">(d)<span class="space">&#160;</span>As a consequence of points (a) and (c), there is usually considerable overlap of peaks, and not all will be resolved as separate identifiable maxima.</p>
<p class="indent">For these reasons, Patterson maps usually show large featureless regions of overlapped broad peaks, with significant peaks due to vectors involving &#x2018;heavy atoms&#x2019;. If a structure contains only a few heavy atoms among a lot of lighter atoms, the Patterson map will show a small number of large peaks standing out clearly above the general background level.</p>
<p class="indent">In such cases it is usually possible to find a self-consistent set of atomic positions for the heavy atoms which explain the large Patterson peaks. Vectors between symmetry-related heavy atoms often lie in special positions, with some coordinates equal to 0 or <img src="../images/in3_11.jpg" alt="images"/>, for example, and are easily recognized. Examples are given in the next chapter. Solving a Patterson map is rather like a mathematical brain-teaser puzzle.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the heaviest atoms have been found, the rest are located as shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.9">section 2.9</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec2.8.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Patterson search methods</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even for structures without particularly heavy atoms, the Patterson synthesis can provide a solution method in some cases. If a significant proportion of the molecule has a known shape, then a group of vectors generated internally by these atoms can be calculated. Such a pattern occurs in the Patterson map, but its orientation is unknown and it is mixed up with other vectors involving the rest of the molecule and vectors between atoms in different molecules. It may be possible to match the pattern by computer search and hence find the correct orientation of the known fragment. Further computer analysis of possible intermolecular vectors then gives proposed positions for the fragment. Steroids, with a relatively rigid and predictable tetracyclic nucleus, are good examples of suitable materials for this approach (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>). <i>Direct methods</i> are, however, much more commonly used for &#x2018;equal atom&#x2019; structures.</p>

<section id="sec2.8.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Direct methods</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">This is a general name given to methods which seek to obtain approximate reflection phases from the measured intensities with no other information available.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Such a description of the situation is, however, misleading. There is other information available to help us find the missing phases, in the nature of the electron density we are trying to determine.</p>
<p class="indent">The electron density is the Fourier transform of the diffraction pattern. This means we add together a set of waves in order to produce the electron density distribution. Each wave has half its value positive and half negative (alternate &#x2018;crests&#x2019; and &#x2018;troughs&#x2019;: see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>), except for <i>F</i>(000), which is constant and positive. The electron density, however, is everywhere positive or zero; it can have no negative regions. Furthermore, it is concentrated into certain compact regions (atoms; see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>). So the waves must be added together in such a way as to build up and concentrate positive regions and cancel out negative regions. This puts considerable restrictions on the relationships among the phases of different reflections, especially the most intense ones, which contribute most to the sum.</p>
<p class="indent">Since large numbers of reflections are involved in the complete Fourier transform, individual phase relationships are not certainties, but have to be expressed in terms of probabilities, and the probabilities depend on the relative intensities.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct methods involve selecting the most important reflections (those which contribute most to the Fourier transform), working out the probable relationships among their phases, then trying different possible phases to see how well the probability relationships are satisfied. For the most promising combinations (assessed by various numerical measures), Fourier transforms are calculated from the observed amplitudes and trial phases, and are examined for recognizable molecular features.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years, various methods of more or less sophistication have been developed for the steps involved. They can be regarded most simply as a sort of inspired trial-and-error method, in which it is usually necessary to try many different sets of phases and use the relationships themselves to &#x2018;refine&#x2019; or improve them. Direct methods involve a considerable amount of computing, and are treated as a &#x2018;black box&#x2019; even by many of their regular users. When they are successful, they usually locate most or all of the non-hydrogen atoms in a structure. Examples are given in the next chapter, and an illustration in one dimension is shown below.</p>

</section>
<section id="sec2.8.4" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Other methods</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">Almost all &#x2018;small molecule&#x2019; crystal structures these days are solved by either Patterson or direct methods. Lack of space precludes a discussion of other methods used for macromolecular structures, which rarely contain heavy atoms with a high proportion of the total electron density, and for which the very large number of reflections and hence of phase relationships makes conventional direct methods less reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">A partial solution for some small molecule structures can be found from considerations of symmetry. For example, if a molecule which could reasonably have a centrosymmetric geometry crystallizes in the triclinic system with one molecule per unit cell, then the centre of the molecule probably coincides with a crystallographic inversion centre in space group <img src="../images/in4_11.jpg" alt="images"/> (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a>). Such a situation is frequently found for metal complexes, and the metal atom is thereby located at a special position. If the metal has sufficient electrons to be classed as a heavy atom, it can be used, as shown in the next section, to find the rest of the atoms; no Patterson map or direct methods calculation is necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be noted that there is no &#x2018;correct&#x2019; method for solving a particular structure. Once the right solution has been found, by whatever method, it can be further refined (see below); the method of solution is no longer important. If one method does not work, it is perfectly valid to try others, with all the available variations, until one is successful. The objective is to beat the &#x2018;phase problem&#x2019;; exactly how this is done does not really matter.</p>

<p class="noindent">At each chosen value of <i>z</i>, there are 19 terms to add together. The task is further simplified by the fact that the structure is centrosymmetric (this simplification for centrosymmetric structures applies also in three dimensions). In such cases the phases of reflections can only take one of two special values, 0 and 180&#x00B0; (or 0 and <i>&#x03C0;</i> radians), and the term exp(<i>i&#x03D5;</i>) becomes equal to cos(<i>&#x03D5;</i>); this is simply +1 for <i>&#x03D5;</i> = 0, and &#x2013;1 for <i>&#x03D5;</i> = 180&#x00B0;, and the mystery of the unknown phase narrows down to a straight choice between completely in phase and completely out of phase for each individual reflection. This is the same as having to choose whether each amplitude is added or subtracted to make up the total sum. This still leaves us with a two-way choice 19 times over, giving 524 288 possible combinations! This is clearly too much for a blind trial-and-error approach.</p>

<p class="noindent">For the one-dimensional case, this summation process can be shown graphically. The contributions of each of the 19 reflection amplitudes to each point across the range of <i>z</i> from 0 to 1 are shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.16">Fig. 2.16</a>. The contributions are all shown on the same scale, and with all the unknown signs (corresponding to the unknown phases) set as positive. The cosine term in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq2.3">equation 2.3</a> means that reflections with a low value of the index <i>l</i> make a contribution to the electron density which varies only slowly across the unit cell; reflections with a high value of <i>l</i> contribute much more finely, with more maxima and minima across the range. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.17">Figure 2.17</a> shows the result of adding up these 19 contributions with different combinations of signs (phases). The top result comes from arbitrarily chosen signs; it does not look like a promising solution for the electron density, particularly with some deep minima. The second result comes from the correct signs (as provided by a forward Fourier transform calculation from the final known structure; these correct signs are given in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>); it shows large maxima for two symmetry-related bromine atoms (two molecules per unit cell) and smaller maxima, approximately regularly spaced, most of which correspond to pairs of carbon atoms, these overlapping in projection along the axis. The positions of the atoms, particularly the large bromine atoms, are correctly given: the final refined <i>z</i> coordinates for bromine are very close to 0.1 and 0.9.</p>
<p class="indent">To illustrate the principles of direct methods, concentrate on the largest amplitudes; clearly these contribute most to the summations, and incorrect signs for the smaller amplitudes will not greatly affect the result. The correct signs for reflections 4 and 5 (using the <i>l</i> indices to label them) are both negative. This means they should both be turned upside down before being added into the sum. Together they then contribute a considerable positive</p>

Reflection 9 is also quite strong, and the positions of its crests and troughs are related to those of reflections 4 and 5, simply because 4 + 5 = 9. If reflection 9 is to reinforce the positive build-up of electron density provided by the inverted reflections 4 and 5, rather than partially cancelling it, it must have a crest roughly coinciding with the first troughs of those reflections as they are shown in the figure, so its sign must be</p>

<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:8.8em;">It is not actually the strongest reflections absolutely which are most important, but those reflections which are relatively strong for their Bragg angle; because intensities always decrease at higher angle, a high-angle reflection which is weak compared with low-angle reflections but strong compared with other high-angle reflections is an important contributor to the electron density calculation. For this reason, direct methods use <i>normalized structure amplitudes</i>, more commonly known as <i>E values</i>, instead of the basic amplitudes (F <i>values)</i> themselves; normalization is a calculation which effectively compensates for the <i>&#x03B8;</i>-dependent decrease in intensity within a data set.</p>

<p class="noindent">The probability that such a relationship among the phases of reflections with related indices is true increases with their amplitudes. In this particular example, if we take all the reflections with amplitudes greater than 80, there are 11 of these relatively strong reflections and 19 relationships of this kind which involve only these reflections. All 19 relationships are, in fact, obeyed [for example, reflection 6 is negative, reflection 9 is positive, and reflection 15 is negative: (&#x2013;1) x (+1) = (&#x2013;1)]; <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#tab2.2">Table 2.2</a> gives them all. In general, for three-dimensional structures, because these relationships are probabilities rather than certainties, some of the indications will be wrong, and for some reflections participating in several relationships contrary indications may be found, so an overall balance of the various indications has to be taken.</p>

</figure>
<p class="tablecaption-left-60">For each relationship the / indices of the three reflections are given by one entry in the table body together with the corresponding number at the head of the column and the number at the left-hand end of the row; an underlined index represents a negative reflection amplitude (for example, reflection 6 has a negative amplitude, but reflection 9 has a positive amplitude).</p>
<p class="indent">In direct methods as commonly applied, the strongest reflections are chosen and all the phase relationships among them are generated. Then various possible combinations of phases are tried, either by assigning values to a few reflections and using the probability relationships to generate others, or by assigning random phases to all the reflections and using the relationships to improve them so that they fit the relationships better. The combination of phases giving the best agreement with the expected relationships is then used, together with the observed amplitudes, in a reverse Fourier transformation to calculate an electron density map, and this is examined for recognizable molecular features. In typical cases a few tens of initial phase sets are tried and <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Chapter 2 The method step by step</a> several of these are likely to lead to a recognizable correct structure showing most or all of the non-hydrogen atoms. In more difficult cases, many hundreds or thousands of attempts may be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">The third result in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.17">Fig. 2.17</a> comes from taking all the reflections as positive, i.e. all phases set at zero; the 19 curves of <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.16">Fig. 2.16</a> are simply added together as they are. Since all the curves have a crest at <i>z</i> = 0 and at <i>z</i> = 1, very large maxima are generated at these points. This is just like a onedimensional Patterson synthesis, except that |<i>F</i>| values have been used instead of <i>F</i><sup>2</sup> values. The corresponding result using <i>F</i><sup>2</sup> and zero phases looks very much like the third curve except that the maxima and minima are more exaggerated. The large maximum at the origin is a feature of all Patterson syntheses, corresponding to the superposition of the self-vectors of all atoms in the structure. The next largest maximum in this curve (together with its symmetry equivalent) corresponds to a vector between the two bromine atoms in the unit cell; its <i>z</i> coordinate is twice the <i>z</i> coordinate for one bromine atom, because the two symmetry-equivalent bromine atoms are at +<i>z</i> and &#x2013;<i>z</i>, and the difference between these is (+<i>z</i>) &#x2013; (&#x2013;<i>z</i>) = 2<i>z</i>. Hence the bromine atom in the molecule can be located simply by inspection of this Patterson synthesis, without the knowledge or guessing of any phases at all. Location of the remaining atoms then follows in the next stage (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.9">section 2.9</a>). The solution of a Patterson synthesis in order to find one unique heavy atom in a structure (together with its symmetry equivalents) often involves no arithmetic more difficult than dividing by 2. Further examples are given in Chapter 3.</p>

<p class="noindent">If the initial structure solution has revealed positions for all the atoms (except for hydrogen atoms, which have very little electron density and are not usually found until later, if at all), this next step is unnecessary. Often, however, particularly from analysis of a Patterson map, only a partial structure has been obtained: some atom positions are known, but not all. This partial structure serves as our initial model or trial structure.</p>

<p class="indent">If the atoms of the model structure are approximately in the right positions, there should be at least some degree of resemblance between the calculated diffraction pattern and the observed one, i.e. between the sets of |<i>F</i><sub>c</sub>| and |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| values.

<p class="noindent">To illustrate the bootstrap procedure we take a structure which has most of the atoms lying in one plane, because the gradual development of the structure is clearly seen by successive calculations of the electron density in this plane. The compound is [PhSNSNSNSPh]<sup>+</sup>[AsF6]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>). The complete cation, together with arsenic and two flourine atoms of the anion, lie on a mirror plane perpendicular to the <i>b</i> axis in an orthorhombic space group, so all their <i>y</i> coordinates are equal. The position of the arsenic atom within this plane can be found by inspection of the Patterson synthesis, part of which was shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a> (As has 34 electrons, S 16, F 9, N 7 and C 6, so vectors between symmetry-equivalent arsenic atoms stand out clearly).</p>
<p class="indent">Calculation of the diffraction pattern corresponding to the arsenic atom alone (and its equivalent atoms according to the space group symmetry), by the forward Fourier transform equation (2.5), gives a set of calculated amplitudes and phases for this very crude initial model structure; at this stage the value of <i>R</i> is 0.604, so the agreement between the observed and calculated amplitudes is not very good. The calculated phases are also far from perfect (the structure is centrosymmetric, so each phase must be either 0 or 180&#x00B0;, and any particular calculated phase is either completely right or completely wrong), but there are enough correct phases for the reverse Fourier transform, calculated from these phases and the observed amplitudes (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq2.9">equation 2.9</a>), to show not only the known arsenic atom, but also four clear peaks for the four sulfur atoms (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>(a)). Inclusion of these in the model structure leads to a calculated diffraction pattern in better agreement with the observed amplitudes: <i>R</i> is reduced to 0.364, the calculated phases are more nearly correct, and the next electron density map (reverse Fourier transform) shows all the N, C and F atoms (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>(b)); four of the F atoms are not seen in this figure, because they lie out of the plane shown, but peaks are found for them in the correct positions above and below the plane. With all the non-hydrogen atoms included, <i>R</i> drops to 0.036 after refinement (see below), and an electron density map shows well resolved and clear peaks for all the atoms (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>(c)). The largest peaks in a difference electron density map (calculated from |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| &#x2013; |<i>F</i><sub>c</sub>| instead of from |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>|) are in the positions expected for the hydrogen atoms (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>(d)), and incorporation of these into the model structure leads to a final <i>R</i> of 0.027, and a very precise structure.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once all the non-hydrogen atoms have been found, the model structure needs to be <i>refined.</i> This means varying the numerical parameters describing the structure to produce the &#x2018;best&#x2019; agreement between the diffraction pattern calculated from it by a Fourier transform and the observed diffraction pattern. Since there are no observed phases, the comparison of observed and calculated diffraction patterns is made entirely on their amplitudes |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| and |<i>F</i><sub>C</sub>|. Changing any of the structural parameters (modifying the model structure in any way) affects the |<i>F</i><sub>C</sub>| values, while the |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| values remain fixed during the process.</p>
<p class="indent">The refinement process uses a well-established mathematical procedure called <i>least-squares</i> analysis, which defines the &#x2018;best fit&#x2019; of two sets of data (here |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| and |<i>F</i><sub>C</sub>|) to be that which minimizes one of the least-squares sums</p>

<p class="noindent">The first of these (refinement on <i>F</i>) has historically been most commonly used, but the second (refinement on <i>F</i><sup>2</sup>) is now increasing in popularity and is, in many ways, superior. The contribution of each reflection to the sum is weighted according to its perceived reliability, usually with weights based on the experimental s.u.&#x2019;s, such as <img src="../images/in1_11.jpg" alt="images"/> for refinement on <i>F</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">The least-squares refinement of crystal structures is similar, in principle, to finding a &#x2018;best-fit&#x2019; straight line through a set of points on a graph, but is more complicated because (i) there are many variable parameters instead of just two (the gradient and intercept) for a straight line graph and (ii) the equation relating data to parameters (the Fourier transform) is far from linear. Because of the non-linearity, an approximate solution (the model structure) must be known before refinement can begin, and each least-squares calculation is approximate, not exact, giving an improvement to the model, but not the best possible fit; the calculation must be repeated several times until eventually the changes in the parameters are insignificant.</p>
<p class="indent">What are the numerical parameters to be refined? They are, for the most part, the terms describing the positions and vibrations of the atoms in the Fourier transform equation (1.17). For each atom there are three positional coordinates <i>x</i>, <i>y, z</i> and a displacement parameter <i>U</i>, which can be interpreted as an <i>isotropic mean-square amplitude of vibration</i> (in &#x00C5;<sup>2</sup>) of the atom. In most experiments a significantly better fit to the data can be achieved by using more than one displacement parameter per atom in the model structure, allowing each atom to vibrate by different amounts in different directions <i>(anisotropic vibration).</i> The usual mathematical treatment has six <i>U</i> values (one for each axis and three cross-terms) for each atom in order to give different vibration amplitudes in three orthogonal directions which are, in general, not along the unit cell axes (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>). Thus, there are commonly nine refined parameters for each independent atom (atoms which are not related to each other by symmetry) in the structure. In addition, a scale factor has to be refined, which puts the |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| and |<i>F</i><sub>c</sub>| values on the same scale (the |<i>F</i><sub>o</sub>| scale is arbitrary at the time of measurement, but |<i>F</i><sub>c</sub>| values are calculated relative to the scattering power of one electron). There may be a small number of other refined correction factors, but these are not important for a basic understanding of the procedure.</p>

<p class="indent">Although there are many parameters to be refined for all but the smallest structures, the diffraction experiment usually provides an even greater number of observed data, unless X-ray scattering is unusually weak. Typically, the</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">As a rough rule of thumb, around 100 data per non-hydrogen atom in the asymmetric unit should be ample.</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:6em;">The <i>goodness of fit</i> is another standard statistical parameter, intended to show how well the calculated diffraction pattern corresponding to the model structure agrees with the observed diffraction pattern. For an ideal agreement and a correct weighting scheme, the goodness of fit should have avalu&#x00E9; of unity; considerable variation is observed in practice.</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:12em;"><i>Constraints</i> are conditions which are imposed on the refinement, for example by requiring certain parameters to have particular values rather than being free to take values which give the best agreement between observed and calculated diffraction patterns. Constraints may be imposed for various reasons, including the requirements of symmetry or the need to control parameters which are poorly defined by the diffraction data.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">data/parameter ratio exceeds 6, and it may be as high as 20. The structure refinement problem is said to be &#x2018;over-determined&#x2019;, and this is essential in order to produce precise (reliable) parameters. As well as providing a value for each refined parameter, the least-squares process also gives a standard uncertainty. These parameter s.u.&#x2019;s depend on the s.u.&#x2019;s of the data (a good structure requires good data!), on the extent of agreement of the observed and calculated data (a lower least-squares sum gives lower parameter s.u.&#x2019;s; another function closely related to this sum is called the <i>goodness of fit)</i>, and on the excess of data over parameters (a greater excess gives lower parameter s.u.&#x2019;s). Both the quality and the quantity of measured data matter for the quality (reliability) of the structure derived from them.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the model structure has been refined with anisotropic displacement parameters for the atoms, it is often possible to see small but significant difference electron density peaks in positions close to those expected for hydrogen atoms, particularly if there are few or no heavy atoms in the structure. Hydrogen atoms are more likely to be located from measurements taken at low temperature, because this reduces the vibration of the atoms and sharpens the electron density peaks. It is possible to include the hydrogen atoms in the refinement, and this may improve the fit slightly, but their parameters usually have large s.u.&#x2019;s because their low electron density means they contribute only weakly to the diffraction of X-rays, so the measured intensities are relatively insensitive to the hydrogen atom parameters. In most cases, refinement is more successful if <i>constraints</i> are applied to hydrogen atom parameters, e.g. by keeping their bond lengths fixed and by tying their <i>U</i> values to those of the atoms to which they are attached. Details of how this is done vary enormously with different computer programs and with the habits and preferences of different crystallographers; some examples can be seen in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The refinement stage usually involves the vast majority of the computing resources used in a crystal structure determination, simply because the calculations are many and very repetitive. Compared with finding the atoms initially, it is generally a much less interesting process, but its correct execution is very important, since it delivers the final parameters describing the structure.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of refinement, a difference electron density map should contain no significant features (peaks or holes). This calculation is usually performed as an extra check on the validity of the refined model structure. Typically, a final map with no features outside the range &#x00B1;1 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> is accepted as one evidence of a satisfactory structure determination.</p>

<p class="noindent">What in fact are the results of a crystal structure determination? Returning to the microscope analogy, the application of the reverse Fourier transform equation to the observed diffraction pattern (but using calculated rather than genuinely observed phases!) gives an electron density map, an image of the X-ray scattering power of the crystal sample. It is, however, rare for the results to be presented in this way. Instead, the structure is represented as atoms (positioned at the centres of peaks of electron density) joined together by chemical bonds, and these atoms are described numerically by the refined parameters of the model structure.</p>

Since these are all interpretative models, not direct observations (unlike what is seen through a standard optical microscope), a wide variety of styles of representation is possible, the traditional <i>ball-and-stick</i> model being the most commonly used. It is also possible, of course, to construct accurately scaled three-dimensional models of structures from the atomic coordinates, though this is likely to be very time-consuming!
