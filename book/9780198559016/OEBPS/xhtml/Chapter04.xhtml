<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Disorder and twinning</h2>
<p class="noindent">Case studies 3, 6 and 7 included structural <i>disorder.</i> This is a random (not systematic) variation in the detailed contents of the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. For an ideal structure, all asymmetric units are exactly equivalent under the space group symmetry, and all unit cells are identical. Instantaneously, of course, this is never true, as each atom is undergoing vibration and these movements are not usually correlated throughout the structure, but this effect is dealt with by the atomic displacement parameters, giving equivalence on a time-averaged basis. Large amplitudes of vibration are sometimes referred to as <i>dynamic disorder</i>, and they are reduced by cooling the sample in low-temperature data collection.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Static disorder</i> consists of alternative positions for atoms or groups of atoms. If it is truly random, then what X-ray diffraction sees is the average asymmetric unit. This appears in the model structure as partially occupied atom sites.</p>
<p class="indent">A commonly observed example is a methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) or trifluoromethyl (CF<sub>3</sub>) group attached to an aromatic ring, as in a toluene solvent molecule or a tolyl substituent. There is no single preferred torsional orientation of the methyl group, and the energy barrier to rotation about the C&#x2014;C bond is relatively low. In some structures, a difference electron density map will show three clear positions for the hydrogen or fluorine atoms, because the CH<sub>3</sub> or CF<sub>3</sub> group is held in one preferred orientation by neighbouring atoms in the same or another molecule. In others, six positions are found (with lower peak heights), corresponding to two alternative orientations with comparable energies, because the intermolecular interactions are weaker, and each molecule in the structure adopts one of the two possibilities at random, with no regard for the orientation adopted in neighbouring asymmetric units (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other commonly observed disorder patterns are for conformationally flexible groups of atoms, such as long alkyl chains (as in case study 6), non-planar five-membered rings (tetrahydrofuran, thf, is notorious in this respect), counter-ions of high symmetry which are only loosely held in place with no strong intermolecular interactions (particularly <img src="../images/in42_1.jpg" alt="images"/>, <img src="../images/in42_2.jpg" alt="images"/> and <img src="../images/in42_3.jpg" alt="images"/> anions), and small solvent molecules not anchored by hydrogen bonding or other significant interactions (such as toluene, acetone and dichloromethane). <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.2">Figure 4.2</a><span class="space">&#160;</span>shows some typical cases.</p>
<p class="indent">Where the disordered atom sites are well resolved, so that individual electron density peaks can be seen, refinement is usually straightforward.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">When disordered atom sites are closer together than normal bonding distances, special techniques are often required, in which the expected molecular geometry is used as data in the refinement alongside the diffraction pattern intensities. These techniques are called <i>constraints</i> and <i>restraints</i>, and they are particularly important in cases of high disorder.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-3.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Examples of <i>constraints</i> and <i>restraints</i> are given in the previous chapter.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Very often, the disordered part of a crystal structure is not of particular interest, and the fact that this portion is less well determined is not important. Unfortunately, however, disorder in any part of the structure affects the reliability with which the whole structure can be determined. This is because the whole structure generally contributes to the whole diffraction pattern in the experiment, and the whole diffraction pattern contributes to the whole structure in the subsequent calculations; this is the nature of Fourier transforms. The effect can be seen in two particular ways.</p>
<p class="indent">First, except in the simplest cases, disorder can be difficult to incorporate in the model structure which is refined, especially when some alternative atom sites lie close together or when there are multiple disorder sites. A less than ideal model structure makes it more difficult to match the calculated and observed diffraction patterns and so leads to higher uncertainties in all the refined parameters than there would be for a fully ordered structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, static disorder represents a spreading out of electron density from ideal ordered positions, and this, like atomic vibrations, increases interference effects and hence reduces diffracted intensities, particularly at higher Bragg angles (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.6">section 1.6</a>). Badly disordered structures give diffraction patterns in which the intensities fall off rapidly at higher angles; a lower proportion of reflections will be of significant intensity than for an ordered structure of <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, chapter 4 Further topics</a> similar scattering power. A shortage of high-angle data with significant intensity leads inevitably to a structure with lower precision, not only because there are fewer data. Inspection of the Bragg equation (1.3 and 1.4) shows that kigh scattering angle corresponds to small <i>d</i>-spacings, i.e. the <i>resolution</i> of closely spaced features in the structure. The maximum Bragg angle for which data are measured dictates the effective minimum resolution to which the structure can be determined. The effect of omitting higher-angle data is illustrated in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>, where electron density maps have been calculated from all data with <i>&#x03B8;</i> &#x003C; 25&#x00B0; (<i>d</i> &#x003E; 0.84 &#x00C5;) and from the data with <i>&#x03B8;</i> &#x003C; 15&#x00B0; (<i>d</i> &#x003E; 1.37 &#x00C5;). With the lower resolution data only, it is much more difficult to distinguish the individual lighter atoms.</p>

<p class="indent">High disorder particularly affects crystal structures of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, which incorporate large amounts of disordered solvent water in the substantial spaces between molecules. The diffraction intensities are also weak because of the large size of the molecules. As a consequence, usually only relatively low-angle intensities are observed, and atomic resolution is rarely achieved; in many cases, resolution is limited to 2 &#x00C5;, 3 &#x00C5; or even worse. Similar, though less serious, problems can affect some large non-biological structures in developing research areas such as supramolecular chemistry. Low-temperature data collection and the use of synchrotron radiation are both important as means of maximizing intensities and crystal stability.</p>
<p class="indent">Another departure from ideal structures which can seriously hinder a crystal structure determination is the phenomenon of <i>twinning.</i> A twinned crystal is one in which two (or more) orientations or mirror images of the same structure occur together in a well-defined relationship to each other. It tends to occur when there are fortuitous rational relationships among the unit cell parameters, such as for a monoclinic structure with the angle <i>&#x03B2;</i> close to 90&#x00B0;, or with similar values for the <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> axis lengths. Twinning then results from &#x2018;mistakes&#x2019; in putting the unit cells together to form the complete crystal during its growth, because they can fit almost equally well two different ways round.</p>
<p class="indent">A twinned crystal gives a diffraction pattern which is the superposition of the diffraction patterns of the two (or more) individual component parts of the <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, chapter 4 Further topics</a> crystal. In some cases, the two diffraction patterns have reflections which coincide exactly, each measured intensity then being the sum of two different but related reflections. In other cases, the presence of two diffraction patterns can be recognized from the outset, because they are not exactly superimposed. Whatever the precise nature of the twin relationship, if it can be worked out from the observed diffraction pattern, then there are methods for solving and refining the structure, though it is more complicated than for a normal untwinned structure.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-0.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">More generally, for any non-centrosymmetric structure together with its inverse form; chiral structures are a subset of non-centrosymmetric structures.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A common case of twinning which is easily dealt with occurs when a chiral structure grows together with its opposite enantiomer in a single crystal. This can easily happen if both forms of the material are present together in solution, because the unit cell shape is identical for both enantiomers, a crystal lattice always being centrosymmetric even if the overall structure is not (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.3">section 1.3</a>). The reflections which exactly overlap in this case are pairs of <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> and &#x2013;<i>h</i>, &#x2013;<i>k</i>, &#x2013;<i>l</i>. An attempt to determine the absolute configuration by refinement of a special parameter (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.3">section 3.3</a>) will reveal this twinning. For one pure chiral form, the absolute structure parameter should refine to a value of 0 with a small standard uncertainty (s.u.), if the effects of anomalous scattering are significant; if the data actually correspond to the opposite chiral form from that of the model structure, the parameter should be 1 with a small s.u. An intermediate value, around 0.5 with a small s.u., indicates <i>racemic twinning.</i> A large s.u. is obtained if the anomalous dispersion effects are not sufficient to provide reliable information on the absolute structure.</p>

<p class="noindent">X-rays are used for crystal structure determination because they have wavelengths comparable to the separations between atoms in molecules, and so they give measurable diffraction effects from crystals. Any other radiation with a similar wavelength would, in principle, serve the same purpose. Of course, there are no other forms of electromagnetic radiation with the same wavelengths as X-rays, by definition.</p>

<p class="noindent">an object of mass <i>m</i> moving with velocity <i>v</i> and momentum <i>p</i> = <i>mv</i> has an associated wavelength and can display corresponding wave properties. For neutrons generated by a nuclear reactor, the associated wavelengths lie in the same range as X-rays, so a beam of neutrons can be diffracted by crystalline material.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of neutrons for diffraction is experimentally much more difficult and expensive than the use of a conventional laboratory X-ray tube and, in most cases, diffracted intensities are considerably weaker, so there is no point in it unless it offers some significant advantages over X-ray diffraction. For most structure determinations this is not the case, and X-ray diffraction is much more widely used. There are, however, circumstances in which neutrons provide clear advantages, arising from the different ways in which neutrons and X-rays interact with matter as they pass through it.</p>
<p class="indent">X-rays, as we have seen, are scattered by the electrons of atoms; an X-ray diffraction experiment shows the electron density distribution within the unit <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, chapter 4 Further topics</a>cell of a crystal. This electron density distribution is usually interpreted in terms of atomic positions, and leads to molecular geometry. Since the electron density of each atom is generally distributed approximately symmetrically about the nucleus, this interpretation is valid, but in reality there are deviations from spherical symmetry, caused by chemical bonding and other valence effects. The effect is particularly marked for hydrogen atoms, which are consistently located too close to their bonded atoms by X-ray diffraction (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>).</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Neutrons, by contrast, interact insignificantly with the electron density when they pass through a crystalline solid. Scattering is instead by the nuclei. Since both nuclei and neutrons are extremely small, significant scattering takes place only when a neutron passes close to a nucleus, and on average the total intensity of diffraction of neutrons by a crystal is low compared with that of X-rays. The relatively weak scattering means that larger crystals are preferred for neutron diffraction, and it may not be easy to grow them. On the other hand, neutron scattering by a stationary atom does not fall off at higher angle like that of X-rays (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>); lower intensities at higher angles are due entirely to atomic vibrations.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the scattering power of an atom for X-rays is directly proportional to its atomic number (the number of electrons in the neutral atom), there is no simple relationship between neutron scattering power and atomic number. Neutron scattering powers vary erratically across the periodic table, often with large differences between adjacent elements, and heavier elements do not dominate lighter ones as they do with X-rays; even different isotopes of the same element have different neutron scattering powers. A selection of relative scattering powers for X-rays and neutrons is given in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">It can be seen that some nuclei scatter in phase (positive scattering factors), while others scatter out of phase (negative scattering factors). Note that different isotopes of the same element may have quite different neutron scattering powers; this is particularly so for the isotopes of hydrogen, H and D. Elements (isotopes) with very small scattering powers, such as V, are effectively almost invisible to neutrons. Among common elements, H (D even more so) and N are particularly good neutron scatterers.</p>
<a id="page_75" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 75, chapter 4 Further topics</a>
<p class="indent">There are several important consequences of this difference in the nature of X-ray and neutron scattering, which make neutron diffraction a useful tool in particular cases.</p>
<p class="indent">Compared with X-rays, neutrons are generally good at locating light atoms in the presence of much heavier atoms, though this depends very much on the particular elements involved. In particular, the precise location of first-row atoms such as C, N, O in structures containing several very heavy atoms such as W, Re, U is likely to be more successful with neutron diffraction, though an X-ray result is perfectly adequate in most cases (see, for example, case study 6) unless small differences in light-atom bond lengths are to be detected.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The distinction between precision and accuracy is important. <i>Precision</i> refers to the spread of results obtained if a measurement is repeated many times; it measures repeatability or the degree of confidence with which a particular measurement can be made, and it is measured by statistical parameters such as s. u.&#x2019;s. <i>Accuracy</i> refers to the agreement of the measurement with the true value. Thus, a result can be precise but not accurate (like a wrongly set digital watch), and it can be accurate but not precise.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An extreme case is, of course, the location of hydrogen atoms, for which neutron diffraction is far superior to X-ray diffraction, especially for deuterated compounds. Not only is the neutron result more <i>precise</i>, because H/D atoms scatter relatively strongly, it is also more <i>accurate</i>, because it locates the nuclei directly rather than the electron density distorted by valence effects. For studies in which <i>precise</i> and <i>accurate</i> hydrogen atom location is important, neutron diffraction is the method of choice. Examples include hydride (H<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) ligands in transition metal complexes, bridging hydrogen atoms in electron-deficient compounds such as boranes, and hydrogen bonding. In the majority of structures, however, hydrogen atom positions are entirely predictable and neutron diffraction is not justified.</p>
<p class="indent">Neutron diffraction can clearly distinguish many pairs of neighbouring elements in the periodic table, which have almost the same X-ray scattering power. This may be of value in some compounds such as mixed-metal complexes (e.g. containing both W and Re, which have 74 and 75 electrons, respectively, but quite different neutron scattering powers), alloys (where metal atoms may be ordered or disordered) and minerals.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Under certain circumstances, significant differences between the X-ray scattering factors of neighbouring elements can be generated by choosing a wavelength which gives a large anomalous scattering effect for one of them and a small effect for the other. This requires tuneable X-ray wavelengths, which can be achieved with synchrotron radiation but not with standard laboratory sources.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Distinguishing between isotopes of the same element is impossible with X-ray diffraction but, in many cases, straightforward with neutrons, provided the isotopes are not disordered in the structure. A case in point is the determination of the H and D sites in a partially deuterated compound, which may help, for example, in establishing a reaction mechanism by unambiguously identifying the isotopic substitution in the product.</p>
<p class="indent">There are more advanced types of experiment, in which both X-rays and neutrons are used to study the same structure. Since neutrons locate nuclei, from which core electron density can be calculated, and X-rays reveal the total electron density distribution, the combination provides a means of mapping valence electrons and bonding effects. Such studies require extremely careful measurements and corrections, since the valence effects are small compared with the total electron density, and they lie beyond the scope of this book.</p>

<p class="noindent">A single crystal gives a diffraction pattern (with either X-rays or neutrons) with discrete diffracted beams, each in a definite direction relative to the orientation of the crystal and the incident beam, according to the Bragg equation. Because the diffraction conditions are severe, a stationary single crystal gives very few reflections (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">section 2.3</a>). In order to generate the complete diffraction pattern it is necessary to rotate the crystal in the X-ray or neutron beam.</p>

<p class="aside">Even individual tiny crystals which can be seen only under a microscope, such as constitute a fine powder, are still effectively infinite in size compared with the wavelength of X-rays, so each one acts as a single crystal.

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If several single crystals of the same material in different orientations are irradiated simultaneously by X-rays, each of them gives its own diffraction pattern and these are superimposed. As the composite sample is rotated, any particular reflection will be generated by each of the individual crystals at different times as the Bragg equation is satisfied; the Bragg angle and intensity will be the same in each case (assuming equal sizes of crystals), but the direction of the diffracted beam will vary, while always being inclined at 2<i>&#x03B8;</i> to the straight-through direction (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>). On a flat detector perpendicular to the incident beam and on the opposite side of the sample, this set of corresponding reflections from the multiple crystals appear as identical spots on a circle. With an increasing number of identical and randomly oriented crystals, more such spots appear, all lying on the same circle, which is where a cone of diffracted radiation hits the detector. A microcrystalline powder consists of an essentially infinite number of tiny crystals and this produces a complete circle for a particular reflection.</p>
<p class="indent">The same occurs for every Bragg reflection, each one giving a cone of radiation with semi-angle 2<i>&#x03B8;</i> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>), and hence producing a circle on the detector. The overall result is a set of many concentric circles, with radii dictated by the Bragg equation and hence the unit cell geometry, and with intensities closely related to those that would be produced by one single crystal.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, a powder diffraction pattern is usually measured either on a strip of photographic film wrapped round the sample in a cylindrical shape (a <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, chapter 4 Further topics</a> powder camera), in order to reach high Bragg angles (with <i>&#x03B8;</i> approaching 90&#x00B0;, the diffracted beam is almost doubled back on the incident beam), or by an electronic detector which is driven in a circle around the sample under computer control (a powder diffractometer). In either case, intensity is recorded as a function of angle, and for each reflection a Bragg angle and an intensity can be obtained. The effect of using a microcrystalline powder instead of a single crystal is to compress the full three-dimensional diffraction pattern into a one-dimensional pattern (the only geometrical variable is <i>&#x03B8;</i>). It is also possible to use a position-sensitive detector (either an area detector, or one which is one-dimensional rather than two-dimensional in form) to record powder diffraction patterns quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="indent">For relatively simple structures, giving few reflections, there may be little overlap of these in the powder diffraction pattern. In such cases it is possible to assign individual indices and intensities and carry out structure determination as with single crystals. Even for larger structures, where this is not possible, powder diffraction has important uses, in chemical analysis and for the identification of materials, which is its most common application. A full treatment is given in the Oxford Chemistry Primer on <i>Inorganic Materials Chemistry</i> by M. T. Weller. The primary purpose of this brief treatment is to illustrate the relationship between single-crystal and powder diffraction techniques, both of which can be carried out with laboratory X-rays, synchrotron radiation or neutrons.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>4.4 Electronic aspects of crystallographic results</h2>
<p class="noindent">A crystal structure determination yields as its results the unit cell geometry and symmetry, and the positions and displacement (vibration) parameters of all the atoms it contains. From these the intramolecular and intermolecular geometry can be calculated, and graphical representations can be produced. All the results, together with the diffraction data from which they are derived, are held electronically in computer files.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of computers does not end with the successful completion of a structure refinement. One important further step is the safe storage of the results on computer-readable backup media such as magnetic tapes, for archiving and possible future access.</p>
<p class="indent">Computers also play an important role in the publication of structural results in the research literature. Not only are manuscripts prepared with computer word-processors, as in research generally, but there is a growing use of electronic transmission of results from researchers and authors to publishers, via electronic mail and other network services. In this subject, such developments are very much assisted by the well defined nature of the structural results and widespread acceptance of particular standards and formats for them. Recent years have seen the introduction of the so-called <i>Crystallographic Information File</i> (CIF), which has been devised as a convenient and flexible form of information for archive, exchange and publication; modem structure refinement programs generally produce a CIF as well as other forms of output, and further items of information can easily be added, since each piece of information in the file is uniquely identified by a name defined in an internationally agreed dictionary. An example of part of a CIF is shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>; a complete CIF for a large structure is a long file, <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, chapter 4 Further topics</a>including not only the primary results, but also the derived geometry with associated s.u.&#x2019;s. The diffraction data can also be stored in a defined CIF format, as can an entire research report or manuscript for publication. Computer programs are then used for converting information from a CIF into text and tables more suitable for human readers, by-passing any need for manual typesetting with its inherent probability of introducing errors. Crystallography is very well suited to electronic publishing.</p>

<p class="indent">Once structural results have been published in the primary research literature (scientific journals), they are available for anyone to access and use. It is, however, not necessary to work through libraries of printed material to <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, chapter 4 Further topics</a> find results of relevance and interest, because of the availability of <i>computer databases.</i> Databases are essentially collections of items of information with a common structure and format. Their advantages over paper-based or other storage and retrieval systems include their ease of maintenance and updating, the possibility of automatic validation of new entries, facilities for selecting and sorting entries, and computer-based analysis of selected entries. A database has two components: the stored contents, and suitable software for search, retrieval and analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Computer databases are important in many areas of chemistry and other sciences, and cover such aspects as bibliography and literature citations, safety information, spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. They are particularly well suited for crystal structures.</p>
<p class="indent">Four main structural databases are used internationally in research. The <i>Metals Crystallographic Data File</i> (MCDF), administered by the National Research Council of Canada, holds information on metals, alloys and some binary compounds (hydrides and oxides) of metals. In 1997 there were over 55 000 entries.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Inorganic Crystal Structure Database</i> (ICSD) is managed by the Gmelin Institute and the Fachinformationszentrum (Karlsruhe) in Germany. It contains inorganics and minerals, in which there is no organic carbon. In 1997 there were over 43 000 entries.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Protein Data Bank</i> (PDB), maintained by the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, USA, stores data for proteins and nucleic acids. A relative newcomer, its size has grown enormously, with over 6000 entries in 1997.</p>
<p class="indent">The largest structural database is the <i>Cambridge Structural Database</i> (CSD), developed by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, UK. Its contents are organics, organometallics and metal complexes, and numbered around 168 000 in 1997, with continued rapid expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">A further database of interest is the <i>Crystal Data Identification File</i> from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. This holds details of unit cell parameters for over 210 000 structures. It is particularly useful in the early stages of crystal structure determination, when the unit cell geometry has been obtained. If this proves to be essentially the same as an entry in the database, and the chemical composition for that entry is reasonable for the sample being investigated, a unnecessary full data collection and repeat determination of a known structure can be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of these databases has its own individual special features appropriate to the contents, but they also have common aspects. Since the CSD is the most widely used, we consider it further here in illustrating some points.</p>
<p class="indent">Entries for the CSD are drawn mainly from the primary research literature. Many of these require manual keyboard input from paper copies, though image scanners can also be used. Some journals request or require electronic submission of structural results, which are then forwarded to the CSD compilers, for example in CIF form. Other entries are supplied direct by crystallographers for inclusion in CSD, whether paper-based publication occurs or not. Individual entries are thoroughly checked for consistency and possible errors, which are either corrected or flagged.</p>
<p class="indent">Each entry in the database contains bibliographic information; a collection of individual text and numeric data such as unit cell parameters, temperature <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, chapter 4 Further topics</a> of data collection, and <i>R</i> factor; a two-dimensional representation of the chemical structural formula; and all the atom positions, from which detailed geometry can be calculated. Searches can be made through the contents against any of these items; particularly useful is the facility to search for all structures containing a particular group of atoms (a molecular fragment), with or without specific restrictions on its geometry. The possible output includes display of all the searchable items, a three-dimensional graphical representation of the structure which can be manipulated interactively, and statistical analysis of any of the numerical items, including specific geometrical features such as bond lengths.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">There is, of course, much that the databases do <i>not</i> contain, such as the authors&#x2019;discussion of their results, for which the original literature must be consulted; but even here, the databases provide the necessary bibliographic information as a way into the literature.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The structural databases are thus an invaluable resource of reliable information, far more convenient to use than the original published literature. They can be used to find a particular structure for various reasons (this includes avoiding repeating work which has already been done!), to obtain information on a series of related structures, to generate a geometry for a structural fragment for use in other calculations such as molecular orbital theory or molecular modelling, and for extensive research into trends and patterns in structures (such as conformations of rings, hydrogen bonding, intermolecular interactions, substituent effects, etc.).</p>
<p class="indent">There is no doubt that the science of crystal structure determination, at its best, is a highly developed, well organized, very reliable and powerful technique, from the initial measurement of diffraction data, through the solution of the &#x2018;phase problem&#x2019; and the refinement of trial structures, to the presentation and interpretation of results and their availability in convenient form to the world at large. Much of modem chemistry depends heavily on it, and it continues to be a subject of rapid development and excitement.</p>
