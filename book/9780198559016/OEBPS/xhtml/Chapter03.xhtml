<p class="noindent">In this chapter the process of crystal structure determination is illustrated by a series of examples drawn from a wide range of structural chemistry research. The examples have been chosen to cover many different aspects of the experimental measurements and methods of structure solution and refinement, as well as a variety of types of material. Not all details of every structure determination are given, but each example presents particular features of interest. At the end of the chapter (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.8">section 3.8</a>) some problems are presented for the reader to solve.</p>

This means there are two cations and two anions in the unit cell. There are only two possible triclinic space groups (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a>), and the more likely is <img src="../images/in28_1.jpg" alt="images"/>, which requires the two cations to be related to each other by inversion symmetry, and similarly for the two anions in the unit cell; the asymmetric unit of the structure is one cation and one anion, so we know nothing at this stage about the molecular geometry from symmetry arguments.</p>

Corrections are applied for absorption effects, which are strong for a compound containing mercury, based on measurements of intensities of selected medium&#x2013;strong reflections at a range of different crystal orientations (these would be equal if there were no absorption and a correction can be calculated from their observed variation); it is also found that the intensities have decreased steadily by about 7% during the data collection period of around 4 days, and this is corrected for. Each pair of reflections with indices <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> and &#x2013;<i>h</i>, &#x2013;<i>k</i>, &#x2013;<i>l</i> is equivalent by symmetry, so they are averaged, to give a unique set of 5412 reflections.

<p class="indent1">In this space group, for each atom at a position <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> there is a symmetry-equivalent atom at position &#x2013;<i>x</i>, &#x2013;<i>y</i>, &#x2013;<i>z</i>. The two mercury atoms in the unit cell thus have coordinates which are equal and opposite in sign, and the vector between these two positions is <i>x</i> &#x2013; (&#x2013;<i>x</i>), <i>y</i> &#x2013; (&#x2013;<i>y</i>), <i>z</i> &#x2013; (&#x2013;<i>z</i>), which is just 2<i>x</i>, 2<i>y</i>, 2<i>z</i>. The highest Patterson peak, therefore, excluding the origin peak, should correspond to a Hg&#x2014;Hg vector, should be much larger than the other peaks, and has coordinates equal to twice those of a mercury atom; its vector length is the distance between the two mercury atoms in the unit cell. The coordinates of one mercury atom are thus 0.462/2, 0.146/2, 0.432/2, giving <i>x</i> = 0.231, <i>y</i> = 0.073, <i>z</i> = 0.216. The two mercury atoms are well separated (almost 9 &#x00C5; apart); a short distance here would indicate that the two mercury atoms are in fact part of a dimeric anion of formula [Hg<sub>2</sub>(SR)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>, probably with bridging thiolate ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">A mercury atom has 80 electrons, and this is a significant proportion of the total scattering power of the asymmetric unit (344 electrons). Since we now know the position of the mercury atom, we can use this as our first model structure in the next stage of Fourier syntheses to find the remaining atoms. It is, however, worth pausing to examine the next highest peaks in the Patterson map. There are six of these with similar heights; all other peak heights are less than 60 on this scale. The next largest peaks after Hg&#x2014;Hg are expected to be Hg&#x2014;S. There should be three of these corresponding to <i>intramolecular</i> vectors, i.e. Hg&#x2014;S bonds within one anion, and three corresponding to <i>intermolecular</i> vectors, i.e. from mercury in one anion to the three sulfur <a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>atoms in the other anioh. The list does include three vectors of length 2.47, 2.46 and 2.39 &#x00C5;, which are appropriate for bonds, and three vectors more than 7 &#x00C5; long, which will be the intermolecular ones. So the Patterson map is certainly consistent with our proposed chemical formula and with a three-coordinate Hg-centred anion.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Now we move into the structure completion &#x2018;bootstrap&#x2019; procedure. Taking the mercury atom alone as the model structure, Fourier transformation gives a calculated diffraction pattern. The value of the residual factor <i>R</i> is 0.2840 for the 5032 reflections which have <i>F</i><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 2<i>&#x03C3;</i>(<i>F</i><sup>2</sup>) (such reflections are sometimes called &#x2018;<i>observed reflections</i>&#x2019;, because they have an intensity judged to be significantly higher than background scattering), and <i>wR</i>2 is 0.6497 for the complete set of reflections. A difference electron density map calculated from the observed amplitudes and the calculated phases derived from just the mercury atom does not show the full electron density of the mercury atom (it would appear clearly as a very large peak in a full electron density map, but a difference map is better for finding new atoms). Its highest three peaks, with electron densities above 20 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, are in positions about 2.4 &#x00C5; from mercury, suitable for sulfur atoms; all 26 carbon atoms and the single nitrogen atom are among the 32 next highest peaks excluding the residual peak at the position of mercury, with densities in the range 8.6 down to 2.8 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, and the remaining peaks are rather lower. It is not expected that all carbon atoms will have the same electron density, because those which undergo larger vibrations have their electron density spread out over a larger volume, so they usually show up as smaller peaks. The assignment of atom types is made on the basis of the observed distances and angles involving the peak positions and the expected structure, as well as on peak heights.</p>
<p class="indent">So in this case, a single cycle of Fourier synthesis calculations reveals all the non-hydrogen atoms, and refinement of the structure can begin. Refinement with isotropic displacement parameters for all the atoms (each atom has one adjustable overall displacement parameter as well as three adjustable coordinates) reduces <i>wR</i>2 from 0.3647 (with all atoms in the positions found from the difference map) to 0.3112 and the value of <i>R</i> after refinement is 0.1021, a considerable improvement on the first trial structure with just the mercury atom present. Inclusion of anisotropic displacement parameters (six values for each atom instead of one) reduces <i>wR</i>2 to 0.1371 and <i>R</i> to 0.0406; there are now 280 refined parameters.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the 53 hydrogen atoms now show up in a further difference electron density map, those in the anion being clearer than those in the cation, for which the atoms have higher displacement parameters, so their electron density is more spread out. They are included in the refinement, but the C&#x2014;H bond lengths and angles involving hydrogen atoms are kept fixed (constrained) at ideal values rather than being allowed to refine freely, because the hydrogen atoms are not very precisely located by X-ray diffraction; effectively, the hydrogen atoms are made to ride on their parent carbon atoms. This technique incorporates all the electron density of the atoms in the model structure, but it adds very few or no extra refined parameters; in this particular structure, free rotation is allowed about the C&#x2014;C bonds of the cation starting from an idealized staggered conformation; such small deviations from ideal positions are due to intermolecular interactions. The final refinement also includes some extra minor corrections for effects which <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>are not important for this account, including small modifications to the relative weighting of different reflections, and gives values of 0.0823 for <i>wR</i>2 (all data) and 0.0315 for <i>R</i> (observed data). There are 285 refined parameters derived from the 5412 data, a very high degree of over-determination, so the precision of the structure is high (s.u. values of the parameters are small). In a final difference electron density map there a few peaks of size 0.8&#x2013;2.1 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> very close to the mercury atom (a commonly observed feature for heavy atom structures, due largely to an imperfect correction for strong absorption effects in the data), and no other peaks above 0.6 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, which is an insignificant level.</p>

<figcaption  style="width:60%;margin-left:-0.7em;" id="fig3.3"><b>Fig. 3.3</b> The structure of the cation and anion of case study 1; the anion is shown in ball-and-stick form, the cation with displacement ellipsoids for carbon and nitrogen atoms, to illustrate different styles of representation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The cation and anion are shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>. The main interest is in the coordination of the mercury atom, which is somewhat distorted trigonal planar, with a range of about 0.08 &#x00C5; for the three Hg&#x2014;S bond lengths, much greater than their individual uncertainties of about 0.002 &#x00C5;, and three very different S&#x2014;Hg&#x2014;S angles, the smallest being 101.27(5)&#x00B0; and the largest 135.82(5)&#x00B0;. As expected, all the cyclohexane rings show a chair conformation with sulfur in an equatorial position. There is nothing at all unexpected or special about the geometry of the cation, which occurs in many salts of complex anions. It is an important feature of crystal structure determination that, in general, the whole structure has to be determined, even if only one particular part of it is really of interest; it is an all-or-nothing technique. This is a direct consequence of the nature of Fourier transforms: all the atoms in the unit cell contribute together to the observed diffraction pattern, and all the diffraction pattern has to be used to find the atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, this case study illustrates particularly how simple it is to find a single heavy atom in the asymmetric unit of this common low-symmetry space group by a Patterson synthesis, the straightforward completion of the structure from this one heavy atom as a starting point, and the necessity to locate and refine all the atoms of the structure even if some parts of it are of little or no particular interest.</p>

<p class="noindent">This cell volume is sufficient for two units of the suggested formula, but this is incompatible with the symmetry of the space group, which requires all atoms and groups of atoms to occur in sets of four unless they lie on inversion centres; this is not possible for a dibenzylamido group (Bz<sub>2</sub>N), which is highly unlikely to be linear at the nitrogen atom. In this case, then, we must proceed without knowing the actual chemical contents of the asymmetric unit, which is one-quarter of the unit cell.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of iodine (53 electrons; no other atom has more than seven) means a Patterson synthesis is again appropriate for the solution of this structure.

So, if there is indeed one iodine atom in the asymmetric unit of the structure, we will expect to find in the Patterson synthesis a very large origin peak (as always); a large peak with <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> coordinates both equal to <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/> and a <i>y</i> coordinate from which we can easily calculate the <i>y</i> coordinate of the iodine atom; another large peak with <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/> for its <i>y</i> coordinate and with <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> coordinates from which we can similarly find the <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> coordinates of the iodine atom; and a peak of about half the size of these two with coordinates equal to twice the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> coordinates of the iodine atom.

<p class="indent">Finding the position of the iodine atom in the asymmetric unit from these peaks is a matter of identifying each of the peaks with a corresponding entry in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a>. There are in fact several possible solutions, all of which are entirely equivalent and equally correct. Thus, for example, peak number 2 can be identified with the entry <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/>, <img src="../images/in28_6.jpg" alt="images"/>, <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/> and this means <img src="../images/in28_7.jpg" alt="images"/>, so <i>y</i> = 0.146. Peak number 3 can be identified with the entry <img src="../images/in28_8.jpg" alt="images"/>, <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/>, <img src="../images/in28_9.jpg" alt="images"/>, which gives <i>x</i> = 0.243 and <i>z</i> = 0.042. These three coordinates for the iodine atom agree with peak number 4, identified with the entry 2<i>x</i>, 2<i>y</i>, 2<i>z</i>. The shortest distance between two iodine atoms in the structure is the shortest vector length for the three peaks, which is over 6 &#x00C5;.</p>
<p class="indent">The iodine atom serves as our first model structure, and the process of structure completion by Fourier calculations and examination of electron density syntheses (or difference electron density syntheses) proceeds as for the first case study. With just the iodine atom, <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> are 0.6904 and 0.2850 respectively. The first 21 peaks in a difference map have heights ranging from 8.83 to 4.04 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, and the remaining peaks are under 2.6 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>. These 21 peaks can all be assigned atom types based on the observed geometry, which reveals a pmdeta molecule, a lithium atom and a BzN fragment (nitrogen with just one benzyl group attached, not two).</p>
<a id="page_56" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 56, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>
<p class="indent">Inclusion of all these atoms in a new model structure with isotropic displacement parameters for all atoms reduces <i>wR</i>2 to 0.2523 and <i>R</i> to 0.0683; refinement with anisotropic displacement parameters gives further reduction to 0.1938 and 0.0463. At this point a difference electron density map shows 32 hydrogen atoms in sensible positions: peak heights for these are between 0.75 and 0.50 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, and the next highest peak is 0.44 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>. There are two hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom of the BzN group (which is coordinated to lithium), so this is shown to be a benzylamine ligand, BzNH<sub>2</sub>. In the subsequent refinement, the positions of these two hydrogen atoms are left to refine freely, in order not to impose a preconceived idea of the geometry at the nitrogen atom, but all the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms are constrained to the expected geometry.</p>
<p class="indent">The total number of refined parameters is 211, so we still have a very high data/parameter ratio. The final values of <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> are 0.0595 and 0.0255, and a difference electron density map shows no peaks higher than 0.32 and no holes deeper than 0.37 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, indicating that the atoms are all correctly accounted for.</p>
<p class="indent">The asymmetric unit of the structure is shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>. The compound is the iodide salt of a lithium-centred complex cation having as ligands a tridentate neutral pmdeta molecule and a benzylamine molecule. The reaction to produce it must involve cleavage of a C&#x2014;N bond of the original dibenzylamine reagent. Lithium has an approximately tetrahedral coordination geometry, which is not unusual.</p>
<p class="indent">Examination of the relative positions of the cation and anion, and symmetry equivalents of them, shows that the hydrogen atoms of the NH<sub>2</sub> amine group are both directed towards iodide anions to give N&#x2014;H&#x2026;I hydrogen bonding. Each iodide anion is involved in two such hydrogen bonds, to give dimeric units of two cations and two anions, as shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>. These dimeric units are packed together in the crystal structure as shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>, with normal van der Waals interactions holding the units together.</p>

<p class="noindent">The unexpected result of the previous investigation prompted further study of related systems, and it was found that high yields of the same material could be obtained by simple reaction of Lil, pmdeta and benzylamine (BzNH<sub>2</sub>) in toluene solution. Use of <i>p</i>-methylbenzylamine (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>) instead of benzylamine gave a product for which chemical analysis and spectroscopic measurements were consistent with an analogous formula [(pmdeta)-<a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>Li(H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Me)]I.

The unit cell is orthorhombic and body-centred with two-fold rotation symmetry along each of the three unit cell axes but no reflection or inversion symmetry: the space group is <i>I</i>222. There are in fact no fewer than six different space groups all theoretically possible from inspection of the diffraction data (six different possible arrangements of rotation/reflection/inversion symmetry elements, all consistent with the observed diffraction pattern), and the correct one must be chosen by trying each one in turn and seeing which gives a recognizable solution. In fact, the correct space group is judged to be the most likely one on the basis of some statistical criteria, and was the first one attempted; this was successful, so it was not necessary to consider the others further.

<p class="indent">As for the previous example, a correction was applied for absorption effects, but was unnecessary for intensity decay. A total of 14 059 measured reflections with <i>&#x03B8;</i> &#x003C; 28.4&#x00B0; gave 5050 unique data after averaging of symmetry equivalents, with a value of 0.025 for <i>R</i><sub>int</sub>.</p>

<p class="sidebar">This means we are trying to find 252 unknown values, and we have 15 847 pieces of information about combinations of these values. Each of these pieces of information is approximate and has an associated probability of being true (a reliability). The ratio of information (relationships) to unknowns (phases) is very high, which it needs to be for any chance of success.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In this case, for variety, the structure solution is carried out by direct methods. In a fully automatic mode, the computer program selected 252 relatively intense reflections with an impressive 15 847 relationships among their phases. Sixty-four different sets of starting phases were generated at random and were adjusted to give the best agreement with these relationships in each case; 14 of them converged to essentially the same set of well-fitting phases. Note that, for a structure with no inversion symmetry, each phase can take any value from 0 to 360&#x00B0;, and these calculations are more time-consuming than they would be for a centrosymmetric structure. An electron density map calculated from the observed amplitudes and estimated phases of the strongest reflections shows two large peaks, both lying on two-fold rotation axes (which have <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of 0 and <img src="../images/in28_5.jpg" alt="images"/>), and no other geometrically recognizable fragments. An iodine atom lying on a rotation axis of symmetry has only three other symmetry equivalents in the unit cell, whereas an atom in a general position has seven others, because the rotation symmetry relates the atom to itself and not to a different one. Two iodine atoms on rotation axes thus give <i>Z</i> = 8 as expected.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, exactly the same solution for the iodine atoms can be found from a Patterson synthesis, which shows four large peaks with heights between 434 and 181 (relative to the origin peak of height 999), from which the coordinates of the atoms, related to each other by the two-fold rotation axes, are easily deduced.</p>
<a id="page_59" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 59, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>
<p class="indent">Use of the two iodine atoms as the initial model structure leads to a problem. Because these atoms lie in special positions on symmetry elements, their arrangement in the unit cell, together with their equivalents, actually has higher symmetry than the complete structure with all atoms present; the apparent space group is a different one, in which there are also mirror planes. This incorrect extra symmetry carries through the Fourier transform equations into the calculated diffraction pattern and hence, via the calculated phases (which are all either 0 or 180&#x00B0; because of the extra symmetry, when they should really be able to take any value between 0 and 360&#x00B0;), back into the next electron density map. The values of <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> are 0.5976 and 0.1987. In the electron density map two amine ligands are seen, related to each other by mirror symmetry which does not belong to the space group (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>), and two pmdeta molecules are also visible in the same way; the relatively electron-poor lithium does not show up clearly at this stage. Only one of the amine ligands can be correct, and only one of the pmdeta molecules, and there is a 50% probability of choosing a valid combination. In such cases, it is simplest to select only some of the possible atoms, keeping to those which we are sure belong together. For this structure one of the amine ligands is chosen (they are equally acceptable), giving us one nitrogen and eight carbon atoms to add to the model structure.</p>

<p class="indent">This model structure no longer has false mirror planes. The calculated amplitudes are closer to the observed ones (<i>wR</i>2 = 0.5181, <i>R</i> = 0.1642), and the calculated phases are more nearly correct, so the next electron density map is clearer, showing the pmdeta molecule and the lithium atom, with only small peaks corresponding to mirror images of these and of the amine ligand. For this structure, two cycles of the &#x2018;bootstrap&#x2019; Fourier procedure have been required in order to find all the non-hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Refinement now proceeds as before, with reduction of <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> to 0.3251 and 0.0862 respectively with isotropic displacement parameters, and then to 0.1618 and 0.0406 with anisotropic parameters. Most of the hydrogen atoms show up in a difference electron density map. They are included in the refinement in the same way as for the previous example. The difference map also shows that two of the CH<sub>2</sub> groups of the pmdeta ligand do not actually lie in the same position in every molecule, but that each of them occupies two alternative positions at random; that is, for each of them, one position is adopted in some of the molecules, and the other position is adopted in the rest. This is by no means an uncommon observation, and is referred to as disorder in the structure. It means that all the molecules are not actually identical, but there is some variation (in this case a choice of two alternatives for each of two groups of atoms), and X-ray diffraction gives us only an average structure, which appears as partial atoms. This <i>disorder</i> is included in the refinement, with the distribution ratio between the two alternative sites as a variable parameter. The final values of <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> are 0.0543 and 0.0221 respectively. The total number of refined parameters is 241, and there are no features in a final difference map outside the range &#x00B1; 0.54 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent">There is one other important feature of this structure determination. We have previously seen that a diffraction pattern always has a centre of symmetry, even if the crystal structure is not centrosymmetric; this is known as <i>Friedel&#x0027;s law</i>. In fact, this is only approximately true, because of an effect known as <i>anomalous scattering</i>. As a first approximation, every time an atom <a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>scatters X-rays, a phase shift of 180&#x00B0; occurs; because this phase shift is constant, it can be ignored, and we regard all atoms as scattering in phase at <i>&#x03B8;</i> = 0&#x00B0;. In reality, the phase shift is not exactly 180&#x00B0;, and it is different for different atoms, generally increasing with atomic number, although there are irregularities in the pattern; atoms which contribute strongly to X-ray absorption also give significant anomalous scattering. For centrosymmetric structures, the effects of anomalous scattering on the pair of opposite reflections <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> and &#x2013;<i>h</i>, &#x2013;<i>k</i>, &#x2013;<i>l</i> are equal, and so they still do have the same intensity: Friedel&#x0027;s law is obeyed. For non-centrosymmetric structures, however, the effects do not cancel, and these reflections, known as <i>Friedel pairs</i> or <i>Friedel opposites</i>, have different intensities. The differences are not very great in most cases, since anomalous scattering is only a small fraction of the total atomic scattering of X-rays, but careful measurement and comparison of Friedel pairs of reflections, or inclusion of them as separate non-equivalent data in refinement, allows us to distinguish a crystal structure from its inverse or opposite hand. For <i>chiral</i> molecules, this represents a direct experimental method of determining <i>absolute configurations</i>, which is not possible otherwise.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A <i>chiral</i> molecule is one which is not identical to its mirror image; the two non-identical mirror images, known as <i>enantiomers</i>, are related like left and right hands.

It can be seen that, in the present structure, anomalous scattering effects are significant, and the correct <i>absolute structure</i> (a general term which includes absolute configuration and related expressions appropriate for structures which are non-centrosymmetric but not chiral) is indicated with confidence. It can be assessed (among other possible methods) by refinement of a special parameter which should be 0 for the correct result and 1 for the wrong absolute structure; for this structure, the parameter is &#x2013;0.01(2), i.e. it is less than 1 s.u. from zero and so is definitely correct. Alternatively, both the structure and its inverse can be separately refined and the results compared; for this structure, refinement with everything inverted gives significantly higher values of <i>wR</i>2 (0.0697 compared with 0.0543) and <i>R</i> (0.0289 compared with 0.0221).</p>

<p class="indent">In summary, this example illustrates a partial solution derived by direct methods, a <i>pseudosymmetry</i> problem caused by heavy atoms which in themselves have more symmetry than the complete structure, the occurrence of a small amount of disorder in a structure, and the use of anomalous scattering effects to determine absolute configuration (absolute structure). In conjunction with the previous example, it also illustrates how compounds which are chemically extremely similar can have significant differences in their crystal structures.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-9.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Pseudosymmetry means approximate but not exact symmetry; in this particular case, the arrangement of the heavy atoms alone fits a higher symmetry space group than that of the whole structure with all the light atoms included.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Indeed, it is also possible for one and the same compound to adopt more than one crystal structure under different conditions of crystallization (such as different rates of crystallization, different solvents, different temperatures, etc.). This phenomenon is called <i>polymorphism</i>, and is by no means uncommon. At an elementary level it is familiar in the different crystalline forms of sulfur (monoclinic and orthorhombic). It is common in minerals (such as calcite and aragonite, two crystalline forms of calcium carbonate), and it is commercially important in pharmaceuticals, where one polymorph of a substance may be an active drug while another polymorph of the same chemical substance is inactive or even harmful.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">By its derivation, the word <i>polymorphism</i> means the existence of <i>many forms</i>; it is generally used when a compound is found in at least two different crystalline forms.</p>

<p class="indent">There are no elements heavier than nitrogen in this compound, so we turn to direct methods for a solution. The 277 most significant reflections (highest intensities relative to the average for their particular Bragg angles) give 5757 phase relationships. Of 64 automatically generated starting phase sets, adjusted to give the best agreement of the phase relationships in each case, no fewer than 40 produce essentially the same electron density map. In this map there are three peaks with relative heights 260, 258, and 210, which are clearly nitrogen atoms when the geometry is examined. The boron atom corresponds to a peak with height 180. Carbon atoms show a higher degree of vibration and give peaks with heights 127&#x2013;159, and the electron-poor lithium atom is the smallest peak for a genuine atom, at 114. All other peaks are below 62 in height, so the molecule stands out clearly from the background of the map (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.14">Fig. 3.14</a>) and all non-hydrogen atoms are revealed in a single calculation.</p>
<p class="indent">Isotropic refinement reduces <i>wR</i>2 from 0.6063 to 0.4455, with <i>R</i> = 0.1655; addition of anisotropic displacement parameters gives <i>wR</i>2 = 0.3397, <i>R</i> = 0.1260. All the hydrogen atoms are now found in a difference map, with electron densities up to 0.35 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>.

With optimization of the weighting, the final <i>wR</i>2 and <i>R</i> are 0.2362 and 0.0741 respectively, and there are no significant features remaining in a final difference map.

<p class="indent">The molecular structure is shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.15">Fig. 3.15</a>. As in the previous examples, pmdeta functions as a tridentate ligand to lithium. The borohydride anion has a tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms around boron, as expected, and it is bonded to lithium through t\yo bridging hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are less precisely located than the other atoms, of course, but the bonds between boron and the bridging atoms are slightly longer than those to the terminal hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have already looked at this example, in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a>, when considering preliminary unit cell and symmetry information. The proposed chemical formula is [(18-crown-6)K][In(NCS)<sub>4</sub>(py)<sub>2</sub>], where py is pyridine, and unit cell determination shows that there cannot be more than one formula unit in the cell. If the correct space group is the centrosymmetric <img src="../images/in28_1.jpg" alt="images"/>, which is much more common than the alternative non-centrosymmetric triclinic space group <i>P</i>1, then we already know that both the cation and the anion must lie on inversion centres, and that the arrangement of pyridine ligands around the indium atom must be <i>trans</i>. The details of the structure, however, are still to be established; some extra molecules of pyridine are likely to be found.</p>

<a id="page_64" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 64, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>
<p class="indent">There are eight inversion centres per unit cell, and one of them can be chosen arbitrarily for one of the metal atoms, corresponding to a choice among the available unit cell origins. It is not possible, however, to place the second metal atom arbitrarily on one of the other inversion centres; they must have the correct relative positions. It is in fact possible to decide on the correct positions of both metal atoms by a careful examination of the distribution of intensities in the data set, but this is not necessary. The indium atom alone has enough electron density to serve as the first model structure. It is placed on the inversion centre at <i>x</i> = <i>y</i> = <i>z</i> = 0.5, which sets the anion conveniently at the exact centre of the cell. No Patterson synthesis or direct methods calculation is necessary in order to solve this structure!</p>
<p class="indent">The indium atom alone gives <i>wR</i>2 = 0.7990 and <i>R</i> = 0.4602. Now the largest difference electron density peak lies on another inversion centre and is clearly the potassium atom. The next peaks in descending order of height are two for sulfur, then three for oxygen, four for nitrogen, and 18 for carbon atoms, corresponding to half a cation, half an anion and one separate pyridine molecule in the asymmetric unit (half the unit cell). The assignments are based on peak heights and geometry; in the uncoordinated pyridine molecule, the largest peak is assigned provisionally as nitrogen.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">If a nitrogen atom is refined erroneously as a carbon atom, it does not have enough electron density ; as a partial compensation, the refinement produces an unusually small displacement parameter, which corresponds to a sharpening of the electron density distribution in an attempt to give a larger peak. Conversely, mis-assignment of a nitrogen atom as an oxygen atom would give a relatively large displacement parameter, spreading out the too high electron density in order to reduce the peak.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Isotropic refinement of these atoms (with the two metal atoms fixed in position on their respective inversion centres) gives <i>wR</i>2 = 0.2281, <i>R</i> = 0.0717; anisotropic, <i>wR</i>2 = 0.1375, <i>R</i> = 0.0353. All hydrogen atoms are found in a difference map as the top 22 peaks. The uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen atom is confirmed as correct because it gives the shortest bonds in the ring, the displacement parameters are normal, and it does not have an attached hydrogen atom. Inclusion of hydrogen atoms with constraints gives final values of <i>wR</i>2 = 0.0529, <i>R</i> = 0.0206, 257 parameters, and no difference map features outside the range &#x00B1; 0.6 e &#x00C5;<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>.

<p class="indent">This is another non-centrosymmetric structure. The absolute structure parameter refines to 0.5(2), intermediate between the two possibilities and not very precisely determined. The uncertainty is high, because anomalous scattering effects are quite small in the absence of heavy atoms. The structure is likely to be <i>twinned</i>, a combination of two inversion-related components in <a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Chapter 3 The method illustrated by examples</a>approximately equal amounts; this effect is not unusual for synthetic materials of this kind.</p>
