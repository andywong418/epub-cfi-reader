<p class="noindent">There are some clear trends in chemical properties of the Group 13 elements, such as oxidation number and amphoteric character, that we shall see repeated in the other groups of the p block. In this chapter we look at the occurrence and isolation of each element in Group 13 and consider the chemical properties of the elements and their simple compounds, coordination compounds, and organometallic compounds. In addition, we introduce the extensive range of boron clusters.</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0.1em;">The elements of Group 13&#x2014;boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium&#x2014;have diverse physical and chemical properties. The first member of the group, boron, is essentially nonmetallic, whereas the heavier members of the group are distinctly metallic. Aluminium is the most important element commercially and is produced on a massive scale for a wide range of applications. Boron forms a large number of cluster compounds involving hydrogen, metals, and carbon. Gallium and indium in alloys and compounds have important electronic and optical properties.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The elements of Group 13 show a wide variation in abundance in crustal rocks, the oceans, and the atmosphere. Aluminium is abundant but the low cosmic and terrestrial abundance of boron, like that of lithium and beryllium, reflects how the light elements are sidestepped in nucleosynthesis (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#box1.1">Box 1.1</a>). The low abundance of heavier members of the group is in <a id="page_355" class="page">page 355, The Group 13 elements</a>keeping with the progressive decrease in nuclear stability of the elements that follow iron. Boron occurs naturally as <i>borax</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;8H<sub>2</sub>O, and <i>kernite</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;2 H<sub>2</sub>O, from which the impure element is obtained. Aluminium occurs in numerous clays and aluminosilicate minerals but the commercially most important mineral is <i>bauxite</i>, a complex mixture of hydrated aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxide, from which it is extracted on an immense scale. Gallium oxide occurs as an impurity in bauxite and is normally recovered as a by-product of the manufacture of aluminium. Indium and thallium occur in trace amounts in many minerals.</p>

<p class="indent">Whereas the elements of the s and d blocks are all metallic, the elements of the p block range from nonmetals, through metalloids, to metals. This variety results in a diversity of chemical properties and some distinctive trends (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.4">Section 9.4</a>). There is an increase in metallic character from B to Tl: B is a nonmetal; Al is essentially metallic, although it is often classed as a metalloid on account of its amphoteric character; and Ga, In, and Tl are metals. Associated with this trend is a variation from predominantly covalent to ionic bonding in the compounds of the elements that can be rationalized in terms of the increase in atomic radius and related decrease in ionization energy down the group (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#tab13.1">Table13.1</a>). Because the ionization energies of the heavier elements are low, the metals form cations increasingly readily down the group. In contrast to the expected trend in electronegativity (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7d">Section 1.7d</a>), Ga manifests the alternation effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.2c">Section 9.2c</a>), being more electronegative than Al.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.8">Section 9.8</a>, the first member of each group differs from its congeners on account of its small atomic radius. This difference is particularly evident in Group 13, where the chemical properties of B are distinct from those of the rest of the group. However, B does have a pronounced diagonal relationship with Si in Group 14:</p>
<p class="list2" style="width:67%;"><span class="fig1" style="color:#4295D1;">&#x2022;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Boron and silicon form acidic oxides, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>; aluminium forms an amphoteric oxide.</p>
<p class="list2" style="width:67%;"><span class="fig1" style="color:#4295D1">&#x2022;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Boron and silicon form many polymeric oxide structures and glasses.</p>
<p class="list2" style="width:67%;"><span class="fig1" style="color:#4295D1">&#x2022;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Boron and silicon form flammable, gaseous hydrides; aluminium hydride is a solid.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The valence electron configuration of the Group 13 elements is <i>n</i>s<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>p<sup>1</sup> and, as this configuration suggests, all the elements adopt the &#x002B;3 oxidation state in their compounds. However, the heavier elements of the group also form compounds with the metal in the &#x002B;1 oxidation state and this state increases in stability down the group. In fact, the most common oxidation state of Tl is Tl(I). This trend is particularly evident within the halides and is a consequence of the inert-pair effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>). The consequences of the inert-pair effect are evident in Group 13. Thallium(I) is intensely poisonous because its ionic radius is very similar to that of potassium ions: it enters cells and disrupts the mechanisms of potassium and sodium transport (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="page_356" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 356, The Group 13 elements</a></p>
<p class="indent">Boron exists in several allotropes. Amorphous B is a brown powder but the hard and refractory crystalline B forms shiny black crystals. The three solid phases for which crystal structures are available contain the icosahedral (20-faced) B<sub>12</sub> unit as a building block (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.1">Fig. 13.1</a>). This icosahedral unit is a recurring motif in boron chemistry and we shall meet it again in the structures of metal borides and boron hydrides. The icosahedral unit is also found in some intermetallic compounds of other Group 13 elements, such as Al<sub>5</sub>CuLi<sub>3</sub>, RbGa<sub>7</sub>, and K<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>13</sub>. Boron is inert, and under normal conditions finely divided B is attacked only by F<sub>2</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">Even though Al is an electropositive metal it is very inert on account of the presence of a passivating surface oxide film. If this film is removed then Al is rapidly oxidized by air. Aluminium has a high reflectance, which is maintained in the powdered form, making it a useful component of silver-coloured paints. It is a good thermal and electrical conductor.</p>
<p class="indent">Gallium is brittle at low temperatures but liquefies at 30&#x00B0;C. Its low melting point is attributed to its crystal structure, in which each Ga atom has only one nearest neighbour and six next-nearest neighbours: thus, the Ga atoms tend to form Ga&#x0064;Ga pairs. Gallium has a wide liquid range (30&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;2403&#x00B0;C) and wets glass and skin, making it difficult to handle. Gallium readily forms alloys with other metals and diffuses into their lattices, making them brittle. Indium forms a distorted ccp lattice and Tl is hexagonal close-packed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> All of the elements form hydrides, oxides, and halides in the &#x002B;3 oxidation state. The &#x002B;1 oxidation state becomes more stable down the group and is the most stable oxidation state for compounds of thallium.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top:1em;">A most striking feature of the lighter Group 13 elements is their <i>n</i>s<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>p<sup>1</sup> electron configuration, which contributes up to a maximum of six electrons in the valence shell when three covalent bonds are formed by electron sharing. As a result, many of their compounds have an incomplete octet and act as Lewis acids, being able to complete their octet by accepting a pair of electrons from a donor. Moreover, as is typical of an element at the head of its group, the chemical properties of B and its compounds are strikingly different from those of its congeners.</p>
<div class="bggr2" style="width:67%;">
<p class="boxpara"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> Be careful to distinguish electron deficiency from the possession of an incomplete octet. The former refers to the lack of sufficient electrons to account for the connections between atoms as normal covalent bonds; the latter is the possession of less than eight electrons in a valence shell.</p></div>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1.5em">The binary hydrogen compounds of B are called boranes. The simplest member of the series, diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<b>1</b>), is electron-deficient and its structure is commonly described in terms of 2<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> and 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>): bridging 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds are a recurring theme in borane chemistry. All the boron hydrides burn with a characteristic green flame and several of them ignite explosively on contact with air. Alkali metal tetrahydridoboranates, NaBH<sub>4</sub> and LiBH<sub>4</sub>, are very useful in the laboratory as general reducing agents and as precursors for most boron&#x2013;hydrogen compounds. Alkali and alkali earth metal tetrahydridoboranes and ammonia borane, NH<sub>3</sub>BH<sub>3</sub>, are useful hydrogen storage materials (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#box13.1">Box 13.1</a>).</p>

<p class="boxpara">Hydrogen fuel cells are seen as an alternative to carbon-based fuel and are starting to find applications in mobile technologies and motor vehicles. Efficient fuel cells demand an efficient source of hydrogen, and many methodologies for storing hydrogen have been investigated. These include using high pressure and porous materials, but others focus on chemical compounds that generate H<sub>2</sub> on heating or on reaction with water. The boron and aluminium hydrides come into this last category. Attractive compounds have a high mass percentage hydrogen content. The values for LiBH<sub>4</sub>, NaBH<sub>4</sub>, LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, and AlH<sub>3</sub> are approximately 18, 11, 11, and 10 mass per cent, respectively.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The reaction requires a nickel or platinum catalyst and rapidly produces moist hydrogen for the engine or fuel cell. The NaBH<sub>4</sub> is used as a 30 mass per cent solution in water and the fuel is thus a nonvolatile, nonflammable liquid at atmospheric pressure.

<p><a id="page_357" style="width:98%;" class="page">page 357, The Group 13 elements</a></p>
<p class="boxpara" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Ammonia borane, BH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>, with a hydrogen content of 21 mass per cent, has also been investigated for hydrogen generation. It was investigated as a rocket fuel in the 1950s but the studies were abandoned. Ammonia borane decomposes to liberate hydrogen when heated to 500&#x00B0;C. The residue is boron nitride, which cannot be easily recycled. Recent studies have investigated the hydrogen storage potential of the ammonia complex of magnesium borohydride, Mg(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;2NH<sub>3.</sub> The complex contains 16 mass per cent hydrogen, which is released when a solution of the complex flows over a ruthenium catalyst. The complex begins to decompose at 150&#x00B0;C, with a maximum hydrogen release rate at 205&#x00B0;C, making it competitive with ammonia borane, BH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub> as a hydrogen storage material.</p></div>

<p class="indent">Boron trihalides consist of trigonal-planar BX<sub>3</sub> molecules. Unlike the halides of the other elements in the group, they are monomeric in the gas, liquid, and solid states. Boron trifluoride and boron trichloride are gases, the tribromide is a volatile liquid, and the triiodide is a solid (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#tab13.2">Table 13.2</a>). This trend in volatility is consistent with the increase in strength of dispersion forces with the number of electrons in the molecules. Boron trihalides have an incomplete octet and are Lewis acids. The order of Lewis acidity is BF<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;BCl<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;BBr<sub>3</sub> and contrary to the order that might be expected from consideration of the electronegativity of the attached halogens (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.7">Section 4.7</a>). The electron deficiency is partially removed by X&#x2013;B &#x03C0; bonding between the halogen atoms and the B atom, giving rise to the partial occupation of the vacant p orbital on the B atom by electrons donated by the halogen atoms (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.2">Fig. 13.2</a>). The trend in Lewis acidity stems from more efficient X&#x2013;B &#x03C0; bonding for the lighter, smaller halogens, the F&#x2013;B bond being one of the strongest formally single bonds known.</p>

<p class="noindent">The vitreous form of the oxide consists of a network of partially ordered trigonal BO<sub>3</sub> units. Crystalline B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> consists of an ordered network of BO<sub>3</sub> units joined through O atoms. Metal oxides dissolve in molten B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to give coloured glasses. Boron oxide and silica are the main constituents of borosilicate glass, which, because of the low thermal expansivity of the glass due to the strong B&#x2013;O bonds, is used to make heat-resistant laboratory glassware.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many molecular compounds that contain BN bonds and many of them are analogous to carbon compounds. The similarities between compounds containing BN and CC units can be explained by the fact that these units are isoelectronic. The simplest compound of B and N, boron nitride, BN, is easily synthesized by heating boron oxide with a nitrogen compound (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#box13.2">Box 13.2</a>):</p>

<p class="boxpara">Hexagonal boron nitride was first developed to meet the needs of the aerospace industry. It is stable in oxygen and is not attacked by steam below 900&#x00B0;C. It is a good thermal insulator, has low thermal expansion, and is resistant to thermal shock. These applications have led to its use in industry to make high-temperature crucibles. The powder is used as a mould release and thermal insulator. Boron nitride nanotubes have been formed by depositing boron and nitrogen on a tungsten surface under high vacuum. These nanotubes could be suitable for high-temperature conditions under which carbon nanotubes would burn. BN nanotubes also offer the possibility of ambient-temperature hydrogen storage as they have been found to take up 2.6 weight per cent of H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><a id="page_358" class="page" style="width:98%;">page 358, The Group 13 elements</a></p>
<p class="boxparai" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">The softness and sheen of powdered boron nitride has led to its widest application, in the cosmetics and personal-care industries. It is nontoxic and presents no known hazard, and is added to many products up to around 10 per cent. It adds a pearlescent sheen to products such as nail polishes and lipsticks, and is added to foundations to hide wrinkles. Its light-reflective properties scatter the light, making wrinkles less noticeable.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1.2em;">The structure of one form of boron nitride consists of planar sheets of atoms like those in graphite (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.5">Section 14.5</a>), and some of the physical properties of BN are similar to those of graphite. For example, both graphite and BN have a slippery feel and are used as lubricants. However, BN is a white, nonconducting solid, not a black, metallic conductor. Apart from layered boron nitride, the best-known unsaturated compound of B and N is borazine, B<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<b>2</b>), which is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene and, like benzene, is a colourless liquid (b.p. 55&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="indent">The elements Al, Ga, In, and Tl are metals with many similarities in their chemical properties. Like B, they form electron-deficient compounds that act as Lewis acids. Aluminium forms alloys with many other metals and produces light, corrosion-resistant materials. When Al is alloyed with Ga, the Ga prevents the formation of the tightly held passivating oxide film on the Al. When the alloy is dropped in water the Al reacts with the water, forming aluminium hydroxide and liberating hydrogen. Aluminium hydride, AlH<sub>3</sub>, is a solid that is best regarded as saline, like the hydrides of the s-block metals. Unlike CaH<sub>2</sub> and NaH, which are more readily available commercially, AlH<sub>3</sub> has few applications in the laboratory. However, NaAlH<sub>4</sub> is a widely used reducing agent. The alkylaluminium hydrides, such as Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, are well-known molecular compounds and contain Al&#x2013;H&#x2013;Al 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">All the elements form trihalides with the metal in its &#x002B;3 oxidation state. However, as we expect from the inert-pair effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>), the &#x002B;1 oxidation state becomes more common on descending the group, and Tl forms stable monohalides. Gallium, In, and Tl also form mixed I/III oxidation state halides. Because the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion is so small, the trifluorides are mechanically hard ionic solids that have much higher melting points and sublimation enthalpies than the other halides. Their high lattice enthalpies also result in them having very limited solubility in most solvents, and they do not act as Lewis acids to simple donor molecules. The heavier trihalides of Al, Ga, and In are soluble in a wide variety of polar solvents and are excellent Lewis acids. The trigonal planar MX<sub>3</sub> monomer occurs only at elevated temperatures in the gas phase. Otherwise, the trihalides exist as M<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> dimers in the vapour phase and in solution. The volatile solids are dimeric. An exception is AlCl<sub>3</sub>, which has a six-coordinate layer structure in the solid phase and converts to four-coordinate molecular dimers at its melting point. The dimers contain coordinate M&#x2013;X bonds in which a lone pair on X belonging to one AlX<sub>3</sub> unit completes the octet of M belonging to the second MX<sub>3</sub> unit (<b>3</b>). This arrangement results in a tetrahedral arrangement of X atoms around each M atom. In contrast to the other elements in the group, Tl(I) is the most stable oxidation state of the halides.</p>

The alums can be thought of as double salts containing the hydrated trivalent cation [Al(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. The remaining water molecules form hydrogen bonds between the cations and sulfate ions. The mineral alum, KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x22C5;12H<sub>2</sub>O, from which aluminium takes its name, is the only common, water-soluble, aluminium-bearing mineral. It has been used since ancient times as a mordant to fix dyes to textiles. The mordant forms a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric, preventing it from being washed out. The term &#x2018;alum&#x2019; is used widely to describe other compounds with the general formula M(I)M<sup>&#x2032;</sup>(III)(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;12H<sub>2</sub>O, where M<sup>&#x2032;</sup> is often a d metal, such as Fe in &#x2018;ferric alum&#x2019;, KFe(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;12H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p class="indent">The borohydrides with the formula [B<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub><i>n</i></sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> have a <b><i><b><i>closo</i></b></i> structure</b>, a name derived from the Greek for &#x2018;cage&#x2019;.

<p class="noindent">In this section we present a more detailed discussion of the chemistry of the elements of Group 13, interpreting some of the observed properties in terms of the trends from nonmetallic to metallic character down the group and the impact of the incomplete octet and associated Lewis acidity on their properties. The contrasting properties of boron are dealt with in several sections.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Boron exists in several hard and refractory allotropes. The three solid phases for which crystal structures are available contain the icosahedral (20-faced) B<sub>12</sub> unit as a building block (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.1">Fig. 13.1</a>). This icosahedral unit is a recurring motif in boron chemistry and we shall meet it again in the structures of metal borides and boron hydrides. The icosahedral unit is also found in some intermetallic compounds and Zintl phases (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.8">Section 3.8c</a>) of other Group 13 elements, such as Al<sub>5</sub>CuLi<sub>3</sub>, RbGa<sub>7</sub>, and K<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>13</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Boron occurs naturally as <i>borax</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;8H<sub>2</sub>O, and <i>kernite</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;2H<sub>2</sub>O, from which the impure element is obtained. The borax is converted to boric acid, B(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and then to boron oxide, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The oxide is reduced with magnesium and washed with alkali and then hydrofluoric acid.

<p class="noindent">Aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust and makes up approximately 8 per cent by mass of crustal rocks. It occurs in numerous clays and aluminosilicate minerals <a id="page_360" class="page">page 360, The Group 13 elements</a>but the commercially most important mineral is <i>bauxite</i>, a complex mixture of hydrated aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxide, from which it is extracted by the Hall&#x2013;H&#x00E9;roult process on an immense scale (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.18">Section 5.18</a>). In this process the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is dissolved in molten cryolite, Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, the mixture is electrolysed, and aluminium is deposited at the cathode. The process is very energy-intensive but the expense of this is offset by the scale of production, the low cost of the raw material, and the use of hydroelectric power. The oxide, alumina, occurs naturally as ruby, sapphire, corundum, and as a constituent of emery.</p>
<p class="indent">Gallium oxide occurs as an impurity in bauxite and is normally recovered as a by-product of the manufacture of aluminium. The process results in the concentration of gallium in the residues, from which it is extracted by electrolysis. Indium is produced as a by-product of the extraction of lead and zinc, and is isolated by electrolysis. Thallium compounds are found in flue dust, the fine particles emitted with the gases produced during smelting. The dust is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid; hydrochloric acid is then added to precipitate thallium(I) chloride and the metal is extracted by electrolysis.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="nor">13.5</span> <b>Uses of the elements and their compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The most useful compound of boron is borax; the most commercially important element is aluminium.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The main use of B is in borosilicate glasses. Borax has many domestic uses, for example as a water softener, cleaner, and mild pesticide. Boric acid, B(OH)<sub>3</sub>, is used as a mild antiseptic. Amorphous brown boron is used in pyrotechnics to impart a bright green colour. Boron is an essential micronutrient in plants. Lightweight, strong boron filaments are used in composite materials for the aerospace industry and in sports equipment. Many compounds of B are superhard materials, having hardness approaching that of diamond. Cubic boron nitride is synthesized at high pressures, which makes it expensive. Rhenium diboride does not require high pressures so production is relatively cheap, but Re is an expensive metal. The material known as &#x2018;heterodiamond&#x2019;, sometimes labelled BCN, is formed from diamond and boron nitride by explosive shock synthesis. These compounds are used as substitutes for diamond in cutting tools and blades. Sodium perborate, NaBO<sub>3</sub>&#x00B7;H<sub>2</sub>O, which exists as the dimer Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>, is used as a chlorine-free bleach in laundry products, cleaning materials, and tooth whitener. It is less aggressive to textiles than chlorine bleaches and active at low temperatures when mixed with an activator such as tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED). Sodium hydridoborate, NaBH<sub>4</sub>, is used on a massive scale for bleaching wood pulp. Boranes used to be popular as rocket fuels but were found to be too pyrophoric to be handled safely. Boranes are being investigated as possible hydrogen storage materials, with the hydrogen stored as the ammonia&#x2013;borane complex NH<sub>3</sub>:BH<sub>3</sub> (Boxes <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box10.4">10.4</a>, <a href="Chapter12.xhtml#box_12.3">12.3</a> and <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#box13.1">13.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Aluminium is the most widely used nonferrous metal. The technological uses of aluminium metal exploit its lightness, resistance to corrosion, and the fact that it is easily recycled. It is used in cans, foils, utensils, in construction, and in aircraft alloys (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#box13.3">Box 13.3</a>). Many Al compounds are used as mordants, in water and sewage treatment, in paper production, as food additives, and for waterproofing textiles. Aluminium chloride and chlorohydride are used in antiperspirants and the hydroxide is used as an antacid. Sodium tetrahydridoaluminate, NaAlH<sub>4</sub>, doped with TiF<sub>3</sub> is used as a hydrogen storage material.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the melting point of Ga (30&#x00B0;C) is just above room temperature, it is used in high-temperature thermometers. Gallium and In form a low-melting-point alloy that is used as the safety device in sprinkler systems. Both elements are deposited on glass surfaces to form corrosion-resistant mirrors, and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> doped with Sn is used as a transparent, conducting coating for electronic displays and as a heat-reflective coating for light bulbs. Gallium nitride is used in blue laser diodes and is the basis of Blu-ray&#x00AE; technology. It is insensitive to ionizing radiation and is used in solar cells in satellites. Gallium arsenide is a semiconductor and is used in integrated circuits, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. Thallium compounds were once used to treat ringworm and as a rat and ant poison. However, this application has been banned because of their very high toxicity, which arises from the transport of Tl<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions across cell membranes together with K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a>). Thallium is absorbed more efficiently by tumour cells and has been used in nuclear medicine as an imaging agent.</p>

<p class="boxtitle" id="box13.3"><b><span class="bgg">BOX 13. 3</span>&#160;&#160;Aluminium recycling</b></p></div>
<p class="boxpara">Aluminium production is energy-intensive and expensive and for these reasons aluminium recycling is very attractive. Aluminium has been recycled for many decades but the popularity of aluminium beverage cans and the focus on domestic recycling has increased the activity enormously. The aluminium economy is a good example of a circular economy, where a waste product becomes the feedstock of another process, minimizing the impact on the environment and natural resources. The aluminium is not consumed during a product&#x2019;s lifetime but has the potential to be recycled and reused many times, as the process has no detrimental effects on the metal&#x2019;s physical or chemical properties.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The cost of recycling aluminium is 5 per cent of the cost of extracting aluminium from bauxite, even when the costs of collection and separation are taken in to account. There are added benefits associated with the reduced use of landfill and the cost of shipping new aluminium or bauxite. The process is fairly straightforward. Cans are separated from other waste and shredded into small pieces which are cleaned and formed into blocks. The formation of blocks minimizes oxidation. The blocks are then heated in a furnace at 750&#x00B0;C to produce molten aluminium. Solid waste is removed and any dissolved hydrogen is degassed by adding ammonium perchlorate, which decomposes to liberate chlorine that reacts with the hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Additives can be added to alter the properties of the final alloy. The aluminium is then cast into ingots. Recycling the aluminium from motor vehicles is also well established and follows the same basic process but with more complex separation stages in order to separate out other metals, polymers, textiles, etc.</p>
<p class="boxparai" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">The global recycling rate for aluminium beverage cans is 70 per cent, with Brazil leading the way with 97 per cent of all cans being recycled. The global recycling rate for aluminium from building and transport uses is approaching 90 per cent and recycled aluminium plays an increasing role in meeting society&#x2019;s demands for the metal.</p></div>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, can be prepared in the laboratory by metathesis of a boron halide with either LiAlH<sub>4</sub> or LiBH<sub>4</sub> in ether:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15em;">

<p class="noindent">That this reaction is a metathesis (an exchange of partners) can be seen by writing it in the simplified form</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-16.5em;">
<img src="../images/equ361b.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Both LiBH<sub>4</sub> and LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, like LiH, are good reagents for the transfer of H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, but they are generally preferred over LiH and NaH because they are soluble in ethers. The synthesis is carried out with the strict exclusion of air (typically in a vacuum line) because diborane ignites on contact with air. Diborane decomposes very slowly at room temperature, forming higher boron hydrides and a nonvolatile and insoluble yellow solid that consist of B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub> and the polymeric species BH<sub><i>n</i></sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The compounds fall into two classes. One class has the formula B<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub><i>n</i></sub><sub>&#x002B;4</sub> and the other, which is richer in hydrogen and less stable, has the formula B<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub><i>n</i></sub><sub>&#x002B;6</sub>. Examples include pentaborane(11), B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub> (<b>8</b>), tetraborane(10), B<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> (<b>10</b>), and pentaborane(9), B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> (<b>7</b>). The nomenclature, in which the number of B atoms is specified by a prefix and the number of H atoms is given in parentheses, should be noted. Thus, the systematic name for diborane is diborane(6); however, as there is no diborane(8), the simpler term &#x2018;diborane&#x2019; is almost always used.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;">

<p class="indent">All the boranes are colourless and diamagnetic. They range from gases (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>), through volatile liquids (B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub> hydrides), to the sublimable solid B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>. All the boron hydrides are flammable, and several of the lighter ones, including diborane, react spontaneously with air, often with explosive violence and a green flash (an emission from an excited state of the reaction intermediate BO). The final product of the reaction is boric acid:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17em;">

<p class="noindent">Boranes are readily hydrolysed by water to give boric acid and hydrogen:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15em;">
<img src="../images/equ361d.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">As described below, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is a Lewis acid, and the mechanism of this hydrolysis reaction involves coordination of H<sub>2</sub>O acting as a Lewis base. Molecular hydrogen then forms as a result of the combination of the partially positively charged H atom on O with the partially negatively charged H atom on B.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_13.6b">(b) Lewis acidity</h4>
<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Soft and bulky Lewis bases cleave diborane symmetrically; more compact and hard Lewis bases cleave the hydrogen bridge unsymmetrically; although it reacts with many hard Lewis bases, diborane is best regarded as a soft Lewis acid.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">As implied by the mechanism of hydrolysis, diborane and many other light boron hydrides act as Lewis acids and are cleaved by reaction with Lewis bases. Two different cleavage patterns have been observed, namely symmetrical cleavage and unsymmetrical cleavage. In <b>symmetrical cleavage</b>, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is broken symmetrically into two BH<sub>3</sub> fragments, each of which forms a complex with a Lewis base:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">

<p class="noindent">Many complexes of this kind exist and they are isoelectronic with hydrocarbons. For instance, the product of this reaction is isoelectronic with 2,2-dimethylpropane, C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Stability trends indicate that BH<sub>3</sub> is a soft Lewis acid, as illustrated by the reaction</p>
<figure  style="margin-left:-13em;">
<img src="../images/equ361e.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">in which BH<sub>3</sub> transfers to the soft S donor atom and the harder Lewis acid, BF<sub>3</sub>, combines with the hard N donor atom.</p>
<p class="indent">The direct reaction of diborane and ammonia results in <b>unsymmetrical cleavage</b>, which is cleavage leading to an ionic product:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-10em;">
<img src="../images/pg361b.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Unsymmetrical cleavage of this kind is generally observed when diborane and a few other boron hydrides react with strong, sterically uncrowded bases at low temperatures. Two ligands can attack one B atom in the course of the reaction only if they are small and steric repulsion is avoided.</p>

<p class="noindent">Borate esters are much weaker Lewis acids than the boron trihalides, presumably because the O atom acts as an intramolecular &#x03C0; donor, like the F atom in BF<sub>3</sub> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.7">Section 4.7b</a>), and donates electron density to the p orbital of the B atom. Hence, judging from Lewis acidity, an O atom is more effective than an F atom as a &#x03C0; donor towards B. 1,2-Diols have a particularly strong tendency to form cyclic borate esters (including with sugars) on account of the chelate effect (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.14">Section 7.14</a>), (<b>17</b>).</p>

The difference between the structures of graphite and boron nitride, however, lies in the register of the atoms of neighbouring sheets: in BN, the hexagonal rings are stacked directly over each other, with B and N atoms alternating in successive layers; in graphite, the hexagons are staggered. Molecular orbital calculations suggest that the stacking in BN stems from a partial positive charge on B and a partial negative charge on N.

<p class="indent">As with impure graphite, layered boron nitride is a slippery material that is used as a lubricant. Unlike graphite, however, it is a colourless electrical insulator, as there is a large energy gap between the filled and vacant &#x03C0; bands. The size of the band gap is consistent with its high electrical resistivity and lack of absorption in the visible spectrum. In keeping with this large band gap, BN forms a much smaller number of intercalation compounds than graphite (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.5">Section 14.5</a>). In contrast to graphite, layered boron nitride is stable in air up to 1000&#x00B0;C, making it a useful refractory material.</p>

<p class="indent">Layered boron nitride changes into a denser cubic phase at high pressures and temperatures (60 kbar and 2000&#x00B0;C; Fig. 13.5 ). This phase is a hard crystalline analogue of diamond but, as it has a lower lattice enthalpy, it has a slightly lower mechanical hardness ( Fig. 13.6 ). Cubic boron nitride is manufactured and used as an abrasive for certain high-temperature applications in which diamond cannot be used because it forms carbides with the material being ground.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that BN and CC are isolectronic suggests that there might be analogies between these compounds and hydrocarbons. Many aminee&#x2013;boranes , the boron&#x2013;nitrogen analogues of saturated hydrocarbons, can be synthesized by reaction between a nitrogen Lewis base and a boron Lewis acid:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-16.5em;">
<img src="../images/equ365a.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">However, although amine&#x2013;boranes are isoelectronic with hydrocarbons, their properties are significantly different, in large part due to the difference in electronegativities of B and N. For example, whereas ammonia&#x2013;borane, H<sub>3</sub>NBH<sub>3</sub>, is a solid at room temperature with a vapour pressure of a few pascals, its analogue ethane, H<sub>3</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>, is a gas that condenses at &#x2212;89&#x00B0;C. This difference can be traced to the difference in polarity of the two molecules: ethane is nonpolar, whereas ammonia&#x2013;borane has a large dipole moment of 5.2 D (<b>20</b>).</p>

<p class="indent">Several BN analogues of the amino acids have been prepared, including ammonia&#x2013;carboxyborane, H<sub>3</sub>NBH<sub>2</sub>COOH, the analogue of glycine, NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH. These compounds display significant physiological activity, including tumour inhibition and reduction of serum cholesterol.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest unsaturated boron&#x2013;nitrogen compound is aminoborane, H<sub>2</sub>NBH<sub>2</sub>, which is isoelectronic with ethene. It has only a transient existence in the gas phase because it readily forms cyclic ring compounds such as a cyclohexane analogue (<b>21</b>). However, the aminoboranes do survive as monomers when the double bond is shielded from reaction by bulky alkyl groups on the N atom and by Cl atoms on the B atom (<b>22</b>). For instance, monomeric aminoboranes can be synthesized readily by the reaction of a dialkylamine and a boron halide:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-10em;">

<p class="noindent">The reaction also occurs with xylyl (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) groups in place of isopropyl groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from layered boron nitride, the best known unsaturated compound of boron and nitrogen is borazine, B<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<b>2</b>), which is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene. Borazine was first prepared by Alfred Stock in 1926 by the reaction between diborane and ammonia. Since then, many symmetrically trisubstituted derivatives have been made by procedures that depend on the protolysis of BCl bonds of BCl<sub>3</sub> by an ammonium salt (<b>23</b>):</p>

<p class="indent">Despite their structural resemblance, there is little chemical resemblance between borazine and benzene. Once again, the difference in the electronegativities of boron and nitrogen is influential, and BCl bonds in trichloroborazine are much more labile than the CCl bonds in chlorobenzene. In the borazine compound, the &#x03C0; electrons are concentrated on the N atoms and there is a partial positive charge on the B atoms that leaves them open to nucleophilic attack. A sign of the difference is that the reaction of a chloroborazine with a Grignard reagent or hydride source results in the substitution of Cl by alkyl, aryl, or hydride groups. Another example of the difference is the ready addition of HCl to borazine to produce a trichlorocyclohexane analogue (<b>24</b>):</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">Metal borides are found with a wide range of compositions, as B can occur in numerous types of structure, including isolated B atoms, chains, planar and puckered nets, and clusters. The simplest metal borides are metal-rich compounds that contain isolated B<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> ions. The most common examples of these compounds have the formula M<sub>2</sub>B, where M may be one of the middle to late 3d metals (Mn to Ni) in low oxidation states. Another important class of metal borides contains planar or puckered hexagonal nets that have the composition MB<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.7">Fig.13.7</a>). These compounds are formed primarily by electropositive metals, including Mg, Al, the early d metals (from Sc to Mn, for instance, in Period 4), and U (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#box13.4">Box 13.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The boron-rich borides, typically MB<sub>6</sub> and MB<sub>12</sub>, where M is an electropositive metal, are of even greater structural interest. In them, the B atoms link to form an intricate network of interconnecting cages. In MB<sub>6</sub> compounds (which are formed by the electropositive s-block metals, such as Na, K, Ca, Sr, and Ba, and f-block metals), the B<sub>6</sub> octahedra are linked by their vertices to form a cubic framework (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.8">Fig. 13.8</a>). The linked B<sub>6</sub> clusters bear a charge of &#x2212;1, &#x2212;2, or &#x2212;3, depending on the cation with which they are associated. In the MB<sub>12</sub> compounds the B-atom networks are based on linked cuboctahedra (<b>25</b>) rather than the more familiar icosahedron. This type of compound is formed by some of the heavier electropositive metals, particularly those of the f block.</p>

<p class="boxpara">Magnesium diboride, MgB<sub>2</sub>, is a cheap compound that has been known in the laboratory for over 50 years. In 2001 this simple compound was found to have superconducting properties (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). Jun Akimitsu and his co-workers discovered by chance that MgB<sub>2</sub> loses its electrical resistance when cooled. At the time, they were characterizing materials used to enhance the performance of known high-temperature superconductors. The discovery led to a major flurry of research around the world on this new superconductor.</p>
<p class="boxparai">In bulk materials the transition temperature of MgB<sub>2</sub> is 38&#x2005;K and is exceeded only by the much more complicated perovskite cuprate structures (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). Many of the first measurements were made using MgB<sub>2</sub> powder straight from the bottle. High-quality MgB<sub>2</sub> can be synthesized by heating fine boron and magnesium powders together at around 950&#x00B0;C under pressure. Thin films, wires, and tapes have since been formed that have potential for applications in superconducting magnets, microwave communications, and power applications.</p>
<p class="boxparai" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Magnesium diboride has a simple structure in which the B atoms are arranged in graphite-like planes with alternating layers of Mg atoms. The Mg atoms donate their two valence electrons to the network of B atoms. Varying the number of electrons donated to the boron conduction bands can dramatically affect the transition temperature. The transition temperature of the compound falls if some of the Mg atoms are replaced by Al and increases when doped with Cu. The transition temperature, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>, of MgB<sub>2</sub> is approximately 15&#x2005;K higher than theory predicts. This difference has been explained in terms of vibrations in the lattice that allow two electrons to form a Cooper pair, which then travels resistance-free through the material.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1.2em;">However, it is sometimes fruitful to identify groups of three atoms and to regard them as bonded together by versions of the 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds of the kind that occur in diborane itself (<b>1</b>). In the more complex boranes, the three centres of the 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds may be BHB bridge bonds, but they may also be bonds in which three B atoms lie at the corners of an equilateral triangle with their sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals overlapping at its centre (<b>26</b>).

<h4 class="h4" id="sec_13.11a">(a) Wade&#x2019;s rules</h4>
<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Wade&#x2019;s rules can be used to predict the structures of polyhedral borohydrides; boron hydride structures include simple polyhedral <i>closo</i> compounds and the progressively more open <i>nido</i> and <i>arachno</i> structures.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">A correlation between the number of electrons (counted in a specific way), the formula, and the shape of the molecule was established by Kenneth Wade in the 1970s. These so-called <b>Wade&#x2019;s rules</b> apply to a class of polyhedra called <b>deltahedra</b> (because they are made up of triangular faces resembling Greek deltas, &#x0394;) and can be used in two ways. For molecular and anionic boranes, they enable us to predict the general shape of the molecule or anion from its formula. However, because the rules are also expressed in terms of the number of electrons, we can extend them to analogous species in which there are atoms other than boron, such as carboranes and other p-block clusters. Here we concentrate on the boron clusters, where knowing the formula is sufficient for predicting the shape. However, so that we can cope with other clusters we shall show how to count the framework electrons too.</p>
<p class="indent">The building block from which the deltahedron is constructed is assumed to be one BH group (<b>27</b>) that contributes two electrons. The electrons in the B&#x2013;H bond are ignored in the counting procedure, but all others are included whether or not it is obvious that they help to hold the skeleton together. By the &#x2018;skeleton&#x2019; is meant the framework of the cluster with each BH group counted as a unit. If a B atom happens to carry two H atoms, only one of the B&#x2013;H bonds is treated as a unit. The second B&#x2013;H bond lies within the same spherical surface as the B atoms and is included in the skeleton electron count. For instance, in B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>, one of the B atoms has two &#x2018;terminal&#x2019; H atoms but only one BH entity is treated as a unit, the other pair of electrons being treated as part of the skeleton and hence referred to as &#x2018;skeletal electrons&#x2019;. A BH group makes two electrons available to the skeleton (the B atom provides three electrons and the H atom provides one but, of these four, two are used for the B&#x2013;H bond).</p>

<p class="indent">A B&#x2013;H bond uses one electron and one orbital of the B atom, leaving three orbitals and two electrons for the skeletal bonding. One of these orbitals, which is called a <b>radial orbital</b>, can be considered to be a boron sp hybrid pointing towards the interior of the fragment (as in <b>26</b>). The remaining two boron p orbitals, the <b>tangential orbitals,</b> are perpendicular to the radial orbital (<b>29</b>). The shapes of the 18 symmetry-adapted linear combinations of these 18 orbitals in an octahedral B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> cluster can be inferred from the drawings in <i>Resource section 4</i>, and we show the ones with net bonding character in <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.9">Fig. 13.9</a>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;">The lowest-energy molecular orbital is totally symmetric (a<sub>1g</sub>) and arises from in-phase contributions from all the radial orbitals. Calculations show that the next-higher orbitals are the t<sub>1u</sub> orbitals, each of which is a combination of four tangential and two radial orbitals. Above these three degenerate orbitals lie another three t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals, which are tangential in character, giving seven bonding orbitals in all. Hence, there are seven orbitals with net bonding character delocalized over the skeleton, and they are separated by a considerable gap from the remaining 11 largely antibonding orbitals (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.10">Fig. 13.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are seven electron pairs to accommodate, one pair from each of the six B atoms and one pair from the overall charge (&#x2212;2). These seven pairs can all enter and fill the seven bonding skeleton orbitals, and hence give rise to a stable structure, in accord with the (<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;1) rule. Note that the unknown neutral octahedral B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> molecule would have too few electrons to fill the t<sub>2g</sub> bonding orbitals. Similar arguments can be used for all <i>closo</i> structures.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_13.11c">(c) Structural correlations</h4>
<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Conceptually, the <i>closo</i>, <i>nido</i>, and <i>arachno</i> structures are related by the successive removal of a BH fragment and addition of H or electrons.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">A very useful structural correlation between <i>closo</i>, <i>nido</i>, and <i>arachno</i> species is based on the observation that clusters with the same numbers of skeletal electrons are related by removal of successive BH groups and the addition of the appropriate numbers of electrons and H atoms. This conceptual process provides a good way to think about the structures of the various boron clusters but does not represent how they are interconverted chemically.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea is amplified in <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.11">Fig. 13.11</a>, where the removal of a BH unit and two electrons and the addition of four H atoms converts the octahedral <i>closo</i>-[B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> anion to the square- pyramidal <i>nido</i>-B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> borane. A similar process (removal of a BH unit and addition of two H atoms) converts <i>nido</i>-B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> into a butterfly-shaped <i>arachno</i>-B<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> borane. Each of these three boranes has 14 skeletal electrons but, as the number of skeletal electrons per B atom increases, the structure becomes more open. A more systematic correlation of this type is indicated for many different boranes in <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.12">Fig. 13.12</a>.</p>

A key first step in the proposed mechanism is the dissociation of B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and the condensation of the resulting BH<sub>3</sub> fragment with borane fragments.

<figure style="margin-left:-18em;">
<img src="../images/equ370a.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure> 
<p class="indent">The synthesis of tetraborane(10), B<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, is particularly difficult because it is highly unstable, in keeping with the instability of the B<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub><i>n</i></sub><sub>&#x002B;6</sub> (<i>arachno</i>) series. To improve the yield, the product that emerges from the hot reactor is immediately quenched on a cold surface. Pyrolytic syntheses to form species belonging to the more stable B<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub><i>n</i></sub><sub>&#x002B;4</sub> (<i>nido</i>) series proceed in higher yield, without the need for a rapid quench. Thus B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> and B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub> are readily prepared by the pyrolysis reaction.

<p class="indent">Although direct reaction of Al, Ga, or In with a halogen yields a halide, these electropositive metals also react with HCl or HBr gas, and the latter is usually a more convenient route:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-13em;">

Cryolite occurs naturally, and molten synthetic cryolite is used as a solvent for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the industrial extraction of aluminium.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lewis acidities of the trihalides reflect the relative chemical hardness of the Group 13 elements. Thus, towards a hard Lewis base (such as ethyl acetate, which is hard because of its O donor atoms), the Lewis acidities of the halides weaken as the softness of the acceptor element increases, so the Lewis acidities fall in the order BCl<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;AlCl<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;GaCl<sub>3</sub>.

<p class="noindent">This reaction is an example of <b>transmetallation</b>, which is important in the preparation of main-group organometallic compounds. In transmetallation reactions, the halide formed is that of the more electronegative element and the high lattice enthalpy of that compound can be regarded as the &#x2018;driving force&#x2019; of the reaction (as we saw in Example 13.9). The main industrial application of AlCl<sub>3</sub> is as a Friedel&#x2013;Crafts catalyst in organic synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">The thallium trihalides are much less stable than those of their lighter congeners.

<p class="noindent">The formula GaX<sub>2</sub> is deceiving, as this solid and most other apparently divalent salts do not contain Ga(II); instead they are mixed-oxidation-state compounds containing Ga(I) and Ga(III), Ga(I)[Ga(III)Cl<sub>4</sub>]. Mixed-oxidation-state halogen compounds are also known for the heavier metals, such as InCl<sub>2</sub> and TlBr<sub>2</sub>.

There is in fact only a fine line between the formation of a mixed-oxidation-state ionic compound and the formation of a compound that contains M&#x2013;M bonds.

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The most stable form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &#x03B1;-alumina, is a very hard and refractory material. In its mineral form it is known as <i>corundum</i> and as a gemstone it is <i>sapphire</i> or <i>ruby</i>, depending on the metal-ion impurities. The blue of sapphire arises from a charge-transfer transition from Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ion impurities (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.5">Section 20.5</a>). Ruby is &#x03B1;-alumina in which a small fraction of the Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are replaced by Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>.

<p class="indent">Dehydration of aluminium hydroxide at temperatures below 900&#x00B0;C leads to the formation of &#x03B3;-alumina, which is a metastable polycrystalline form with a defect spinel structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9b</a>) and a very high surface area. Partly because of its surface acid and base sites, this material is used as a solid phase in chromatography and as a heterogeneous catalyst and catalyst support (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.10">Section 25.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The &#x03B1; and &#x03B3; forms of Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> have the same structures as their Al analogues.

Half the Ga(III) ions are therefore four-coordinate despite its large radius (compared to Al(III)). This coordination may be due to the effect of the filled 3d<sup>10</sup> shell of electrons, as remarked previously.

The main uses of these films are as transparent conducting coatings for liquid-crystal and plasma displays, touch panels, solar cells, and organic light-emitting diodes. They are also used as infrared-reflecting mirrors and as an antireflective coating on binoculars, telescopes, and spectacles. The melting point of ITO is 1900&#x00B0;C, which makes ITO thin film strain gauges very useful in harsh environments such as jet engines and gas turbines.</p>

<p class="indent">The most widely used Group 13/15 semiconductor is gallium arsenide, GaAs, which is used to make devices such as integrated circuits, light-emitting diodes, and laser diodes. Its band gap is similar to that of Si and larger than those of other Group 13/15 compounds (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#tab13.5">Table 13.5</a>). Gallium arsenide is superior to Si for such applications because it has higher electron mobility, allowing it to function at frequencies in excess of 250&#x2005;GHz. Gallium arsenide devices also generate less electronic noise than silicon devices. One disadvantage of Group 13/15 semiconductors is that the compounds decompose in moist air and must be kept under an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen, or be completely encapsulated.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Group 13 elements form Zintl phases with Group 1 and Group 2 elements which are poor conductors and diamagnetic.</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The Group 13 elements form Zintl phases (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.8">Section 3.8c</a>) with Group 1 or Group 2 metals. Zintl phases are compounds of two metals which are brittle, diamagnetic, and poor conductors. They are therefore quite different from alloys. Zintl phases are formed between a very electropositive Group 1 or 2 element and a moderately electronegative p-block metal or metalloid. They are ionic, with electrons being transferred from the Group 1 or 2 metal to the more electronegative element. The anion, referred to as a &#x2018;Zintl ion&#x2019;, has a complete octet of valence electrons and is polymeric; the cations are located within the anionic lattice. The structure of NaTl consists of the polymeric anion in a covalent diamond structure with Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions fitted into the anionic lattice. In Na<sub>2</sub>Tl the polymeric anion is tetrahedral <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>Tl</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>8</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>  The Zintl anions can be isolated by reacting with salts containing the tetraalkylammonium ion, which substitutes for the Group 1 or 2 metal ion, or by encapsulation within a cryptand. Some compounds appear to be Zintl phases but are conducting and paramagnetic.

<figure style="margin-left:-14em;">

<p class="noindent">Trimethylaluminium is prepared commercially by the reaction of Al metal with chloromethane to give Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4.</sub> This intermediate is then reduced with Na and the Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (<b>40</b>) is removed by fractional distillation.</p>

</figure> 
<p class="indent">Alkylaluminium dimers are similar in structure to the analogous dimeric halides but the bonding is different. In the halides, the bridging Al&#x2013;Cl&#x2013;Al bonds are 2<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds; that is, each Al&#x2013;Cl bond involves an electron pair. In the alkylaluminium dimers the Al&#x2013;C&#x2013;Al bonds are longer than the terminal Al&#x2013;C bonds, which suggests that they are 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds, with one bonding pair shared across the Al&#x2013;C&#x2013;Al unit, somewhat analogous to the bonding in diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#sec_13.6">Section 13.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Triethylaluminium and higher alkyl compounds are prepared from the metal, an appropriate alkene, and hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures and pressures:</p>

<p class="indent">This route is relatively cost-effective and, as a result, alkylaluminium compounds have found many commercial applications. Triethylaluminium, often written as the monomer Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is an organometallic complex of Al of major industrial importance. It is used in the Ziegler&#x2013;Natta polymerization catalyst (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.18">Section 25.18</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Steric factors have a powerful effect on the structures of alkylaluminiums. Where dimers are formed, the long weak bridging bonds are easily broken. This tendency increases with the bulkiness of the ligand. So, for example, triphenylaluminium is a dimer but trimesitylaluminium, with the very bulky trimesityl 2,4,6-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>&#x2212; group, is a monomer.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:0.3em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="pink"><b>13.1</b></span> Use suitable molecular-orbital software to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels for <i>closo</i>-[B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>. From that output, draw a molecular orbital energy diagram for the orbitals primarily involved in B&#x2013;B bonding and sketch the form of the orbitals. How do these orbitals compare qualitatively with the qualitative description for this anion in this chapter? Is B&#x2013;H bonding neatly separated from the B&#x2013;B bonding in the computed wavefunctions?</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:0.3em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="pink"><b>13.2</b></span> In his paper &#x2018;Covalent and ionic molecules: why are BeF<sub>2</sub> and AlF<sub>3</sub> high melting point solids whereas BF<sub>3</sub> and SiF<sub>4</sub> are gases?&#x2019; (<i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 1998, <b>75</b>, 923), R.J. Gillespie makes a case for the classification of the bonding in BF<sub>3</sub> and SiF<sub>4</sub> as predominantly ionic. Summarize his arguments and describe how these differ from the conventional view of bonding in gaseous molecules.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:0.3em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="pink"><b>13.3</b></span> Nanotubes of C and BN have been synthesized by C. Colliex et al. (<i>Science</i>, 1997, <b>278</b>, 653). (a) What are the advantageous properties of these nanotubes over carbon analogues? (b) Outline the method used for the preparation of these compounds. (c) What was the main structural feature of the nanotubes, and how could this be exploited in applications?</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:0.3em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="pink"><b>13.4</b></span> M. Montiverde discusses &#x2018;Pressure dependence of the superconducting temperature of MgB<sub>2</sub>&#x2019; (<i>Science</i>, 2001, <b>292</b>, 75). (a) Describe the bases of the two theories that have been postulated <a id="page_380" class="page">page 380, The Group 13 elements</a>to explain the superconductivity of MgB<sub>2</sub>. (b) How does the <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of MgB<sub>2</sub> vary with pressure? What insight does this provide into the superconductivity?</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:0.3em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="pink"><b>13.5</b></span> Use the references in Z.W. Pan, Z.R. Dai, and Z.L. Wang (<i>Science</i>, 2001, <b>291</b>, 1947) as a starting point to write a review of wire-like nanomaterials of Group 13 elements. Indicate how In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanobelts were prepared and give the dimensions of a typical nanobelt.</p>
