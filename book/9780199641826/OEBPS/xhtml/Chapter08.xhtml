<p class="noindentd"><b>All the structures of the molecules and materials to be covered in this book have been determined by applying one or more physical techniques. The techniques and instruments available vary greatly in complexity and cost, as well as in their suitability for meeting particular challenges. All the methods produce data that help to determine a compound&#x2019;s structure, its composition, or its properties. Many of the physical techniques used in contemporary inorganic research rely on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter, and there is hardly a section of the electromagnetic spectrum that is not used. In this chapter, we introduce the most important physical techniques that are used to investigate the atomic and electronic structures of inorganic compounds and to study their reactions</b>.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b>Diffraction methods</b></h3>
<p class="noindentt">Diffraction techniques, particularly those using X-rays, are the most important methods available to the inorganic chemist for the determination of structures. X-ray diffraction has been used to determine the structures of a quarter of a million different substances, including tens of thousands of purely inorganic compounds and many organometallic compounds. The method is used to locate the positions of the atoms and ions that make up a solid compound and hence provides a description of structures in terms of features such as bond lengths, bond angles, and the relative positions of ions and molecules in a unit cell. This structural information has been interpreted in terms of atomic and ionic radii, which then allow chemists to predict structure and explain trends in many properties. Diffraction methods are normally nondestructive in the sense that the sample remains unchanged and may be analysed further by using a different technique.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><b>Diffraction</b> is the interference between waves that occurs as a result of an object in their path. X-rays are scattered elastically (with no change in energy) by the electrons in atoms, and diffraction can occur for a periodic array of scattering centres separated by distances similar to the wavelength of the radiation (about 100&#x2009;pm), such as exist in a crystal. If we <a id="page_235" class="page">page 235, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>think of scattering as equivalent to reflection from two adjacent parallel planes of atoms separated by a distance <i>d</i> (<a href="#fig_8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>), then the angle at which constructive interference occurs (to produce a diffraction intensity maximum) between waves of wavelength <i>&#x03BB;</i> is given by <b>Bragg&#x2019;s equation</b>:</p>

<p class="indentt">An atom or ion scatters X-rays in proportion to the number of electrons it possesses, and the intensities of the measured diffraction maxima are proportional to the square of that number. Thus the diffraction pattern produced is characteristic of the positions and types (in terms of their number of electrons) of atom present in the crystalline compound, and the measurement of X-ray diffraction angles and intensities provides structural information. Because of its dependence on the number of electrons, X-ray diffraction is particularly sensitive to any electron-rich atoms in a compound. Thus, X-ray diffraction by NaNO<sub>3</sub> displays all three nearly isoelectronic atoms similarly, but for Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub> the scattering and structural information is dominated by the Pb atom.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two principal X-ray techniques: the <b>powder method</b>, in which the materials being studied are in polycrystalline form, and <b>single-crystal diffraction</b>, in which the sample is a single crystal of dimensions of several tens of micrometres or larger.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.1a">(a) Powder X-ray diffraction</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Powder X-ray diffraction is used mainly for phase identification and the determination of lattice parameters and lattice type</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">A powdered (polycrystalline) sample contains an enormous number of very small crystallites, typically 0.1 to 10&#x2009;&#x00B5;m in dimension and orientated at random. An X-ray beam striking a polycrystalline sample is scattered in all directions; at some angles, those given by Bragg&#x2019;s equation, constructive interference occurs. As a result, each set of planes of atoms with lattice spacing <i>d</i> gives rise to a cone of diffraction intensity. Each cone consists of a set of closely spaced diffracted rays, each one of which represents diffraction from a single crystallite within the powder sample (<a href="#fig_8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>). With a very large number of crystallites these rays merge together to form the diffraction cone. A <b>powder diffractometer</b> (<a href="#fig_8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>a) uses an electronic detector to measure the angles of the diffracted beams. Scanning the detector around the sample along the circumference of a circle cuts through the diffraction cones at the various diffraction maxima, and the intensity of the X-rays is recorded as a function of the detector angle (<a href="#fig_8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>b).</p>
<p class="indent">The number and positions of the reflections depend on the cell parameters, crystal system, lattice type, and wavelength used to collect the data; the peak intensities depend on the types of atoms present and their positions. Nearly all crystalline solids have a unique powder X-ray diffraction pattern in terms of the angles of the reflections and <a id="page_236" class="page">page 236, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>their intensities. In mixtures of compounds, each crystalline phase present contributes to the powder diffraction pattern its own unique set of reflection angles and intensities. Typically, the method is sensitive enough to detect a small level (5 to 10 per cent by mass) of a particular crystalline component in a mixture.</p>

<p class="indent">The effectiveness of powder X-ray diffraction has led to it becoming the major technique for the characterization of polycrystalline inorganic materials (<a href="#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a>). Many of the powder diffraction data sets collected from inorganic, organometallic, and organic compounds have been compiled into a database by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). This database, which contains over 50&#x2009;000 unique powder X-ray diffraction patterns, can be used like a fingerprint library to identify an unknown material from its powder pattern alone. Powder X-ray diffraction is used routinely in the investigation of phase formation and changes in structures of solids. The synthesis of a metal oxide can be verified by collecting a powder diffraction pattern and demonstrating that the data are consistent with a single pure phase of that material. Indeed, the progress of a chemical reaction is often monitored by observing the formation of the product phase at the expense of the reactants.</p>

<p class="indent">Basic crystallographic information, such as lattice parameters, can normally be extracted easily from powder X-ray diffraction data, usually with high precision. The presence or absence of certain reflections in the diffraction pattern permits the determination of the lattice type. In recent years the technique of fitting the intensities of the peaks in the diffraction pattern has become a popular method of extracting structural information such as atomic positions. The analysis, which is known as the <b>Rietveld method</b>, involves fitting a calculated diffraction pattern to the experimental trace. The technique is not as powerful as the single-crystal methods, for it gives less accurate atomic positions, but has the advantage of not requiring the growth of a single crystal.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from single crystals allows the structure of molecules and extended lattices to be determined, although hydrogen atoms are often not located in inorganic compounds</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Analysis of the diffraction data obtained from single crystals is the most important method of obtaining the structures of inorganic solids. Provided a compound can be grown as a crystal of sufficient size and quality, the data provide definitive information about molecular and extended lattice structures.</p>
<p class="indent">The collection of diffraction data from a single crystal can be carried out by using a diffractometer (<a href="#fig_8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>) where the crystal is rotated around three orthogonal directions, denoted <i>&#x03C9;</i>, <i>&#x03D5;</i> and <i>&#x03C7;</i>, in an X-ray beam A <b>four-circle diffractometer</b> uses a scintillation detector to measure the diffracted X-ray beam intensity as a function of the diffraction angle, 2<i>&#x03B8;</i>. Most contemporary diffractometers use an <b>area-detector</b> or <b>image plate</b> that is sensitive to X-rays; these detectors measure a large number of diffraction maxima simultaneously so that full data sets can typically be collected in just a few hours (<a href="#fig_8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Analysis of the diffraction data from single crystals is formally a complex process involving the locations and intensities of many thousands of reflections, but with increasing advances in computation power a skilled crystallographer can complete the structure determination of a small inorganic molecule in under an hour. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction can be used to determine the structures of the vast majority of inorganic compounds when they can be obtained as crystals with dimensions of about 50&#x2009;&#x00D7;&#x2009;50&#x2009;&#x00D7;&#x2009;50&#x2009;&#x00B5;m or larger. Positions for most atoms, including C, N, O, and metals, in most inorganic compounds can be determined with sufficient accuracy that bond lengths can be defined to within a fraction of a picometre. As an example, the S&#x2013;S bond length in monoclinic sulfur has been reported, with the estimated standard deviation (esd) given in brackets, as 204.7(3)&#x2009;pm or 2.047(3) &#x00C5;.</p>

<p class="indentt">The positions of hydrogen atoms can be determined for inorganic compounds that contain only light atoms (<i>Z</i> less than about 18, Ar), but their locations in many inorganic compounds that also contain heavy atoms, such as the 4d- and 5d-series elements, can be difficult or impossible. The problem lies with the small number of electrons on a hydrogen atom (just one), which is often reduced even further when H forms bonds to other atoms. Furthermore, as the one electron is normally part of a bond, the X-ray-determined position of this electron density is often displaced along the bond direction; this produces bond lengths shortened compared to the true internuclear distance. Other techniques, such as neutron diffraction (<a href="#sec_8.2">Section 8.2</a>), can often be applied to determine the positions of hydrogen atoms in inorganic compounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Molecular structures obtained by the analysis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction data are often represented in ORTEP diagrams (<a href="#fig_8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>; the acronym stands for Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Program). In an ORTEP diagram an ellipsoid is used to represent the volume within which the scattering electron density most probably lies, more correctly called the displacement ellipsoid, taking into account its thermal motion. The size of the ellipsoid increases with temperature and, as a result, so does the imprecision of the bond lengths extracted from the data and hence the reported error.</p>

Synchrotron radiation is produced by electrons circulating close to the speed of light in a storage ring and is typically several orders of magnitude more intense than laboratory sources.

<h3 class="h3">8.2 <b>Neutron diffraction</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The scattering of neutrons by crystals yields diffraction data that give additional information on structure, particularly the positions of light atoms</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Diffraction occurs from crystals for any particle with a velocity such that its associated wavelength (through the de Broglie relation, <i>&#x03BB;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;<i>h</i>/<i>mv</i>) is comparable to the separations of the atoms or ions in the crystal. Neutrons and electrons travelling at suitable velocities have wavelengths of the order of 100&#x2013;200&#x2009;pm and thus undergo diffraction by crystalline inorganic compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Neutron beams of the appropriate wavelength are generated by &#x2018;moderating&#x2019; (slowing down) neutrons generated in nuclear reactors or through a process known as <b>spallation</b>, in which neutrons are chipped off the nuclei of heavy elements by accelerated beams of protons. The instrumentation used for collecting data and analysing single-crystal or powder neutron diffraction patterns is often similar to that used for X-ray diffraction. The scale is much larger, however, because neutron beam fluxes are much lower than laboratory X-ray sources. Furthermore, whereas many chemistry laboratories have X-ray diffraction equipment for structure characterization, neutron diffraction can be undertaken only at a few specialist sources worldwide. The investigation of an inorganic compound with this technique is therefore much less routine and its application is essentially limited to systems where X-ray diffraction fails to determine an important part of the structure containing <a id="page_239" class="page">page 239, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>hydrogen. With the growing importance of hydrogen-containing compounds in relation to energy storage and generation (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>), locating hydrogen atoms in inorganic compounds is becoming increasingly vital.</p>

<p class="indent">The advantages of neutron diffraction stem from the fact that neutrons are scattered by nuclei rather than by the surrounding electrons. As a result, neutrons are sensitive to structural parameters that often complement those for X-rays. In particular, the scattering is not dominated by the heavy elements, which can be a problem with X-ray diffraction for most inorganic compounds. For example, locating the position of a light element such as H or Li in a material that also contains Pb can be impossible with X-ray diffraction, as almost all the electron density is associated with the Pb atoms. With neutrons, in contrast, the scattering from light atoms is often similar to that of heavy elements, so the light atoms contribute significantly to the intensities in the diffraction pattern. Thus neutron diffraction is frequently used in conjunction with X-ray diffraction techniques to define an inorganic structure more accurately in terms of atoms such as H, Li, and O when they are in the presence of heavier, electron-rich metal atoms. Typical applications include studies of the complex metal oxides, such as the high-temperature superconductors (where accurate oxide ion positions are required in the presence of metals such as Ba and Tl) and systems where H atom positions are of interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Another use for neutron diffraction is to distinguish nearly isoelectronic species. In X-ray scattering, pairs of neighbouring elements in a period of the periodic table, such as O and N or Cl and S, are nearly isoelectronic and scatter X-rays to about the same extent, so they are hard to tell apart in a crystal structure that contains them both. However, the atoms of these pairs do scatter neutrons to very different extents, N 50 per cent more strongly than O, and Cl about four times better than S, so the identification of the atoms is much easier than by X-ray diffraction.</p>
<p class="indent">A further property of neutrons, with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac bevelled='true'><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> is that they are also scattered by unpaired electrons, also having <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac bevelled='true'><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> In inorganic compounds that have ordered arrangements of unpaired electrons, such as ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>), this scattering will produce additional diffraction peaks, called magnetic scattering to distinguish it from the nuclear scattering (<a href="#fig_8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>).

<p class="indent">The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation used in chemistry ranges from the short wavelengths associated with &#x03B3;- and X-rays (about 1&#x2009;nm), to radiowaves with wavelengths of several metres (<a href="#fig_8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>). This spectrum covers the full range of atomic and molecular energies associated with characteristic phenomena such as ionization, vibration, rotation, and nuclear reorientation. Thus, X- and ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be used to determine the electronic structures of atoms and molecules and infrared (IR) radiation can be used to examine their vibrational behaviour. Radiofrequency (RF) radiation, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), can be used to explore the energies associated with reorientations of the nucleus in a magnetic field, and those energies are sensitive to the chemical environment of the nucleus. In general, absorption spectroscopic methods make use of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by a molecule or material at a characteristic frequency corresponding to the energy of a transition between the relevant energy levels. The intensity is related to the probability of the transition, which in turn is determined in part by symmetry rules, such as those described in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a> for vibrational spectroscopy.</p>

<p class="indent">The various spectroscopic techniques involving electromagnetic radiation have different associated timescales and this variation can influence the structural information that is extracted. When a photon interacts with an atom or molecule we need to consider factors such as the lifetime of any excited state and how a molecule may change during that interval. <a href="#tab8.2">Table 8.2</a> summarizes the timescales associated with various spectroscopic techniques discussed in this section. We see that IR spectroscopy takes a much faster snapshot of the molecular structure than NMR; thus if a molecule can reorientate or change its shape within a nanosecond the different states are distinguished by IR but not by NMR, which instead sees an average structure of the molecule. Such a species is said to be &#x2018;fluxional&#x2019; on the NMR timescale. The temperature at which data are collected should also be taken into account as molecular reorientation rates increase with increasing temperature.</p>

UV&#x2013;visible spectroscopy is among the most widely used techniques for studying inorganic compounds and their reactions, and most laboratories possess a UV&#x2013;visible spectrophotometer (<a href="#fig_8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>).

<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.3a">(a) Measuring a spectrum</h4>
<p class="noindent">The sample for a UV&#x2013;visible spectrum determination is usually a solution but may also be a gas or a solid. A gas or liquid is contained in a cell (a &#x2018;cuvette&#x2019;) constructed of an optically transparent material such as glass or, for UV spectra at wavelengths below 320&#x2009;nm, pure silica. Usually, the beam of incident radiation is split into two, one passing through the sample and the other passing through a cell that is identical except for the absence of the sample. The emerging beams are compared at the detector (a photodiode) and the absorption is obtained as a function of wavelength. Conventional spectrometers sweep the wavelength of the incident beam by changing the angle of a diffraction grating, but it is now more common for the entire spectrum to be recorded at once using a diode array detector. For solid samples, the intensity of UV&#x2013;visible radiation reflected from the sample is more easily measured than that transmitted through a solid, and an absorption spectrum is obtained by subtraction of the reflected intensity from the intensity of the incident radiation (<a href="#fig_8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">When the emphasis is on measurement of the intensities rather than the energies of transitions, the spectroscopic investigation is usually called <b>spectrophotometry</b>. Provided at least one of the species involved has a suitable absorption band, it is usually straightforward to carry out a &#x2018;spectrophotometric titration&#x2019; in which the extent of reaction is monitored by measuring the concentrations of the components present in the mixture. The measurement of UV&#x2013;visible absorption spectra of species in solution also provides a method for monitoring the progress of reactions and determining rate constants.</p>

<p class="indent">Techniques that use UV&#x2013;visible spectral monitoring range from those measuring reactions with half-lives of picoseconds (photochemically initiated by an ultrafast laser pulse) to the monitoring of slow reactions with half-lives of hours or even days. The <b>stopped-flow technique</b> (<a href="#fig_8.15">Fig. 8.15</a>) is commonly used to study reactions with half-lives of between 5&#x2009;ms and 10&#x2009;s and which can be initiated by mixing. Two solutions, each containing one of the reactants, are mixed rapidly by a pneumatic impulse, then the flowing, reacting solution is brought to an abrupt stop by filling a &#x2018;stop-syringe&#x2019; chamber, which triggers the monitoring of absorbance. The reaction can be monitored at a single wavelength or successive spectra can be measured very rapidly by using a diode array detector.</p>
<p class="indent">The spectral changes incurred during a titration or the course of a reaction also provide information about the number of species that form during its progress. An important case is the appearance of one or more <b>isosbestic points</b>, wavelengths at which two species have equal values for their molar absorption coefficients (<a href="#fig_8.16">Fig. 8.16</a>; the name comes from the Greek for &#x2018;equal extinguishing&#x2019;). The detection of isosbestic points in a titration or during the course of a reaction is evidence for there being only two dominant species (reactant and product) in the solution. It is extremely unlikely that three coloured species (hence an intermediate as well as reactant and product) could have the same molar absorption coefficient at one or more wavelengths.</p>

The emitted photon is normally at a lower energy than the exciting radiation because of losses to nonradiative process in the compound under investigation, such as vibrational modes. The origins and relationships between absorption and emission spectra of a compound are summarized in <a href="#fig_8.17">Figure 8.17</a>. The emission or fluorescence spectrum depends on the energy of the exciting radiation and experimentally it may be collected for a variety of incident wavelengths. Electronic absorption and emission spectra are often collected and analysed together. The luminescence spectrometer (<a href="#fig_8.18">Figure 8.18</a>) typically uses a xenon lamp as a source of excitation and a monochromator selects an excitation wavelength from the light produced in the range of 200 to 800&#x2009;nm. This monochromatic beam is directed onto the compound under investigation and its emission spectrum analysed, using a second monochromator, for photon energies between 200 and 900&#x2009;nm.</p>

<p class="indent">In inorganic chemistry, emission spectra are of particular interest for materials that are used as phosphors and in displays, where UV radiation, produced by a discharge in a mercury vapour, is converted into visible light. As with UV&#x2013;visible spectroscopy, transitions between the electronic energy levels of transition and f-block elements, which contain unpaired electrons, frequently cause emission in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, compounds of lanthanoid ions, such as Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Tm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.5">Section 23.5</a>), and some transition metal doped sulfides, for example Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-doped ZnS, are normally used in these applications. <a href="#fig_8.19">Figure 8.19</a> shows the emission spectrum collected from nanoparticles of CdSe/ZnS, known as quantum dots (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#box_24.5">Box 24.5</a>) as a function of particle size.

It is also used to detect the presence of known compounds (fingerprinting), to monitor changes in the concentration of a species during a reaction, to determine the components of an unknown compound (such as the presence of CO ligands), to determine a likely structure for a compound, and to measure properties of bonds (their force constants).

However, in polyatomic molecules each vibrational mode corresponds to the motion of different quantities of mass and this depends on the individual masses in a much more complicated way, and the &#x2018;effective mass&#x2019; is the more general term for use when discussing vibrational modes.</p>
</div>
<p class="indentt">A molecule consisting of <i>N</i> atoms can vibrate in 3<i>N</i>&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;6 different, independent ways if it is nonlinear and 3<i>N</i>&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;5 different ways if it is linear. These different, independent vibrations are called <b>normal modes</b>. For instance, a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule has four normal modes of vibration (as was shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig_6.16">Fig. 6.16</a>), two corresponding to stretching the bonds and two corresponding to bending the molecule in two perpendicular planes. Bending modes typically occur at lower frequencies than stretching modes and their effective masses, and therefore their frequencies, depend on the masses of the atoms in a complicated way that reflects the extent to which the various atoms move in each mode. The modes are labelled <i>&#x03BD;&#x03BD;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&#x03BD;&#x03BD;</i><sub>2</sub>, etc. and are sometimes given evocative names such as &#x2018;symmetric stretch&#x2019; and &#x2018;antisymmetric stretch&#x2019;. Only normal modes that correspond to a changing electric dipole moment can absorb infrared radiation, so only these modes are <b>IR active</b> and contribute to an IR spectrum. A normal mode is <b>Raman active</b> if it corresponds to a change in polarizability. As we saw in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, group theory is a powerful tool for predicting the IR and Raman activities of molecular vibrations.</p>

<p class="indentt">In early IR spectrometers, the transmission was measured as the frequency of the radiation was swept between two limits. Now the spectrum is extracted from an interferogram by <b>Fourier transformation</b>, which converts information in the time domain (based on the interference of waves travelling along paths of different lengths) to the frequency domain. The sample must be contained in a material that does not absorb IR radiation, which means that glass cannot be used and aqueous solutions are unsuitable unless the spectral bands of interest occur at frequencies not absorbed by water. Optical windows are typically constructed from CsI or CaF<sub>2</sub>. Traditional procedures of sample preparation include KBr pellets (where the sample is diluted with dried KBr and then pressed into a translucent disc) and paraffin mulls (where the sample is produced as a suspension that is then placed as a droplet between the optical windows). These methods are still widely used, although becoming more popular are total internal reflectance devices in which the sample is simply placed in position. A typical range of an IR spectrum is between 4000 and 250&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which corresponds to a range of wavelengths between 2.5 and 40&#x2009;&#x00B5;m; this range covers many important vibrational modes of inorganic bonds. <a href="#fig_8.20">Figure 8.20</a> shows a typical spectrum.</p>

<p class="indent">In Raman spectroscopy the sample is exposed to intense laser radiation in the visible region of the spectrum. Most of the photons are scattered elastically (with no change of frequency) but some are scattered inelastically, having given up some of their energy to excite vibrations. The latter photons have frequencies different from that of the incident radiation (<i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>0</sub>) by amounts equivalent to vibrational frequencies (<i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>i</sub>) of the molecule. A disadvantage of Raman compared to IR is that linewidths are usually much greater. Conventional Raman spectroscopy involves the photon causing a transition to a &#x2018;virtual&#x2019; excited state which then collapses back to a real lower state, emitting the detected photon in the process. The technique is not very sensitive but great enhancement is achieved if the species under investigation is coloured and the excitation laser is tuned to a real electronic transition. The latter technique is known as <b>resonance Raman spectroscopy</b> and is particularly valuable for studying the environment of d-metal atoms in enzymes (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#ch26">Chapter 26</a>) because only vibrations close to the electronic chromophore (the group primarily responsible for the electronic excitation) are excited and the many thousands of bonds in the rest of the molecule are silent.</p>
<p class="indent">Raman spectra may be obtained over a similar range to IR spectra (200&#x2013;4000&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and <a href="#fig_8.21">Fig. 8.21</a> shows a typical spectrum. Note that energy can be transferred <i>to</i> or <i>from</i> the sample: the former lead to <b>Stokes lines</b>, lines in the spectrum at energies lower (at a lower wavenumber and greater wavelength) than the excitation energy; the latter lead to <b>anti-Stokes lines</b>, which appear at energies higher than the excitation energy. Raman spectroscopy is often complementary to IR spectroscopy as the two techniques probe vibrational modes with different activities: one mode might correspond to a change in dipole moment and thus be detectable in the IR spectrum; another mode might correspond to a change in polarizability (a change in the electron distribution in a molecule caused by an applied electric field) and be seen in the Raman spectrum. We saw in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Section 6.5</a> that for group-theoretical reasons no mode can be both IR and Raman active in a molecule having a centre of inversion (the exclusion rule).</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.5c"><b>(c) Applications of IR and Raman spectroscopy</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">One important application of vibrational spectroscopy is in the determination of the shape of an inorganic molecule. A five-coordinate structure, AX<sub>5</sub> (where X is a single element) for instance, may adopt a square-pyramidal or trigonal-bipyramidal geometry having <i>C</i><sub>4v</sub> or <i>D</i><sub>3h</sub> symmetry, respectively.

A similar analysis of square-pyramidal geometry shows it has four IR active stretching modes (2A<sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;E, three bands) and five Raman active stretching modes (2A<sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;B<sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;E, four bands).

<p class="indentt">A major use of IR and Raman spectroscopy is the study of numerous compounds of the d block that contain carbonyl ligands, which give rise to intense vibrational absorption bands in a region where few other molecules produce absorptions. Free CO absorbs at 2143&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, but when coordinated to a metal atom in a compound the stretching frequency (and correspondingly the wavenumber) is lowered by an amount that depends on the extent to which electron density is transferred into the two &#x03C0; antibonding orbitals (the LUMOs) by back donation from the metal atom (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.5">Section 22.5</a>).

<h3 class="h3a"><b>Resonance techniques</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Several techniques of structural investigation depend on bringing energy-level separations into resonance with electromagnetic radiation, with the separations in some cases controlled by the application of a magnetic field. Two of these techniques involve <b>magnetic resonance</b>: in one, the energy levels are those of magnetic nuclei (nuclei with nonzero spin, <i>I</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;0); in the other, they are the energy levels of unpaired electrons.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_8.6">
<h3 class="h3">8.6 <b>Nuclear magnetic resonance</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Nuclear magnetic resonance is suitable for studying compounds containing elements with magnetic nuclei, especially hydrogen. The technique gives information on molecular structure, including chemical environment, connectivity, and internuclear separations. It also probes molecular dynamics and is an important tool for investigating rearrangement reactions occurring on a millisecond timescale</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Nuclear magnetic resonance</b> (NMR) is the most powerful and widely used spectroscopic method for the determination of molecular structures in solution and pure liquids. In many cases it provides information about shape and symmetry with greater certainty than is possible with other spectroscopic techniques, such as IR and Raman spectroscopy. It also provides information about the rate and nature of the interchange of ligands in fluxional molecules and can be used to follow reactions, in many cases providing exquisite mechanistic detail. The technique has been used to obtain the structures of protein molecules with molar masses of up to 30&#x2009;kg&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (corresponding to a molecular mass of 30&#x2009;kDa) and complements the more static descriptions obtained with X-ray single-crystal diffraction. However, unlike X-ray diffraction, NMR studies of molecules in solution generally cannot provide precise bond distances and angles, although they can provide some information on internuclear separations. It is a nondestructive technique because the sample can be recovered from solution after the resonance spectrum has been collected.</p>
<p class="indent">The sensitivity of NMR depends on several factors, including the abundance of the isotope and the size of its nuclear magnetic moment. For example, <sup>1</sup>H, with 99.98 per cent natural abundance and a large magnetic moment, is easier to observe than <sup>13</sup>C, which has a smaller magnetic moment and only 1.1 per cent natural abundance. With modern multinuclear NMR techniques it is particularly easy to observe spectra for <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, and <sup>31</sup>P, and useful spectra can also be obtained for many other isotopes. <a href="#tab8.4">Table 8.4</a> lists a selection of important NMR nuclei and their sensitivities. A common limitation for exotic nuclei is the presence of a nuclear quadrupole moment, a nonuniform distribution of electric charge (which is present for all nuclei with nuclear spin quantum number <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>&#x003E;</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math>
), which broadens signals and degrades spectra. Nuclei with even atomic numbers and even mass numbers (such as <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>16</sup>O) have zero spin and are invisible in NMR.</p>

<p class="indent">The chemical shifts of <sup>1</sup>H and other nuclei in various chemical environments are tabulated, so empirical correlations can often be used to identify compounds or the element to which the resonant nucleus is bound. For example, the H chemical shift in CH<sub>4</sub> is only 0.1 because the H nuclei are in an environment similar to that in the standard, tetramethylsilane, but the H chemical shift in GeH<sub>4</sub> is <i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;3.1 (<a href="#fig_8.25">Fig. 8.25</a>). Chemical shifts are different for the same element in inequivalent positions within a molecule because the local electron densities around the nuclei in different sites will be dissimilar. For instance, in ClF<sub>3</sub> the chemical shift of the unique <sup>19</sup>F nucleus is separated by &#x0394;<i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;120 from that of the other two F nuclei (<a href="#fig_8.26">Fig. 8.26</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Changes in the chemical shift are caused by the introduction of a paramagnetic species into the solution due to the local magnetic fields they produce. Measurement of this difference in chemical shift may be used to determine the number of unpaired electrons in the paramagnetic species (see the later section, <i>Magnetometry and magnetic susceptibility</i>).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.6c"><b>(c) Spin&#x2013;spin coupling</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Structural assignment is often helped by the observation of the spin&#x2013;spin coupling, which gives rise to multiplets in the spectrum due to interactions between nuclear spins. Spin&#x2013;spin coupling arises when the orientation of the spin of a nearby nucleus affects the energy of another nucleus and causes small changes in the location of the latter&#x2019;s resonance. The strength of spin&#x2013;spin coupling, which is reported as the spin&#x2013;spin coupling constant, <i>J</i> (in hertz, Hz), and is independent of the applied magnetic field, decreases rapidly with distance through chemical bonds, and in many cases is greatest when the two atoms are directly bonded to each other. In <b>first-order spectra</b>, which are being considered here, the coupling constant is equal to the separation of adjacent lines in a multiplet. As can be seen in <a href="#fig_8.25">Fig. 8.25</a>, <i>J</i>(<sup>1</sup>H&#x2013;<sup>73</sup>Ge)&#x2009;&#x2248;&#x2009;100&#x2009;Hz. The resonances of chemically equivalent nuclei do not display the effects of their mutual spin&#x2013;spin coupling. Thus, a single <sup>1</sup>H signal is observed for the CH<sub>3</sub>I molecule even though there is coupling between the H nuclei.</p>

<p class="noindent">The timescale of NMR is slow in the sense that structures can be resolved provided their lifetime is not less than a few milliseconds. For example, [Fe(CO)5] shows just one <sup>13</sup>C resonance, indicating that, on the NMR timescale, all five CO groups are equivalent. However, the IR spectrum (of timescale about 1&#x2009;ps) shows distinct axial and equatorial CO groups, and by implication a trigonal-bipyramidal structure. The observed <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of [Fe(CO)5] is the weighted average of these separate resonances.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Because the temperature at which NMR spectra are recorded can easily be changed, samples can often be cooled down to a temperature at which the rate of interconversion becomes slow enough for separate resonances to be observed. <a href="#fig_8.27">Figure 8.27</a>, for instance, shows the idealized <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectra of [RhMe(PMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] (<b>3</b>) at room temperature and at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. At low temperatures the spectrum consists of a doublet of doublets of relative intensity 3 near <i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;&#x2212;24, which arises from the equatorial P atoms (coupled to <sup>103</sup>Rh and the single axial <sup>31</sup>P), and a quartet of doublets of intensity 1, derived from the axial P atom (coupled to <sup>103</sup>Rh and the three equatorial <sup>31</sup>P atoms). At room temperature the scrambling of the PMe<sub>3</sub> groups makes them all equivalent and a doublet is observed (from coupling to <sup>103</sup>Rh).</p>
<p class="indent">Collection of spectra as a function of temperature allows the determination of the point at which the spectrum changes from the high-temperature form to the low-temperature form (&#x2018;the coalescence temperature&#x2019;). Further detailed analysis of these variable-temperature NMR data allows extraction of a value for the energy barrier to interconversion.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.6f"><b>(f) Solid-state NMR</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The NMR spectra of solids rarely show the high resolution that can be obtained from solution NMR. This difference is mainly due to anisotropic interactions such as dipolar magnetic couplings between nuclei, which are averaged in solution due to molecular tumbling, and long-range magnetic interactions arising from the fixed atomic positions. These effects mean that in the solid state chemically equivalent nuclei might be in different magnetic environments and so have different resonance frequencies. A typical result of these additional couplings is to produce very broad resonances, often more than 10&#x2009;kHz wide.</p>
<p class="indent">To average out anisotropic interactions, samples are spun at very high speeds (typically 10&#x2013;25&#x2009;kHz) at the &#x2018;magic angle&#x2019; (54.7&#x00B0;) with respect to the field axis. At this angle the interaction of parallel magnetic dipoles and quadrupole interactions, which typically vary as (1&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;3 cos<sup>2</sup> <i>&#x03B8;</i>), is zero. This so-called <b>magic-angle spinning</b> (MAS) reduces the effect of anisotropy substantially but often leaves signals that are still significantly broadened compared to those from solution. The broadening of signals can sometimes be so great that signal widths are comparable to the chemical shift range for some nuclei. This broadening is a particular problem for <sup>1</sup>H, which typically has a chemical shift range of &#x0394;<i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;10. Broad signals are less of a problem for nuclei such as <sup>195</sup>Pt, for which the range in chemical shifts is &#x0394;<i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;16 000, although this large range can be reflected in large anisotropic linewidths. Quadrupolar nuclei (those with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>&#x003E;</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math>) present additional problems as the peak position becomes field-dependent, and unless the nucleus is in a high-symmetry environment, e.g. tetrahedral or octahedral, the peak can no longer be identified with the chemical shift.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.7a"><b>(a) The <i>g</i> value</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">For a free electron <i>g</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;2.0023 but in compounds this value is altered by spin&#x2013;orbit coupling which changes the local magnetic field experienced by the electron. For many species, particularly d-metal complexes, <i>g</i> values may be highly anisotropic so that the resonance condition depends on the angle that the paramagnetic species makes with the applied field (<a href="#fig_8.31">Fig. 8.31</a>). The illustration shows the EPR spectra of frozen solutions or &#x2018;glasses&#x2019;, expected for isotropic (all three <i>g</i> values the same along perpendicular axes), axial (two the same), and rhombic (all three different) spin systems.</p>
<p class="indent">The sample (which is usually contained in a quartz tube) comprises the paramagnetic species in dilute form, either in the solid state (doped crystals or powders) or in solution. Relaxation is so efficient for d-metal ions that the spectra are often too broad to detect; consequently, liquid nitrogen and sometimes liquid helium are used to cool the sample. Frozen solutions behave as amorphous powders, so resonances are observed at all the <i>g</i> values of the compound, somewhat analogous to powder X-ray diffraction (<a href="#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>). More detailed studies can be made with oriented single crystals. Provided relaxation is slow, EPR spectra can also be observed at room temperature in liquids.</p>
<p class="indent">Spectra can also be obtained for systems having more than one unpaired electron, such as triplet states, but the theoretical background is much more complicated. Whereas species having an odd number of electrons are usually detectable, it may be very difficult to observe spectra for systems having an even number of electrons. <a href="#tab8.5">Table 8.5</a> shows the suitability of common paramagnetic species for EPR detection.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.7b"><b>(b) Hyperfine coupling</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <b>hyperfine structure</b> of an EPR spectrum, the multiplet structure of the resonance lines, is due to the coupling of the electron spin to any magnetic nuclei present. A nucleus with spin <i>I</i> splits an EPR line into 2<i>I</i>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;1 lines of the same intensity (<a href="#fig_8.32">Fig. 8.32</a>). A distinction is sometimes made between the hyperfine structure due to coupling to the nucleus of the atom on which the unpaired electron is primarily located and the &#x2018;superhyperfine coupling&#x2019;, the coupling to ligand nuclei. Superhyperfine coupling to ligand nuclei is used to measure the extent of electron delocalization and covalence in metal complexes (<a href="#fig_8.33">Fig. 8.33</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">If a sample containing <sup>57</sup>Fe (which occurs with 2 per cent natural abundance) is placed close to the source, the monochromatic &#x03B3;-ray emitted by <sup>57</sup>Fe&#x002A; can be expected to be absorbed resonantly. However, because changes in the exact electronic and magnetic environment affect the nuclear energy levels to a small degree, resonant absorption occurs only if the environment of the sample <sup>57</sup>Fe is chemically identical to that of the emitting <sup>57</sup>Fe&#x002A; nucleus. It might seem that the energy of the &#x03B3;-ray cannot easily be varied, but the Doppler effect can be exploited for moving the transmitting nucleus at a speed <i>v</i> relative to the sample and a frequency shift is induced of magnitude &#x0394;<i>&#x03BD;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;(<i>v</i>/<i>c</i>)<i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>&#x03B3;</sub>.

<p class="indent">The M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectrum of a sample containing iron in a single chemical environment can be expected to consist of a single line due to absorption of radiation at the energy required (&#x0394;<i>E</i>) to excite the nucleus from its ground state to the excited state. The difference between &#x0394;<i>E</i> of the sample and that of metallic <sup>57</sup>Fe is called the <b>isomer shift</b> and is expressed in terms of the velocity that is required to achieve resonance by the Doppler shift. The value of &#x0394;<i>E</i> depends on the magnitude of the electron density at the nucleus, and although this effect is primarily due to&#x2009;s electrons (because their wavefunctions are nonzero at the nucleus) shielding effects cause &#x0394;<i>E</i> to be sensitive to the number of p and d electrons too. As a result, different oxidation states, such as Fe(II), Fe(III), and Fe(IV), can be distinguished as well as ionic and covalent bonding.</p>

The theorem assumes that the energy involved in electron reorganization after ionization is offset by the increase in electron&#x2013;electron repulsion energy as the orbital contracts. This approximation is usually taken as reasonably valid.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two major types of photoionization technique: <b>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</b> (XPS) and <b>ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy</b> (UPS). Although much more intense sources can be obtained using synchrotron beam lines, the standard laboratory source for XPS is usually a magnesium or aluminium anode that is bombarded by a high-energy electron beam. This bombardment results in radiation at 1.254 and 1.486&#x2009;keV, respectively, due to the transition of a 2p electron into a vacancy in the 1s orbital caused by ejection of an electron. These energetic photons cause ionizations from core orbitals in other elements that are present in the sample; the ionization energies are characteristic of the element and its oxidation state. Because the linewidth is high (usually 1&#x2013;2&#x2009;eV), XPS is not suitable for probing fine details of valence orbitals but can be used to study the band structures of solids. The mean free path of electrons in a solid is only about 1&#x2009;nm, so XPS is suitable for surface elemental analysis, and in this application it is commonly known as <b>electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis</b> (ESCA).</p>
<p class="indent">The source for UPS is typically a helium discharge lamp that emits He(I) radiation (21.22&#x2009;eV) or He(II) radiation (40.8&#x2009;eV). Linewidths are much smaller than in XPS, so the resolution is far greater. The technique is used to study valence-shell energy levels, and the vibrational fine structure often provides important information on the bonding or antibonding character of the orbitals from which electrons are ejected (<a href="#fig_8.37">Fig. 8.37</a>). When the electron is removed from a nonbonding orbital the product is formed in its vibrational ground state, and a narrow line is observed. However, when the electron is removed from a bonding or antibonding orbital the resulting ion is formed in several different vibrational states and extensive fine structure is observed. Bonding and antibonding orbitals can be distinguished by determining whether the vibrational frequencies in the resulting ion are higher or lower than for the original molecule.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> X-ray absorption spectra can be used to determine the oxidation state of an element in a compound and to investigate its local environment</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">As mentioned in <a href="#sec_8.9">Section 8.9</a>, the intense X-ray radiation from synchrotron sources may be used to eject electrons from the cores of elements present in a compound. <b>X-ray absorption spectra</b> (XAS) are obtained by varying the photon energy across a range of energies at which electrons in the various atoms present in a compound can be excited and ionized (typically between 0.1 and 100&#x2009;keV). The characteristic absorption energies correspond to the binding energies of different inner-shell electrons of the various elements present. Thus the frequency of an X-ray beam may be swept across an absorption edge of a selected element and information on the oxidation state and neighbourhood of this chosen chemical element obtained.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_8.38">Figure 8.38</a> shows a typical X-ray absorption spectrum. Each region of the spectrum can provide different useful information on the chemical environment of the element under investigation:</p>

<p class="indenthanging" style="width:68%;"><b>2.</b> In the edge region, where the photon energy, <i>E</i>, is between <i>E</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;10&#x2009;eV, where <i>E</i><sub>i</sub> is the ionization energy, the &#x2018;X-ray absorption near-edge structure&#x2019; (XANES) is observed. Information that can be extracted from the XANES region includes oxidation state and the coordination environment, including any subtle geometrical distortions. The near-edge structure can also be used as a &#x2018;fingerprint&#x2019;, as it is characteristic of a specific environment and valence state. The presence and quantity of a compound in a mixture may be determined from analysis of this region of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="indenthanging" style="width:68%;"><b>3.</b> The &#x2018;near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure&#x2019; (NEXAFS) region lies between <i>E</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;10&#x2009;eV and <i>E</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;50&#x2009;eV.

<p class="indenthanging" style="width:68%;"><b>4.</b> The &#x2018;extended X-ray absorption fine structure&#x2019; (EXAFS) region lies at energies greater than <i>E</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;50&#x2009;eV. The photoelectrons ejected from a particular atom by absorption of X-ray photons with energies in this region may be backscattered by any adjacent atoms. This effect can result in an interference pattern that is detected as periodic variations in intensity at energies just above the absorption edge. In EXAFS these variations are analysed to reveal the nature (in terms of their electron density) and number of nearby atoms and the distance between the absorbing atom and the scattering atom. An advantage of this method is that it can provide bond lengths in amorphous samples and for species in solutions.</p>

<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> We need to understand how the energies of the orbitals involved in producing the pre-edge feature change with increasing manganese oxidation state.

The higher the oxidation state of manganese, the greater the effective nuclear charge experienced by the 1s electron and the greater the energy needed to excite or ionize it. This is reflected in the experimentally observed monotonic increase in pre-edge feature energy from Mn(II) to Mn(VII).

<h3 class="h3">8.11 <b>Mass spectrometry</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Mass spectrometry is a technique for determining the mass of a molecule and of its fragments</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Mass spectrometry</b> measures the mass-to-charge ratio of gaseous ions. The ions can be either positively or negatively charged, and it is normally trivial to infer the actual charge on an ion and hence the mass of a species. It is a destructive analytical technique because the sample cannot be recovered for further analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">The precision of measurement of the mass of the ions varies according to the use being made of the spectrometer (<a href="#fig_8.39">Fig. 8.39</a>). If all that is required is a crude measure of the mass, for instance to within &#x00B1;<i>m</i><sub>u</sub> (where <i>m</i><sub>u</sub> is the atomic mass constant, 1.66054&#x2009;&#x00D7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2212;27</sup>&#x2009;kg), then the resolution of the mass spectrometer need be of the order of only 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup>. In contrast, to determine the mass of individual atoms so that the mass defect can be determined, <a id="page_258" class="page">Page 258, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>the precision must approach 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup>. With a mass spectrometer of this precision, molecules of nominally the same mass such as <sup>12</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O (of mass 27.9949<i>m</i><sub>u</sub>) can be distinguished from <sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub> (of mass 28.0061<i>m</i><sub>u</sub>) and the elemental and isotopic composition of ions of nominal mass less than 1000<i>m</i><sub>u</sub> may be determined unambiguously.</p>

</figure>


<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.11a"><b>(a) Ionization and detection methods</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The major practical challenge with mass spectrometry is the conversion of a sample into gaseous ions. Typically, less than a milligram of compound is used. Many different experimental arrangements have been devised to produce gas-phase ions but all suffer from a tendency to fragment the compound of interest. <b>Electron impact ionization</b> (EI) relies on bombarding a sample with high-energy electrons to cause both vaporization and ionization. A disadvantage is that EI tends to induce considerable decomposition in larger molecules. <b>Fast atom bombardment</b> (FAB) is similar to EI, except that bombardment of the sample with fast neutral atoms is used to vaporize and ionize the sample; it induces less fragmentation than EI. <b>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization</b> (MALDI) is similar to EI, except that a short laser pulse is used to the same effect; this technique is particularly effective with polymeric samples. In <b>electrospray ionization</b> (ESI), droplets of a solution containing ionic species of interest are sprayed into a vacuum chamber where solvent evaporation results in generation of individually charged ions; ESI mass spectrometry is becoming more widely used and is often the method of choice for ionic compounds in solution.</p>
<p class="indent">In the traditional method of ion separation, the mass-to-charge discrimination is achieved by accelerating the ions with an electric field and then using a magnetic field to deflect the moving ions: ions with a lower mass-to-charge ratio are deflected more than heavier ions. As the magnetic field is changed, ions with different mass-to-charge ratio are directed on to the detector (<a href="#fig_8.39">Fig. 8.39</a>). In a <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF) mass spectrometer, the ions from a sample are accelerated by an electric field for a fixed time and then allowed to fly freely (<a href="#fig_8.40">Fig. 8.40</a>). Because the force on all the ions of the same charge is the same, the lighter ions are accelerated to higher speeds than the heavier ions and strike a detector sooner. In an <b>ion cyclotron resonance</b> (ICR) mass spectrometer (often denoted FTICR, for Fourier transform-ICR), ions are collected in a small cyclotron cell inside a strong magnetic field. The ions circle round in the magnetic field, effectively behaving as an electric current. Because an accelerated current generates electromagnetic radiation, the signal generated by the ions can be detected and used to establish their mass-to-charge ratio.</p>
<p class="indent">Mass spectrometry is most widely used in organic chemistry but is also very useful for the analysis of inorganic compounds. However, many inorganic compounds, such as those with ionic structures or covalently bonded networks (for example SiO<sub>2</sub>), are not volatile and do not fragment into molecular ion units (even with the MALDI technique) so cannot be analysed by this method. Conversely, the weaker bonding in some inorganic coordination compounds means that they fragment much more easily than organic compounds in the mass spectrometer.</p>

</figure>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_8.11b"><b>(b) Interpretation</b></h4>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig_8.41">Figure 8.41</a> shows a typical mass spectrum. To interpret a spectrum, it is helpful to detect a peak corresponding to the singly charged, intact molecular ion. Sometimes a peak occurs at half the molecular mass and is then ascribed to a doubly charged ion. Peaks from multiply charged ions are usually easy to identify because the separation between the peaks from the different isotopomers is no longer <i>m</i><sub>u</sub> but fractions of that mass. For instance, in a doubly charged ion, isotopic peaks are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>u</mtext></msub></mrow></math> apart, in a triply charged ion they are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></mstyle><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>u</mtext></msub></mrow></math> apart, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to indicating the mass of the molecule or ion that is being studied (and hence its molar mass), a mass spectrum also provides information about fragmentation pathways of molecules. This information can be used to confirm structural assignments. For example, complex ions often lose ligands and peaks are observed that correspond to the complete ion less one or more ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Multiple peaks are observed when an element is present as a number of isotopes (for instance, chlorine is 75.5 per cent <sup>35</sup>Cl and 24.5 per cent <sup>37</sup>Cl). Thus, for a molecule containing chlorine, the mass spectrum will show two peaks 2<i>m</i><sub>u</sub> apart in an intensity ratio of about 3:1. Different patterns of peaks are obtained for elements with a more complex isotopic composition and can be used to identify the presence of an element in compounds of unknown composition. An Hg atom, for instance, has six isotopes in significant abundance (<a href="#fig_8.42">Fig. 8.42</a>). The actual proportion of isotopes of an element varies according to its geographic source, and this subtle aspect is easily identified with high-resolution mass spectrometers. Thus, the precise determination of the proportions of isotopes can be used to determine the source of a sample.</p>

<p class="noindent">A classic application of physical techniques is to the determination of the elemental composition of compounds. The techniques now available are highly sophisticated and in <a id="page_260" class="page">Page 260, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>many cases can be automated to achieve rapid, reliable results. In this section we include thermal techniques that can be used to follow the phase changes of substances without change of composition, as well as processes that result in changes of composition. In each of these techniques the compound is usually destroyed during the analysis.</p>

<h3 class="h3">8.12 <b>Atomic absorption spectroscopy</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Almost every metallic element can be determined quantitatively by using the spectral absorption characteristics of atoms</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The principles of atomic absorption spectroscopy are similar to those of UV&#x2013;visible spectroscopy except that the absorbing species are free atoms, either neutral or charged. Unlike molecules, atoms do not have rotational or vibrational energy levels and the only transitions that occur are between electronic energy levels. Consequently, atomic absorption spectra consist of sharply defined lines rather than the broad bands typical of molecular spectroscopy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_8.44">Figure 8.44</a> shows the basic components of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The gaseous sample is exposed to radiation of a specific wavelength from a &#x2018;hollow cathode&#x2019; lamp, which consists of a cathode constructed of a particular element and a tungsten anode in a sealed tube filled with neon. If a particular element is present in the sample, the radiation emitted by the lamp characteristic for that element is reduced in intensity at the detector because it stimulates an electronic transition in the sample and is partly absorbed. By determining the level of absorption relative to standard materials a quantitative measurement can be made of the amount of the element present. A different lamp is required for each element that is to be analysed. Because the ionization process may produce spectral lines from other components of the analyte (the substance being analysed), a monochromator is placed after the atomizer to isolate the desired wavelength for passage to the detector.</p>

<p class="indent">The major differences in instrumentation arise from the different methods used to convert the analyte to free, unbound atoms or ions. In <b>flame atomization</b> the analyte solution is mixed with the fuel in a &#x2018;nebulizer&#x2019;, which creates an aerosol. The aerosol enters the burner where it passes into a fuel&#x2013;oxidant flame. Typical fuel&#x2013;oxidant mixtures are acetylene&#x2013;air, which produces flame temperatures of up to 2500 K, and acetylene&#x2013;nitrous oxide, which generates temperatures of up to 3000&#x2009;K. A common type of &#x2018;electrothermal atomizer&#x2019; is the graphite furnace. The temperatures reached in the furnace are comparable to those attained in a flame atomizer but detection limits can be 1000 times better. The increased sensitivity is due to the ability to generate atoms quickly and keep them in the optical path for longer. Another advantage of the graphite furnace is that solid samples may be used.</p>
<p class="indent">Almost every metallic element can be analysed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, although not all with high sensitivity nor a usefully low detection limit. For example, the detection limit for Cd in a flame ionizer is 1 part per billion (1&#x2009;ppb&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1 in 10<sup>9</sup>) whereas that for Hg is only 500&#x2009;ppb. Limits of detection using a graphite furnace can be as low as 1 part in 10<sup>15</sup>. Direct determination is possible for any element for which hollow cathode lamp sources are available. Other species can be determined by indirect procedures. For example,<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>PO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> reacts with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>MoO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> in acid conditions to form H<sub>3</sub>PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, which can be extracted into an organic solvent and analysed for molybdenum. To analyse for a particular element, a set of calibration standards is prepared in a similar matrix to the sample, and the standards and the sample are analysed under the same conditions.</p>

The sample is heated to 900&#x00B0;C in oxygen, and a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water, nitrogen, and nitrogen oxides is produced. A stream of helium sweeps the products into a tube furnace at 750&#x00B0;C, where copper reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and removes excess oxygen. Copper oxide converts carbon monoxide <a id="page_261" class="page">Page 261, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>to carbon dioxide. The resulting mixture of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> is analysed by passing it through a series of three thermal conductivity detector pairs. The first cell of the first detector pair measures the total conductivity of the gas mixture, water is then removed in a trap, and the thermal conductivity is measured again. The difference in the two conductivity values corresponds to the amount of water in the gas and thus the hydrogen content of the sample. A second detector pair separated by a carbon dioxide trap yields the carbon content and the remaining nitrogen is measured at the third detector. The data obtained from this technique are reported as mass percentage C, H, and N.</p>

<p class="indent">Oxygen may be analysed if the reaction tube is replaced with a quartz tube filled with carbon that has been coated with catalytic platinum. When the gaseous products are swept through this tube, the oxygen is converted to carbon monoxide, which is then converted to carbon dioxide by passage over hot copper oxide. The rest of the procedure is the same as described above. Sulfur can be measured if the sample is oxidized in a tube filled with copper oxide. Water is removed by trapping in a cool tube and the sulfur dioxide is determined at what is normally the hydrogen detector.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Qualitative and quantitative information on the elements present in a compound may be obtained by exciting and analysing X-ray emission spectra</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">As discussed in <a href="#sec_8.9">Section 8.9</a>, ionization of core electrons can occur when a material is exposed to short-wavelength X-rays. When an electron is ejected in this way, an electron from a higher-energy orbital can take its place and the difference in energy is released in the form of a photon, which is also typically in the X-ray region, with an energy characteristic <a id="page_262" class="page">Page 262, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>of the atoms present. This fluorescent radiation can be analysed by either energy-dispersive analysis or wavelength-dispersive analysis. By matching the peaks in the spectrum with the characteristic values of the elements it is possible to identify the presence of a particular element. This is the basis of the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique. The intensity of the characteristic radiation is also directly related to the amount of each element in the material. Once the instrument is calibrated with appropriate standards it can be used to determine quantitatively most elements with <i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;8 (oxygen). <a href="#fig_8.46">Figure 8.46</a> shows a typical XRF energy-dispersive spectrum.</p>

<p class="indent">A technique similar to XRF is used in electron microscopes (<a href="#sec_8.17">Section 8.17</a>), where the method is known as energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) or energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Here the X-rays generated by bombardment of a sample by energetic electrons result in the ejection of core electrons, and X-ray emission occurs as the outer electrons fall into the vacancies in the core levels. These X-rays are characteristic of the elements present and their intensities are representative of the amounts present. The spectrum can be analysed to determine qualitatively and quantitatively (using appropriate standards) the presence and amount of most elements (generally those with <i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;8) in the material. Quantitative information is not highly accurate; typically errors on determined percentages are at least a few per cent even with careful use of standards, and the accuracy is lowered further if the X-ray spectra of elements being investigated overlap.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Thermal methods include thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Thermal analysis</b> is the analysis of a change in a property of a sample induced by heating. The sample is usually a solid and the changes that occur include melting, phase transition, sublimation, and decomposition.</p>
<p class="indent">The analysis of the change in the mass of a sample on heating is known as <b>thermogravimetric analysis</b> (TGA). The measurements are carried out using a <i>thermobalance</i>, which consists of an electronic microbalance, a temperature-programmable furnace, and a controller, which enables the sample to be simultaneously heated and weighed (<a href="#fig_8.47">Fig. 8.47</a>). The sample is weighed into a sample holder and then suspended from the balance within the furnace. The temperature of the furnace is usually increased linearly, but more complex heating schemes, isothermal heating (heating that maintains constant temperature at a phase transition), and cooling protocols can also be used. The balance and furnace are situated within an enclosed system so that the atmosphere can be controlled. That atmosphere may be inert or reactive, depending on the nature of the investigation, and can be static or flowing. A flowing atmosphere has the advantage of carrying away any volatile <a id="page_263" class="page">Page 263, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>or corrosive species and prevents the condensation of reaction products. In addition, any species produced can be fed into a mass spectrometer for identification.</p>

<p class="indent">Thermogravimetric analysis is most useful for desorption, decomposition, dehydration, and oxidation processes. For example, the thermogravimetric curve for CuSO<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;5H<sub>2</sub>O from room temperature to 300&#x00B0;C shows three stepwise mass losses (<a href="#fig_8.48">Fig. 8.48</a>), corresponding to the three stages in the dehydration to form first CuSO<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;3H<sub>2</sub>O, then CuSO<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;H<sub>2</sub>O, and finally CuSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another widely used thermal method of analysis is <b>differential thermal analysis</b> (DTA). In this technique the temperature of the sample is compared to that of a reference material while they are both subjected to the same heating procedure. In a DTA instrument, the sample and reference are placed in low thermal conductivity sample holders that are then located within cavities in a block in the furnace. Common reference samples for the analysis of inorganic compounds are alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and carborundum (SiC). The temperature of the furnace is increased linearly and the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference is plotted against the furnace temperature. If an endothermic event takes place within the sample, the temperature of the sample lags behind that of the reference and a minimum is observed on the DTA curve. If an exothermic event takes place, the temperature of the sample rises above that of the reference and a maximum is observed on the curve. The area under the endotherm or exotherm (the resulting curve in each case) is related to the enthalpy change accompanying the thermal event. DTA is most useful for the investigation of processes such as phase changes, where one form of a solid changes to another and there is no weight change observed in the TGA experiment. Examples include the crystallization of amorphous glasses and the transition from one structure type to another (for example, the transition of TlI from a rocksalt structure type to a CsCl structure type that occurs on heating to 175&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="indent">A technique closely related to DTA is <b>differential scanning calorimetry</b> (DSC). In DSC, the sample and the reference are maintained at the same temperature throughout the heating procedure by using separate power supplies to the sample and reference holders. Any difference between the power supplied to the sample and reference is recorded against the furnace temperature. Thermal events appear as deviations from the DSC baseline as either endotherms or exotherms, depending on whether more or less power has to be supplied to the sample relative to the reference. In DSC, endothermic reactions are usually represented as positive deviations from the baseline, corresponding to increased power supplied to the sample. Exothermic events are represented as negative deviations from the baseline.</p>
<p class="indent">The information obtained from DTA and DSC is very similar. The former can be used up to higher temperatures although the quantitative data, such as the enthalpy of a phase change, obtained from DSC are more reliable. Both DTA and DSC are used to obtain a &#x2018;fingerprint&#x2019; comparison of the results obtained from a sample relative to a reference material.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Magnetometry is used to determine the characteristic response of a sample to an applied magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility provides information on the number of unpaired electrons in a metal complex</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The classic way of monitoring the magnetic properties of a sample is to measure the attraction into or repulsion out of an inhomogeneous magnetic field by monitoring the change in the apparent weight of a sample when the magnetic field is applied by using equipment known as a <b>Gouy balance</b> (<a href="#fig_8.49">Fig. 8.49</a>a). The sample is hung on one side of a balance by a fine thread so that one end of it lies in the field of a powerful electromagnet and the other end of the sample is in just the Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field. The sample is weighed with the electromagnet field applied and then with it turned off. From the change in apparent weight, the force acting on the sample as a result of the application of the field can be determined and, from this&#x2014;with a knowledge of various instrumental constants, sample volume, and the molar mass&#x2014;the molar susceptibility. The effective magnetic moment of a d-metal or f-block ion present in a material may be deduced from the magnetic susceptibility and used to infer the number of unpaired electrons and the spin state (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#ch20">Chapter 20</a>). In a <b>Faraday balance</b> a magnetic field gradient is generated between two curved magnets; this technique yields precise susceptibility measurements and also allows collection of magnetization data as a function of the magnitude and direction of the applied field.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The more modern <b>vibrating sample magnetometer</b> (VSM, <a href="#fig_8.49">Fig. 8.49</a>b) measures the magnetic properties of a material by using a modified version of a Gouy balance. The sample is placed in a uniform magnetic field, which induces a net magnetization. As the sample is vibrated, an electrical signal is induced in suitably placed pick-up coils. The signal has the same frequency of vibration and its amplitude is proportional to the induced magnetization. The vibrating sample may be cooled or heated, allowing a study of magnetic properties as a function of temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Measurements of magnetic properties are now made more routinely using a <b>superconducting quantum interference device</b> (SQUID, <a href="#fig_8.50">Fig. 8.50</a>). A SQUID makes use of the quantization of magnetic flux and the property of current loops in superconductors that are part of the circuit. The current that flows in the loop in a magnetic field is determined by the value of the magnetic flux and hence the magnetic susceptibility of the sample.</p>
<p class="indent">The <b>Evans method</b> can be used to determine the magnetic moment of the paramagnetic species <i>in solution</i> and thus the number of unpaired electrons. The technique uses the change in the NMR chemical shift of a dissolved species (<a href="#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>) that results from adding the paramagnetic species to the solution. This observed shift in resonance frequency, &#x0394;<i>&#x03BD;&#x03BD;</i> (in Hz), is related to the specific susceptibility <i>&#x03C7;</i><sub>g</sub> of the solute (cm<sup>3</sup>&#x2009;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) through the expression</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Cyclic voltammetry is used to measure reduction potentials and investigate coupled chemical reactions of redox-active species</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In <b>cyclic voltammetry</b> the current flowing due to interfacial electron transfer between an electrode and a species in solution is measured while the potential difference applied to the electrode is varied linearly with time, back and forth between two potential limits. Cyclic voltammetry provides direct information on reduction potentials and reactions coupled to redox chemistry, such as catalysis, and stabilities of products of oxidation or reduction. <a id="page_265" class="page">Page 265, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>The technique gives rapid qualitative insight into the redox properties of an electroactive compound and reliable quantitative information on its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. The solution containing the species of interest, usually a transition-metal complex, is contained in an electrochemical cell into which three electrodes are placed (<a href="#fig_8.51">Figure 8.51</a>). The &#x2018;working electrode&#x2019; at which the electrochemical reaction of interest occurs is usually constructed from platinum, silver, gold, or graphite. The reference electrode is normally a silver/silver-chloride electrode and the counter electrode is normally a piece of platinum. The role of the counter electrode is to complete the electrical circuit, ensuring that electrons do not need to pass across the reference&#x2013;solution interface. The concentration of electroactive species is usually quite low (less than 0.001&#x2009;mol&#x2009;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) and the solution contains a relatively high concentration of inert &#x2018;supporting&#x2019; electrolyte (at concentrations greater than about 0.1&#x2009;mol&#x2009;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) to provide conductivity. The potential difference is applied between the working electrode and the reference electrode and is scanned back and forth between two limits, tracing out a triangular waveform. The potential sweep rate can be varied between 1&#x2009;mV&#x2009;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 100&#x2009;V&#x2009;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, depending on the instrument and size of electrode.</p>

The half-cell reaction of interest occurs at the working electrode (WE), the potential of which is controlled with respect to the reference electrode (RE).

<p class="indent">To understand what is involved, consider the simple redox couple [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>/[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4&#x2212;</sup>, where, initially, only the reduced form (the Fe(II) complex) is present (<a href="#fig_8.52">Fig. 8.52</a>). No current flows while the electrode potential is sufficiently negative relative to the reduction potential. As the potential approaches the reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, the Fe(II) must be oxidized to preserve Nernstian equilibrium close to the working electrode, and a current starts to flow. This current rises to a peak, then decreases steadily because Fe(II) becomes depleted close to the electrode (the solution is unstirred) and must be supplemented by species diffusing from increasingly distant regions of the solution. Once the upper potential limit is reached, the potential sweep is reversed. Initially, Fe(II) diffusing to the electrode continues to be oxidized but eventually the potential difference becomes sufficiently negative to reduce the Fe(III) that had been formed; the current reaches a peak, then decreases gradually to zero as the lower potential limit is reached.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:0em;"><b><span class="red">Figure 8.52</span></b> The cyclic voltammogram for an electroactive species present in solution as the reduced form, and displaying a reversible one-electron reaction at an electrode. The peak potentials <i>E</i><sub>pa</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>pc</sub> for oxidation and reduction, respectively, are separated by 0.06&#x2009;V. The reduction potential is the mean of <i>E</i><sub>pa</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>pc</sub>.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The average of the two peak potentials is a good approximation to the reduction potential <i>E</i> under the prevailing conditions (<i>E</i> is not in general the standard potential because nonstandard conditions are usually adopted). In the ideal case, the oxidation and reduction peaks are similar in magnitude and separated by a small potential increment, which is usually (59&#x2009;mV)/<i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>e</sub> at 25&#x00B0;C, where <i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>e</sub> is the number of electrons transferred during the reaction at the electrode (see also <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>). This case is an example of a reversible redox reaction, with electron transfer at the electrode sufficiently fast that equilibrium is always maintained throughout the potential sweep. In such a case the current is usually limited by diffusion of electroactive species to the electrode.</p>
<p class="indent">Slow kinetic processes at the electrode result in a large separation of reduction and oxidation peaks that increases with increasing scan rate. This separation arises because an overpotential (effectively a driving force) is required to overcome barriers to electron transfer in each direction. Moreover, the peak due to a reduction or an oxidation in the initial part of the cycle process is often not matched by a corresponding peak in the reverse direction. This absence occurs because the species that is initially generated undergoes a further chemical reaction during the cycle and produces either a species with a different reduction potential or one that is not electroactive within the range of potential scanned. Inorganic chemists often refer to this behaviour as &#x2018;irreversible&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">An electrochemical reaction followed by a chemical reaction is known as an <b>EC process</b>. By analogy, a <b>CE process</b> is a reaction in which the species able to undergo the electrochemical (E) reaction must first be generated by a chemical (C) reaction. Thus, for a molecule that is suspected of decomposing upon oxidation, it may be possible to observe the initial unstable species formed by the E process provided the scan rate is sufficiently fast to re-reduce it before it undergoes further reaction. Consequently, by varying the scan rate, the kinetics of the chemical reaction can be determined.</p>
<p class="indent">The chemical step &#x2018;C&#x2019; is often a proton transfer reaction that is fast compared to electron transfer so that its kinetics cannot be determined. Even so, cyclic voltammetry provides a great deal of information on the thermodynamics of proton-coupled electron transfer that were described in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.6">Sections 5.6</a> and <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.14">5.14</a>. <a href="#fig_8.53">Figure 8.53a</a> shows the cyclic voltammetry of an Os(II) complex containing a single H<sub>2</sub>O ligand; two one-electron processes are revealed, generating first Os(III), then Os(IV). The separation between the potentials at which each process occurs and the fact that the return sweep regenerates first Os(III) then Os(II) shows that all species are stable. Carrying out the experiment over a wide pH range (0&#x2013;10) allows a Pourbaix diagram (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.14">Section 5.14</a>) to be constructed, as shown in <a href="#fig_8.53">Fig. 8.53b</a>. The interpretation <a id="page_266" class="page">Page 266, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>is that over the pH range 2&#x2013;9, oxidation of Os(II) to Os(III) results in loss of one proton (the slope is &#x2212;59&#x2009;mV/pH unit), and subsequent oxidation to Os(IV) results in loss of both protons and formation of an oxo-ligand. Bends in the data lines for Os(III)/Os(II) at pH 1.9 and pH 9.2 are ascribed to the pK values for the first deprotonations of Os(III) and Os(II), respectively, but no such deviations are observed in the data line for Os(IV)/Os(III), showing that the pK values for the second deprotonations of Os(III) or protonation of Os(IV) are out of range.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b>Microscopy</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Microscopy involves viewing materials, usually in solid form, on a scale which is smaller than can be resolved by the unaided human eye. Optical microscopy using visible light and lenses is widely used in crystallography to assess crystal quality prior to single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure determination (<a href="#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>). In addition to optical microscopy there are two key microscopy methods applied to the study of inorganic compounds and materials: <b>electron microscopy</b> and <b>scanning probe microscopy</b>. These techniques are able to visualize materials at much shorter distances, down to 1&#x2009;nm, and many of the advances made in nanosciences and nanotechnology (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#ch24">Chapter 24</a>) would not have occurred without the ability to characterize the nanoscale structural, chemical, and physical properties of materials.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Scanning tunnelling microscopy uses the tunnelling current from a sharp conductive tip to image and characterize a conductive surface; atomic force microscopy uses intermolecular forces to image the surface</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Scanning tunnelling microscopy</b> (STM) and <b>atomic force microscopy</b> (AFM) were the first discovered and are now most widely used examples of <b>scanning probe microscopies</b> (SPM). This family of techniques allows the three-dimensional imaging of the surface of materials by using a sharply pointed probe brought into close proximity (or in contact) with the specimen. As the probe is moved across the surface an image is constructed by monitoring the spatial variation in the value of a physical parameter such as potential difference, electric current, magnetic field, or mechanical force.</p>
<p class="indent">In STM, an atomically sharp conductive tip is scanned at about 0.3&#x2013;10&#x2009;nm above the surface of the sample (<a href="#fig_8.54">Figure 8.54</a>a). Electrons in the conductive tip, which is held either at a constant potential or at a constant height above the sample, can tunnel through the gap with a probability that is related exponentially to the distance from the surface. As a result, the electron tunnelling current reflects the distance between the sample and the tip. If the tip is scanned over the surface at a constant height, then the current represents the change in the topography of the surface. The movement of the tip at a constant height with great precision is accomplished by using piezoelectric ceramics for the displacement of the <a id="page_267" class="page">Page 267, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>tip. <a href="#fig_8.54">Figure 8.54</a>b shows the results of an STM study of a graphite substrate. In AFM, the atoms at the tip of the probe interact with the surface atoms of the sample through intermolecular forces (such as van der Waals interactions). The cantilever holding the probe bends up and down in response to the forces and the extent of deflection is monitored with a reflected laser beam. Variations on AFM include:</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindentt">An imaging electron microscope operates like a conventional optical microscope but instead of imaging photons, as in the visible microscope, electron microscopes use electrons. In these instruments, electron beams are accelerated through 1&#x2013;200&#x2009;kV and electric and magnetic fields are used to focus the electrons. In <b>transmission electron microscopy</b> (TEM) the electron beam passes through the thin sample being examined and is imaged on a phosphorescent screen. In <b>scanning electron microscopy</b> (SEM) the beam is scanned over the object and the reflected (scattered) beam is then imaged by the detector (<a href="#fig_8.55">Figure 8.55</a>). The ultimate resolution of SEM depends on how sharply the incident beam is focused on <a id="page_268" class="page">Page 268, Physical techniques in inorganic chemistry</a>the sample, how it is moved over the sample, and how much the beam spreads out into the sample before it is reflected, but features with dimensions of 1&#x2009;&#x00B5;m or less are typically resolved. In both microscopes, the electron probes cause the production of X-rays with energies characteristic of the elemental composition of the material. As such, <b>energy-dispersive spectroscopy</b> of these characteristic X-rays is used to quantify the chemical make-up of materials by using electron microscopes (<a href="#sec_8.14">Section 8.14</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The primary advantage of SEM over TEM is that it can form images of electron-opaque samples without the need for difficult specimen preparations: SEM is therefore the electron microscopy method of choice for the straightforward characterization of materials. However, SEM samples need to be conductive; otherwise electrons collect on the sample and interact with the electron beam itself, resulting in blurring. Nonconductive samples must therefore be coated with a thin layer of a conducting material, usually gold or graphitic carbon.</p>
