<p class="noindentd"><b>In this chapter we look at the occurrence and isolation of the Group 2 elements and study the chemical properties of their simple compounds, complexes, and organometallic compounds. Throughout the chapter we draw comparisons with the elements of Group 1 and show how the chemical properties of beryllium differ from those of the other Group 2 elements. We see how the insolubility of some of the calcium compounds in particular leads to the existence of many inorganic minerals that provide the raw materials for the infrastructure of our built environment and provide the building blocks from which many rigid biological structures are formed.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The elements calcium, strontium, barium, and radium are known as the <b>alkaline earth metals</b>, but the term is often applied to the whole of Group 2. All the elements are silvery white metals and the bonding in their compounds is normally described in terms of the ionic model (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Some aspects of the chemical properties of beryllium are more like those of a metalloid with a degree of covalence in its bonding. The elements are denser, harder, and less reactive than the elements of Group 1 but are still more reactive than many typical metals. The lighter elements beryllium and magnesium form a number of complexes and organometallic compounds.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindentt">Beryllium occurs naturally as the semiprecious mineral beryl, Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust and the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater; it is commercially extracted from seawater and from the mineral dolomite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>&#x22C5;MgCO<sub>3</sub>. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust but only the seventh most common in seawater because of the low solubility of CaCO<sub>3</sub>; it occurs widely in its carbonate as limestone, marble, and chalk, and it is a major component of biominerals, such as shells and coral. Calcium, strontium, and barium are all extracted by electrolysis of their molten chlorides. Radium can be extracted from uranium-bearing minerals, although all its isotopes are radioactive.</p>
<p class="indent">The greater mechanical hardness and higher melting points of the Group 2 compared with the Group 1 elements indicates an increase in the strength of metallic bonding on going from Group 1 to Group 2, which can be attributed to the increased number of electrons available (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>). The atomic radii of the Group 2 elements are smaller than those of Group 1. This reduction between the groups is responsible for their higher densities and ionization energies (<a href="#tab12.1">Table 12.1</a>). The ionization energies of the elements decrease down the group as the radius increases (<a href="#fig_12.1">Fig. 12.1</a>), and the elements become more reactive and more electropositive as it becomes easier to form the &#x002B;2 ions. This decrease in ionization energy is reflected in the trend in standard potentials for the M<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/M couples, which become more negative down the group. Thus, whereas calcium, strontium, barium, and radium react readily with cold water, magnesium reacts only with hot water:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15em;">
<img src="../images/page337-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">All the elements occur as hexagonal closed-packed structures with the exception of barium and radium, which adopt the more open body-centred cubic structure. The density decreases from Be to Mg to Ca (in contrast to the lighter Group 1 elements) as a result of very strong metallic bonding in the Group 2 elements, which leads to short metal&#x2013;metal distances in the lighter elements (225&#x2009;pm in beryllium, for instance) and as a result small unit cells. Beryllium is inert in air as its surface is passivated by the formation of a thin layer of BeO. Magnesium and calcium metals tarnish in air with the formation of an oxide layer, but will burn completely to their oxides and nitrides when heated. Strontium and barium, especially in powdered forms, ignite in air and are stored under hydrocarbon oils.</p>
<p class="indent">As with the Group 1 elements (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.1">Section 11.1</a>), flame tests are commonly used for the identification of the presence of the heavier Group 2 elements and their compounds:</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">All the elements occur as M(II) in their simple compounds, which is consistent with their <i>n</i>s<sup>2</sup> valence-electron configuration. Apart from Be, their compounds are predominantly ionic. With the exception of Be, the Group 2 elements form ionic (saline) hydrides; the anion present is the hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. In contrast, beryllium hydride adopts a three-dimensional network of linked BeH<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. Magnesium hydride, MgH<sub>2</sub>, loses hydrogen when heated above 250&#x00B0;C and is being studied as a hydrogen storage material. The hydrides react with water to produce hydrogen gas.</p>
<p class="indent">All the elements form halides, MX<sub>2</sub>, by direct combination of the elements. The halides of the elements other than Be, however, are normally formed from solution, such as by reaction of the metal hydroxide or carbonate with a hydrohalic acid (HX(aq), X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;Cl, Br, I) followed by dehydration of the resulting hydrous salt. The fluorides of the larger cations (from Ca to Ba) adopt the 8:4-coordinate fluorite structure (<a href="#fig_12.2">Fig. 12.2</a>), while MgF<sub>2</sub> crystallizes with a rutile structure with 6:3 coordination for the smaller Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion. The beryllium halides form covalently bonded networks of edge- or corner-linked tetrahedra.</p>
<p class="indent">Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white, insoluble solid with the wurtzite structure with 4:4 coordination, as expected for the small Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion; the oxides of the other Group 2 elements all adopt the rock-salt structure with 6:6 coordination. Magnesium oxide is insoluble but reacts slowly with water to form Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>; likewise CaO reacts with water to form the partially soluble Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The oxides of Sr and Ba, SrO and BaO, dissolve in water to form strongly basic hydroxide solutions:</p>

<p class="noindentt">which has recently been isolated in the salt SrBe(OH)<sub>4.</sub></p>
<p class="indent">The sulfides can be prepared by direct reaction of the elements, and adopt the rock-salt structure for all except Be, which has a sphalerite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.34">Fig. 3.34</a>). Beryllium carbide, Be<sub>2</sub>C, has an antifluorite structure formally containing Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and C<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> (methide) ions. The carbides of the other members of the group have the formula MC<sub>2</sub> and contain the dicarbide (acetylide) anion, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>C</mtext><mtext>2</mtext><mrow><mtext>2</mtext><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mtext>;</mtext></mrow></math> they react with water to generate ethyne, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The elements from Mg to Ra react directly with nitrogen when heated to produce the nitrides, M<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, which react with water to produce ammonia.</p>
<p class="indent">With the exception of the fluorides, the salts of singly charged anions are usually soluble in water, although beryllium salts&#x2014;once again on account of the highly polarizing nature of the Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion&#x2014;often hydrolyse in aqueous solutions with the formation of [Be(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH)]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The radium halides are the least soluble of the group halides and this property is used to extract radium using fractional crystallization. In general, the salts of the Group 2 elements are much less soluble in water than those of Group 1 on account of the higher lattice enthalpies of structures containing doubly charged cations, especially when they are in combination with highly charged anions: the carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates are insoluble or only sparingly soluble.</p>
<p class="indent">The carbonates and sulfates of the Group 2 elements have important roles in natural water systems, rock formation, and as materials for forming hard structures. The carbonates and sulfates are insoluble, as a result of the high lattice energy of structure formed from 2&#x002B; and 2&#x2212; ions. The solubility of calcium carbonate increases if CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved in the water, as in rainwater, owing to the formation of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> with its lower charge. &#x2018;Temporary hardness&#x2019; of water is caused by the presence of magnesium and calcium hydrogencarbonates; the cations are precipitated as carbonates on boiling solutions containing the hydrogencarbonates. Calcium carbonate is widely used by living organisms in the construction of hard structural biomaterials such as shells, bones, and teeth (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.17">Section 26.17</a>). When heated, an alkaline earth carbonate decomposes to the oxide, although for Sr and Ba this decomposition process requires temperatures above 800&#x00B0;C. Calcium sulfate is used widely in the construction industry (plaster) and occurs naturally as gypsum, which is the dihydrate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>&#x22C5;2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p class="indent">The Group 2 cations form complexes with charged polydentate ligands, such as the analytically important ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (edta; see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#tab7.1">Table 7.1</a>) and crown and crypt ligands. The most important macrocyclic complexes are the chlorophylls, which are porphyrin complexes of Mg and are involved in photosynthesis <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Sections 26.2</a>, <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.10">26.10</a>.</p>
<p><a id="page_339" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 339, The Group 2 elements</a></p>
<p class="indent">Beryllium forms an extensive series of organometallic compounds. Alkyl- and arylmagnesium halides are very well known as Grignard reagents and are widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, where they behave as a source of alkyl and aryl anions.</p>

<p class="noindentt">The small size of Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (ionic radius 27&#x2009;pm) and its consequent high charge density and polarizing power results in the compounds of Be being largely covalent; the ion is a strong Lewis acid.

<h3 class="h3d">PART B: <b>THE DETAIL</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this section we present a more detailed discussion of the chemistry of the elements of Group 2 and their compounds. Because the bonding in the compounds formed by these elements is usually ionic (as always, bearing in mind the individuality of Be) we can usually interpret their properties in terms of the ionic model.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_12.4">
<h3 class="h3">12.4 <b>Occurrence and extraction</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Magnesium is the only Group 2 element extracted on an industrial scale; magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium can be extracted from the molten chloride.</b></p>
<p><a id="page_340" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 340, The Group 2 elements</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Beryllium occurs naturally as the semiprecious mineral beryl, Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, from which its name is taken. Beryl is the basis of the gemstone emerald, in which a small fraction of Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is replaced by Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. Beryllium is extracted by heating beryl with sodium hexafluorosilicate, Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, to produce BeF<sub>2</sub>, which is then reduced to the element by magnesium.</p>
<p class="indent">Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. It occurs naturally in a number of minerals such as dolomite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>&#x22C5;MgCO<sub>3</sub>, and magnesite, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, and is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater (after Na and Cl), from which it is commercially extracted. A litre of seawater contains more than 1&#x2009;g of magnesium ions. The extraction from seawater relies on the fact that magnesium hydroxide is less soluble than calcium hydroxide because the solubility of the salts of mononegative anions increases down the group (<a href="#sec_12.11">Section 12.11</a>). Either CaO (quicklime) or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (slaked lime) is added to seawater and Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> precipitates. The hydroxide is converted to the chloride by treatment with hydrochloric acid:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-13em;">
<img src="../images/page340-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The magnesium is then extracted by electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-16em;">
<img src="../images/page340-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Magnesium is also extracted from dolomite which is initially heated in air to give magnesium and calcium oxides. This mixture is heated with ferrosilicon (FeSi), which forms calcium silicate, Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, iron, and magnesium. Magnesium is a liquid at the high operating temperatures used in the process and can be removed by distillation.</p>
<p class="indent">A major problem in the production of magnesium is its high reactivity towards water, oxygen, and moist air. Nitrogen, which is commonly used to provide an inert atmosphere for the production of many other reactive metals, cannot be used for magnesium because it reacts to form the nitride, Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. Sulfur hexafluoride or sulfur dioxide added to dry air are used as alternatives to nitrogen as these gases inhibit the formation of MgO. Although hot and liquid magnesium are very reactive towards oxygen and water, the metal can be handled safely under ambient conditions on account of the presence of an inert passivating oxide film on its surface.</p>
<p class="indent">Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust and occurs widely as limestone, CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The name &#x2018;calcium&#x2019; comes from the Latin <i>calx</i>, which means &#x2018;lime&#x2019;. Calcium concentrations in seawater are lower than those of magnesium because of the lower solubility of CaCO<sub>3</sub> compared with MgCO<sub>3</sub> and the greater use of calcium by marine organisms. The element is a major component of biominerals such as bone, shells, and teeth, and is central to cell signalling processes such as hormonal or electrical activation of enzymes in higher organisms (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.4">Sections 26.4</a>, <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.17">26.17</a>). The average adult human contains approximately 1&#x2009;kg of calcium. Calcium binds strongly to oxalate ions to form insoluble Ca(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>); kidney stones are formed when this reaction occurs in the kidneys.</p>
<p class="indent">Calcium is extracted by electrolysis of the molten chloride, which is itself obtained as a by-product of the Solvay process for the production of sodium carbonate (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.11">Section 11.11</a>). Calcium tarnishes in air and ignites on heating with the formation of calcium oxide and nitride. Strontium is named after the Scottish village of Strontian where the strontium-containing ore was first found. It is extracted by electrolysis of molten SrCl<sub>2</sub> or by reduction of SrO with Al:</p>

<p class="noindent">The metal reacts vigorously with water and as a finely divided powder ignites in air; initially the product is SrO but, once burning, the nitride, Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, is also formed. Barium is extracted by electrolysis of the molten chloride or by reduction of BaO with Al. It reacts very vigorously with water and ignites readily in air.</p>
<p class="indent">All the isotopes of radium are radioactive. They undergo &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, and &#x03B3; decay with half-lives that vary from 42 minutes to 1599 years. Radium was discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1898 after painstaking extraction from the uranium-bearing mineral pitchblende. Pitchblende is a complex mineral containing many elements: it contains approximately 1&#x2009;g of Ra in 10&#x2009;t of ore and it took the Curies three years to isolate 0.1&#x2009;g of RaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">12.5 <b>Uses of the elements and their compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Magnesium and its compounds have major applications in pyrotechnics, alloys, and common medicines; calcium compounds are widely used in the construction industry; magnesium and calcium are very important for biological function.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Beryllium is unreactive in air on account of a passivating layer of an inert oxide film on its surface, which makes it very resistant to corrosion. This inertness, combined with the fact that it is one of the lightest metals, results in its use in alloys to make precision instruments, aircraft, and missiles. It is highly transparent to X-rays because of its low atomic number (and thus electron count) and is used for X-ray tube windows. An alloy of beryllium with copper and aluminium has excellent fatigue or failure resistance to spring and stressed functions; applications include automobile suspensions, electromechanical devices, and the springs in computer keyboards and printers. Beryllium is also used as a moderator for nuclear reactions (where it slows down fast-moving neutrons through inelastic collisions) because the beryllium nucleus is a very weak absorber of neutrons and the metal has a high melting point.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the applications of elemental magnesium are based on the formation of light alloys, especially with aluminium, that are widely used in construction in applications where weight is an issue, such as aircraft. A magnesium&#x2013;aluminium alloy was previously used in warships but was discovered to be highly flammable when subjected to missile attack. Some of the uses of magnesium are based on the fact that the metal burns in air with an intense white flame, and so it is used in fireworks and flares.</p>
<p class="indent">As beryllium oxide is extremely toxic and carcinogenic by inhalation and soluble beryllium salts are mildly poisonous, the industrial applications of beryllium compounds are limited. BeO is used as an insulator in high-power electrical devices where high thermal conductivity is also necessary. Various applications of magnesium compounds include &#x2018;Milk of Magnesia&#x2019;, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which is a common remedy for indigestion, and &#x2018;Epsom Salts&#x2019;, MgSO<sub>4</sub>&#x22C5;7H<sub>2</sub>O, which is used for a variety of health treatments, <a id="page_341" class="page">page 341, The Group 2 elements</a>including as a treatment for constipation, a purgative, and a soak for sprains and bruises. Magnesium oxide, MgO, is used as a refractory lining for furnaces. Organomagnesium compounds are widely used in organic synthesis as Grignard reagents (<a href="#sec_12.13">Section 12.13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The compounds of calcium are much more useful than the element itself. Calcium oxide (as lime or quicklime) is a major component of mortar and cement (<a href="#box_12.1">Box 12.1</a>). It is also used in steelmaking and papermaking. Calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>&#x22C5;2H<sub>2</sub>O, is widely used in building materials, such as plasterboard, and anhydrous CaSO<sub>4</sub> is a common drying agent. Calcium carbonate is used in the Solvay process (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.11">Section 11.11</a>) for the production of sodium carbonate (except in the US, where sodium carbonate is mined as trona) and as the raw material for production of CaO. Calcium fluoride is insoluble and transparent over a wide range of wavelengths. It is used to make cells and windows for infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers.</p>
<p class="indent">Strontium is used in pyrotechnics (<a href="#box_12.2">Box 12.2</a>), in phosphors, and in glasses for the now rapidly declining market for colour television tubes. Barium compounds, taking advantage of the large number of electrons of each Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion, are very effective at absorbing X-rays: they are used as &#x2018;barium meals&#x2019; and &#x2018;barium enemas&#x2019; to investigate the intestinal tract. Barium is highly toxic, so the insoluble sulfate is used in this application. Barium carbonate is used in glassmaking and as a flux to aid the flow of glazes and enamels. It is also used as rat poison. The sulfide has been used as a depilatory, to remove unwanted body hair. Barium sulfate is pure white, with no absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is used as a reference standard in UV&#x2013;visible spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.3">Section 8.3</a>)</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">Cement is made by grinding together limestone and a source of aluminosilicates, such as clay, shale, or sand, and then heating the mixture to 1500&#x00B0;C in a rotary cement kiln. The first important reaction to occur in the lower-temperature portion of the kiln (900&#x00B0;C) is the calcining of limestone (the process of heating to a high temperature to oxidize or decompose a substance and convert it to a powder), when calcium carbonate (limestone) decomposes to calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide is driven off. At higher temperatures the calcium oxide reacts with the aluminosilicates and silicates to form molten Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>, and Ca<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The relative proportions of these compounds determine the properties of the final cement. As the compounds cool, they solidify into a form called <i>clinker</i>. The clinker is ground to a fine powder and a small amount of calcium sulfate (gypsum) is added to form Portland cement.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Concrete is produced by mixing cement with sand, gravel, or crushed stone and water. Often small amounts of additives are added to achieve particular properties. For example, flow and dispersion are improved by adding polymeric materials such as phenolic resins, and resistance to frost damage is improved by adding surfactants. When the water is added to the cement, complex hydration reactions occur that produce hydrates such as Ca<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&#x22C5;H<sub>2</sub>O, Ca<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&#x22C5;3H<sub>2</sub>O, and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>:</p>

</figure>
<p class="boxpara">These hydrates form a gel or slurry that coats the surfaces of the sand or aggregates and fills the voids to form the solid concrete. The properties of concrete are determined by the relative proportions of calcium silicates and calcium aluminosilicates in the cement used, the additives, and the amount of water, which determines the degree of hydration.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The raw materials for cement manufacture often contain traces of sodium and potassium sulfates, and sodium and potassium hydroxides are formed during the hydration process. These hydroxides are responsible for the cracking, swelling, and distortion of many ageing concrete structures. The hydroxides take part in a complex series of reactions with the aggregate material to form an alkali silicate gel. This gel is hygroscopic and expands as it absorbs water, producing stress in the concrete, which leads to cracking and deformation. The susceptibility of concrete to this &#x2018;alkali silicate reaction&#x2019; is now monitored by calculating the total alkali levels in the concrete produced, and strategies are in place to minimize its effects. For example, adding &#x2018;fly ash&#x2019;, a waste product from coal-fired power stations, to the mix can reduce the problem.</p>

<p class="boxpara">Fireworks use exothermic reactions to produce heat, light, and sound. Common oxidants are nitrates and perchlorates, which decompose when heated to liberate oxygen. Common fuels are carbon, sulfur, powdered aluminium or magnesium, and organic materials such as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), starch, and gums. The most common constituent of fireworks is gunpowder or black powder, a mixture of potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal, and thus both an oxidant and a fuel. Special effects, such as colours, flashes, smoke, and noises, are provided by additives to the firework mixture. The Group 2 elements are used in fireworks to provide colour.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Barium compounds are added to fireworks to produce green flames. The species responsible for the colour is BaCl<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which is produced when Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions combine with Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions. The Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions are produced during decomposition of the perchlorate oxidant or during combustion of the PVC fuel:</p>

Strontium chlorate and perchlorate are effective at producing the red colour but are too unstable to shock and friction for routine use.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Distress flares also use strontium compounds. Strontium nitrate is mixed with sawdust, waxes, sulfur, and KClO<sub>4</sub> and packed into a waterproof tube. When ignited, the flares burn with an intense red flame for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="boxparai">As well as being used as a fuel, powdered magnesium is added to fireworks and flares to maximize light output. As well as the magnesium producing an intense white light, illumination is increased by the incandescence of high-temperature MgO particles that are produced in the oxidation reaction.</p>

Luminous radium paint was once widely used on clock and watch faces but has been replaced by less hazardous phosphorescent compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Magnesium and calcium are of great biological importance. Magnesium is a component of chlorophyll but also it is coordinated by many other biologically important ligands, including ATP (adenosine triphosphate, <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Section 26.2</a>). It is essential for human health, being responsible for the activity of many enzymes.

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> All the Group 2 elements form saline hydrides with the exception of beryllium, which forms a polymeric covalent compound.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Like the Group 1 elements, the Group 2 elements, with the exception of Be, form ionic, saline hydrides that contain the H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion. They can be prepared by direct reaction between the metal and hydrogen. Beryllium hydride is covalent and must be prepared from alkylberyllium (<a href="Chapter12.xhtml#sec_12.13">Section 12.13</a>). It has a three-dimensional network structure with bridging H atoms (<a href="#fig_12.3">Fig. 12.3</a>); the long-held view that it is a linear chain is incorrect.</p>
<p class="indent">The ionic hydrides of the heavier elements react violently with water to produce hydrogen:</p>

For hydrogen storage, a reversible reaction involving uptake of hydrogen near room temperature is needed. Magnesium hydride loses hydrogen on heating above 250&#x00B0;C so the process</p>

Attempts to reduce the decomposition temperature to closer to room temperature involve making complex magnesium hydrides doped with other metals, fabricating nano-particulate forms, and forming molecular complexes with magnesium hydride cores (<a href="#box_12.3">Box 12.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Calcium hydride is used as a desiccant for amine solvents, removing water through the formation of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen gas. This reaction with water is also a convenient source of hydrogen gas used for inflating weather balloons and life rafts.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The kinetics can be greatly improved by doping MgH<sub>2</sub> with transition metals, particularly Ti as TiH<sub>2</sub>, by ball milling the solid to decrease particle size, or through treatment with fluoride-containing solutions. Consideration of the thermodynamics of the MgH<sub>2</sub> decomposition reaction show a positive enthalpy for this reaction of 74.4&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which derives from the very high lattice enthalpy of MgH<sub>2</sub>(s) (&#x0394;<sub>L</sub><i>H</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;2718&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) relative to that of Mg(s) (&#x0394;<sub>L</sub><i>H</i>&#x003D; 147&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).

Consequently, bulk MgH<sub>2</sub> cannot be used for the reversible storage of hydrogen under, or near, ambient conditions.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Theoretical calculations demonstrate that for subnanometer-sized solid MgH<sub>2</sub> or (MgH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> clusters (<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;20), the enthalpy of decomposition decreases sharply because of the reduced lattice enthalpy of a high-surface-area particle; surface ions have low coordination numbers and thus a reduced contribution to the lattice enthalpy in the Born&#x2013;Mayer equation (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.12">Section 3.12</a>). A decomposition temperature of about 200&#x00B0;C has been estimated for very small clusters of (MgH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>.

<p class="noindent">The anhydrous halides of magnesium can be prepared by the direct combination of the elements or, for strontium and barium, dehydration of the hydrated halide salt; preparation from aqueous solutions yields the hydrated salts, which, for the lighter elements, are partially hydrolysed on heating. All the fluorides except BeF<sub>2</sub> are sparingly soluble, although the solubility increases slightly down the group. As the radius of the cation increases from Be to Ba, the coordination number in the fluorides increases from 4 to 8; BeF<sub>2</sub> forms structures analogous to those of SiO<sub>2</sub> (such as quartz, 4:2 coordination), MgF<sub>2</sub> adopts the rutile structure (6:3) and CaF<sub>2</sub>, SrF<sub>2</sub>, and BaF<sub>2</sub> adopt the fluorite structure (8:4) (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). The other halides of Group 2 form layer structures, reflecting the increasing polarizability of the halide ions. Magnesium chloride adopts the CdCl<sub>2</sub> layered structure, in which the layers are arranged so that the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions are cubic close-packed (<a href="#fig_12.4">Fig. 12.4</a>). Both MgI<sub>2</sub> and CaI<sub>2</sub> adopt the closely related cadmium-iodide structure in which the layers of I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions are hexagonal close-packed.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important fluoride of the group is CaF<sub>2</sub>. Its mineral form, fluorite or fluorspar, is the only large-scale source of fluorine. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is prepared by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid on fluorspar:</p>

Magnesium chloride is the most important chloride for industry and applications. It is extracted from seawater and then used in the production of magnesium metal. Calcium chloride is also of great importance and is produced on a massive scale industrially. Its hygroscopic character leads to its widespread use as a laboratory drying agent. Both MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> are used to de-ice roads, where they are more effective than NaCl for two reasons. First, the dissolution is very exothermic:</p>

<p class="noindent">The heat generated helps to melt the ice. Second, the minimum freezing mixture of CaCl<sub>2</sub> in water has a freezing point of &#x2212;55&#x00B0;C, compared to &#x2212;18&#x00B0;C for that of NaCl in water. Calcium and magnesium chlorides are also less toxic than NaCl to plant life <a id="page_344" class="page">page 344, The Group 2 elements</a>surrounding roads and are less corrosive to iron and steel. The exothermic dissolution of the chlorides also leads to applications in instant-heating packs and self-heating drink containers.</p>
<p class="indent">Radium has the least soluble halides as a result of the low hydration enthalpy of the large Ra<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion; the solubilities of RaCl<sub>2</sub> and BaCl<sub>2</sub> at 20&#x00B0;C are &#x223C;200&#x2009;g&#x2009;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> and &#x223C;350&#x2009;g&#x2009;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, respectively.

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> All the Group 2 elements form normal oxides by reaction with oxygen, except Ba, which forms the peroxide; all the peroxides decompose to the oxides, their stabilities increasing down the group.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Beryllium oxide is obtained by ignition of the metal in oxygen. It is a white, insoluble solid with the wurtzite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Its high melting point (2570&#x00B0;C), low reactivity, and excellent thermal conductivity, the highest of any oxide, lead to its use as a refractory material. It is highly toxic on inhalation, leading to chronic beryllosis, a disease of the lungs, and cancer. This problem is exacerbated by its low density (3.0&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>), as dust particles remain airborne for long periods, but BeO is safe for many applications when used as a sintered monolith. In combination with electropositive metals beryllium forms complex beryllates, such as K<sub>2</sub>BeO<sub>2</sub> and La<sub>2</sub>Be<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which contain BeO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra and are structurally analogous to silicates.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxides of the other Group 2 elements can be obtained by direct combination of the elements (except Ba, which forms the peroxide) but they are more commonly obtained by decomposition of the carbonates:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.5em;">
<img src="../images/page344-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The oxides of the elements from Mg to Ba all adopt the rock-salt structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Their melting points decrease down the group as the lattice enthalpies decrease with increasing cation radius. Magnesium oxide only melts at 2852&#x00B0;C, and is used as a refractory lining in industrial furnaces. Like BeO, MgO has a high thermal conductivity coupled with a low electrical conductivity. This combination of properties leads to its use as an electrically insulating material around the heating elements of domestic appliances and in electrical cables.</p>
<p class="indent">Calcium oxide (as lime or quicklime) is used in large quantities in the steel industry to remove P, Si, and S. When heated, CaO is thermoluminescent and emits a bright white light (hence &#x2018;limelight&#x2019;). Calcium oxide is also used as a water softener to remove hardness by reacting with soluble carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to form the insoluble CaCO<sub>3</sub>. It reacts with water to form Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which is sometimes known as <i>slaked lime</i> and is used to neutralize acidic soils.</p>
<p class="indent">The peroxides SrO<sub>2</sub> and BaO<sub>2</sub> can be made by direct reaction of the elements while the insoluble peroxides of Mg and Ca are obtained by addition of sodium peroxide, NaO<sub>2</sub> to aqueous solutions of these metals. All the peroxides are strong oxidizing agents and decompose to the oxide:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.7em;">
<img src="../images/page344-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The thermal stability of the peroxides increases down the group as the radius of the cation increases. This trend is explained by considering the lattice enthalpies of the peroxide and the oxide and their dependence on the relative radii of the cations and anions. As O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> is smaller than <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mi>O</mi><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> the lattice enthalpy of the oxide is greater than that of the corresponding peroxide. The difference between the two lattice enthalpies decreases down the group as both values become smaller with increasing cation radius, so the tendency to decompose decreases. Magnesium peroxide, MgO<sub>2</sub>, is consequently the least stable peroxide and is used as an <i>in situ</i> source of oxygen in a range of applications, including bioremediation to clean up polluted waterways. CaO<sub>2</sub> has similar applications in disinfecting water and as a flour-bleaching agent.</p>

The range of ionic radii available, from Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (72&#x2009;pm for <a id="page_345" class="page">page 345, The Group 2 elements</a>coordination number 6) to Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (142&#x2009;pm and larger for coordination number 8 and higher) means that complex oxides can be synthesized that contain these cations in a large variety of different structure types. Important examples of such complex oxides include the ferroelectric perovskite BaTiO<sub>3,</sub> the phosphor SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu, and many of the high-temperature superconductors, for example YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>).

<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> First, we need to be aware that a binary compound such as CaSe is likely to adopt one of the simple AX structure types described in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>; then we can use the radius-ratio rule to guide us to the likely structural type. Two of the AX structure types have face-centred lattice types, namely rock-salt and zinc-blende. The radius ratio is (100&#x2009;pm)/(194&#x2009;pm)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0.52, which according to <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.6">Table 3.6</a> suggests that the rock-salt structure is preferred. The lattice parameter for the rock-salt structure is calculated by considering the unit cell in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.30">Fig. 3.30</a> as it is equal to the length of the side of the unit cell. As can be seen from the figure, this length is twice the sum <i>r</i>(Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>)&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>r</i>(Se<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>).

The most common forms are calcite, aragonite, and vaterite (<a href="#fig_12.7">Fig. 12.7</a>; <a href="#box_12.4">Box 12.4</a>). Calcium carbonate is an important biomineral and a major constituent of bones and shells (<a href="#box_12.5">Box 12.5</a>).

<p class="boxpara">Calcium carbonate occurs as vast deposits of sedimentary rocks that are formed from the fossilized remains of marine creatures. The most common and stable form is the hexagonal <i>calcite</i>, which has been identified in numerous different crystalline forms. Calcite comprises about 4 per cent by mass of the Earth&#x2019;s crust and is formed in many different geological environments. Calcite can form rocks of considerable mass and constitutes a significant part of all three major rock classification types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Calcite is a major component in the igneous rock called carbonatite and forms the major portion of many hydrothermal veins. Limestone is the sedimentary form of calcite.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Limestone metamorphoses to marble from the heat and pressure of metamorphic events, which increase the density of the rock and destroy any texture. Pure white marble is the result of metamorphism of very pure limestone. The characteristic swirls and veins of many coloured marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as clay, silt, sand, and iron oxides. <i>Iceland spar</i> is a form of transparent, colourless calcite originally found in Iceland. It exhibits birefringence. Birefringence, or double refraction, is the division of a ray of light into two rays when it passes through certain types of material, depending on the polarization of the light. This behaviour is explained by assigning two different refractive indices to the material for different polarizations. As the two beams exit the crystal they are bent into two different angles of refraction.</p>
<p class="boxparai"><i>Aragonite</i> is a less abundant polymorph of calcite. Aragonite is orthorhombic with three crystal forms. It is less stable than calcite and converts into it at 400&#x00B0;C and, given enough time, aragonite in the environment will convert to calcite. Most bivalve animals, such as oysters, clams, mussels, and corals, secrete aragonite and their shells and pearls are composed mostly of aragonite. The pearlization and iridescent colours in seashells such as abalone are due to several layers of aragonite (<a href="#box_12.5">Box 12.5</a>). Other natural sources of aragonite include hot springs and cavities in volcanic rocks.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Synthetic aragonite can be formed and is used as a filler in the paper industry, where its fine texture, whiteness, and absorbent properties add quality to the product. Powdered limestone is heated in a kiln to form CaO (lime). The lime is then slurried with water to form <i>milk of lime</i>. Carbon dioxide is then bubbled through the slurry until aragonite is formed:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15em;">
<img src="../images/page347-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The conditions, such as temperature and flow rate of carbon dioxide, determine the final particle size distribution and crystal type.</p>
<p class="boxparai"><i>Vaterite</i> is an even rarer polymorph of calcium carbonate, also adopting a hexagonal unit cell. It is more soluble than calcite or aragonite and converts slowly to these forms in contact with water. It is deposited from some mineral springs in cold climates; gallstones are often composed of this form of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. <i>Travertine</i> is a white, naturally occurring, very hard form of calcium carbonate. It is deposited from the water of hot mineral springs or streams containing CaO.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The two main polymorphs of CaCO<sub>3</sub> may be distinguished using infrared spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">Section 8.5</a>).

Moreover, due to differences in the local symmetry, certain vibrational modes are detected for each polymorph, as summarized in the following table, and infrared or Raman spectra may be used to rapidly distinguish the two forms. For example, the infrared spectrum obtained from a piece of snail shell is shown in <a href="#fig_B12.1">Fig. B12.1</a>.

</div>
<p class="boxpara">Biomineralization involves the production by organisms of inorganic solids, and over 50 biominerals have been identified, of which calcium carbonate is one of the most common. Nature is adept at controlling mineralization processes to produce single crystals and polycrystalline and amorphous structures with remarkable morphologies and mechanical properties (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.17">Section 26.17</a>). The biomineral often fulfils a structural role in the organism, for example as teeth, bones, or shells. Many shells are composed mostly of calcium carbonate with only up to about 2 per cent protein.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Most of the calcium carbonate mineral deposits found today were formed by sea creatures that manufactured shells and skeletons of calcium carbonate. When these animals died, their shells settled on the sea floor and were compressed to form limestone and chalk. The White Cliffs of Dover in England are chalk made from the shells of microscopic sea creatures called <i>Foraminifera</i> that lived about 136 million years ago.</p>
<p class="boxparai">In pearls and mother-of-pearl, very small CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystals are deposited to form smooth, hard, lustrous alternating layers of alternating layers of calcite and aragonite. The different structural forms of the calcium carbonate layers make the shell very strong, as they have different preferred directions of fracture and the interleaved layers resist breaking under pressure. The thickness of the layers is similar to the wavelength of light, which produces the interference effects and the observed pearlescence.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Many attempts are being made to replicate these complicated crystal growth patterns of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the laboratory. Crystals can sometimes be grown around a template, which is then removed to produce a porous structure; or the addition of certain chemicals can cause different shapes of crystals to grow from a particular solution. Similarly the growth of bone, which is mainly calcium hydroxyapatite, Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is being investigated, including the development of synthetic bone materials.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The large negative hydration enthalpies of the salts of mononegative ions ensure that they are soluble. For salts of dinegative ions, the lattice enthalpies are more influential and the salts are insoluble.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Compounds of the Group 2 elements are generally much less soluble in water than those of Group 1 elements even though the hydration enthalpies are more negative:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12em;">
<img src="../images/page349-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">With the exception of the fluorides, the salts of singly charged anions are usually soluble in water and those of doubly charged anions (such as oxides) are usually only sparingly soluble. For the latter, such as the carbonates and the sulfates, the high lattice enthalpy arising from the high charge of the anion is the deciding factor, outweighing the influence of the enthalpy of hydration. This insolubility is responsible for the enormous deposits of magnesium- and calcium-containing minerals such as limestone, gypsum, and dolomite that are widely exploited in the construction industry. With the exception of BeF<sub>2</sub>, the fluorides are all insoluble in water because the small size of F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> leads to a high lattice enthalpy. Beryllium fluoride has a very high hydration enthalpy due to the high charge density on the small cation: in its case, hydration enthalpy rather than lattice enthalpy is the dominant factor:</p>

<figure style="margin-left:-10.5em;">
<img src="../images/page349-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This reaction can be traced to the high polarizing power of the small, doubly charged cation. Solutions of the hydrated salts of the heavier elements are neutral.</p>
<p class="indent">These trends in solubility and hydrolysis can also be explained in hard/soft acid&#x2013;base terms. As the group is descended the ions become less hard; the fluorides and hydroxides (small, hard anions) are insoluble for the harder Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> but more soluble for Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is most strongly hydrated by the hard O atom in H<sub>2</sub>O, and the relatively soft Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> much more weakly.</p>
<p class="indent">The amphoteric nature of Be, leading to the formation of [Be(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> under strongly basic conditions, means that the element forms an extensive series of beryllates that are built from BeO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra.

A trace of iodine is usually added to the reactants, forming magnesium iodide; this compound is soluble in the solvent used and dissolves to expose an activated magnesium surface.

A few drops of pH&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;10 buffer were added to a 100&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of the water. This sample was titrated against 0.01&#x2009;M edta(aq) using Eriochrome Black T indicator and gave a titre of 33.8&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup>. Under these circumstances both Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions react with edta. A second 100&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup> sample was titrated against the edta solution after 5.0&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup> of 0.1&#x2009;M NaOH(aq) and a few drops of murexide indicator had been added. Under these conditions only the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions react with the edta and a titre of 27.5&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup> was obtained. Determine the hardness of the water sample in terms of the concentration of the Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and of the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions.</p>
