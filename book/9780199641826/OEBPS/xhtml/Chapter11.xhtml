<p class="noindentd"><b>All the Group 1 elements are metallic but, unlike most metals, they have low densities and are very reactive. In this chapter we provide a survey of the chemistry of these elements, highlighting the similarities and trends in properties and commenting on the slightly anomalous behaviour of lithium. We then provide a detailed review of the chemistry of the alkali metals, discussing the occurrence of the elements in the natural environment and how they are extracted and used. The chapter also interprets trends in the properties of the simple binary compounds in terms of the ionic model and the nature of complexes and organometallic compounds of the elements.</b></p>

<p class="noindent">The Group 1 elements, the <b>alkali metals</b>, are lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium (cesium), and francium. We shall not discuss francium, which exists naturally only in minute quantities and is highly radioactive. All the elements are metals and form simple ionic compounds, most of which are soluble in water. The elements form a limited number of complexes and organometallic compounds. In this first section of the chapter we summarize the key features of the chemistry of the Group 1 elements.</p>

<p class="indent">All the Group 1 elements are metals with valence electron configuration <i>n</i>s<sup>1</sup>. They conduct electricity and heat, are soft, and have low melting points that decrease down the group. Their softness and low melting points stem from the fact that their metallic bonding is weak because each atom contributes only one electron to the valence band (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>). This softness is particularly evident for Cs, which melts at only 29&#x00B0;C. Liquid sodium and sodium/potassium mixtures have been used as the coolant in some nuclear power plants because of their excellent thermal conductivities. All the elements adopt a body-centred cubic structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.5">Section 3.5</a>) and because that structure-type is not close-packed and their atomic radii are large, they have low densities. The metals readily form alloys among themselves, for example NaK, and with many other metals, such as sodium/mercury amalgam. <a href="#tab11.1">Table 11.1</a> summarizes some important properties.</p>
<p class="indent">Flame tests are commonly used for the identification of the presence of the alkali metals and their compounds. Electronic transitions occur within the metal atoms and ions formed in the flames with energies that fall in the visible part of the spectrum, which give a characteristic colour to the flame:</p>

<p class="indent">The chemical properties of the Group 1 elements correlate with the trend in their atomic radii (<a href="#fig_11.1">Fig. 11.1</a>). The increase in atomic radius from Li to Cs leads to a decrease in first ionization energy down the group because the valence shell is increasingly distant from the nucleus (<a href="#fig_11.2">Fig. 11.2</a>; <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>). Because their first ionization energies are all low, the metals are reactive and form M<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions increasingly readily down the group. Their reaction with water,</p>

The surprising uniformity of the standard <a id="page_320" class="page">page 320, The Group 1 elements</a> potentials of the alkali metals can be explained by studying the thermodynamic cycle for the reduction half-reaction (<a href="#fig_11.3">Fig. 11.3</a>). The enthalpies of sublimation and ionization both decrease down the group (making the formation of the M<sup>&#x002B;</sup>(g) ion easier and the oxidation more favourable); however, this trend is counteracted by a smaller enthalpy of hydration as the radii of the ions increase (making oxidation less favourable).</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The binary compounds of the alkali metals contain the cations of the elements and exhibit predominantly ionic bonding</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Group 1 elements form ionic (saline) hydrides with the rock-salt structure; the anion present is the hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. These hydrides were discussed in some detail in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>b. All the Group 1 elements form halides, MX. They can be obtained by direct combination of the elements or more normally from solutions&#x2014;for example, reaction of the metal hydroxide or carbonate with hydrohalic acid (HX, X&#x003D;F, Cl, Br, I). The halides occur widely&#x2014;for example, a litre of seawater contains about 35&#x2009;g of NaCl. Most of the halides have the 6:6-coordinate rock-salt structure (<a href="#fig_11.4">Fig. 11.4</a>), but CsCl, CsBr, and CsI have the 8:8-coordinate CsCl structure (<a href="#fig_11.5">Fig. 11.5</a>) as the larger caesium ion is able to fit a larger number of halide anions around it (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Group 1 elements react vigorously with oxygen. Only Li reacts directly with oxygen to give a simple oxide, Li<sub>2</sub>O. Sodium reacts with oxygen to give the peroxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which contains the peroxide ion, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> and the other Group 1 elements form the superoxides, which contain the paramagnetic superoxide ion, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> All the hydroxides are white, translucent, deliquescent solids.

The solubility of the hydroxides makes them a ready source of OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions in the laboratory and in industry. The metals react with sulfur to form compounds with the formula M<sub>2</sub>S<sub><i>x</i></sub>, where <i>x</i> lies in the range 1 to 6.

These solutions survive for long periods at and below the normal boiling point of ammonia (&#x2212;33&#x00B0;C) and in the absence of air. Concentrated metal&#x2013;ammonia solutions have a metallic bronze colour and have electrical conductance close to that of a solid metal, about 10<sup>7</sup>&#x2009;S&#x2009;m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

<p class="indent">The lighter Group 1 elements form organometallic compounds which are highly reactive; hydrolysed by water, liberating hydrogen; and pyrophoric (spontaneously igniting) in air. Protic (proton-donating) organic compounds are reduced by the elements to form ionic organometallic compounds; for example, cyclopentadiene reacts with Na metal in the solvent THF to form Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>[C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. Lithium alkyls and aryls are by far the most important Group 1 organometallic compounds.

<p class="noindentt">As we saw in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, most of the trends in the chemical properties of the elements in the periodic table are best discussed in terms of vertical trends within groups or horizontal trends across periods. However, the lightest member of a group, in this case Li, often displays properties that are markedly different from that of its congeners. This difference can often be expressed as a diagonal relationship with the element to its lower right in the periodic table (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.10">Section 9.10</a>). In the case of Group 1 and Li the following differences can be noted:</p>
<p class="indentbulletl-new" style="margin-top:1em;"><span class="blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Lithium can exhibit a high degree of covalent character in its bonding.

<p class="noindentt">The name &#x2018;lithium&#x2019; comes from the Greek <i>lithos</i> for stone. The natural abundance of lithium is low, the most abundant minerals being spodumene, LiAlSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, from which lithium used to be extracted, and lepidolite, which has the approximate formula K<sub>2</sub>Li<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>7</sub>O<sub>21</sub>(F,OH)<sub>3</sub>. Lithium is now most commonly obtained from brines as lithium carbonate (<a href="#box_11.1">Box 11.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium occurs as the mineral rock salt (NaCl) and in salt lakes, seawater and the residue of ancient dried-up saline lakes that are often buried underground. Sodium chloride makes up 2.6 per cent by mass of the biosphere, with the oceans containing 4&#x2009;&#x00D7;&#x2009;10<sup>19</sup>&#x2009;kg of the salt. Subsurface deposits can be mined in the conventional way or water may be pumped underground to dissolve the rock salt, which is then pumped out as saturated brine solution. The metal is extracted by <i>Down&#x2019;s process</i>, the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17em;">
 <img src="../images/page321-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The sodium chloride is kept molten at 600&#x00B0;C, a temperature considerably below its melting point of 808&#x00B0;C, by the addition of calcium chloride. A high potential difference, typically between 4 and 8&#x2009;V, is applied between a carbon anode and an iron cathode immersed in the molten salt. The electrolysis <a id="page_322" class="page">page 322, The Group 1 elements</a>liberates liquid sodium metal at the cathode, which rises to the surface of the cell where it is collected under an inert atmosphere. This process is also used for the industrial production of chlorine, which is generated at the anode.</p>

<p class="boxtitle" id="box_11.1"><b><span class="bgg">BOX 11.1</span> Distribution and extraction of lithium</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">The growing technological importance of lithium&#x2014;particularly for primary and rechargeable battery applications (see <a href="#box_11.2">Box 11.2</a>) and specifically for vehicles&#x2014;has focused attention on worldwide reserves and extraction of the element. Worldwide consumption of lithium is near 24&#x2009;000 tonnes per annum and supply security has become a top priority for technology and automotive companies. Lithium is the 25th most abundant element (at 20 ppm) in the Earth&#x2019;s crust, but it is widely distributed; seawater has a concentration of around 0.20&#x2009;ppm, equivalent to 230 billion tonnes. Lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks such as spodumene and petalite, and hectorite clays derived from weathering of igneous rocks; these have all, in the past, been commercially viable sources. The vast majority of lithium is now extracted from brines, aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts (halides, nitrates and sulfates), or <b>caliche</b>, which is a hardened deposit of these sedimentary salts. These caliches are normally mainly CaCO<sub>3</sub>, but in some parts of the world consist of alkali metal salts and in northern Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia these minerals are relatively rich in lithium and potassium. The caliche rock is dissolved to produce brine, and this is concentrated by solar evaporation. Because of the high solubility of lithium salts (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.7">Section 11.7</a>) the solutions become enriched in lithium compared with other Group 1 elements. Lithium carbonate is precipitated by the addition of a solution of sodium carbonate to the hot, lithium-rich brine. Lithium can also be concentrated in brines by reverse osmosis, where pressure is applied to the dilute solution, causing water to migrate through a semipermeable membrane, thereby increasing the salt content of the solution. Industries involved in the recycling of lithium from batteries have also sprung up over the past few years. Identified worldwide resources of lithium are estimated at 35 million tonnes which, if used exclusively for car batteries using current technologies, is sufficient for approximately three billion cars with 24&#x2009;kWh batteries, three times the present number. However, the demand for lithium in other industries also needs to be met, including nonautomotive battery applications. The majority of extracted lithium (29 per cent) is currently used in the ceramics and glass industry to produce low melting point materials and in lithium hydroxide-based lubricating greases (12 per cent). Therefore, there is considerable need for research into more effective methods of lithium extraction from low-concentration sources and into the recycling of lithium-containing battery materials. A further area of research involves finding alternatives to lithium-based systems for energy storage. For applications where weight is not of high importance&#x2014;that is, nonmobile applications, such as the storage of intermittently generated wind power&#x2014;rechargeable batteries based on the more widely available sodium can be used.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Potassium occurs naturally as potash (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and carnallite (KCl&#x00B7;MgCl<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;6H<sub>2</sub>O). Natural potassium contains 0.012 per cent of the radioactive isotope <sup>40</sup>K, which undergoes &#x03B2;-decay, with a half-life of 1.25&#x2009;Ga, to <sup>40</sup>Ca and electron capture to <sup>40</sup>Ar. The ratio of <sup>40</sup>K and <sup>40</sup>Ar can be used for dating rocks, specifically the time when the rock solidified, at which point it traps any <sup>40</sup>Ar formed. In principle potassium could be extracted electrolytically, but the high reactivity of the element makes this far too hazardous. Instead, molten sodium and molten potassium chloride are heated together and potassium and sodium chloride are formed:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17em;">

</figure>
<p class="noindent">At the temperature of operation, potassium is a vapour and removing it from the system drives the equilibrium to the right.</p>
<p class="indent">Rubidium (from the Latin <i>rubidus</i> for deep red) and caesium (from <i>caesius</i> for sky-blue) were discovered by Robert Bunsen in 1861 and named from the colour their salts impart to a flame. Both elements occur as minor constituents of the mineral lepidolite, which has the composition (K,Rb,Cs)Li<sub>2</sub>Al(Al,Si)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(F,OH)<sub>2</sub>, from which they are obtained as by-products of the extraction of lithium. Prolonged treatment of lepidolite with sulfuric acid forms the alums of the alkali metals, M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&#x00B7;<i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, M&#x003D;K, Rb, Cs. The alums are separated by multiple fractional crystallizations and then converted to the hydroxide by reaction with Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> and then to the chloride by ion exchange. The metals are obtained from the molten chloride by reduction with calcium or&#x2009;barium:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15.5em;">

</figure>
<p class="noindent">Caesium also occurs as the mineral pollucite, Cs<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>9</sub>O<sub>26</sub>&#x00B7;H<sub>2</sub>O. The element is extracted from the mineral by leaching with sulfuric acid to form the alum Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&#x00B7;24H<sub>2</sub>O, which is then converted to the sulfate by roasting with carbon. The chloride is formed by ion exchange and is then reduced with calcium or&#x2009;barium as described above. Caesium metal can also be obtained by the electrolysis of molten CsCN.</p>

<h3 class="h3">11.5 <b>Uses of the elements and their compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Common uses of lithium are related to its low density; the most widely used compounds of Group 1 are sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The applications of lithium metal are in large part due to its low atomic mass and consequently low density. It is used in alloys where weight is of a premium concern, such as aircraft parts; Al containing around 2 per cent Li has a mass density 6 per cent lower than that of pure Al and is used, for example, in parts of aircraft wings to reduce the overall weight and thereby improve fuel consumption. Similar lithium-containing alloys have been used in aerospace applications such as the booster tanks of the Space Shuttle.</p>
<p class="indent">The low molar mass of lithium (6.94&#x2009;g&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), only 3.3 per cent that of lead, coupled with the strongly negative standard potential of the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/Li couple (<a href="#tab11.1">Table 11.1</a>), make lithium batteries an attractive alternative to lead&#x2013;acid batteries (<a href="#box_11.2">Box 11.2</a>). Lithium carbonate is widely used to treat bipolar conditions (manic depression, <a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.4">Section 27.4</a>) and lithium stearate is a widely used lubricant in the automotive industry. The high polarizing power of Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> means that some complex oxides, such as LiMO<sub>3</sub>, M&#x003D;Nb or Ta, show important nonlinear optical and acousto-optical effects, and are widely used in mobile communication devices.</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium and potassium are essential for physiological function (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a>), and a major use of NaCl is in flavouring food. Sodium is used in the extraction of rarer metals, such as Ti from titanium(IV) chloride. Other major uses of NaCl are road de-icing and production of NaOH for the chloralkali industry (<a href="#box_11.3">Box 11.3</a>). However, because of concerns over the effects on the environment of distributing large amounts of rock salt</p>

<p class="boxtitle" id="box_11.2"><b><span class="bgg">BOX 11.2</span> lithium batteries</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">The very negative standard potential and low molar mass of lithium make it an ideal anode material for batteries. These batteries have relatively high specific energy (energy production divided by the mass of the battery) because lithium metal and compounds containing lithium are light in comparison with some other materials used in batteries, such as lead and zinc. Lithium batteries are common, but there are many types based on different lithium compounds and reactions. Batteries that contain lithium which are used once and then disposed of are termed primary lithium batteries while rechargeable systems are described as secondary or Li-ion batteries.</p>
<p class="boxpara1"><b><span class="bgg">Primary lithium batteries</span></b></p>
<p class="boxpara">The reaction between lithium and MnO<sub>2</sub> is used in the majority of these cells, producing a voltage of 3V, twice that of a zinc-carbon battery or an alkaline battery (which uses the reaction between the less electropositive zinc and MnO<sub>2</sub>). The reaction are as follows:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">While such batteries are widely used in Japan, accounting for 30 per cent of the primary battery market, they only account for a small proportion in the UK and EU. Lithium&#x2013;iron sulfide (FeS<sub>2</sub>) batteries are also produced commercially and have twice the capacity of alkaline batteries, producing a voltage of &#x223C;1.5&#x2009;V. They have low self-discharge rates, leading to a long shelf-life.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Another popular lithium battery uses thionyl chloride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>. This system produces a light, high-voltage cell with a stable energy output. The overall reaction in the battery is</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The battery requires no additional solvent as both SOCl<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are liquids at the internal battery pressure. This battery is not rechargeable as both sulfur and LiCl are precipitated. It is used in military applications and in spacecraft. Another battery system is based on the reduction of SO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.3em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The system is also not rechargeable as solid Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> deposits on the cathode. This battery uses acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN) as a co-solvent and the handling of this compound and the SO<sub>2</sub> present safety hazards. The batteries are hermetically sealed and not available to the general public. They are used in military communications and automated external defibrillators that are used to restore normal heart rhythm.</p>
<p class="boxpara1"><b><span class="bgg">Rechargeable lithium batteries</span></b></p>
<p class="boxpara">The lithium rechargeable battery, used in portable computers and phones, mainly uses Li<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> (<i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1) as the cathode, with a lithium/graphite anode, LiC<sub>6</sub>. Lithium ions are produced at the anode during the battery discharge. To maintain charge balance, Co(IV) is reduced to Co(III) in the form of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> at the cathode. The reactions occurring during battery discharge are</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-13em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The battery is rechargeable because both the cathode and the anode can act as host for the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions, which can move back and forth between them when charging and discharging. There are many other lithium batteries using different electrode materials, mainly d-metal compounds that take part in the redox reaction in a similar way to the cobalt. The latest generation of electric cars uses lithium battery technology rather than lead&#x2013;acid cells (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box14.7">Box 14.7</a>).</p>
<p class="boxparad">Lithium&#x2013;air batteries are also being researched as they could produce very high energy densities of 12&#x2009;kWh&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, about five times that of the Li<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> system described earlier. These rechargeable batteries use atmospheric oxygen as the cathode, where it is reduced to lithium oxide during discharge, and lithium metal as the anode. However, these battery types need considerable further research as many side-reactions&#x2014;for example the formation of lithium peroxide, carbonate, and hydroxide at the cathode in air and reactions involving the electrolyte separating the anode and cathode&#x2014;can take place, degrading battery performance.</p>

<p class="boxtitle" id="box_11.3"><b><span class="bgg">BOX 11.3</span> The chloralkali industry</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">The chloralkali industry has its roots in the industrial revolution, when large quantities of alkali were required for the manufacture of soap, paper, and textiles. Today, sodium hydroxide is one of the top 10 most important inorganic chemicals in terms of quantity produced, and continues to be important in the manufacture of other inorganic chemicals and in the pulp and paper industries. Chlorine and dihydrogen are the gaseous products. Chlorine is very important industrially and is used in the manufacture of PVC, in the extraction of titanium, and in the pulp and paper industries.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The industrial process is based on the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride. Water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions at the cathode, and chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas at the anode:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">There are three different types of cells that are used for the electrolysis. In a <b>diaphragm cell</b> there is a diaphragm which prevents the OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions produced at the cathode from coming into contact with the Cl<sub>2</sub> gas produced at the anode. This diaphragm used to be made of asbestos, but it is now made of a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh. During the electrolysis, the solution at the cathode is removed continuously and evaporated in order to crystallize the sodium chloride impurities. The final sodium hydroxide typically contains approximately 1 per cent by mass NaCl.</p>
<p class="boxparai">A <i>membrane cell</i> functions like the diaphragm cell except that the anode and cathode solutions are separated by a microporous polymer membrane that is permeable only to Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions. The sodium hydroxide solution produced using this cell typically contains approximately 50&#x2009;ppm&#x2009;Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The disadvantages of this method are that the membrane is very expensive, and can become clogged by trace impurities.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The <i>mercury cell</i> uses liquid mercury as the cathode. Chlorine gas is produced at the anode but sodium metal is produced at the cathode:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-18.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page323-6.jpg" alt="images"/>

</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The sodium hydroxide solution produced by this route is very pure and the mercury cell is the preferred source of high-quality solid sodium hydroxide. Unfortunately, the process is accompanied by discharge of mercury into the environment by a number of routes. Consequently, the chloralkali industry is under pressure to move away from the use of mercury electrodes.</p>

<p class="boxtitle" id="box_11.4"><b><span class="bgg">BOX 11.4</span> Sodium ion-exchange materials</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">Hard water contains high levels of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions, which precipitate from the water on heating (as limescale, which is largely CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and inhibit the formation of a lather with soap or detergent, so reducing their effectiveness. Domestic water softeners contain zeolites, or ion-exchange resins, which contain Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions that exchange with the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions. Zeolites are often also a component of washing detergents, where they perform the same role.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicates that contain weakly held cations and water molecules within their cavities (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.15">Section 14.15</a>). They are often available naturally or are synthesized as their sodium-containing form and denoted &#x2018;Na-zeolite&#x2019;. The ion-exchange reaction that occurs when hard water is exposed to Na-zeolite is</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-13.7em;">
 <img src="../images/page324-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">with the result that Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions are removed from the solution to the solid phase. The softened water contains mainly Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions as the dissolved cation species. As sodium carbonate and the sodium salts of soap and detergent molecules are very soluble, the softened water is more effective for washing and avoids problems such as the deposition of limescale on the heating elements of kettles, dishwashers, and washing machines.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The reverse reaction, which regenerates the ion-exchanger Na-zeolite, can be performed in a water softener by exposing the exhausted zeolite to high concentrations of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions (for example, sodium chloride solution):</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-14em;">
 <img src="../images/page324-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">In the case of zeolites added to detergents, the Ca-zeolite that is produced exists as a finely divided solid that is flushed away. This procedure is environmentally benign because the effluent contains calcium, silicon, aluminium, oxygen, and water&#x2014;the same as many natural minerals.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Instead of zeolites, some water softeners contain resins, which are porous polymeric organic compounds formed from cross-linked polystyrene decorated with functional groups such as carboxylates and sulfonates. The charge on these anionic groups is balanced by Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions on the surface of the resin, which are readily exchanged with Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt" style="margin-top:2em;">as a de-icing agent, alternative materials using less NaCl are being sought. For example, a mixture of sodium chloride and molasses has been employed. Sodium hydroxide is one of the 10 most important industrial chemicals in terms of annual tonnage produced. Other common applications of sodium and its compounds include the use of the metal in some kinds of street lamps, which produce a distinctive yellow glow when an electrical discharge is passed through sodium vapour (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#box1.4">Box 1.4</a>), table salt, baking soda, and caustic soda (NaOH). Sodium salts and compounds with ion-exchangable Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> are also widely used in water-softening equipment (<a href="#box_11.4">Box 11.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Potassium hydroxide is used in soap manufacture to make &#x2018;soft&#x2019; liquid soaps. Potassium chloride and sulfate are used as fertilizers; the nitrate and chlorate are used in fireworks. Potassium bromide has been used as an antaphrodisiac (a compound that reduces libido). Potassium cyanide is used in the metal extraction and plating industries to obtain or aid in the deposition of copper, silver, and gold.</p>
<p class="indent">Rubidium and caesium are often used in the same applications, and one element may often be substituted for the other. The market for these elements is small and highly specialized. Applications include glass for fibre optics in the telecommunications industry, night-vision equipment, and photoelectric cells. The &#x2018;caesium clock&#x2019; (atomic clock) is used for the international standard measure of time and for the definition of the second and the metre. Caesium salts are also used as high-density drilling fluids: the high density of the solutions arises from the high atomic mass of Cs.</p>

<p class="noindentt">All the Group 1 elements form halides, MX, by direct combination of the elements. Most of the halides have the 6:6-coordinate rock-salt structure, but CsCl, CsBr, and CsI have the 8:8-coordinate CsCl structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). The simple radius-ratio arguments presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a> may be used to help rationalize this choice of structure. <a href="#tab11.2">Table 11.2</a> summarizes the radius ratio (<i>&#x03B3;</i>) for the various alkali metal halides. As we saw in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>, a rock-salt structure with 6:6 coordination is expected for radius-ratio values between 0.414 and 0.732, and the CsCl structure is expected for larger values; a 4:4-coordinate zinc-sulfide structure is expected for values below 0.414. However, the lattice energies of the CsCl and rock-salt arrangements differ by only a small percentage and factors such as polarization (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.12">Section 3.12</a>) help to stabilize the rock-salt structure over the CsCl structure for most of the alkali metal halides. At 445&#x00B0;C the CsCl structure changes to the rock-salt structure, and on cooling below room temperature RbCl converts to the CsCl structure.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The powder X-ray diffraction data collected from RbI at standard conditions show that the lattice type is face-centred cubic and the lattice parameter is 734&#x2009;pm. Application of 4&#x2009;kbar causes the powder X-ray diffraction pattern to change, showing that the lattice type becomes primitive with a lattice parameter of 446&#x2009;pm. Interpret these data, given that the ionic radii for Rb<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in six-fold (eight-fold in parentheses) coordination are 148 (160)&#x2009;pm and 220 (232)&#x2009;pm, respectively.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> On the basis of radius-ratio rules and <i>&#x03B3;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0.67, the predicted structure for rubidium iodide is rock-salt with 6:6 coordination (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>b). The lattice type of this structure is face-centred cubic, in agreement with the diffraction data. It is also possible to predict the lattice parameter for this structure by using the ionic radii. In the rock-salt structure the lattice parameter is equivalent to the overall Rb&#x0064;I&#x0064;Rb distance (<a href="#fig_11.4">Fig. 11.4</a>), which is twice the sum of the anion and cation ionic radii. Thus, the predicted lattice parameter is 736&#x2009;pm, in good agreement with the experimental value. Structures under pressure have a thermodynamic tendency to rearrange to denser arrangements. The radius ratio for rubidium iodide lies close to 0.732, above which the CsCl structure is expected. Therefore, under pressure, a phase transformation occurs in RbI. The lattice type of the CsCl structure type is primitive (<a href="#fig_11.5">Fig. 11.5</a>), in agreement with the X-ray diffraction data, and a lattice parameter for this structure type can be calculated by using the ionic radii of Rb<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in eight-fold coordination (160 and 232&#x2009;pm, respectively) as 453&#x2009;pm (from 2(<i>r</i><sub>&#x002B;</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>r</i><sub>&#x2212;</sub>)/3<sup>1/2</sup>). This result closely matches the experimental data: the diffraction data are collected at 4&#x2009;kbar, so the lattice parameter is slightly smaller than the calculated value, which is based on ionic radii evaluated at 1&#x2009;bar.</p>

The enthalpies of formation become less negative for the fluorides on descending the group but become more negative for the chlorides, bromides, and iodides (<a href="#fig_11.6">Fig. 11.6</a>). These trends can be rationalized by considering a Born&#x2013;Haber cycle for formation of the halides from the elements (<a href="#fig_11.7">Fig. 11.7</a>).

<p class="indent">Not all alkali metal salts occur as their hydrates. The lattice enthalpies of hydrated salts are lower than for the anhydrous salt because the radius of the cation is effectively increased by the hydration sphere and is further from its surrounding anions.

Group 1 Zintl phases are ionic compounds in which electrons are transferred from the alkali metal atom to a cluster of the p-block atoms to form a polyanion; these compounds are normally diamagnetic, semiconducting or poor conductors, and brittle.</p>

<p class="noindentt">The Group 1 ions, particularly Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, are hard Lewis acids (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.9">Section 4.9</a>). Therefore, most of the complexes they form arise from Coulombic interactions with small, hard donors, such as those possessing O or N atoms. Monodentate ligands are only weakly bound on account of the weak Coulombic interactions and lack of significant covalent bonding by these ions. However, a number of factors (such as the formation of peroxides and ozonides, rather than oxides, by the heavier alkali metals and the insolubility of their perchlorates) indicate that the metals become less hard as the group is descended.</p>

<p class="indent">Another example of this fit between cation and ligand cavity is thought to be responsible for the transport of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions across cell membranes (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a>). The ions cross the hydrophobic cell membrane by means of embedded protein molecules that contain cavities lined with donor atoms.

Such <i>ion channels</i> modulate the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentration differential across the cell membrane that is essential for particular functions of the cell. The naturally occurring molecule valinomycin (<b>5</b>) is an antibiotic that selectively coordinates K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>: the resulting hydrophobic 1:1 complex transports K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> through a bacterial cell membrane, depolarizing the ion differential and resulting in cell death.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The organometallic compounds of the Group 1 elements react rapidly with water and are pyrophoric.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Group 1 elements form a number of organometallic compounds that are unstable in the presence of water and are pyrophoric in air. They are prepared in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF). Protic (proton-donating) organic compounds form ionic organometallic compounds with the Group 1 metals. For example, cyclopentadiene reacts with sodium metal in THF:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-14.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page333-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The resulting cyclopentadienide anion is an important intermediate in the synthesis of d-block organometallic compounds (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#ch22">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Lithium, sodium, and potassium form intensely coloured compounds with aromatic species. The oxidation of the metal results in transfer of an electron to the aromatic system to produce a <b>radical anion</b>, an anion that possesses an unpaired electron:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_0979.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Sodium and potassium alkyls are colourless solids that are insoluble in organic solvents and, when stable, have fairly high melting temperatures. They are produced by a <b>transmetallation reaction</b>, which involves breaking a metal&#x2013;carbon bond and forming a metal&#x2013;carbon bond to a different metal. Alkylmercury compounds are often the starting materials in these reactions. For example, methylsodium is produced in the reaction between sodium metal and dimethylmercury in a hydrocarbon solvent:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-16.2em;">
 <img src="../images/page333-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Organolithiums are by far the most important Group 1 organometallic compounds. They are liquids or low-melting solids, are the most thermally stable of the entire group, and are soluble in organic and nonpolar solvents such as THF. They can be synthesized from an alkyl halide and lithium metal or by reacting the organic species with butyllithium, Li(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>), commonly abbreviated to BuLi:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-14em;">
 <img src="../images/page333-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A feature of many main-group organometallic compounds is the presence of bridging alkyl groups. When ethers are the solvent, methyl lithium exists as Li<sub>4</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, with a tetrahedron of Li atoms and bridging CH<sub>3</sub> groups (<b>6</b>). In hydrocarbon solvents, Li<sub>6</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (<b>7</b>) is formed; its structure is based on an octahedral arrangement of Li atoms. Other alkyllithiums adopt similar structures except when the alkyl groups become very bulky, as in the case of <i>t</i>-butyl, &#x2212;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, when tetramers are the largest species formed. Many of these alkyllithiums are electron-deficient compounds and contain the 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds characteristic of such compounds (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>).</p>

<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_0982.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Organolithium compounds are also used to convert p-block halides to organoelement compounds, as we see in later chapters. For example, boron trichloride reacts with butyllithium in THF to give an organoboron compound:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-14em;">
 <img src="../images/page333-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The driving force for this and many other reactions of s- and p-block organometallic compounds is the formation of the insoluble halide compound of the less electronegative metal.</p>
<p class="indent">Alkyllithiums are important industrially in the stereospecific polymerization of alkenes to form synthetic rubber. Butyllithium is used as an initiator in solution polymerization to produce a wide range of elastomers and polymers. Organolithium compounds are also used in the synthesis of a range of pharmaceuticals, including vitamins A and D, analgesics, antihistamines, <a id="page_334" class="page">page 334, The Group 1 elements</a>antidepressants, and anticoagulants. Alkyllithiums can be used in the synthesis of other organometallic compounds. For example, they can be used to introduce alkyl groups into d-metal organometallic compounds (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.8">Section 22.8</a>):</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12em;">

<p class="noindent">The reactivity and solubility of alkyllithium are enhanced by adding a chelating ligand such as tetramethylethylenediamine, TMEDA (<b>8</b>), which breaks up any tetramers to give complexes such as [BuLi(TMEDA)]<sub>2</sub>.</p>
