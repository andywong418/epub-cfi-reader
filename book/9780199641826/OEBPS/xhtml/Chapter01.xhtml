<p class="noindentd"><b>This chapter lays the foundations for the explanation of the trends in the physical and chemical properties of all inorganic compounds. To understand the behaviour of molecules and solids we need to understand atoms: our study of inorganic chemistry must therefore begin with a review of their structures and properties. We start with a discussion of the origin of matter in the solar system and then consider the development of our understanding of atomic structure and the behaviour of electrons in atoms. We introduce quantum theory qualitatively and use the results to rationalize properties such as atomic radii, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. An understanding of these properties allows us to begin to rationalize the diverse chemical properties of the more than 110 elements known today.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The observation that the universe is expanding has led to the current view that about 14 billion years ago the currently visible universe was concentrated into a point-like region that exploded in an event called the <b>Big Bang</b>. With initial temperatures immediately after the Big Bang of about 10<sup>9</sup> K, the fundamental particles produced in the explosion had too much kinetic energy to bind together in the forms we know today. However, the universe cooled as it expanded, the particles moved more slowly, and they soon began to adhere together under the influence of a variety of forces. In particular, the <b>strong force</b>, a short-range but powerful attractive force between nucleons (protons and neutrons), bound these particles together into nuclei. As the temperature fell still further, the <b>electromagnetic force</b>, a relatively weak but long-range force between electric charges, bound electrons to nuclei to form atoms, and the universe acquired the potential for complex chemistry and the existence of life (<a href="#box1.1">Box 1.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">About two hours after the start of the universe, the temperature had fallen so much that most of the matter was in the form of H atoms (89 per cent) and He atoms (11 per cent). In one sense, not much has happened since then for, as <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows, hydrogen and helium remain overwhelmingly the most abundant elements in the universe. However, nuclear reactions have formed a wide assortment of other elements and have immeasurably enriched the variety of matter in the universe, and thus given rise to the whole area of chemistry (<a href="#box1.2">Boxes 1.2</a> and <a href="#box1.3">1.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a> summarizes the properties of the subatomic particles that we need to consider in chemistry.

</div>
<p class="boxpara">The earliest stars resulted from the gravitational condensation of clouds of H and He atoms. This gave rise to high temperatures and densities within them, and fusion reactions began as nuclei merged together.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Energy is released when light nuclei fuse together to give elements of higher atomic number. Nuclear reactions are very much more energetic than normal chemical reactions because the <b><i>strong force</i></b> which binds protons and neutrons together is much stronger than the electromagnetic force that binds electrons to nuclei. Whereas a typical chemical reaction might release about 10<sup>3</sup> kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, a nuclear reaction typically releases a million times more energy, about 10<sup>9</sup> kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Elements up to <i>Z</i> &#x003D; 26 were formed inside stars. Such elements are the products of the nuclear fusion reactions referred to as &#x2018;nuclear burning&#x2019;. The burning reactions, which should not be confused with chemical combustion, involved H and He nuclei and a complicated fusion cycle catalysed by C nuclei. The stars that formed in the earliest stages of the evolution of the cosmos lacked C nuclei and used noncatalysed H-burning. Nucleosynthesis reactions are rapid at temperatures between 5 and 10 MK (where 1 MK &#x003D; 10<sup>6</sup> K). Here we have another contrast between chemical and nuclear reactions, because chemical reactions take place at temperatures a hundred thousand times lower. Moderately energetic collisions between species can result in chemical change, but only highly vigorous collisions can provide the energy required to bring about most nuclear processes.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Heavier elements are produced in significant quantities when hydrogen burning is complete and the collapse of the star&#x2019;s core raises the density there to 10<sup>8</sup> kg m<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (about 10<sup>5</sup> times the density of water) and the temperature to 100 MK. Under these extreme conditions, helium burning becomes viable.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The high abundance of iron and nickel in the universe is consistent with these elements having the most stable of all nuclei. This stability is expressed in terms of the <b>binding energy</b>, which represents the difference in energy between the nucleus itself and the same numbers of individual protons and neutrons. This binding energy is often presented in terms of a difference in mass between the nucleus and its individual protons and neutrons because, according to Einstein&#x2019;s theory of relativity, mass and energy are related by <i>E</i> &#x003D; <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Therefore, if the mass of a nucleus differs from the total mass of its components by &#x0394;<i>m</i> &#x003D; <i>m</i><sub>nucleons</sub> &#x2212; <i>m</i><sub>nucleus</sub>, then its binding energy is <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub> &#x003D; (&#x0394;<i>m</i>)<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. The binding energy of <sup>56</sup>Fe, for example, is the difference in energy between the <sup>56</sup>Fe nucleus and 26 protons and 30 neutrons. A positive binding energy corresponds to a nucleus that has a lower, more favourable, energy (and lower mass) than its constituent nucleons.</p>
<p class="boxparai"><a href="#figb1.1">Figure B1.1</a> shows the binding energy per nucleon, <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub>/<i>A</i> (obtained by dividing the total binding energy by the number of nucleons), for all the elements. Iron and nickel occur at the maximum of the curve, showing that their nucleons are bound more strongly than in any other nuclide. Harder to see from the graph is an alternation of binding energies as the atomic number varies from even to odd, with even-<i>Z</i> nuclides slightly more stable than their odd-<i>Z</i> neighbours. There is a corresponding alternation in cosmic abundances, with nuclides of even atomic number being marginally more abundant than those of odd atomic number. This stability of even-<i>Z</i> nuclides is attributed to the lowering of energy by the pairing of nucleons in the nucleus.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b>The structures of hydrogenic atoms</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The organization of the periodic table is a direct consequence of periodic variations in the electronic structure of atoms. Initially, we consider hydrogen-like or <b>hydrogenic atoms</b>, which have only one electron and so are free of the complicating effects of electron&#x2013;electron repulsions. Hydrogenic atoms include ions such as He<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and C<sup>5&#x002B;</sup> (found in stellar interiors) as well as the hydrogen atom itself. Then we use the concepts these atoms introduce to build up an approximate description of the structures of <b>many-electron atoms</b> (or <b>polyelectron atoms</b>).</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">If two nuclei with mass numbers lower than 56 merge to produce a new nucleus with a larger nuclear binding energy, the excess energy is released. This process is called <b>fusion</b>. For example, two neon-20 nuclei may fuse to give a calcium-40 nucleus:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
 <img src="../images/page5-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The value of the binding energy per nucleon, <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub>/<i>A,</i> for Ne is approximately 8.0 MeV. Therefore, the total binding energy of the species on the left-hand side of the equation is 2 &#x00D7; 20 &#x00D7; 8.0 MeV &#x003D; 320 MeV. The value of <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub>/<i>A</i> for Ca is close to 8.6 MeV and so the total energy of the species on the right-hand side is 40 &#x00D7; 8.6 MeV &#x003D; 344 MeV. The difference in the binding energies of the products and reactants is therefore 24 MeV.</p>
<p class="boxparai">For nuclei with <i>A</i> &#x003E; 56, binding energy can be released when they split into lighter products with higher values of <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub>/<i>A</i>. This process is called fission. For example, uranium-236 can undergo fission into (among many other modes) xenon-140 and strontium-93 nuclei:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
 <img src="../images/page5-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The values of <i>E</i><sub>bind</sub>/<i>A</i> for <sup>236</sup>U, <sup>140</sup>Xe, and <sup>93</sup>Sr nuclei are 7.6, 8.4, and 8.7 MeV, respectively. Therefore, the energy released in this reaction is (140 &#x00D7; 8.4) &#x002B; (93 &#x00D7; 8.7) &#x2212; (236 &#x00D7; 7.6) MeV &#x003D; 191.5 MeV for the fission of each <sup>236</sup>U nucleus.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Fission can also be induced by bombarding heavy elements with neutrons:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
 <img src="../images/page5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">The kinetic energy of fission products from <sup>235</sup>U is about 165 MeV and that of the neutrons is about 5 MeV, and the &#x03B3;-rays produced have an energy of about 7 MeV. The fission products are themselves radioactive and decay by &#x03B2;-, &#x03B3;-, and X-radiation, releasing about 23 MeV. In a nuclear fission reactor the neutrons that are not consumed by fission are captured with the release of about 10 MeV. The energy produced is reduced by about 10 MeV which escapes from the reactor as radiation, and about 1 MeV which remains as undecayed fission products in the spent fuel. Therefore, the total energy produced for one fission event is about 200 MeV, or 32 pJ. It follows that about 1 W of reactor heat (where 1 W &#x003D; 1 J s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) corresponds to about <a id="page_6" class="page">page 6, Atomic structure</a>3.1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>10</sup> fission events per second. A nuclear reactor producing 3 GW has an electrical output of approximately 1 GW and corresponds to the fission of 3 kg of <sup>235</sup>U per day.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The use of nuclear power is controversial in large part on account of the risks associated with the highly radioactive, long-lived, spent fuel. The declining stocks of fossil fuels, however, make nuclear power very attractive as it is estimated that stocks of uranium could last for hundreds of years. The cost of uranium ores is currently very low and one small pellet of uranium oxide generates as much energy as three barrels of oil or 1 tonne of coal. The use of nuclear power would also drastically reduce the rate of emission of greenhouse gases. The environmental drawback with nuclear power is the storage and disposal of radioactive waste and the public&#x2019;s continued nervousness about possible nuclear accidents, including Fukushima in 2011, and misuse in pursuit of political ambitions.</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">A synthetic element is one that does not occur naturally on Earth but that can be artificially generated by nuclear reactions. The first synthetic element was technetium (Tc, <i>Z</i> &#x003D; 43), named from the Greek word for &#x2018;artificial&#x2019;. Its discovery&#x2014;or more precisely, its preparation&#x2014;filled a gap in the periodic table and its properties matched those predicted by Mendeleev. The longest-lived isotope of technetium (<sup>98</sup>Tc) has a half-life of 4.2 million years so any produced when the Earth was formed has long since decayed. Technetium is produced in red-giant stars.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The most widely used isotope of technetium is <sup>99m</sup>Tc, where the &#x2018;m&#x2019; indicates a metastable isotope. Technetium-99m emits high-energy &#x03B3;-rays but has a relatively short half-life of 6.01 hours. These properties make the isotope particularly attractive for use <i>in vivo</i> as the &#x03B3;-ray energy is sufficient for it to be detected outside the body and its half-life means that most of it will have decayed within 24 hours. Consequently, <sup>99m</sup>Tc is widely used in nuclear medicine, for example in radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and functional studies of the brain, bones, blood, lungs, liver, heart, thyroid gland, and kidneys (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.9">Section 27.9</a>). Technetium-99m is generated through nuclear fission in nuclear power plants but a more useful laboratory source of the isotope is a technetium generator, which uses the decay of <sup>99</sup>Mo to <sup>99m</sup>Tc. The half-life of <sup>99</sup>Mo is 66 hours, which makes it more convenient for transport and storage than <sup>99m</sup>Tc itself. Most commercial generators are based on <sup>99</sup>Mo in the form of the molybdate ion, <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msup><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>[MoO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow></mrow></msubsup><mo stretchy='false'>]</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msup></mrow></math>, adsorbed on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

When passed through a prism or diffraction grating, this radiation is found to consist of a series of components: one in the ultraviolet region, one in the visible region, and several in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>; <a href="#box1.1">Box 1.1</a>).

<p class="boxpara">The emission of light when atoms are excited is put to good use in lighting streets in many parts of the world. The widely used yellow street lamps are based on the emission of light from excited sodium atoms.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Low pressure sodium (LPS) lamps consist of a glass tube coated with indium tin oxide (ITO). The indium tin oxide reflects infrared and ultraviolet light but transmits visible light. Two inner glass tubes hold solid sodium and a small amount of neon and argon, the same mixture as found in neon lights. When the lamp is turned on the neon and argon emit a red glow which heats the sodium metal. Within a few minutes, the sodium starts to vaporize and the electrical discharge excites the atoms and they re-emit the energy as yellow light.</p>
<p class="boxparai">One advantage of these lamps over other types of street lighting is that they do not lose light output as they age. They do, however, use more energy towards the end of their life, which may make them less attractive from environmental and economic perspectives.</p>

<p class="indent">The question these observations raise is why the energy of the electron in the atom is limited to the values &#x2212;<i>hcR</i>/<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> and why <i>R</i> has the value observed. An initial attempt to explain these features was made by Niels Bohr in 1913 using an early form of quantum theory in which he supposed that the electron could exist in only certain circular orbits. Although he obtained the correct value of <i>R</i>, his model was later shown to be untenable as it conflicted with the version of quantum theory developed by Erwin Schr&#x00F6;dinger and Werner Heisenberg in 1926.</p>

<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:2em;"><b>1.2 Some principles of quantum mechanics</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Electrons can behave as particles or as waves; solution of the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation gives wavefunctions, which describe the location and properties of electrons in atoms. The probability of finding an electron at a given location is proportional to the square of the wavefunction. Wavefunctions generally have regions of positive and negative amplitude, and may undergo constructive or destructive interference with one another.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">In 1924, Louis de Broglie suggested that because electromagnetic radiation could be considered to consist of particles called photons yet at the same time exhibit wave-like properties, such as interference and diffraction, then the same might be true of electrons. This dual nature is called <b>wave&#x2013;particle duality</b>. An immediate consequence of duality is that it is impossible to know the linear momentum (the product of mass and velocity) and the location of an electron (or any other particle) simultaneously. This restriction is the content of Heisenberg&#x2019;s <b>uncertainty principle</b>, that the product of the uncertainty in momentum and the uncertainty in position cannot be less than a quantity of the order of Planck&#x2019;s constant (specifically, &#x00BD;<i>&#x210F;</i>, where <i>&#x210F;</i> &#x003D; &#x210E;/2<i>&#x03C0;</i>).</p>
<p class="indent">Schr&#x00F6;dinger formulated an equation that took account of wave&#x2013;particle duality and accounted for the motion of electrons in atoms. To do so, he introduced the <b>wavefunction</b>, <i>&#x03C8;</i> (psi), a mathematical function of the position coordinates <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> which describes the behaviour of an electron. The <b>Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation</b>, of which the wavefunction is a solution, for an electron free to move in one dimension is</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>m</i><sub>e</sub> is the mass of an electron, <i>V</i> is the potential energy of the electron, and <i>E</i> is its total energy. The Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation is a second-order differential equation that can be solved exactly for a number of simple systems (such as a hydrogen atom) and can be solved numerically for many more complex systems (such as many-electron atoms and molecules). However, we shall need only qualitative aspects of its solutions. The generalization of <a href="#eqn_1.2">eqn 1.2</a> to three dimensions is straightforward, but we do not need its explicit form.</p>
<p class="indent">One crucial feature of <a href="#eqn_1.2">eqn 1.2</a> and its analogues in three dimensions and the imposition of certain requirements (&#x2018;boundary conditions&#x2019;) is that physically acceptable solutions exist only for certain values of <i>E</i>. Therefore, the <b>quantization</b> of energy, the fact that an electron can possess only certain discrete energies in an atom, follows naturally from the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation.</p>
<p><a id="page_9" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 9, Atomic structure</a></p>
<p class="indent">A wavefunction contains all the dynamical information possible about the electron, including where it is and how fast it is travelling. As Heisenberg&#x2019;s uncertainty principle means it is impossible to know all this information simultaneously, this leads naturally to the concept of the probability of finding an electron at a given location. Specifically, the probability of finding an electron at a given location is proportional to the square of the wavefunction at that point, <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup>. According to this interpretation, there is a high probability of finding the electron where <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup> is large, and the electron will not be found where <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup> is zero (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>). The quantity <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup> is called the <b>probability density</b> of the electron. It is a &#x2018;density&#x2019; in the sense that the product of <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup> and the infinitesimal volume element d<i>&#x03C4;</i> &#x003D; d<i>x</i>d<i>y</i>d<i>z</i> (where <i>&#x03C4;</i> is tau) is proportional to the probability of finding the electron in that volume. The probability is <i>equal</i> to <i>&#x03C8;</i><sup>2</sup>d<i>&#x03C4;</i> if the wavefunction is &#x2018;normalized&#x2019;. A normalized wavefunction is one that is scaled so that the total probability of finding the electron somewhere is 1. The wavefunction of an electron in an atom is called an <b>atomic orbital</b>. To help keep track of the relative signs of different regions of a wavefunction, in illustrations we label regions of opposite sign with dark and light shading corresponding to &#x002B; and &#x2212; signs, respectively.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Like other waves, wavefunctions in general have regions of positive and negative amplitude, or sign. The sign of the wavefunction is of crucial importance when two wavefunctions spread into the same region of space and interact. Then a positive region of one wavefunction may add to a positive region of the other wavefunction to give a region of enhanced amplitude. This enhancement is called <b>constructive interference</b> (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4a</a>). It means that where the two wavefunctions spread into the same region of space, such as occurs when two atoms are close together, there may be a significantly enhanced probability of finding the electrons in that region. Conversely, a positive region of one wavefunction may be cancelled by a negative region of the second wavefunction (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4b</a>). This <b>destructive interferenc</b>e between wavefunctions reduces the probability that an electron will be found in that region. As we shall see, the interference of wavefunctions is of great importance in the explanation of chemical bonding.</p>

<p class="noindentt">In addition to the three quantum numbers required to specify the spatial distribution of an electron in a hydrogenic atom, two more quantum numbers are needed to define the state of an electron. These additional quantum numbers relate to the intrinsic angular momentum of an electron, its <b>spin</b>. This evocative name suggests that an electron can be regarded as having an angular momentum arising from a spinning motion, rather like the daily rotation of the earth as it travels in its annual orbit around the sun. However, spin is a quantum mechanical property and this analogy must be viewed with great caution.</p>
<p class="indent">Spin is described by two quantum numbers, <i>s</i> and <i>m</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>. The former is the analogue of <i>l</i> for orbital motion but it is restricted to the single, unchangeable value <i>s</i> &#x003D; &#x00BD;. The magnitude of the spin angular momentum is given by the expression [<i>s</i>(<i>s</i> &#x002B; 1)]<sup>1/2</sup> <i>&#x210F;</i>, so for an electron this magnitude is fixed at <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><msqrt><mn>3</mn></msqrt><mi>&#x210F;</mi></mrow></math> for any electron.

<p class="noindentt"><a href="#fig_1.8">Figures 1.8</a> and <a href="#fig_1.9">1.9</a> show the radial variation of some atomic orbitals. A 1s orbital, the wavefunction with <i>n</i> &#x003D; 1, <i>l</i> &#x003D; 0, and <i>m</i><sub><i>l</i></sub> &#x003D; 0, decays exponentially with distance from the nucleus and never passes through zero. All orbitals decay exponentially at sufficiently great distances from the nucleus and this distance increases as <i>n</i> increases. Some orbitals oscillate through zero close to the nucleus and thus have one or more radial nodes before beginning their final exponential decay. As the principal quantum number of an electron increases, it is likely to be found further away from the nucleus and its energy increases.</p>
<p class="indent">An orbital with quantum numbers <i>n</i> and <i>l</i> has <i>n</i> &#x2212; <i>l</i> &#x2212;1 radial nodes. This oscillation is evident in the 2s orbital, the orbital with <i>n</i> &#x003D; 2, <i>l</i> &#x003D; 0, and <i>m</i><sub><i>l</i></sub> &#x003D; 0, which passes through zero once and hence has one radial node. A 3s orbital passes through zero twice and so has two radial nodes (<a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>). A 2p orbital (one of the three orbitals with <i>n</i> &#x003D; 2 and <i>l</i> &#x003D; 1) has no radial node because its radial wavefunction does not pass through zero anywhere. However, a 2p orbital, like <i>all</i> orbitals other than s orbitals, is zero at the nucleus. For any series of the same type of orbital, the first occurrence has no radial node, the second has one radial node, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Although an electron in an s orbital may be found at the nucleus, an electron in any other type of orbital will not be found there. We shall soon see that this apparently minor detail, which is a consequence of the absence of orbital angular momentum when <i>l</i> &#x003D; 0, is one of the key concepts for understanding the layout of the periodic table and the chemistry of the elements.</p>

An s orbital has the same amplitude at a given distance from the nucleus whatever the angular coordinates of the point of interest: that is, an s orbital is spherically symmetrical. The orbital is normally represented by a spherical surface with the nucleus at its centre. The surface is called the <b>boundary surface</b> of the orbital, and defines the region of space within which there is a high (typically 90 per cent) probability of finding the electron. This boundary surface is what chemists draw to represent the shape of an orbital.

<h3 class="h3a"><b>Many-electron atoms</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">As we have remarked, a &#x2018;many-electron atom&#x2019; is an atom with more than one electron, so even He, with two electrons, is technically a many-electron atom. The exact solution of the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation for an atom with <i>N</i> electrons would be a function of the 3<i>N</i> coordinates of all the electrons. It would be extremely challenging to find exact formulas for such complicated functions; however, it is straightforward to perform numerical computations by using widely available software to obtain precise energies and probability densities. This software can also generate graphical representations of the resulting orbitals that can assist in the interpretation of the properties of the atom. For most of inorganic chemistry we rely on the <b>orbital approximation</b>, in which each electron occupies an atomic orbital that resembles those found in hydrogenic atoms. When we say that an electron &#x2018;occupies&#x2019; an atomic orbital, we mean that it is described by the corresponding wavefunction and set of quantum numbers.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.4">
<h3 class="h3">1.4 <b>Penetration and shielding</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The ground-state electron configuration is a specification of the orbital occupation of an atom in its lowest energy state. The exclusion principle forbids more than two electrons from occupying a single orbital. The nuclear charge experienced by an electron is reduced because of shielding by other electrons, including those in the same shell. Trends in effective nuclear charge can be used to rationalize the trends in many properties. As a result of the combined effects of penetration and shielding, the order of energy levels in a particular shell of a many-electron atom is s &#x003C; p &#x003C; d &#x003C; f.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">It is quite easy to account for the electronic structure of the helium atom in its <b>ground state</b>, its state of lowest energy. According to the orbital approximation, we suppose that both electrons occupy an atomic orbital that has the same spherical shape as a hydrogenic 1s orbital. However, the orbital will be more compact because, as the nuclear charge of helium is greater than that of hydrogen, the electrons are drawn in towards the nucleus more closely than is the one electron of an H atom. The ground-state <b>configuration</b> of an atom is a statement of the orbitals its electrons occupy in the ground state. For helium, with two electrons in the 1s orbital, the ground-state configuration is denoted 1s<sup>2</sup> (read as &#x2018;one s two&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="indent">As soon as we come to the next atom in the periodic table, lithium (<i>Z</i> &#x003D; 3), we encounter several major new features. The configuration 1s<sup>3</sup> is forbidden by a fundamental feature of nature known as the <b>Pauli exclusion principle</b>:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><i>No more than two electrons may occupy a single orbital and, if two do occupy a single orbital, then their spins must be paired.</i></p>
<p class="noindentt">By &#x2018;paired&#x2019; we mean that one electron spin must be &#x2191; (<i>m</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &#x003D; &#x002B;&#x00BD;) and the other &#x2193; (<i>m</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &#x003D; &#x2212;&#x00BD;); the pair is denoted &#x2191;&#x2193;. Another way of expressing the principle is to note that, because an electron in an atom is described by four variable quantum numbers, <i>n</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i><sub><i>l</i></sub>, and <i>m</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>, no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers. The Pauli principle was introduced originally to account for the absence of certain transitions in the spectrum of atomic helium.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the configuration 1s<sup>3</sup> is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle, the third electron must occupy an orbital of the next higher shell, the shell with <i>n</i> &#x003D; 2. The question that now arises is whether the third electron occupies a 2s orbital or one of the three 2p orbitals. To answer this question, we need to examine the energies of the two subshells and the effect of the other electrons in the atom. Although 2s and 2p orbitals have the same energy in a hydrogenic atom, spectroscopic data and calculations show that this is not the case in a many-electron atom.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:0em;"><span class="red"><b>Figure 1.17</b></span> The electron at a radius <i>r</i> experiences a repulsion from the total charge within the sphere of radius <i>r</i>; charge outside that radius has no net effect.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the orbital approximation, we treat the repulsion between electrons in an approximate manner by supposing that the electronic charge is distributed spherically around the nucleus. Then each electron moves in the attractive field of the nucleus and also experiences an average repulsive charge from the other electrons. According to classical electrostatics, the field that arises from a spherical distribution of charge is equivalent to the field generated by a single point charge at the centre of the distribution (<a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a>). This negative charge reduces the actual charge of the nucleus, <i>Z</i>, to <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>, where <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> is called the <b>effective nuclear charge</b>. This effective nuclear charge depends on the values of <i>n</i> and <a id="page_16" class="page">page 16, Atomic structure</a><i>l</i> of the electron of interest because electrons in different shells and subshells approach the nucleus to different extents. The reduction of the true nuclear charge to the effective nuclear charge by the other electrons is called <b>shielding</b>. The effective nuclear charge is sometimes expressed in terms of the true nuclear charge and an empirical <b>shielding constant</b>, &#x03C3;, by writing <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> &#x003D; <i>Z</i> &#x2212; &#x03C3;. The shielding constant can be determined by fitting hydrogenic orbitals to those computed numerically. It can also be approximated by using the set of empirical rules known as Slater&#x2019;s rules, described in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#box_5.1">Box 5.1</a>.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:0em;"><span class="red"><b>Figure 1.18</b></span> The penetration of a 2s electron through the inner core is greater than that of a 2p electron because the latter vanishes at the nucleus. Therefore, the 2s electrons are less shielded than the 2p electrons.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The closer to the nucleus that an electron can approach, the closer is the value of <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> to <i>Z</i> itself because the electron is repelled less by the other electrons present in the atom. With this point in mind, consider a 2s electron in the Li atom. There is a nonzero probability that the 2s electron can be found inside the 1s shell and experience the full nuclear charge (<a href="#fig_1.18">Fig. 1.18</a>). The potential for the presence of an electron inside shells of other electrons is called <b>penetration</b>. A 2p electron does not penetrate so effectively through the <b>core</b>, the filled inner shells of electrons, because its wavefunction goes to zero at the nucleus. As a consequence, it is more fully shielded from the nucleus by the core electrons. We can conclude that in a many-electron atom a 2s electron has a lower energy (is bound more tightly) than a 2p electron, and therefore that the 2s orbital will be occupied before the 2p orbitals, giving a ground-state electron configuration for Li of 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>1</sup>. This configuration is commonly denoted [He]2s<sup>1</sup>, where [He] denotes the atom&#x2019;s helium-like 1s<sup>2</sup> core.</p>
<p class="indent">The pattern of orbital energies in lithium, with 2s lower than 2p, and in general <i>n</i>s lower than <i>n</i>p, is a general feature of many-electron atoms. This pattern can be seen from <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a>, which gives the calculated values of <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> for all atomic orbitals in the ground-state electron configuration of atoms. The typical trend in effective nuclear charge is an increase across a period, for in most cases the increase in nuclear charge in successive elements is not fully cancelled by the additional electron. The values in the table also confirm that an s electron in the outermost shell of the atom is generally less shielded than a p electron of that shell. So, for example, <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> &#x003D; 5.13 for a 2s electron in an F atom, whereas for a 2p electron <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> &#x003D; 5.10, a lower value. Similarly, the effective nuclear charge is larger for an electron in an <i>n</i>p orbital than for one in an <i>n</i>d orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of penetration and shielding, the order of energies in many-electron atoms is typically <i>n</i>s, <i>n</i>p, <i>n</i>d, <i>n</i>f because, in a given shell, s orbitals are the most penetrating and f orbitals are the least penetrating. The overall effect of penetration and shielding is depicted in the schematic energy-level diagram for a neutral atom shown in <a href="#fig_1.19">Fig. 1.19</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_1.20">Figure 1.20</a> summarizes the energies of the orbitals through the periodic table. The effects are quite subtle, and the order of the orbitals depends strongly on the numbers of electrons present in the atom, and may change on ionization. For example, the effects of penetration are very pronounced for 4s electrons in K and Ca, and in these atoms the 4s orbitals lie lower in energy than the 3d orbitals. However, from Sc through Zn, the 3d orbitals in the neutral atoms lie close to but lower than the 4s orbitals. In atoms from Ga onwards (<i>Z</i> &#x2265;31), the 3d orbitals lie well below the 4s orbital in energy, and the outermost electrons are unambiguously those of the 4s and 4p subshells.</p>

<h3 class="h3">1.5 <b>The building-up principle</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ground-state electron configurations of many-electron atoms are determined experimentally by spectroscopy and are summarized in <i>Resource section 2</i>. To account for them, we need to consider both the effects of penetration and shielding on the energies of the orbitals and the role of the Pauli exclusion principle. The <b>building-up principle</b> (which is also known as the <b>Aufbau principle</b> and is described below) is a procedure that leads to plausible ground-state configurations. It is not infallible, but it is an excellent starting point for the discussion. Moreover, as we shall see, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and implications of the periodic table.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Ground-state electron configurations</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The order of occupation of atomic orbitals follows the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p,&#x2026;.

<p class="noindentt">Each orbital can accommodate up to two electrons.

</table>
<p class="noindentt">This order agrees with experiment.</p>
<p class="indent">When more than one orbital of the same energy is available for occupation, such as when the 2p orbitals begin to be filled in boron and carbon, we adopt <b>Hund&#x2019;s rule</b>:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><i>When more than one orbital has the same energy, electrons occupy separate orbitals and do so with parallel spins</i> (&#x2191;&#x2191;).</p>
<p class="noindentt">The occupation of separate orbitals of the same value of <i>l</i> (such as a p<sub><i>x</i></sub> orbital and a p<sub><i>y</i></sub> orbital) can be understood in terms of the repulsive interactions that exist between electrons occupying different regions of space (electrons in different orbitals) being weaker than between those occupying the same region of space (electrons in the same orbital). The requirement of parallel spins for electrons that do occupy different orbitals is a consequence of a quantum mechanical effect called <b>spin correlation</b>, the tendency for two electrons with parallel spins to stay apart from one another and hence to repel each other less.</p>
<p class="indent">An additional factor that stabilizes arrangements of electrons with parallel spins is <b>exchange energy.</b> The exchange energy is the extra stability that a parallel spin configuration (&#x2191;&#x2191;) gains because the electrons are indistinguishable and interchangeable. If one of the electrons of a pair with parallel spins is removed then the exchange energy is lost, so that arrangements of electrons in degenerate orbitals with large numbers of parallel spins are stabilized relative to those without. The highest exchange energy occurs with a <b>half-filled shell</b> when the largest number of electrons with parallel spins exists. A consequence of this is that half-filled shells, such as d<sup>5</sup> and f<sup>7</sup>, are particularly stable arrangements as removing an electron from these configurations requires the input of energy to overcome the greatest amount of exchange energy. Removing one electron from the d<sup>5</sup> configuration (&#x2191;&#x2191;&#x2191;&#x2191;&#x2191;) to give (&#x2191;&#x2191;&#x2191;&#x2191;) reduces the number of pairs of electrons with parallel spins from 10 to 6. One result of this preference for arrangements with half-filled shells is that the ground state of the chromium atom is 4s<sup>1</sup>3d<sup>5</sup> rather than 4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>4</sup> as the former maximizes the exchange energy.</p>
<p class="indent">It is arbitrary which of the p orbitals of a subshell is occupied first because they are degenerate, but it is common to adopt the alphabetical order p<sub><i>x</i></sub>, p<sub><i>y</i></sub>, p<sub><i>z</i></sub>. It then follows from the building-up principle that the ground-state configuration of C is 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sub><i>x</i></sub><sup>1</sup>2p<sub><i>y</i></sub><sup>1</sup> or, more simply, 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>. If we recognize the helium-like core (1s<sup>2</sup>), an even briefer notation is [He]2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>, and we can think of the electronic valence structure of the atom as consisting of two paired 2s electrons and two parallel 2p electrons surrounding a closed helium-like core. The electron configurations of the remaining elements in the period are similarly</p>

<p class="boxtitle"><b><span class="ve">EXAMPLE 1.5</span> Accounting for trends in effective nuclear charge</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">From <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a> the increase in <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> for a 2p electron between C and N is 0.69 whereas the increase for a 2p electron between N and O is only 0.62. Suggest a reason why the increase in <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> for a 2p electron is smaller between N and O than between C and N given the configurations of the atoms listed above.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> We need to identify the general trend and then think about an additional effect that might modify it. In this case, we expect to see an increase in effective nuclear charge across a period. However, on going from C to N, the additional electron occupies an empty 2p orbital whereas on going from N to O, the additional electron must occupy a 2p orbital that is already occupied by one electron. It therefore experiences stronger electron&#x2013;electron repulsion. Electron&#x2013;electron repulsion contributes to the overall shielding effect and so the increase in <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> is not as great.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Self-test 1.5</i></b> Account for the larger increase in effective nuclear charge for a 2p electron on going from B to C compared with a 2s electron on going from Li to Be.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt">The ground-state configuration of Na is obtained by adding one more electron to a neon-like core, and is [Ne]3s<sup>1</sup>, showing that it consists of a single electron outside a completely filled 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup> core. Now a similar sequence of filling subshells begins again, with the 3s and 3p orbitals complete at argon, with configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>, which can be denoted [Ar]. Because the 3d orbitals are so much higher in energy, this configuration is effectively closed. Moreover, the 4s orbital is next in line for occupation, so the configuration of K is analogous to that of Na, with a single electron outside a noble-gas core: specifically, it is [Ar]4s<sup>1</sup>. The next electron, for Ca, also enters the 4s orbital, giving [Ar]4s<sup>2</sup>, which is the analogue of Mg. However, in the next element, Sc, the added electron occupies a 3d orbital, and filling of the d orbitals begins.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The energy levels in <a href="#fig_1.19">Figs 1.19</a> and <a href="#fig_1.20">1.20</a> are for individual atomic orbitals and do not fully take into account repulsion between electrons. For elements with an incompletely filled d subshell, the determination of actual ground states by spectroscopy and calculation shows that it is advantageous to occupy orbitals predicted to be <i>higher</i> in energy (the 4s orbitals). The explanation for this order is that the occupation of orbitals of higher energy can result in a reduction in the repulsions between electrons that would occur if the lower-energy 3d orbitals were occupied. It is essential when assessing the total energy of the electrons to consider all contributions to the energy of a configuration, not merely the one-electron orbital energies. Spectroscopic data show that the ground-state configurations of these atoms, the first-row transition metals, are mostly of the form 3d<sup><i>n</i></sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, with the 4s orbitals fully occupied despite individual 3d orbitals being lower in energy.</p>
<p class="indent">An additional feature&#x2014;another consequence of spin correlation and exchange energies&#x2014;is that in some cases a lower total energy may be obtained by forming a half-filled or filled d subshell, even though that may mean moving an s electron into the d subshell. Therefore, as a half-filled d shell is approached the ground-state configuration is likely to be d<sup>5</sup>s<sup>1</sup> and not d<sup>4</sup>s<sup>2</sup> (as for Cr). As a full d subshell is approached the configuration is likely to be d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>1</sup> rather than d<sup>9</sup>s<sup>2</sup> (as for Cu) or d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>0</sup> rather than d<sup>8</sup>s<sup>2</sup> (as for Pd). A similar effect occurs where f orbitals are being occupied, and a d electron may be moved into the f subshell so as to achieve an f<sup>7</sup> or an f<sup>14</sup> configuration, with a net lowering of energy. For instance, the ground-state electron configuration of Gd is [Xe]4f<sup>7</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> and not [Xe]4f<sup>8</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">For cations and complexes of the d-block elements the removal of electrons reduces the effect of electron&#x2013;electron repulsions and the 3d orbital energies fall well below that of the 4s orbital. Consequently, all d-block cations and complexes have d<sup><i>n</i></sup> configurations and no electron in the outermost s orbital. For example, the configuration of Fe is [Ar]3d<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup> whereas that of [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] is [Ar]3d<sup>8</sup> and Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is [Ar]3d<sup>6</sup>. For the purposes of chemistry, the electron configurations of the d-block ions are more important than those of the neutral atoms. In later chapters (starting in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>), we shall see the great significance of the configurations of the d-metal ions, for the subtle modulations of their energies provide the basis for the explanations of important properties of their compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">1.6 <b>The classification of the elements</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The elements are broadly divided into metals, nonmetals, and metalloids according to their physical and chemical properties; the organization of elements into the form resembling the modern periodic table is accredited to Mendeleev.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A useful broad division of elements is into <b>metals</b> and <b>nonmetals</b>. Metallic elements (such as iron and copper) are typically lustrous, malleable, ductile, electrically conducting solids at about room temperature. Nonmetals are often gases (oxygen), liquids (bromine), or solids that do not conduct electricity appreciably (sulfur). The chemical implications of this classification should already be clear from introductory chemistry:</p>
<p class="indentbulletlt"><span class="blue">&#x2022;</span>&#160;&#160;Metallic elements combine with nonmetallic elements to give compounds that are typically hard, nonvolatile solids (for example, sodium chloride).</p>
<p class="indentbulletl"><span class="blue">&#x2022;</span>&#160;&#160;When combined with one another, the nonmetals often form volatile molecular compounds (for example, phosphorus trichloride).</p>
<p class="indentbulletl"><span class="blue">&#x2022;</span>&#160;&#160;When metals combine (or simply mix together) they produce alloys that have most of the physical characteristics of metals (for example, brass from copper and zinc).</p>
<p class="noindentt">Some elements have properties that make it difficult to classify them as metals or nonmetals. These elements are called <b>metalloids</b>. Examples of metalloids are silicon, germanium, arsenic, and tellurium.</p>
<div class="bggr2" style="width:67%;">
<p class="noindentf"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> You will sometimes see metalloids referred to as &#x2018;semimetals&#x2019;. This name is best avoided because a semimetal has a well defined and quite distinct meaning in solid-state physics (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>).</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4">(a) The periodic table</h4>
<p class="noindent">A more detailed classification of the elements is the one devised by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; this scheme is familiar to every chemist as the <b>periodic table</b>. Mendeleev arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic weight (molar mass). This arrangement resulted in families of elements with similar chemical properties, which he arranged into the groups of the periodic table. For example, the fact that C, Si, Ge, and Sn all form hydrides of the general formula EH<sub>4</sub> suggests that they belong to the same group. That N, P, As, and Sb all form hydrides with the general formula EH<sub>3</sub> suggests that they belong to a different group. Other compounds of these elements show family similarities, as in the formulas CF<sub>4</sub> and SiF<sub>4</sub> in the first group, and NF<sub>3</sub> and PF<sub>3</sub> in the second.</p>
<p class="indent">Mendeleev concentrated on the chemical properties of the elements. At about the same time Lothar Meyer in Germany was investigating their physical properties, and found that similar values repeated periodically with increasing molar mass. <a href="#fig_1.21">Figure 1.21</a> shows a classic example, where the molar volume of the element (its volume per mole of atoms) at 1 bar and 298 K is plotted against atomic number.</p>
<p class="indent">Mendeleev provided a spectacular demonstration of the usefulness of the periodic table by predicting the general chemical properties&#x2014;such as the numbers of bonds they form&#x2014;of unknown elements such as gallium, germanium, and scandium corresponding to gaps <a id="page_21" class="page">page 21, Atomic structure</a>in his original periodic table. (He also predicted elements that we now know cannot exist and denied the presence of elements that we now know do exist, but that is overshadowed by his positive achievement and has been quietly forgotten.) The same process of inference from periodic trends is still used by inorganic chemists to rationalize trends in the physical and chemical properties of compounds and to suggest the synthesis of previously unknown compounds. For instance, by recognizing that carbon and silicon are in the same family, the existence of alkenes, R<sub>2</sub>CCR<sub>2</sub>, suggests that R<sub>2</sub>SiSiR<sub>2</sub> ought to exist too. Compounds with silicon&#x2013;silicon double bonds (disilaethenes) do indeed exist, but it was not until 1981 that chemists succeeded in isolating one. The periodic trends in the properties of the elements are explored further in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p class="noindentt">The layout of the periodic table reflects the electronic structure of the atoms of the elements (<a href="#fig_1.22">Fig. 1.22</a>). We can now see, for instance, that a <b>block</b> of the table indicates the type of subshell currently being occupied according to the building-up principle. Each <b>period</b>, or row, of the table corresponds to the completion of the s, p, d, and f subshells of a given shell. The period number is the value of the principal quantum number <i>n</i> of the shell which according to the building-up principle is currently being occupied in the main groups of the table. For example, Period 2 corresponds to the <i>n</i> &#x003D; 2 shell and the filling of the 2s and 2p subshells.</p>
<p class="indent">The <b>group</b> numbers, <i>G</i>, are closely related to the number of electrons in the <b>valence shell</b>, the outermost shell of the atom. In the &#x2018;1&#x2013;18&#x2019; numbering system recommended by IUPAC:</p>

<h3 class="h3">1.7 <b>Atomic properties</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Certain characteristic properties of atoms, particularly their radii and the energies associated with the removal and addition of electrons, show regular periodic variations with atomic number. These atomic properties are of considerable importance for understanding the chemical properties of the elements and are discussed further in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>. A knowledge of these trends enables chemists to rationalize observations and predict likely chemical and structural behaviour without having to refer to tabulated data for each element.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec_1.7a">(a) Atomic and ionic radii</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Atomic radii increase down a group and, within the s and p blocks, decrease from left to right across a period. The lanthanoid contraction results in a decrease in atomic radius for elements following the f block.

<p class="noindentt">One of the most useful atomic characteristics of an element is the size of its atoms and ions. As we shall see in later chapters, geometrical considerations are central to explaining the structures of many solids and individual molecules. In addition, the average distance of an electron from the nucleus of an atom correlates with the energy needed to remove it in the process of forming a cation.</p>
<p><a id="page_23" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 23, Atomic structure</a></p>
<p class="indent">An atom does not have a precise radius because far from the nucleus the electron density falls off only exponentially (but sharply). However, we can expect atoms with numerous electrons to be larger, in some sense, than atoms that have only a few electrons. Such considerations have led chemists to propose a variety of definitions of atomic radius on the basis of empirical considerations.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The <b>metallic radius</b> of a metallic element is defined as half the experimentally determined distance between the centres of nearest-neighbour atoms in the solid (<a href="#fig_1.23">Fig. 1.23</a>a, but see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a> for a refinement of this definition). The <b>covalent radius</b> of a nonmetallic element is similarly defined as half the internuclear distance between neighbouring atoms of the same element in a molecule (<a href="#fig_1.23">Fig. 1.23b</a>). We shall refer to metallic and covalent radii jointly as <b>atomic radii</b> (<a href="#tab1.3">Table 1.3</a>). The periodic trends in metallic and covalent radii can be seen from the data in the table and are illustrated in <a href="#fig_1.24">Fig 1.24</a>. As will be familiar from introductory chemistry, atoms may be linked by single, double, and triple bonds, with multiple bonds shorter than single bonds between the same two elements. The <b>ionic radius</b> (<a href="#fig_1.23">Fig. 1.23c</a>) of an element is related to the distance between the centres of neighbouring cations and anions in an ionic compound. An arbitrary decision has to be taken on how to apportion the cation&#x2013;anion distance between the two ions. There have been many suggestions: in one common scheme, the radius of the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion is taken to be 140 pm (<a href="#tab1.4">Table 1.4</a>; see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a> for a refinement of this definition). For example, the ionic radius of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is obtained by subtracting 140 pm from the internuclear distance between adjacent Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions in solid MgO.</p>
<p class="indent">The data in <a href="#tab1.3">Table 1.3</a> show that <i>atomic radii increase down a group</i> and that they <i>decrease from left to right across a period.</i> These trends are readily interpreted in terms of the electronic structure of the atoms. On descending a group, the valence electrons are found in orbitals of successively higher principal quantum number.

<p class="noindent">hence their radii normally increase down the group. Across a period, the valence electrons enter orbitals of the same shell; however, the increase in effective nuclear charge across the period draws in the electrons and results in progressively more compact atoms. The general increase in radius down a group and decrease across a period should be remembered as they correlate well with trends in many chemical properties.</p>
<p class="indent">Period 6 shows an interesting and important modification to these otherwise general trends. We see from <a href="#fig_1.24">Fig. 1.24</a> that the metallic radii in the third row of the d block are very similar to those in the second row, and not significantly larger as might be expected given their considerably greater numbers of electrons. For example, the atomic radii of Mo (<i>Z</i> &#x003D; 42) and W (<i>Z</i> &#x003D; 74) are 140 and 141 pm, respectively, despite the latter having many more electrons. The reduction of radius below that expected on the basis of a simple extrapolation down the group is a result of the so called <b>lanthanoid contraction</b>. The name points to the origin of the effect. The elements in the third row of the d block (Period 6) are preceded by the elements of the first row of the f block, the lanthanoids, in which the 4f orbitals are being occupied. These orbitals have poor shielding properties and so the valence electrons experience more attraction from the nuclear charge than might be expected. The repulsions between electrons being added on crossing the f block fail to compensate for the increasing nuclear charge, so <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> increases between La and Lu. The dominating effect of the latter is to draw in all the electrons and hence to result in a more compact atom for the later lanthanoids and the third row d-block elements that follow them. A similar contraction is found in the elements that follow the d block for the same reasons. For example, although there is a substantial increase in atomic radius between C and Si (77 and 118 pm, respectively), the atomic radius of Ge (122 pm) is only slightly greater than that of Si.</p>
<div class="bggr2" style="width:67%;">
<p class="noindentf"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> The 4f and 5f elements are known as lanthanoids and actinoids. Older texts may refer to them as lanthanides and actinides but the suffix &#x2018;ides&#x2019; should only be used for anionic species.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page_25" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 25, Atomic structure</a></p>
<p class="indent">Relativistic effects, especially the increase in mass as particles approach the speed of light, have an important role to play on the elements in and following Period 6 but are rather subtle. Electrons in s and p orbitals, which approach closely to the highly charged nucleus and experience strong accelerations, increase in mass and there is an associated contraction in the radii of the orbitals, whereas the less penetrating d and f orbitals expand. One consequence of the latter expansion is that d and f electrons become less effective at shielding other electrons, and the outermost s electron orbitals contract further. For light elements, relativistic effects can be neglected but for the heavier elements with high atomic numbers they become significant and can result in an approximately 20 per cent reduction in the size of the atom.</p>
<p class="indent">Another general feature, apparent from <a href="#tab1.4">Table 1.4</a>, is that all monatomic anions are larger than their parent atoms and all monatomic cations are smaller than their parent atoms (in some cases markedly so). The increase in radius of an atom on anion formation is a result of the greater electron&#x2013;electron repulsions that occur when an additional electron is added to form an anion. There is also an associated decrease in the value of <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>. The smaller radius of a cation compared with its parent atom is a consequence not only of the reduction in electron&#x2013;electron repulsions that follow electron loss but also of the fact that cation formation typically results in the loss of the valence electrons and an increase in <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>. That loss often leaves behind only the much more compact closed shells of electrons. Once these gross differences are taken into account, the variation in ionic radii through the periodic table mirrors that of the atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Although small variations in atomic radii may seem of little importance, in fact atomic radius plays a central role in the chemical properties of the elements. Small changes can have profound consequences, as we shall see in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Ionization energy</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> First ionization energies are lowest at the lower left of the periodic table (near caesium) and greatest near the upper right (near helium). Successive ionizations of a species require higher energies.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The ease with which an electron can be removed from an atom is measured by its <b>ionization energy</b>, <i>I</i> or &#x0394;<sub>ion</sub><i>H</i>, the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a gas-phase atom:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;" id="eqn_1.8">
 <img src="../images/page25-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindentt">The <b>first ionization energy</b>, <i>I</i><sub>1</sub>, is the energy required to remove the least tightly bound electron from the neutral atom; the <b>second ionization energy</b>, <i>I</i><sub>2</sub>, is the energy required to remove the least tightly bound electron from the resulting cation; and so on. Ionization energies are conveniently expressed in electronvolts (eV), but are easily converted into kilojoules per mole by using 1 eV &#x003D; 96.485 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The ionization energy of the H atom is 13.6 eV, so to remove an electron from an H atom is equivalent to dragging the electron through a potential difference of 13.6 V.</p>
<div class="bggr2" style="width:67%;">
<p class="noindentf"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> In thermodynamic calculations it is often more appropriate to use the <b>ionization enthalpy</b>, the standard enthalpy of the process in <a href="#eqn_1.8">eqn 1.8</a>, typically at 298 K. The molar ionization enthalpy is larger by <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math> <i>RT</i> than the ionization energy. This difference stems from the change from <i>T</i> &#x003D; 0 (assumed implicitly for <i>I</i>) to the temperature <i>T</i> (typically 298 K) to which the enthalpy value refers, and the replacement of 1 mol of gas particles by 2 mol of gaseous ions plus electrons. However, because <i>RT</i> is only 2.5 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (corresponding to 0.026 eV) at room temperature and ionization energies are of the order of 10<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 10<sup>3</sup> kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (1&#x2212; 10 eV), the difference between ionization energy and enthalpy can often be ignored.</p>
</div>
<p class="indentt">To a large extent, the first ionization energy of an element is determined by the energy of the highest occupied orbital of its ground-state atom. First ionization energies vary systematically through the periodic table (<a href="#tab1.5">Table 1.5</a>, <a href="#fig_1.25">Fig. 1.25</a>), being smallest at the lower left (near Cs) and greatest near the upper right (near He). The variation follows the pattern of effective nuclear charge including some subtle modulations arising from the effect of electron&#x2013;electron repulsions within the same subshell. A useful approximation is that, for an electron from a shell with principal quantum number <i>n</i>,</p>

<p class="noindentt">Ionization energies also correlate strongly with atomic radii, and elements that have small atomic radii generally have high ionization energies. The explanation of the correlation is that in a small atom an electron is close to the nucleus and experiences a strong Coulombic attraction, making it difficult to remove. Therefore, as the atomic radius increases down a group, the ionization energy decreases and the decrease in radius across a period is accompanied by a gradual increase in ionization energy.</p>
<p class="indent">Some deviation from this general trend in ionization energy can be explained quite readily. An example is the observation that the first ionization energy of boron is smaller <a id="page_27" class="page">page 27, Atomic structure</a>than that of beryllium, despite the former&#x2019;s higher nuclear charge. This anomaly is readily explained by noting that, on going to boron, the outermost electron occupies a 2p orbital and hence is less strongly bound than if it had occupied a 2s orbital. As a result, the value of <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> decreases from Be to B. The decrease between N and O has a slightly different explanation. The configurations of the two atoms are</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-13em;">
 <img src="../images/page27-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindentt">We see that, in an O atom, two electrons are present in a single 2p orbital. They repel each other strongly, and this strong repulsion offsets the greater nuclear charge. Another contribution to the difference is that removing an electron from an O atom to produce an O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion does not involve any reduction in the exchange energy, as the ionized electron is the only one with the &#x2193; spin orientation. Additionally, the half-filled shell of p orbitals of nitrogen is a particularly stable configuration as the ionization of an electron from the 2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup> configuration does involve a significant loss of exchange energy.</p>
<p class="indent">When considering F and Ne on the right of Period 2, the last electrons enter orbitals that are already half full, and continue the trend from O towards higher ionization energy. The higher values of the ionization energies of these two elements reflect the high value of <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>. The value of <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> falls back sharply from Ne to Na as the outermost electron occupies the next shell with an increased principal quantum number and is therefore further from the nucleus.</p>

<p class="boxpara">As in the analogous case of N and O, in the ground state of S two electrons are present in a single 3p orbital. They are so close together that they repel each other strongly, and this increased repulsion offsets the effect of the greater nuclear charge of S compared with P.

</aside>
<p class="indentt">Another important pattern is that successive ionizations of an element require increasingly higher energies (<a href="#fig_1.26">Fig. 1.26</a>). Thus, the second ionization energy of an element E (the energy needed to remove an electron from the cation E<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) is higher than its first ionization energy, and its third ionization energy (the energy needed to remove an electron from E<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) is higher still. The explanation is that the higher the positive charge of a species, the greater the electrostatic attraction experienced by the electron being removed; that is, there is a higher proton : electron ratio. Moreover, when an electron is removed, <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> increases and the atom contracts. It is then even more difficult to remove an electron from this smaller, more compact, cation. The difference in ionization energy is greatly magnified when the electron is removed from a closed shell of the atom (as is the case for the second ionization energy of Li and any of its congeners or elements in the same group) because the electron must then be extracted from a compact orbital in which it interacts strongly with the nucleus. The first ionization energy of Li, for instance, is 513 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, but its second ionization energy is 7297 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, more than 10 times greater.</p>
<p class="indent">The pattern of successive ionization energies down a group is far from simple. <a href="#fig_1.26">Figure 1.26</a> shows the first, second, and third ionization energies of the members of Group 13. Although they lie in the expected order <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> &#x003C; <i>I</i><sub>2</sub> &#x003C; <i>I</i><sub>3</sub>, there is no simple trend. The lesson to be drawn is that whenever an argument hangs on trends in small differences in ionization energies, it is always best to refer to actual numerical values rather than to guess a likely outcome (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.2">Section 9.2</a>).</p>

The electron configuration of B is 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>1</sup>. The first ionization energy corresponds to removal of the electron in the 2p orbital. This electron is shielded from the nuclear charge by the core and the full 2s orbital. The second value corresponds to removal of a 2s electron from the B<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation. This electron is more difficult to remove on account of the increased effective nuclear charge.

The second electron-gain enthalpy, the enthalpy change for the attachment of an electron to a mono-negatively charged atom, is invariably positive because the electron repulsion outweighs the nuclear attraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The electron affinity of an element is largely determined by the energy of the <i>lowest unfilled</i> (or half-filled) orbital of the ground-state atom. This orbital is one of the two <b>frontier orbitals</b> of an atom, the other one being the <i>highest filled</i> atomic orbital. The frontier orbitals are the sites of many of the changes in electron distribution when bonds form, and we shall see more of their importance throughout the text. An element has a high electron affinity if the additional electron can enter a shell where it experiences a strong effective nuclear charge. This is the case for elements towards the top right of the periodic table, as we have already explained. Therefore, elements close to fluorine (specifically O and Cl, but not the noble gases) can be expected to have the highest electron affinities as their <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> is large and it is possible to add electrons to the valence shell. Nitrogen has very low electron affinity because there is a high electron repulsion when the incoming electron enters an orbital that is already half full and there is no gain in exchange energy as the additional electron has a spin anti-parallel to those of the other 2p electrons.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec_1.7d">(d) Electronegativity</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The electronegativity of an element is the power of an atom of the element to attract electrons when it is part of a compound; there is a general increase in electronegativity across a period and a general decrease down a group.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The <b>electronegativity</b>, <i>&#x03C7;</i> (chi), of an element is the power of an atom of the element in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. Scales of electronegativity are always based upon atoms in molecules rather than isolated atoms. If an atom has a strong tendency to acquire electrons, it is said to be highly electronegative (like the elements close to fluorine). Electronegativity is a very useful concept in chemistry and has numerous applications, which include a rationalization of bond energies and the types of reactions that substances undergo and the prediction of the polarities of bonds and molecules (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Periodic trends in electronegativity can be predicted by trends in the size of the atoms and electron configuration, even though electronegativity refers to atoms within compounds. If an atom is small and has an almost closed shell of electrons, then it is more likely to have a high electronegativity. Consequently, the electronegativities of the elements typically increase left to right across a period and decrease down a group.</p>
<p class="indent">Quantitative measures of electronegativity have been defined in many different ways. Linus Pauling&#x2019;s original formulation (which results in the values denoted <i>&#x03C7;</i><sub>P</sub> in Table <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Chapter 1.7</a>) draws on concepts related to the energetics of bond formation, which will be dealt with in 2.<sup><a id="ich1fn2"></a><a href="#ch1fn2">2</a></sup> A definition more in the spirit of this chapter, in the sense that it is based on the properties of individual atoms, was proposed by Robert Mulliken.

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">atom has a high ionization energy, <i>I</i>, and a high electron affinity, <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>, then it will be likely to acquire rather than lose electrons when it is part of a compound, and hence be classified as highly electronegative. Conversely, if its ionization energy and electron affinity are both low, then the atom will in its compounds donate electrons rather than gain them, and hence be classified as electropositive. These observations provide the basis of the definition of the <b>Mulliken electronegativity</b>, <i>&#x03C7;</i><sub><small>M</small></sub>, as the average value of the ionization energy and the electron affinity of the element (both expressed in electronvolts):</p>

<p class="indent">The hidden complication in the apparently simple definition of the Mulliken electronegativity is that the ionization energy and electron affinity in the definition relate to the <b>valence state</b>, the electron configuration the atom is supposed to have when it is part of a molecule. Hence, some calculation is required because the ionization energy and electron affinity to be used in calculating <i>&#x03C7;</i><sub>M</sub> are mixtures of values for various actual spectroscopically observable states of the atom. We need not go into the calculation, but the resulting values given in <a href="#tab1.7">Table 1.7</a> may be compared with the Pauling values (<a href="#fig_1.27">Fig. 1.27</a>). The two scales give similar values and show the same trends. One reasonably reliable conversion between the two is</p>

<p class="noindent">Because the elements near F (other than the noble gases) have high ionization energies and appreciable electron affinities, these elements have the highest Mulliken electronegativities. Because <i>&#x03C7;</i><sup><sub>M</sub></sup> depends on atomic energy levels&#x2014;and in particular on the location of the highest filled and lowest empty orbitals&#x2014;the electronegativity of an element is high if the two frontier orbitals of its atoms are low in energy.</p>
<p class="indent">Various alternative &#x2018;atomic&#x2019; definitions of electronegativity have been proposed. A widely used scale, suggested by A.L. Allred and E. Rochow, is based on the view that <a id="page_31" class="page">page 31, Atomic structure</a>electronegativity is determined by the electric field at the surface of an atom. As we have seen, an electron in an atom experiences an effective nuclear charge <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>. The Coulombic potential at the surface of such an atom is proportional to <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>/<i>r</i>, and the electric field there is proportional to <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>. The <b>Allred&#x2013;Rochow electronegativity</b>, <i>&#x03C7;</i><sub>AR</sub>, is assumed to be proportional to this field, with <i>r</i> taken to be the covalent radius of the atom:</p>

<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.1</b></span> In the paper &#x2018;What can the Bohr&#x2212;Sommerfeld model show students of chemistry in the 21st century?&#x2019; (M. Niaz and L. Cardellini, L., <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i> <b>2011</b> 88<b>,</b> 240) the authors use the development of models of atomic structure to deliberate on the nature of science. What were the shortcomings of the Bohr model of the atom? How did Sommerfeld refine Bohr&#x2019;s model? How did Pauli resolve some of the new model&#x2019;s shortcomings? Discuss what these developments teach us about the nature of science.</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.2</b></span> Survey the early and modern proposals for the construction of the periodic table. You should consider attempts to arrange the elements on helices and cones as well as the more practical two-dimensional surfaces. What, in your judgement, are the advantages and disadvantages of the various arrangements?</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.3</b></span> The decision about which elements should be identified as belonging to the f block has been a matter of some controversy. A view has been expressed by W.B. Jensen (<i>J. Chem. Educ</i>. <b>1982,</b> 59, 635). Summarize the controversy and Jensen&#x2019;s arguments. An alternative view has been expressed by L. Lavalle (<i>J. Chem. Educ</i>. <b>2008,</b> 85, 1482). Summarize the controversy and the arguments.</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.4</b></span> During 1999 several papers appeared in the scientific literature claiming that d orbitals of Cu<sub>2</sub>O had been observed experimentally. In his paper &#x2018;Have orbitals really been observed?&#x2019; (<i>J. Chem. Educ</i>. <b>2000,</b> 77, 1494), Eric Scerri reviews these claims and discusses whether orbitals can be observed physically. Summarize his arguments briefly.</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.5</b></span> At various times the following two sequences have been proposed for the elements to be included in Group 3: (a) Sc, Y, La, Ac; (b) Sc, Y, Lu, Lr. Because ionic radii strongly influence the chemical properties of the metallic elements, it might be thought that ionic radii could be used as one criterion for the periodic arrangement of the elements. Use this criterion to describe which of these sequences is preferred.</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.6</b></span> In the paper &#x2018;Ionization energies of atoms and atomic ions&#x2019; (P.F. Lang and B.C. Smith, <i>J. Chem. Educ</i>. <b>2003,</b> 80, 938) the authors discuss the apparent irregularities in the first and second ionization energies of d- and f-block elements. Describe how these inconsistencies are rationalized.</p>
<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>1.7</b></span> The electron configuration of the transition metals is described by W.H.E. Schwarz in his paper &#x2018;The full story of the electron configurations of the transition elements&#x2019; (<i>J. Chem. Educ</i>. <b>87</b> (2010), 4, 444). Schwarz discussed five features that must be considered to fully understand the electron configurations of these elements. Discuss each of these five features and summarize the impact of each on our understanding of the electronic configurations.</p>
