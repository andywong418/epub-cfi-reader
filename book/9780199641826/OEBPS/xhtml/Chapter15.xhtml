<p class="bh-noindent"><b>The chemical properties of the Group 15 elements are very diverse. Although the simple trends that we observed for Groups 13 and 14 are still apparent, they are complicated by the fact that the Group 15 elements exhibit a wide range of oxidation states and form many complex compounds with oxygen. Nitrogen makes up a large proportion of the atmosphere and is widely distributed in the biosphere. Phosphorus is essential for both plant and animal life. In stark contrast, arsenic is a well-known poison.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt" style="margin-top:1.9em;">The Group 15 elements&#x2014;nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth&#x2014;are some of the most important elements for life, geology, and industry. They range from gaseous nitrogen to metallic bismuth. The members of this group, the &#x2018;nitrogen group&#x2019;, are sometimes referred to collectively as the pnictogens (from the Greek for to &#x2018;stifle&#x2019;, a property of nitrogen). This name is neither widely used nor officially sanctioned. As in the rest of the p block, the element at the head of Group 15, nitrogen, differs significantly from its congeners. Its coordination number is generally lower and it is the only member of the group to exist as a gaseous, diatomic molecule under normal conditions.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent">&#160;</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch15.1a">
<h3 class="bh-h3a1"><b>PART A: THE ESSENTIALS</b></h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">The properties of the Group 15 elements are diverse and more difficult to rationalize in terms of atomic radii and electron configuration than the p-block elements encountered so far. The usual trends of increasing metallic character down a group and stability of low oxidation states at the foot of the group are still evident but they are complicated by the wide range of oxidation states available.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Nitrogen is a gas; the heavier elements are all solids that exist in several allotropic forms.</b></p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">All the members of the group other than N are solids under normal conditions. However, the trend to increasing metallic character down the group is not clear-cut because the electrical conductivities of the heavier elements actually decrease from As to Bi <a href="Chapter15.xhtml#tab15.1">(Table 15.1)</a>. The normal increase in conductivity down a group reflects the closer spacing of the atomic energy levels in heavier elements and hence a smaller separation of the valence and conduction bands (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>). The opposite trend in conductivity in this group suggests that there must be a more pronounced molecular character in the solid state. Indeed, the structures of solid As, Sb, and Bi have three nearest-neighbour atoms and three more at significantly larger distances. The ratio of these long and short interactions decreases down the group, indicating the onset of a polymeric, molecular structure. The band structure of Bi suggests a low density of conduction electrons and holes, and it is best classified as a metalloid rather than as a semiconductor or a true metal.</p>

In each puckered layers (upper diagram), every Bi atom has three nearest neighbours; three weaker interactions exist with Bi atoms in an adjacent sheet.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="bh-indent">The solid elements of Group 15 exist as a number of allotropes. Like the gaseous N<sub>2</sub> molecule, P<sub>2</sub> has a formal triple bond and a short bond length (189&#x2009;pm). The strength of &#x03C0; bonds formed by Period 3 elements is weak relative to those of Period 2, so the allotrope P<sub>2</sub> is much less favoured than N<sub>2</sub>. <i>White phosphorus</i> is a waxy solid consisting of tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub> molecules (<b>1</b>). Despite the small P&#x0064;P&#x0064;P angle (60&#x00B0;), the molecules persist in the vapour up to about 800&#x00B0;C, but above that temperature the equilibrium concentration of P<sub>2</sub> becomes appreciable. White phosphorus is very reactive and bursts into flame in air to yield P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>. <i>Red phosphorus</i> can be obtained by heating white phosphorus at 300&#x00B0;C in an inert atmosphere for several days. It is normally obtained as an amorphous solid, but crystalline materials can be prepared that have very complex three-dimensional network structures. Unlike white phosphorus, red phosphorus does not ignite readily in air. When phosphorus is heated under high pressure, a series of phases of <i>black phosphorus</i> are formed, the thermodynamically most stable form below 550&#x00B0;C. One of the phases consists of puckered layers composed of pyramidal three-coordinate P atoms (<a href="#fig_15.1">Fig. 15.1</a>). In contrast to the usual practice of choosing the most stable ambient phase of an element as the reference phase for thermodynamic calculations, white phosphorus is adopted because it is more accessible and better characterized than the other forms.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">Arsenic exists in two solid forms, <i>yellow arsenic</i> and <i>grey</i> or <i>metallic arsenic</i>. Yellow arsenic and gaseous arsenic both consist of tetrahedral As<sub>4</sub> molecules. Yellow arsenic is transformed into the more stable metallic arsenic by exposure to light. The structure at room temperature of metallic As, and of Sb and Bi, is built from puckered hexagonal layers in which each atom has three nearest neighbours. The layers stack in a way that gives three more distant neighbours in the adjacent net, as described above <a href="#fig_15.2">(Fig. 15.2)</a>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Bismuth has recently been found to be radioactive, decaying by &#x03B1; emission with a half-life of 1.9&#x2009;&#x00D7;&#x2009;10<sup>19</sup> years, which is much longer than the current age of the universe.</p>

This configuration suggests that the highest oxidation state should be &#x002B;5, as is indeed the case.

<p class="bh-indent">Nitrogen has a very high electronegativity (significantly exceeded by only O and F) and in many compounds&#x2014;for example the nitrides, which contain the N<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> ion, and ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;nitrogen is in a negative oxidation state. Nitrogen achieves positive oxidation states only in compounds with the more electronegative elements O and F. Nitrogen does achieve the group oxidation state (&#x002B;5), but only under much stronger oxidizing conditions than are necessary to achieve this state for the other elements of the group.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The distinctive nature of nitrogen is due in large part to its high electronegativity, its small atomic radius, and the absence of accessible d orbitals. Thus, N seldom has coordination numbers greater than 4 in simple molecular compounds, but the heavier elements frequently reach coordination numbers of 5 and 6, as in PCl<sub>5</sub> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>AsF</mtext></mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> </p>

<p class="bh-indent">All the elements form simple hydrides (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>). Ammonia NH<sub>3</sub> (<b>5</b>) is a pungent gas that is toxic at high levels of exposure. Ammonia is an excellent solvent for the Group 1 metals; for instance, it is possible to dissolve 330&#x2009;g of Cs in 100&#x2009;g of liquid ammonia at &#x2212;50&#x00B0;C. These highly coloured, electrically conducting solutions contain solvated electrons (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.14">Section 11.14</a>). The chemical properties of ammonium salts are similar to those of the Group 1 ions, especially K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Rb<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Ammonium salts decompose on heating and ammonium nitrate is a component of some explosives: it is also widely used as a fertilizer. Nitrogen also forms the colourless liquid hydrazine, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The other hydrides of Group 15 are phosphine (formally phosphane, PH<sub>3</sub>), arsine (arsane, AsH<sub>3</sub>), and stibine (stibane, SbH<sub>3</sub>), which are all poisonous gases.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">In nitrous acid, HNO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen is present as N(III). Nitrous acid is a strong oxidizing agent. Dinitrogen trioxide, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the anhydride of nitrous acid, is a blue solid that melts above &#x2212;100&#x00B0;C to give a blue liquid that dissociates into NO and NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Nitrogen(II) oxide, more commonly nitric oxide, NO, is an odd-electron molecule. However, unlike NO<sub>2</sub> it does not form a stable dimer in the gas phase because the odd electron is distributed almost equally over both atoms and not, as in NO<sub>2</sub>, largely confined to the N atom. Until the late 1980s, no beneficial biological roles were known for NO. However, since then it has been found that NO is generated <i>in vivo</i> (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Section 26.2</a>), and that it performs functions such as the reduction of blood pressure, neurotransmission, and the destruction of microbes. Thousands of scientific papers have been published on the physiological functions of NO but our fundamental knowledge of its biochemistry is still quite meagre.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The average oxidation number of nitrogen in dinitrogen oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O (specifically, NNO), which is commonly called nitrous oxide, is &#x002B;1. N<sub>2</sub>O is a colourless, unreactive gas. One sign of this inertness is that N<sub>2</sub>O has been used as the propellant gas for instant whipping cream. Similarly, N<sub>2</sub>O was used for many years as a mild anaesthetic; however, this practice has been discontinued because of undesirable physiological side effects, particularly mild hysteria, indicated by its common name of <i>laughing gas</i>. It is still used in a 50:50 mixture with oxygen as an analgesic in childbirth and in clinical procedures, such as wound suturing. Interestingly, N<sub>2</sub>O is now acknowledged to be an ozone-depleting agent equivalent to chlorofluorocarbons, in addition to being a potential greenhouse gas.</p>

<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:2em;">Phosphorus was first isolated by Hennig Brandt in 1669. Brandt, misinterpreting their colour, was trying to extract gold from urine and sand, and instead extracted a white solid, which glowed in the dark. This element was called phosphorus after the Greek for &#x2018;light bearer&#x2019;. Today, phosphorus is produced by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid on the mineral fluorapatite to generate phosphoric acid, from which elemental phosphorous is subsequently extracted:</p>

<p class="bh-indent">The product of the treatment of phosphate-containing minerals with acid contains d-metal contaminants that are difficult to remove completely, so its use is largely confined to fertilizers and metal treatment. Most pure phosphoric acid and phosphorus compounds are still produced from the element because it can be purified by sublimation. The production of elemental phosphorus starts with crude calcium phosphate, which is reduced with carbon in an electric arc furnace. Silica is added (as sand) to produce a slag of calcium silicate:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/equ412b.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The slag is molten at these high temperatures and so can easily be removed from the furnace. The phosphorus vaporizes and is condensed to the solid, which is stored under water to protect it from reaction with air. Most phosphorus produced in this way is burned to form P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, which is then hydrated to yield pure phosphoric acid.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Arsenic is usually extracted from the flue dust of copper and lead smelters 15.1. However, it is also obtained by heating the ores in the absence of oxygen:</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara">The environmental toxicity of arsenic is a problem of groundwater contamination. The worst occurrence of arsenic pollution is in Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian province of West Bengal, where hundreds of thousands of people have been diagnosed with arsenicosis. Three major rivers drain into this region, bringing iron-laden sediments from the mountains. The fertile delta is heavily farmed, and organic matter leaches into the shallow aquifer, creating reducing conditions. Arsenic levels are correlated with iron levels in groundwater and the arsenic is thought to be released on the dissolution of iron oxides and hydroxides from the ores.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Paradoxically, the problem grew out of a scheme sponsored by the United Nations, starting in the 1960s, to provide clean drinking water (replacing contaminated surface water) by sinking inexpensive tube wells into the aquifer. These wells did in fact improve health greatly by reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases, but the high arsenic content went unrecognized for many years. The tube wells are typically 20&#x2212;100&#x2009;m deep. Groundwater closer to the surface has not had time to develop high concentrations of arsenic, and below 100&#x2009;m the sediment has depleted in arsenic over time. As many as half of the four million tube wells exceed the Bangladesh arsenic standard of 50&#x2009;ppb (the World Health Organization&#x2019;s guideline is 10&#x2009;ppb), whereas levels routinely exceed 500&#x2009;ppb in the more contaminated areas. There are several schemes to treat the well water to remove arsenic, and new wells could be dug into deeper, uncontaminated aquifers. The World Bank is coordinating a mitigation plan, but the massive effort could take years.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Arsenicosis develops over a period of up to 20 years. The first symptoms are keratoses of the skin, which develop into cancers; the liver and kidneys also deteriorate. The early stage is reversible if arsenic ingestion is discontinued, but once cancers develop, effective treatment becomes more difficult. The biochemistry of these effects is uncertain. Arsenate is reduced to As(III) complexes in the body, which probably act by binding sulfhydryl groups. A plausible link to cancer is suggested by the laboratory finding that low levels of arsenic inhibit hormone receptors that turn on cancer suppressor genes.</p></div>
<p class="bh-noindent">The major nonchemical use of nitrogen gas is as an inert atmosphere in metal processing, petroleum refining, and food processing. Nitrogen gas is used to provide an inert atmosphere in the laboratory, and liquid nitrogen (b.p. &#x2212;196&#x00B0;C, 77&#x2009;K) is a convenient refrigerant in both industry and the laboratory. The major industrial use of nitrogen is in the production of ammonia by the <i>Haber process</i> (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.6">Section 15.6</a>) and conversion to nitric acid by the <i>Ostwald process</i> (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.13">Section 15.13</a>). Ammonia provides a route to a wide range of nitrogen compounds, which include fertilizers, plastics, and explosives (<a href="#fig_15.4">Fig. 15.4</a>). Nitrogen plays a crucial role in biology as it is a constituent of amino acids, nucleic acids, and proteins, and the nitrogen cycle is one <a id="page_413" class="page">page 413, The Group 15 elements</a>of the most important processes in the ecosystem (<a href="#box15.2">Box 15.2</a> and <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Phosphorus is used in pyrotechnics, smoke bombs, steel making, and alloys. Red phosphorus mixed with sand is used as the striking strip on matchboxes. The friction involved in striking a match produces enough heat to convert some of the red phosphorus to white phosphorus which then ignites. Sodium phosphate is used as a cleaning agent, a water softener, and to prevent scaling in boilers and pipes. Condensed phosphates are added to detergents as builders that enhance the detergency by softening the water by forming complexes with metal ions. In the natural environment, phosphorus is usually present as phosphate ions. Phosphorus (together with N and K) is an essential plant nutrient. However, as a result of the low solubility of many metal phosphates it is often depleted in soil, and hence hydrogenphosphates are important components of balanced fertilizers. Approximately 85 per cent of the phosphoric acid produced goes into fertilizer manufacture. Phosphorus is also an important constituent of bones and teeth (which are predominantly calcium phosphate), cell membranes (phosphate esters of fatty acids), and nucleic acids, including DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-transfer unit of living organisms (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Section 26.2</a>). The phosphines, PX<sub>3</sub>, are widely used ligands (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.1">Section 7.1</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara">Most of the molecules used by biological systems&#x2014;including proteins, nucleic acids, chlorophyll, various enzymes and vitamins, and many other cellular constituents&#x2014;contain nitrogen. In all these compounds, nitrogen is in its reduced form with an oxidation number of &#x2013;3. Although N<sub>2</sub> is the most abundant constituent of the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, its usefulness is limited by its unreactivity, and the requirements of the biosphere come from the process of nitrogen fixation. Therefore, a major challenge to biology (and technology) involves the reduction of N<sub>2</sub> for incorporation into essential nitrogen compounds.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The nitrogen cycle is shown in <a href="#fig_b15.1">Fig.B15.1.</a> The cycle can be viewed as a set of enzymatically catalysed redox reactions that lead to an accessible supply of reduced nitrogen compounds. Microorganisms are almost entirely responsible for the interconversion of inorganic forms of nitrogen. The enzymes that catalyse these conversions have Fe, Mo, and Cu at their active site. Enzymes of the nitrogen cycle are discussed in <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>. The enzyme system for nitrogen fixation functions anaerobically, and O<sub>2</sub> rapidly and irreversibly destroys the enzyme. Nevertheless, nitrogen fixation also occurs in aerobic bacteria. In some higher plants nitrogen-fixing bacteria </p>

<p class="bh-boxparai">A reduction potential of below 0.30 V is required for biological nitrogen fixation. Reduced ferredoxins or flavoproteins with reduction potentials of &#x2013;0.4 to &#x2013;0.5&#x2009;V are readily available in biological systems <a href="Chapter27.xhtml#ch27">(Chapter 27)</a>. Whereas these potentials indicate that nitrogen fixation is thermodynamically feasible, this is not the case kinetically. The kinetic barrier to N<sub>2</sub> reduction apparently arises from the need to form bound intermediates in the conversion of N<sub>2</sub> to ammonia. Organisms invest metabolic energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, for which &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x29B5;</sup>&#x2009;&#x2248;&#x2009;&#x2212;31&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, for conversion to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) to produce the key intermediates in the N<sub>2</sub> fixation process. The reduction of N<sub>2</sub> consumes 16 molecules of ATP for each molecule of N<sub>2</sub> reduced. Given the opportunity, most organisms capable of nitrogen fixation use available fixed nitrogen sources (ammonia, nitrate, or nitrite) and repress the synthesis of the elaborate nitrogen fixation system.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Once nitrogen is reduced, organisms incorporate the nitrogen into organic molecules, where it enters the biosynthetic pathways of the cell. When organisms die and biomass decays, organonitrogen compounds decompose and release nitrogen to the environment in the form of NH<sub>3</sub> or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>  depending on the conditions.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The growing human population and its dependence on synthetic fertilizers have had enormous impact on the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia synthesis is carried out by the Haber process (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.12">Section 25.12</a>), which augments the total fixed nitrogen available to life on Earth. Between a third and a half of all nitrogen fixed occurs through technological and agricultural, rather than natural, means. In addition to ammonia itself, nitrate salts are produced industrially from ammonia for use in fertilizers. Both ammonia and nitrates enter the nitrogen cycle as fertilizer, which increases all segments of the natural cycle. The natural reservoirs are inadequate sinks for the excess input. Under such conditions, nitrate or nitrite may accumulate as an undesirable component of groundwater or produce eutrophication in lakes, wetlands, river deltas, and coastal areas.</p></div>

<p class="bh-boxpara">&#x2018;Arsenicals&#x2019; is the term used to describe chemicals containing arsenic. Arsenic and its compounds are intensely toxic and all the applications of arsenicals are based on this broad spectrum toxicity.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Inorganic arsenicals in the form of the mineral realgar and arsenolite were used in ancient times to treat ulcers, skin diseases, and leprosy. In the early 1900s an organoarsenic compound was found to be an effective treatment for syphilis and led to a rapid increase in research in this area. This initial treatment has now been replaced by penicillin, but organoarsenic compounds are still used today to treat trypanosiosis, or sleeping sickness, which is caused by a parasite in the blood. Arsenoamide, C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>12</sub>AsNO<sub>5</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, is used in veterinary medicines to treat heartworm in dogs.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Arsenilic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>AsNO<sub>3</sub>, and sodium arsenilate, NaAsC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, are used as antimicrobial agents in animal and poultry feed to prevent the growth of moulds. Another powerful antimicrobial agent is 10,10&#x2019;-oxybisphenoxarsine (OBPA), which is used extensively in the manufacture of plastics.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Arsenicals are also used as insecticides and herbicides. Monosodium methylarsenate (MSMA) is used to control weeds in cotton and turf crops and in domestic lawn treatments. The first arsenic-containing insecticide was <i>Paris green</i>, Cu(CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x22C5;3Cu(AsO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which was manufactured in 1865 for the treatment of the Colorado potato beetle. Sodium arsenite, NaAsO<sub>2</sub>, is used in poison baits to control grasshoppers and as a dip to prevent parasites in livestock.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> The commercial Haber process requires high temperatures and pressures to yield ammonia, which is a major ingredient in fertilizers and an important chemical intermediate.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Nitrogen occurs in many compounds, but N<sub>2</sub> itself, with a triple bond between the two atoms, is strikingly unreactive. A few strong reducing agents can transfer electrons to the N<sub>2</sub> molecule at room temperature, leading to scission of the N&#x2013;N bond, but usually the reaction needs a very strong reducing agent and extreme conditions. The prime example of this reaction is the slow reaction of lithium metal at room temperature, which yields Li<sub>3</sub>N. Similarly, when Mg (the diagonal neighbour of Li) burns in air it forms the nitride as well as the oxide.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The slowness of the reactions of N<sub>2</sub> appears to be the result of several factors. One is the strength of the N&#x2261;N triple bond and hence the high activation energy required for breaking it. (The strength of this bond also accounts for the lack of nitrogen allotropes.) Another factor is the relatively large size of the HOMO&#x2212;LUMO gap in N<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.8">Section 2.8</a>b), which makes the molecule resistant to simple electron-transfer redox processes. A third factor is the low polarizability of N<sub>2</sub>, which does not encourage the formation of the highly polar transition states that are often involved in electrophilic and nucleophilic displacement reactions.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Cheap methods of nitrogen activation&#x2014;its conversion into useful compounds&#x2014;are highly desirable because they would have a profound effect on the economy, particularly in poorer agricultural economies. In the <i>Haber process</i> for the production of ammonia, H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> are combined at high temperatures and pressures over an Fe catalyst, as we discuss in detail in <a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.10">Section 15.10</a>. Much of the recent research aimed at achieving <a id="page_415" class="page">page 415, The Group 15 elements</a>more economical ways of activating N<sub>2</sub> has been inspired by the way in which bacteria carry out the transformation at room temperature. Catalytic conversion of nitrogen to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>  involves the metalloenzyme nitrogenase, which occurs in nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as those found in the root nodules of legumes. The mechanism by which nitrogenase carries out this reaction, at an active site containing Fe, Mo, and S, is the topic of considerable research. In this connection, dinitrogen complexes of metals were discovered in 1965, at about the same time that it was realized that nitrogenase contains Mo (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>). These developments led to optimism that efficient homogeneous catalysts might be developed in which metal ions would coordinate to N<sub>2</sub> and promote its reduction. Many N<sub>2</sub> complexes have in fact been prepared, and in some cases the preparation is as simple as bubbling N<sub>2</sub> through an aqueous solution of a complex:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">As with the isoelectronic CO molecule, end-on bonding is typical of N<sub>2</sub> when it acts as a ligand (9; <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.17">Section 22.17</a>). The N&#x0064;N bond length in the Ru(II) complex is only slightly altered from that in the free molecule. However, when N<sub>2</sub> is coordinated to a more strongly reducing metal centre, this bond is considerably lengthened by back-donation of electron density into the &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals of N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3" style="margin-top:2em;"><b>15.7 Nitrides and azides</b></h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">Nitrogen forms simple binary compounds with other elements; they are classified as nitrides or azides.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(a) Nitrides</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Nitrides are classified as saline, covalent, or interstitial.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">The nitrides of metals can be prepared by direct interaction of the element with nitrogen or ammonia or by thermal decomposition of an amide:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/equ415b.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The compounds of N with H, O, and the halogens are treated separately.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The saline nitrides can be regarded as containing the nitride ion, N<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>. However, the high negative charge of this ion means that it is highly polarizable (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>e) and saline nitrides are likely to have considerable covalent character. Saline nitrides occur for lithium, Li<sub>3</sub>N, and the Group 2 elements, M<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The covalent nitrides, in which the E&#x0064;N bond is covalent, possess a wide range of properties depending on the element to which N is bonded. Some examples of covalent nitrides are boron nitride, BN, cyanogen, (CN)<sub>2</sub>, phosphorus nitride, P<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub>, tetrasulfur tetranitride, S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and disulfur dinitride, S<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. These compounds are discussed in the context of the other elements.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The largest category of nitrides consists of the interstitial nitrides of the d-block elements with formulas MN, M<sub>2</sub>N, or M<sub>4</sub>N. The N atom occupies some or all of the octahedral sites within the cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice of metal atoms. The compounds are hard and inert, with a metallic lustre and conductivity. They are widely used as refractory materials and find applications as crucibles, high-temperature reaction vessels, and thermocouple sheaths.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The nitride ion, N<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>, is often found as a ligand in d-metal complexes. Its high negative charge, small size, and ability to serve as a good &#x03C0;-donor as well as a &#x03C3;-donor means that it can stabilize metals in high oxidation states. The short coordinate bond between the ion and the metal atom is often represented as M&#x2261;N. An example is the complex [Os(N)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<b>11</b>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Ionic azides such as NaN<sub>3</sub> are thermodynamically unstable but kinetically inert; they can be handled at room temperature. Sodium azide is toxic and is used as a chemical preservative and in pest control. When alkali metal azides are heated or detonated by impact they explode, liberating N<sub>2</sub>; this reaction is used in the inflation of air bags in cars, in which the heating of the azide is electrical.</p>
<div class="bh-bgbottom3">
<p class="bh-boxpara"><b><i>A brief illustration</i></b> A typical airbag contains approximately 50&#x2009;g of NaN<sub>3</sub>. To estimate the volume of nitrogen produced when the azide is detonated at room temperature and pressure (20&#x00B0;C and 1&#x2009;atm) we need to consider the amount (in moles) of N<sub>2</sub> molecules produced in the decomposition reaction 2 NaN<sub>3</sub>(s)&#x2009;&#x2192;&#x2009;2 Na(s)&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;3 N<sub>2</sub>(g). The Na produced reacts with KNO3 to produce more N2. Because 50&#x2009;g of NaN<sub>3</sub> contains 0.77&#x2009;mol NaN<sub>3</sub>, it liberates 1.2&#x2009;mol N<sub>2</sub>. This amount occupies 26&#x2009;dm<sup>3</sup> at 20&#x00B0;C and 1&#x2009;atm. As the airbag is restricted in volume, the pressure of nitrogen in the airbag will be high, so providing protection to the driver.</p></div>

Metal-rich phosphides are usually very inert, hard, brittle, refractory materials and resemble the parent metal in having high electrical and thermal conductivities. The structures have a trigonal prismatic arrangement of six, seven, eight, or nine metal ions around a P atom (<b>13</b>). Monophosphides adopt a variety of structures depending on the relative size of the other atom. For example, AlP adopts the zinc-blende structure, SnP adopts the rock-salt structure, and VP adopts the nickel-arsenide structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Phosphorus-rich phosphides have lower melting points and are less stable than metal-rich phosphides and monophosphides. They are semiconductors rather than conductors.</p>

Gallium arsenide is superior to Si for such applications because it has higher electron mobility and the devices produce less electronic noise. Silicon still has major advantages over GaAs in the sense that silicon is cheap and the wafers are stronger than those of GaAs, so processing is easier. Silicon is also less of an environmental problem than GaAs. Gallium arsenide integrated circuits are commonly used in mobile phones, satellite communications, and some radar systems.</p></section>

<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(a) Ammonia</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Ammonia is produced by the Haber process; it is used to manufacture fertilizers and many other useful nitrogen-containing chemicals.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Ammonia is produced in huge quantities worldwide for use as a fertilizer and as a primary source of nitrogen in the production of many chemicals. As already mentioned, the Haber process is used for the entire global production. In this process, N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> combine directly at high temperature (450&#x00B0;C) and pressure (100&#x2009;atm) over a promoted Fe catalyst:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/equ417b.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The promoters (compounds that enhance the catalyst&#x2019;s activity) include SiO<sub>2</sub>, MgO, and other oxides (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.12">Section 25.12</a>). The high temperature and catalyst are required to overcome the kinetic inertness of N<sub>2</sub>, and the high pressure is needed to overcome the thermodynamic effect of an unfavourable equilibrium constant at the operating temperature.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">So novel and great were the chemical and engineering problems arising from the then (early twentieth century) uncharted area of large-scale, high-pressure technology, that two Nobel Prizes were awarded in connection with the process. One went to Fritz Haber (in 1918), who developed the chemical process. The other went to Carl Bosch (in 1931), the chemical engineer who designed the first plants to realize Haber&#x2019;s process. The process is also referred to as the <i>Haber&#x2013;Bosch process</i> in recognition of Bosch&#x2019;s contribution. It has had a major impact on civilization because ammonia is the primary source of most nitrogen-containing compounds, including fertilizers and most commercially important compounds of nitrogen. Before the development of the process the main sources of nitrogen for fertilizers were guano (bird droppings) and saltpetre, which had to be mined and transported from South America. In the early twentieth century there were predictions of widespread starvation across Europe, predictions that were never realized because of the widespread availability of nitrogen-based fertilizers.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The boiling point of ammonia is &#x2212;33&#x00B0;C, which is higher than that of the hydrides of the other elements in the group and indicates the influence of extensive hydrogen bonding. Liquid ammonia is a useful nonaqueous solvent for solutes such as alcohols, amines, ammonium salts, amides, and cyanides. Reactions in liquid ammonia closely resemble those in aqueous solution, as indicated by the following autoprotolysis equilibria:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Nitrogen trichloride, NCl<sub>3</sub>, is a highly endergonic, explosive, yellow oil. It is prepared commercially by the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and was once used as an oxidizing bleach for flour. The electronegativities of nitrogen and chlorine are similar and the N&#x0064;Cl bond is not very polar. Nitrogen tribromide, NBr<sub>3</sub>, is an explosive, deep red oil. Nitrogen triiodide, NI<sub>3</sub>, is an explosive solid. Nitrogen is more electronegative than both bromine and iodine, and so the N&#x0064;X bonds are polar in the sense <sup>&#x03B4;&#x2212;</sup>N&#x0064;X<sup>&#x03B4;&#x002B;</sup> and, formally, the oxidation numbers are &#x2212;3 for the N and &#x002B;1 for each halogen.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">The trihalides and pentahalides of Group 15 elements other than nitrogen are used extensively in synthetic chemistry, and their simple empirical formulas conceal an interesting and varied structural chemistry.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The trihalides range from gases and volatile liquids, such as PF<sub>3</sub> (b.p. &#x2212;102&#x00B0;C) and AsF<sub>3</sub> (b.p. 63&#x00B0;C), to solids, such as BiF<sub>3</sub> (m.p. 649&#x00B0;C). A common method of preparation is direct reaction of the element and halogen. For phosphorus, the trifluoride is prepared by metathesis of the trichloride and a fluoride:</p>

<img src="../images/pg419f.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">Phosphorus trifluoride, PF<sub>3</sub>, is an interesting ligand because in some respects it resembles CO. Like CO, it is a weak &#x03C3; donor but a strong &#x03C0; acceptor, and complexes of PF<sub>3</sub> exist that are the analogues of carbonyls, such as [Ni(PF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>], the analogue of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.18">Section 22.18</a>). The &#x03C0;-acceptor character is attributed to a P&#x0064;F antibonding LUMO, which has mainly P p-orbital <a id="page_420" class="page">page 420, The Group 15 elements</a>character. The trihalides also act as mild Lewis acids towards Lewis bases such as trialkylamines and halides. Many halide complexes have been isolated, such as the simple mononuclear species <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>AsCl</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>  (<b>16</b>) and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>SbF</mtext></mrow><mn>5</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>  (<b>17</b>). More complex dinuclear and polynuclear anions linked by halide bridges, such as the polymeric chain ([BiBr<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> in which Bi(I) is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of Br atoms, are also known.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:0em;width:70%;">

<p class="bh-indent">The pentahalides vary from gases, such as PF<sub>5</sub> (b.p. &#x2212;85&#x00B0;C) and AsF<sub>5</sub> (b.p. &#x2212;53&#x00B0;C), to solids, such as PCl<sub>5</sub> (sublimes at 162&#x00B0;C) and BiF<sub>5</sub> (m.p. 154&#x00B0;C). The five-coordinate gas-phase molecules are trigonal bipyramidal. In contrast to PF<sub>5</sub> and AsF<sub>5</sub>, SbF<sub>5</sub> is a highly viscous liquid in which the molecules are associated through F-atom bridges. In solid SbF<sub>5</sub> these bridges result in a cyclic tetramer (<b>18</b>), which reflects the tendency of Sb(V) to achieve a coordination number of 6. A related phenomenon occurs with PCl<sub>5</sub>, which in the solid state exists as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy='false'>[</mo><msubsup><mrow><mtext>PCl</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo stretchy='false'>]</mo><mo stretchy='false'>[</mo><msubsup><mrow><mtext>PCl</mtext></mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo stretchy='false'>]</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>  In this case, the ionic contribution to the lattice enthalpy provides the driving force for the transfer of a Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion from one PCl<sub>5</sub> molecule to another. Another contributing factor may be the more efficient packing of the PCl<sub>4</sub> and PCl<sub>6</sub> units compared to the less efficient stacking of PCl<sub>5</sub> units. The pentafluorides of P, As, Sb, and Bi are strong Lewis acids (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.6">Section 4.6</a>). SbF<sub>5</sub> is a very strong Lewis acid; it is much stronger, for example, than the aluminium halides. When SbF<sub>5</sub> or AsF<sub>5</sub> is added to anhydrous HF, a <i>superacid</i> is formed (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.14">Section 4.14</a>):</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:3em;">Of the pentachlorides, PCl<sub>5</sub> and SbCl<sub>5</sub> are stable, whereas AsCl<sub>5</sub> is very unstable. This difference is a manifestation of the alternation effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.2">Section 9.2</a>c). The instability of AsCl<sub>5</sub> is attributed to the increased effective nuclear charge arising from the poor shielding of the 3d electrons, which leads to a &#x2018;d-block contraction&#x2019; and a lowering of the energy of the 4s orbitals in As. Consequently, it is more difficult to promote a 4s electron to form AsCl<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">The redox properties of nitrogen are important because of its widespread occurrence in the atmosphere, the biosphere, industry, and the laboratory. Nitrogen chemistry is quite complex, partly because of the large number of accessible oxidation states but also because reactions that are thermodynamically favourable are often slow or have rates that depend crucially on the identity of the reactants. As the N<sub>2</sub> molecule is kinetically inert, redox reactions that consume N<sub>2</sub> are slow. Moreover, the formation of N<sub>2</sub> is often slow and may be sidestepped in aqueous solution (<a href="#fig_15.7">Fig. 15.7</a>). As with several other p-block elements, the barriers to reaction of high-oxidation-state oxoanions, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>  are greater than for low-oxidation-state oxoanions, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>  We should also remember that low pH enhances the oxidizing power of oxoanions (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.6">Section 5.6</a>). Low pH also often accelerates their oxidizing reactions by protonation, and this step may facilitate subsequent NO bond breaking.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Table <a href="#tab15.2">15.2</a> summarizes some of the properties of the nitrogen oxides, and <a href="#tab15.3">Table 15.3</a> does the same for the nitrogen oxoanions. Both tables will help us to navigate through the details of their properties.</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara">For centuries, meat has been preserved by the use of common salt, which dehydrates the meat, removing moisture essential for the growth of bacteria. One by-product of this process was that some meats took on a red appearance and distinctive taste. This was found to be due to traces of sodium nitrate in the salt, which is reduced to nitrite by bacterial action during the processing. Today sodium nitrite is used in curing of meats such as bacon, hams, and sausage.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The nitrite delays the onset of botulism, retards the development of rancidity, and preserves the flavours of spices. The nitrite is converted to nitric oxide which binds to myoglobin, the pigment responsible for the natural red colour of uncured meat. The myoglobin&#x2013;nitric oxide complex is deep red, which results in the bright pink hue typical of cured meats. A reaction of nitrite with myoglobin is also responsible for the green tinge which is sometimes seen in bacon. This is known as <i>nitrite burn</i> and occurs when the heam group in myoglobin is nitrated by the nitrite.</p></div>
<p class="bh-indent">Because NO is endergonic, it should be possible to find a catalyst to convert the pollutant NO to the natural atmospheric gases N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> at its source in exhausts.

<p class="bh-boxpara">Phosphorus in the form of phosphates is essential to life, and phosphate fertilizers in forms such as bone, fish, and guano have been used since ancient times. The phosphate industry started in the mid-nineteenth century when sulfuric acid was used to decompose bones and phosphate minerals to make the phosphate more readily available. The development of more economical routes led to the diversification of the industrial applications of phosphoric acid and phosphate salts.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">More than 90 per cent of world production of phosphoric acid is used to make fertilizers but there are several other applications. One of the most important is in the food industry. A dilute solution of phosphoric acid is nontoxic and has an acidic taste. It is used extensively in beverages to give a tart taste, as a buffering agent in jams and jellies, and as a purifying agent in sugar refining.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The phosphates and hydrogenphosphates have many applications in the food industry Sodium dihydrogenphosphate, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, is added to animal feeds as a dietary supplement. The disodium salt, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, is used as an emulsifier for processing cheese. It interacts with the protein casein and prevents separation of the fat and water. The potassium salts are more soluble and more expensive than the sodium salts. The dipotassium salt, K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, is used as an anticoagulant in coffee creamer. It interacts with the protein and prevents coagulation by the coffee acids. Calcium dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate, Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x22C5;H<sub>2</sub>O, is used as a raising agent in bread, cake mixes, and self-raising flour. Together with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> it produces CO<sub>2</sub> during the baking process but it also reacts with the protein in the flour to control the elasticity and viscosity of the dough or mixture. The largest use of calcium monohydrogenphosphate, CaHPO<sub>4</sub>&#x22C5;2H<sub>2</sub>O, is as a dental polish in nonfluoride toothpaste. Calcium diphosphate, Ca<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, is used in fluoride toothpaste.

<p class="bh-boxpara">The most widely used polyphosphate is sodium tripolyphosphate, Na<sub>5</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>. Its major use is as a &#x2018;builder&#x2019; for synthetic detergents used in domestic laundry products, car shampoos, and industrial cleaners. Its role in these applications is to form stable complexes with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water, effectively making them unavailable for precipitation, the process called &#x2018;sequestration&#x2019;. It also acts as a buffer and prevents the flocculation of dirt and the redeposition of soil particles.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Food-grade sodium tripolyphosphate is used in the curing of hams and bacon. It interacts with the proteins and leads to good moisture retention during curing. It is also used to improve the quality of processed chicken and seafood products. The technical-grade product is used as a water softener, by sequestration as above, and in the paper pulping and textile industries, where it is used to help break down cellulose.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Potassium tripolyphosphate is more soluble and more expensive than the sodium analogue and is used in liquid detergents. For some applications an effective trade-off between solubility and cost can be achieved by using sodium potassium tripolyphosphate, Na<sub>3</sub>K<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The use of polyphosphates in detergents has been implicated in excessive algae growth and eutrophication of some natural waters. This has led to restrictions in their use in many countries and the reduction in their use in home laundry products. However, phosphate is still widely used as an essential fertilizer and more of it enters rivers and lakes by run-off from farm land than from detergents.</p></div></section>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara">Biodegradable polymers are attractive biomedical materials because they survive for only a limited time <i>in vivo</i>. Polyphosphazenes are proving to be very useful in this respect as they degrade to harmless by-products and their physical properties can be tuned by altering the substituents on the P atoms. They are used as bio-inert housing materials for implantation of devices, as structural materials for construction of heart valves and blood vessels, and as biodegradable supports for <i>in vivo</i> bone regeneration. The best polyphosphazenes for this last application form fibres in which the P&#x2013;N backbone consists of alkyoxy groups that form bonds to Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions. The polymer fibre becomes populated with the patient&#x2019;s osteoblasts (bone-making cells). The polymer degrades as the osteoblasts multiply and fill the space between the fibres. Polyphosphazenes have been designed that hydrolyse at a specific rate and maintain their strength as the erosion process proceeds.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Polyphosphazenes are also used as drug-delivery systems. The bioactive molecule is trapped within the structure of the polymer or incorporated into the P&#x2013;N backbone and the drug is released when the polymer degrades. The rate of degradation can be controlled by altering the structure of the polymer backbone, thus giving control over the rate of drug delivery. Drugs that can be delivered in this way include cisplatin, dopamine, and steroids:</p>

Consequently, the stability of the compounds decreases in the same order. In addition, the aryl compounds, such as (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>As, are generally more stable than the alkyl compounds. The halogen-substituted compounds R<sub><i>n</i></sub>MX<sub>3&#x2212;<i>n</i></sub> have been prepared and characterized.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">All the compounds act as Lewis bases and form complexes with d metals. The basicity decreases in the order As&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;Sb&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;Bi. Many complexes of alkyl- and arylarsanes have been prepared but fewer stibane complexes are known. A useful ligand, for example, is the bidentate compound known as diars (<b>32</b>). Because of their soft-donor character, many aryl- and alkylarsane complexes of the soft species Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), and Pt(II) have been prepared. However, hardness criteria are only approximate, so we should not be surprised to see phosphine and arsane complexes of some metals in higher oxidation states. For example, the unusual &#x002B;4 oxidation state of palladium is stabilized by the diars ligand (<b>33</b>).</p>

<p class="bh-indent">Polyarsanes of up to six units have been characterized. Polymethylarsane exists as a yellow, puckered cyclic pentamer (<b>34</b>) and as a purple-black ladder-like structure (<b>35</b>). The strength of the M&#x003D;M bond decreases in the order As&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;Sb&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;Bi, so whereas arsenic forms catenated organometallic compounds, only R<sub>2</sub>Bi&#x2013;BiR<sub>2</sub> has been isolated.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="bh-pink"><b>15.1</b></span> Nitrous oxide has been discovered to play a crucial role in biological systems. A paper published by A.W. Carpenter and M.H. Schoenfisch (<i>Chem. Soc. Rev</i>., 2012, <b>41</b>, 3742) discusses therapeutic applications of NO. Outline the main applications and drawbacks of gaseous NO as a therapeutic agent. Discuss how NO-donor molecules have been developed to enable NO therapies for a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="bh-pink"><b>15.2</b></span> Describe sewage treatment methods that result in a decrease in phosphate levels in wastewater. Outline a laboratory method that could be used to monitor phosphate levels in water.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="bh-pink"><b>15.3</b></span> A compound containing five-coordinate nitrogen has been characterized (A. Frohmann, J. Riede, and H. Schmidbaur, <i>Nature</i>, 1990, <b>345</b>, 140). Describe (a) the synthesis, (b) the structure of the compound, (c) the bonding.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="bh-pink"><b>15.4</b></span> Two articles (A. Lykknes and L. Kvittingen, Arsenic: not so evil after all?, <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 2003, <b>80</b>, 497; J. Wang and C.M. Chien, Arsenic in drinking water: a global environmental problem, <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 2004, <b>81</b>, 207) present opposing perspectives on the toxic nature of arsenic. Use these references to produce a critical assessment of the beneficial and detrimental effects of arsenic.</p>
