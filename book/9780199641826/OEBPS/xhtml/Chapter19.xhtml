<p class="bh-noindentd" style="margin-top:2em;"><b>The d-block elements are all metallic and their chemical properties are central to biology, industry, and many aspects of contemporary research. We have already seen many systematic trends across the block and observed trends in the chemical properties within each group. We now look at the properties of the individual metals and their compounds in more detail.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">The two terms <b>d-block metal</b> and <b>transition metal</b> are often used interchangeably; however, they do not mean the same thing. The name &#x2018;transition metal&#x2019; originally derived from the fact that their chemical properties were transitional between those of the s and p blocks. Now, however, the IUPAC definition of a <b>transition element</b> is an element that has an incomplete d subshell in either the neutral atom or its ions. Thus, two of the Group 12 elements (Zn, Cd) are members of the d block but are not transition elements as they do not have any compounds with an incomplete d subshell. The situation for the third Group 12 element, mercury, is different: the report of a mercury(IV) compound (HgF<sub>4</sub>), which has the d<sup>8</sup> electron configuration, qualifies mercury as a transition metal. In the following discussion, it will be convenient to refer to each row of the d block as a series, with the 3d series the first row of the block (Period 4), the 4d series the second row (Period 5), and so on. It will prove important to note the intrusion of the f block, the <b>inner transition elements</b>, the lanthanoids, before the 5d series. Elements towards the left of the d block are often referred to as <i>early</i> and those towards the right are referred to as <i>late</i>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The chemical properties of the d-block elements (or d metals, as we shall commonly call them) will be covered in this and the next three chapters. It is appropriate to begin with a survey of their occurrence and properties. The trends in their properties, the correlation with their electronic structures, and therefore their location in the periodic table, should be kept in mind throughout these chapters.<a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> dealt with many of the trends that occur in the d block, and we concentrate on specific properties of the individual elements and some of their important compounds here.</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">The elements on the left of the 3d series occur in nature primarily as metal oxides or as metal cations in combination with oxoanions (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#tab19.1">Table 19.1</a>). Of these elements, titanium ores are the most difficult to reduce, and the element is normally produced by heating TiO<sub>2</sub> with chlorine and carbon to produce TiCl<sub>4</sub>, which is then reduced by molten magnesium at about 1000&#x00B0;C in an inert-gas atmosphere. The oxides of Cr, Mn, and Fe are reduced with carbon (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.16">Section 5.16</a>), a much cheaper reagent. To the right of Fe in the 3d series, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn occur mainly as sulfides and arsenides, which is consistent with the increasingly soft Lewis acid character of their dipositive ions. Sulfide ores are usually roasted in air either to the metal directly (for example, Ni), or to an oxide that is subsequently reduced (for example, Zn). Copper is used in large quantities for electrical applications; electrolysis is used to refine crude copper to achieve the high purity needed for high electrical conductivity.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">In the second and third row of the transition metals the switch from oxophile to thiophile in ores happens earlier, with only Group 3 and 4 metals occurring predominantly in the Earth&#x2019;s crust in oxo compounds. The difficulty of reducing the early 4d and 5d metals Mo and W is apparent from <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#tab19.1">Table 19.1</a>, and reflects the tendency of these elements to have stable high oxidation states, as discussed earlier (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>). The platinum metals (Ru and Os, Rh and Ir, and Pd and Pt), which are found at the lower right of the d block, occur as sulfide and arsenide ores, usually in association with larger quantities of Cu, Ni, and Co. They are collected from the sludge that forms during the electrolytic refinement of copper and nickel. Gold (and to some extent silver) is found in its elemental form.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml#tab19.2">Table 19.2</a> lists the electronegativities and atomic radii of all the d metals. We can see that the 3d metals are significantly smaller than their 4d and 5d congeners; the similarity in size of the 4d and 5d metals is a manifestation of the lanthanoid contraction (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.3">Sections 9.3</a> and <a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.4">23.4</a>). Coordination numbers are typically greater for the larger 4d and 5d metals, with less common geometries, such as square antiprism, being found. Electronegativities generally <a id="page_490" class="page">Page 490, The d-block elements</a>increase across the d block, resulting in the increasing soft Lewis acid behaviour noted above. <a href="#ch19tab3">Table 19.3</a> shows both the common, and maximum, oxidation states of nonorganometallic complexes of the d metals, and we can easily see the trends of increasing stability of high oxidation states down a group (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>) and the maximum state peaking in the middle of the series (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>). The chemistries of the d metals also reflect their hard/soft nature. The harder first-row transition metals and the early 4d and 5d elements have an extensive chemistry in combination with oxygen, giving simple and complex oxides which form many functional solid-state materials such as heterogeneous catalysts and</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">electronic and optical materials. The later elements have more extensive chemistries with soft ligands such as sulfide.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">We can contrast the chemical properties of the d metals with those of the s (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="Chapter12.xhtml">12</a>) and p blocks (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml">Chapters 13</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter16.xhtml">16</a>), but the differences all ultimately come down to the presence of d electrons. <a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> deals in detail with the electronic structure of d-metal complexes, but we need to note here that, in complexes, the metals have nondegenerate d orbitals. Electronic transitions are possible between the orbitals, with the energy required corresponding to visible light, resulting in coloured complexes for those with configurations d<sup>1</sup>&#x2013;d<sup>9</sup>. Unpaired electrons in these d orbitals are responsible for electrical conductivity of some compounds and also magnetism; there are configurations where the number of unpaired electron varies. High- and low-spin complexes are possible, though with the increased size of the second- and third-row d metals we see a preponderance for low-spin complexes of these metals.<a href="Chapter22.xhtml">chapter 22</a> deals in detail with the organometallic chemistry of the d metals, but we should note that it is the availability of d orbitals that allows species such as alkenes, arenes, and carbonyls to bind to the metals. The organometallic chemistry of the d metals is thus substantially richer than of any of the other metals.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The physical properties of the elemental d metals are, once again, intimately related to the presence and number of d electrons. Metallic bonding becomes stronger across the rows, peaking in the middle (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.4">Section 9.4</a>), with a concomitant increase in melting point, density, and enthalpy of atomization. The use of the metals throughout history relates to a rather random set of physical properties: availability of ores (or even the natural metal), ease of reducing the ores, and ease of working the metal. Thus gold, which occurs as the natural metal and is easily malleable, has been used for many thousands of years; its lack of any real strength restricted its uses to decorative ones and as currency. Copper, readily available and easily reduced, has been used for at least 5000 years: the metal itself is strong enough to be used structurally. However, it was the discovery that mixing copper with tin (roughly 2:1) gives the much stronger bronze that allowed the manufacture of the first metallic tools (and weapons). The development of bronze allowed cultures to progress beyond the Stone Age and closer to civilization as we know it today. The subsequent development of the much stronger iron (or more precisely, steel) only became possible with more advanced smelting techniques. The harnessing of the strength of iron allowed substantial advances in structural uses of metal and tool making to be developed, giving rise to modern civilization. As a metal, iron still reigns supreme in its use and versatility with, as we note later, more than 90 per cent of all metal refining currently being iron. The development of specialist alloys (e.g. lightweight materials used in the aerospace industry) and composites is a twentieth-century phenomenon, and further technological advances dependent on metals have mostly been incremental rather than step changes. Nowadays, probably every metal in the d block has at least a small-scale specialist use, whether that be in performance alloys, electronics, or as a component in high-temperature superconductors.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Biology has exploited many of the d-block elements as the active sites of enzymes catalysing a wide range of reactions.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>The Group 3 metals are all found in lanthanoid ores and are used in small amounts in specialist alloys and in host materials for optical applications.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Scandium is a silvery-white metal with chemical properties very like those of the lanthanoids. It is present at low levels in many lanthanoid ores and is extracted in small quantities from these. Commercial uses of scandium are largely restricted&#x2014;in part because of the expense of extraction&#x2014;to alloying it, at low levels, with aluminium in aerospace industry components; current production is of the order of 2 tonnes a year. A small amount of scandium iodide is used in some high-intensity mercury vapour discharge lamps as it produces an output similar to sunlight. Scandium has no known biological role, and is considered nontoxic. Yttrium is also found in most lanthanoid ores and is separated from them, as are all lanthanoids (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.2">Section 23.2</a>). Annual production is of the order of 600 tonnes a year, as yttrium compounds have many uses. Common uses include as host compounds which can be doped with lanthanoid ions for optical applications. Doped complex oxides such as Eu:YVO<sub>4</sub> are used as phosphors in display devices and fluorescent and LED lighting (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.5">Section 23.5</a>), yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG, <a id="page_492" class="page">Page 492 The d-block elements</a>Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) is used as a component of many lasers, and yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is used in high-temperature superconductors (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). Yttrium has no identified biological role, but it does concentrate in the liver and bone, and soluble salts are regarded as mildly toxic. Lanthanum is present in most lanthanoid ores, with monazite (Ce, La, Th, Nd, Y)PO<sub>4</sub>, and bastn&#x00E4;site (Ce, La, Y)CO<sub>3</sub>F, providing the main commercial sources. Uses of lanthanum have changed with time: initial use as a component of gas mantles (where it was present at &#x223C;20 per cent as La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) has largely been superseded by use in scintillation counters. The metal itself is used as a component of <i>mischmetal</i> (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.2">Section 23.2</a>) and a component in the anode of nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries. Lanthanum has no known biological role, but lanthanum carbonate can be given to people suffering from chronic kidney dysfunction to help prevent phosphate levels in the blood getting too high; LaPO<sub>4</sub> is extremely insoluble, with a solubility product constant of 3.7 &#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;23</sup>.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum are all electropositive metals with compounds almost exclusively in the &#x002B;3 oxidation state. Chemically, scandium resembles aluminium and indium more than the other d metals. Oxides are white solids of the form M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute acid. Halides, MX<sub>3</sub>, can all be considered ionic, though some of the iodides are prone to hydrolysis, precipitating MO(OH). A number of subhalides exist, such as Sc<sub>7</sub>Cl<sub>10</sub> and Sc<sub>7</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, which contain multiple metal&#x2013;metal bonds within chains (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.1">Fig.19.1</a>).

<p class="bh-noindent">The ionic radius of Y<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, at 102&#x2009;pm in eight-fold coordination, is similar to that of many the trivalent lanthanoid cations, Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.3">Section 23.3</a>). Unlike the lanthanoids, Y<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> has no unpaired f electrons and this means that complex yttrium oxides and halides are excellent host materials for doping with low levels (a few per cent) of many of the Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cations. These lanthanoid-doped yttrium compounds have important applications in optical devices, and their properties rely on the presence of the f electrons of the Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> being widely separated in a host material with no other unpaired electrons.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">One such class of compounds are the lanthanoid-doped yttrium aluminium garnets used in high-intensity lasers. Yttrium aluminium garnet, YAG Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, has the structure shown in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.2">Fig. 19.2</a>, in which the yttrium site has cubic, eight-fold coordination to oxide ions. Replacement of 1 per cent of yttrium by neodymium in the structure, normally given the terminology Nd:YAG, produces a material which, when exposed to high-intensity light from a flashlamp, produces an intense laser emission at 1064&#x2009;nm. Doping with other lanthanoids yields laser emission at different wavelengths: Er:YAG produces an emission at 2940&#x2009;nm, of use in dentistry and medical applications. The complex yttrium fluoride, LiYF<sub>4</sub>, is also used as a lanthanoid ion host for laser applications; in LiYF<sub>4</sub>, yttrium adopts a distorted cubic coordination with four fluoride ions at 222&#x2009;pm and four at 230&#x2009;pm.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Complex yttrium oxides are also used as lanthanoid-ion hosts for phosphor applications where UV light is converted to visible wavelengths. Erbium-doped YVO<sub>4</sub>, with the zircon structure of ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, produces a red light used in displays and fluorescent lighting. Yttrium iron garnet, YIG Y<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, with the same structure as YAG but with Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> replacing Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, is a ferrimagnetic material with a Curie temperature of 500&#x2009;K, and is used in a number of magneto-optic applications. Varying the magnetic field applied to a sample of YIG changes the frequency of microwaves that can pass through it and is of importance in mobile-phone technology.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Doping ZrO<sub>2</sub> with small levels of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> introduces vacancies in the oxide sublattice, producing a material with the fluorite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>) known as yttria-stabilized zirconia.

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The organometallic chemistry of the Group 3 metals is essentially identical to that of the lanthanoids, and is described in <a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.9">Section 23.9</a>: in the &#x002B;3 oxidation state the lack of any d electrons that can backbond to organic fragments restricts the number of bonding modes that are available. The strongly electropositive nature of scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum means that they need good donor, not acceptor, ligands. Thus alkoxide, amide, and halide ligands, which are both &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; donors, are common, whereas CO and phosphine ligands, which are &#x03C3; donors and &#x03C0; acceptors, are rarely seen.

<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.4a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Titanium is widely dispersed and though it is expensive to purify has many applications; zirconium and hafnium both find uses in nuclear power plants.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Titanium is the second most abundant d metal, after iron, in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. The principal ores are rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) and ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>), both of which are widely distributed. Titanium has many desirable properties: it is as strong as steel but only half as dense, it is corrosion-resistant and high-melting. It has many uses in applications where weight is at a premium, such as in the aerospace industry. In spite of the favourable properties of titanium, it is rather costly to extract and refine. The most widely used process, the Kroll process, involves heating crude TiO<sub>2</sub> ores with chlorine gas in the presence of carbon to give TiCl<sub>4</sub>. Fractional distillation of the TiCl<sub>4</sub> gives a pure liquid which can then be reduced with molten magnesium under an argon atmosphere. Titanium dioxide is widely used a white pigment, in paint, sunscreen, and even as a food colourant. Titanium has no known biological role, and is considered nontoxic; the metal itself is used following surgery for pinning bones, hip and knee replacements, cranial plates, and teeth.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Zirconium is principally found as the silicate mineral zircon (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>), with 80 per cent of zircon mining occurring in Australia and South Africa. Most zircon is used directly for decorative ceramics, where doping with V<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>, Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, and Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> gives rise to blue, yellow, and orange compounds used as glazes. Small amounts of zircon are converted to the metal via the Kroll process. Zirconium is highly transparent to neutrons and is used as a cladding material for fuel rods in nuclear power plants. Zirconium currently has no known biological or medicinal role. Zircon (and zirconium) contain a few per cent hafnium, and this is the main source of hafnium, which is obtained via liquid&#x2013;liquid extraction from solution. Hafnium&#x2019;s major use is in incandescent light bulbs (where it helps protect the tungsten filament) and as a highly effective neutron absorber in control rods in nuclear power plants. Hafnium has no known biological role, and is considered nontoxic.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are all electropositive and are normally found in the &#x002B;4 oxidation state. The MO<sub>2</sub> compounds are high-melting solids, and the MF<sub>4</sub> compounds and ZrCl<sub>4</sub> are solids at room temperature that exhibit complex structures with halides bridging the M ions. By contrast, the MX<sub>4</sub> (X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;Cl, Br, I) compounds, with the exception of ZrCl<sub>4</sub>, are volatile covalent liquids or low-melting solids which have tetrahedral geometries. These MX<sub>4</sub> (X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;Cl, Br, I) compounds are strong Lewis acids and are rapidly hydrolysed by water. Lower-oxidation-state compounds (e.g. MCl<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and MO) can be prepared by careful reduction of the normal halide or oxide. Zirconium forms a monohalide when zirconium tetrachloride is reduced with zirconium metal in a sealed tube at high temperatures:</p>

In the perovskite stoichiometry, ABO<sub>3</sub>, the Group 4 cations adopt the B-cation sites with an idealized six-fold octahedral coordination. In BaTiO<sub>3</sub> the perovskite structure is distorted from the normal cubic arrangement to a tetragonal phase where the environment around the Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ion has one short (Ti&#x2013;O, 199.8&#x2009;pm) and one long (Ti&#x2013;O, 211&#x2009;pm) distance. An asymmetry of this type in the coordination geometries of early d-block elements in high oxidation states is a common feature of their structural chemistries and leads to BaTiO<sub>3</sub> having a very high dielectric constant, around 2000 times that of air, and thus its use in charge-storage capacitors. Lead zirconate titanate, PZT, (Pb(Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>)O<sub>3</sub> with 0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1, shows a strong piezoelectric effect and is used in transducers for converting sound into a voltage or vice versa.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">ZrO<sub>2</sub> adopts a distorted form of the fluorite structure, but doping Zr<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> with a few per cent of Y<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> leads to a material known as yttria-stabilized zirconia, YSZ, with the ideal cubic fluorite structure. This material, Zr<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Y<sub><i>x</i></sub>O<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i>/2</sub>, contains vacancies in the oxide sublattice which, above 750&#x00B0;C, allows oxide ions to diffuse rapidly through the structure. This oxide ion mobility leads to application as oxygen gas sensors used in automotive vehicles and in fuel cells.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The zirconium silicate (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>) structure (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.4">Fig. 19.4</a>) contains Zr<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ions in eight-fold coordination to oxygen.

<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.5a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>Vanadium occurs widely and is used to harden steels; niobium and tantalum are much less prevalent and have only specialist uses.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Vanadium occurs naturally in more than 60 different minerals and in fossil-fuel deposits. In some countries it is produced from the slag that results from steel smelting, in others it is produced from the flue dust that forms from the burning of heavy oils, or as a by-product of uranium mining. It is mainly used to harden steel and to produce alloys such as those used in high-speed tools. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid. Vanadium is the only element in Group 5 with an established biological role, and is essential to many species, including humans, where its role is thought to be a regulator of some enzymes that govern the concentrations of sodium ions. A vanadium centre is the site of catalysis in enzymes, known as haloperoxidases, that are responsible for the production of halogenated natural products by marine algae; it is also found <a id="page_495" class="page">Page 495 The d-block elements</a>in place of molybdenum in an alternative class of nitrogenase, the microbial enzyme responsible for ammonia biosynthesis.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Niobium and tantalum have very similar chemical and physical properties and are difficult to distinguish and separate. A new element, named columbium, was reported in 1801 and eight years later it was erroneously concluded that it was identical to tantalum. In 1846 another &#x2018;new&#x2019; element, named niobium, was discovered; experimentation in 1865 proved that niobium and columbium were the same element (and not tantalum). Niobium has only been the official name for element 41 since 1949, columbium and niobium being used interchangeably up to then. Niobium and tantalum are both extracted from the ores tantalite and columbite, with Brazil supplying 75 per cent of the world&#x2019;s usage. Separation of niobium from tantalum relies on the difference in solubilities of their complex fluorides in water. Niobium has no known biological role, though it is considered toxic.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Niobium is mostly used at low levels in specialist steel alloys, where it imparts increased hardness and strength. Other alloys, where it is present at much higher levels, are superconducting at liquid helium temperature (4.2&#x2009;K) (the pure metal is also superconducting); these alloys, such as niobium&#x2013;tin (Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn), are widely used in the superconducting magnets of NMR spectrometers and MRI scanners. Tantalum also finds use at a low level in steel, enhancing the hardness and corrosion resistance of the metal. Tantalum has no known biological role, and is considered nontoxic, with tantalum plates, bolts, and wires used in surgery.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">A <b>polyoxometallate</b> is an oxoanion containing more than one metal atom. The H<sub>2</sub>O ligand created by protonation of an oxido ligand at low pH can be eliminated from the central metal atom and thus lead to the condensation of mononuclear oxometallates. A familiar example is the reaction of a basic chromate solution, which is yellow, with excess acid to form the oxido-bridged dichromate ion, which is orange:</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">In highly acidic solution, oxido-bridged Cr(VI) species with longer chains are formed. The tendency for Cr(VI) to form polyoxo species is limited by the fact that the O tetrahedra link only through vertices: edge and face bridging would result in too close an approach of the metal atoms. By contrast, it is found that five- and six-coordinate metal oxido complexes, which are common with the larger 4d- and 5d-series metal atoms, can share oxido ligands between either vertices or edges. These structural possibilities lead to a richer variety of polyoxometallates than are found with the 3d-series metals.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Chromium&#x2019;s neighbours in Groups 5 and 6 form six-coordinate polyoxo complexes (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_B19.1">Fig. B19.1</a>). In Group 5, the polyoxometallates are most numerous for vanadium, which forms many V(V) complexes and a few V(IV) or mixed oxidation state V(IV)&#x2013;V(V) polyoxido complexes. Polyoxometallate formation is most pronounced in Groups 5 and 6 for V(V), Mo(VI), and W(VI).</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">It is often convenient to represent the structures of the polyoxometallate ions by polyhedra, with the metal atom understood to be in the centre and O atoms at the vertices. For example, the sharing of O atom <a id="page_496" class="page">Page 496 The d-block elements</a>vertices in the dichromate ion, [Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, may be depicted in either the traditional way (<b>B1</b>) or in the polyhedral representation (<b>B2</b>).

The structures for this series of polyoxometallates contain terminal O atoms (those projecting out from a single metal atom) and two types of bridging O atoms: two-metal bridges, M&#x2013;O&#x2013;M, and one hypercoordinated O atom in the centre of the structure that is common to all six metal atoms. The structure consists of six MO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, each sharing an edge with four neighbours. The overall symmetry of the M<sub>6</sub>O<sub>19</sub> array is <i>O</i><sub>h</sub>. Another example of a polyoxometallate is [W<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>10&#x2212;</sup> (<b>B3</b>). As shown by this formula, the polyoxoanion is partially protonated.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The organometallic chemistry of the Group 5 metals is generally underdeveloped, due in large part to the paramagnetic nature of most complexes, which makes characterization by NMR very difficult; the chemistry is challenging, but frequently surprising and rewarding. The binary carbonyls [M(CO)<sub>6</sub>] are 17-electron species and have only been isolated for vanadium. The 18-electron [M(CO)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anions are, however, known for all the Group 5 metals: they are the product of reductive carbonylation of metal salts (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.18">Section 22.18</a>). Indeed the synthesis of the neutral [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>] can only be achieved from the [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anion.

<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.6a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>All three of the Group 6 metals are widely used in steels, imparting hardness and corrosion resistance; all three metals have biological roles.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Chromium is widely dispersed throughout the Earth&#x2019;s crust, mainly occurring as oxide minerals such as chromite, FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, though occasionally it is found as the metal. Currently South Africa produces 40 per cent of the world&#x2019;s supply via chromite reduction. Chromium is hard and extremely resistant to corrosion, and these properties account for its major use: as a component of steels, especially stainless ones, where it is present at between 10 and 40 per cent. Chromium (&#x2018;chrome&#x2019;) plating is also used to protect steels and to give a shiny surface. Reduction of chromite ores via electric arc melting produces ferrochrome, which is used directly in steel production. If pure chromium is required, chromite is roasted in air and then soluble chromium(VI) salts are separated from insoluble Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; subsequent reduction is achieved with carbon and aluminium. A number of chromium salts are used as dyes, pigments, and preservatives; chromium compounds such as supported CrO<sub>3</sub> (which reduces <i>in situ</i>) or chromocene are used as alkene polymerization catalysts. Chromium is essential to humans, where it is normally utilized in the &#x002B;3 oxidation state: it is involved in the regulation of glucose levels and is often taken as a dietary supplement, although the mechanism of its action is unclear; in excess, or in the &#x002B;6 state, chromium is toxic and carcinogenic.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Molybdenum and tungsten are both extremely hard metals and are widely used as components of steels. The use in steels accounts for more than 80 per cent of molybdenum&#x2019;s production, with some steels containing up to 10 per cent molybdenum. Molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>) is the principal ore from which the metal is extracted, with the initial step being a roasting in air to give an oxide; the oxide is then reduced with iron for use in steels, or with hydrogen for other uses. Molybdenum is essential to all species, with at least 20 enzymes known in plants and animals: its main role is as the active site of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of oxygen atoms, thus exploiting the properties of its higher oxidation states. Molybdenum is also found in the active site (the FeMo cofactor) of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for producing ammonia from N<sub>2</sub> in the root nodules of legumes.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal and for this reason found use as the filaments of incandescent lightbulbs. Along with its use in steels, tungsten is extensively used in the form of tungsten carbide, an extremely hard material used to tip drill bits and saw blades. Tungsten is extracted from ores such as wolframite ((Fe,Mn)WO<sub>4</sub>) or scheelite (CaWO<sub>4</sub>) by roasting ores to give oxides that are reduced by carbon or hydrogen; China currently produces more than three-quarters of the world&#x2019;s supply. Tungsten is the only third-row d metal to have a biological role: in some microbes it is found at the active site of enzymes that catalyse reactions requiring more demanding reducing conditions than their molybdenum counterparts; the tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase catalyses the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to formic acid.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.6b">(b) Binary compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Chromium forms highly oxidizing compounds in the &#x002B;6 oxidation state, whereas the equivalent compounds of molybdenum and tungsten are not appreciably oxidizing.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">All three of the Group 6 metals form a trioxide, MO<sub>3</sub>. Whereas CrO<sub>3</sub> (and its aqueous counterparts [CrO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> and [Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) is strongly oxidizing, MoO<sub>3</sub> and WO<sub>3</sub> are not rapidly oxidizing. This behaviour is partly a reflection of this increased stability of high oxidation states of the second- and third-row metals, compared with first-row metals, and partly a result of the structures of the trioxides. CrO<sub>3</sub> consists of chains of vertex-sharing tetrahedra, while the structures of MoO<sub>3</sub> and WO<sub>3</sub> consist of linked MO<sub>6</sub> octahedra; WO<sub>3</sub> adopts a distorted form of the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Solid WO<sub>3</sub> undergoes reductive insertion reactions where small cations such as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or a proton become inserted into the structure during reduction of W(VI) to W(V):</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-6em;width:70%;">

</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">Lower oxides of Mo and W such as MO<sub>2</sub> can be synthesized by careful reduction of MO<sub>3</sub> with hydrogen, whereas chromium trioxide gives the stable &#x002B;3 oxidation state (either as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) with mild reducing agents. CrO<sub>2</sub> may be prepared as long rod-shaped crystals by the reduction of CrO<sub>3</sub> in water at high temperature and pressure; it adopts the rutile structure type. CrO<sub>2</sub> exhibits excellent ferromagnetic properties, which led to its widespread use in high-quality (low-noise) audio and video tapes in the 1970s and 1980s. It is still used in some data-storage applications. Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a widely used green pigment, originally called viridian, because of its inertness and stability in sunlight. Chromium also forms a reducing black oxide, CrO.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Sulfides Cr<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and MS<sub>2</sub> (M&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;Mo and W) are known, with the MS<sub>2</sub> compound adopting layered structures (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.6">Fig. 19.6</a>) which are responsible for their use as solid-state lubricants.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Hexahalides, MX<sub>6</sub>, are known for all metals with X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;F, but only Mo and W form hexachlorides and bromides; all the hexahalides are volatile liquids, rapidly and violently hydrolysed by water. Lower ionic halides such as CrX<sub>3</sub> are easily prepared, and the strongly reducing CrX<sub>2</sub> salts are made by careful reaction of Cr with HX. Molybdenum and tungsten also form solid MX<sub>3</sub> salts with all the halogens except fluorine, but these are frequently layered structures, or clusters, as in W<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>18</sub> (<b>10</b>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Tungsten and molybdenum form electrically conducting complex oxides with other metals; these oxides are known as bronzes.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Tungsten and molybdenum bronzes, first discovered in 1824 by W&#x00F6;hler, are well-defined nonstoichiometric compounds of general formula M<sub><i>x</i></sub>WO<sub>3</sub> or M<sub><i>x</i></sub>MoO<sub>3</sub> where M is most commonly an alkali metal and 0&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;<i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;l.

<p class="bh-indent">These chemically inert tungsten and molybdenum bronzes show several characteristic properties which derive from their electronic structure. While WO<sub>3</sub> and MoO<sub>3</sub> are insulators, with d<sup>0</sup> electronic configurations, the presence of variable amounts of alkali metal in the bronzes reduces the transition metal and introduces electrons into a conduction band (partially filling it with <i>x</i> electrons). This gives rise to metallic properties including high electrical conductivity and, in crystalline form, lustre, leading to the generic name &#x2018;bronze&#x2019;.

<p class="bh-boxparai">Five d electrons would be needed from each metal for a quintuple bond, and this is exactly the case for the d<sup>5</sup> Cr(I) centres in (<b>18</b>). In this molecule, the two Cr atoms are separated by a very short distance of 183.5&#x2009;pm, unsupported by any additional bridging ligand interactions; compare this distance with the separation of Cr atoms in the bulk metal, which is 258&#x2009;pm. The Re compound (<b>B8</b>) also lacks bridging ligand interactions, but here the two d<sup>4</sup> Re(III) centres can form only a quadruple Re&#x2013;Re bond. The four d electrons from each Re atom in (<b>B8</b>) result in the configuration &#x03C3;<sup>2</sup>&#x03C0;<sup>4</sup>&#x03B4;<sup>2</sup>, and it is believed that the d<sub><i>x</i></sub><sub>2&#x2013;<i>y</i>2</sub> orbital is involved in bonding to the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ligands. Evidence for quadruple bonding comes from the observation that [Re<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> has an eclipsed array of Cl ligands, which is sterically unfavourable. It is argued that the &#x03B4; bond, which is formed only when the d<sub><i>xy</i></sub> orbitals are confacial, locks the complex in the eclipsed conformation.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">As shown in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#tabB19.1">Table B19.1</a>, incomplete occupation of the bonding orbitals can result in a reduction of the formal bond order to 3.5 or to the triply bonded M&#x2261;M systems. These complexes are more numerous than the quadruply bonded complexes and, because &#x03B4; bonds are weak, M&#x2261;M bond lengths are often similar to those of quadruply bonded systems. A decrease of bond order can also stem from the occupation of both the &#x03B4;&#x002A; orbitals and, once these are fully occupied, successive occupation of the two higher-lying &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals leads to further decrease in the bond order from 2.5 to 1.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">As with carbon&#x2013;carbon multiple bonds, metal&#x2013;metal multiple bonds are centres of reaction.

<h3 class="bh-h3"><span class="bh-nor">19.7</span>&#160;<b>Group 7: manganese, technetium, and rhenium</b></h3>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.7a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Manganese is widely dispersed on Earth and its compounds have many uses; though technetium has no stable isotopes, it has a number of uses. Rhenium is very rare.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Manganese is distributed widely across the planet, though about 80 per cent of the known reserves are found in South Africa as pyrolusite (MnO<sub>2</sub>). It is estimated that about 500 billion tonnes of manganese nodules exist on the ocean floor, and economically viable routes to extracting these are being developed. Manganese metal itself is rather brittle, but it is used in steel at levels between 1 and 13 per cent where it improves the strength of the metal; manganese is also used in aluminium alloys, such as those used in drinks cans, at a level of &#x223C;1 per cent to improve corrosion resistance. MnO<sub>2</sub> is a major component of alkaline batteries: MnO<sub>2</sub> is reduced to Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and zinc metal is oxidized to ZnO, producing a voltage of 1.5&#x2009;V. Other uses for manganese salts include pigments in ceramics and glasses. Manganese is a very important element in biology and is present as the active-site metal in numerous enzymes across all forms of life: by far its most notable role is as the active site of the enzyme uniquely responsible for photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution. Manganese(II) compounds are nontoxic, but manganese(VII) compounds are highly oxidizing and poisonous.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Technetium was the first unstable element to be synthesized: there are no stable isotopes and only minute quantities are found in nature. It is a fission by-product of uranium, and is extracted in bulk from spent nuclear fuel rods. Technetium is also formed when molybdenum is bombarded by neutrons, and this route was used to isolate the first samples in 1936. A metastable isotope, <sup>99&#x2009;m</sup>Tc, is used medically as a radioactive tracer&#x2014;it decays via &#x03B2; emission with a half-life of 6 hours, and compounds such as Cardiolyte<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>, which is used to image the heart, are in widespread use in hospitals (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.9">Section 27.9</a>). The two longest-lived isotopes, <sup>98</sup>Tc and <sup>97</sup>Tc, have half-lives of over 2 million years, and their detection in red giants proves that heavy-atom nucleosynthesis takes place in such stars. The chemistry of technetium <a id="page_503" class="page">Page 503 The d-block elements</a>has been retarded by its radioactivity, but what there is suggests a great similarity with that of Re.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Rhenium was the last stable nonradioactive element to be discovered, and was first found in gadolinite (a lanthanoid ore) at a level of only 10&#x2009;ppm in 1925. Rhenium is also found in molybdenum ores and is currently extracted from the flue dusts of molybdenum smelters; it is one of the rarest metals in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. Rhenium is used in high-temperature alloys for jet engines and, together with platinum, as a catalyst to reform alkanes. Rhenium has no known biological role, and is considered nontoxic.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.7b">(b) Binary compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Manganese forms stable compounds in a large number of oxidation states; by contrast, the chemistry of technetium and rhenium is dominated by higher-oxidation-state compounds.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Manganese forms oxides MnO, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, and Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Technetium and rhenium, by contrast, only form MO<sub>2</sub>, MO<sub>3</sub>, and M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. The cubic ReO<sub>3</sub> structure has been described in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>, and ReO<sub>2</sub> adopts the rutile structure type. The &#x002B;7 oxidation state M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> oxides are all volatile and dissolve in water to give the [MO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, ions; the Mn complex is the familiar purple &#x2018;permanganate&#x2019; ion, a very powerful oxidizer. The Tc and Re complexes are less oxidizing.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The difficulty of getting seven ligands around a single metal ion means that binary MX<sub>7</sub> halides are only represented by ReF<sub>7</sub>, whereas Re and Tc both form MF<sub>6</sub>, MF<sub>5</sub>, and all four MX<sub>4</sub> halides. Rhenium forms MX<sub>3</sub> with Cl, Br, and I (actually trimers of M<sub>3</sub>X<sub>9</sub>; <b>19</b>); manganese forms MnF<sub>4</sub>, MnF<sub>3</sub>, and all four MX<sub>2</sub> halides. The equilibrium between MnF<sub>3</sub> and MnF<sub>4</sub> is used to purify fluorine; MnF<sub>3</sub> is reacted with impure F<sub>2</sub>(g) to produce MnF<sub>4</sub>(s), which is then heated to above 400&#x00B0;C to liberate pure fluorine gas.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span> Manganese forms a number of complex oxides and halides with useful magnetic properties.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Complex manganese oxides of the formula (Ln<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Sr<sub><i>x</i></sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub>, where Ln is a trivalent lanthanoid cation, typically Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, show <b>colossal magnetoresistance</b>: their electrical resistance changes dramatically (several orders of magnitude) when they are placed in a magnetic field. These materials adopt the perovskite structure and contain a mixture of Mn<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Mn<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ions on the B-cation site. Manganese violet is a pigment described as an ammonium manganese pyrophosphate and contains the Mn<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion. LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, with the spinel structure, is used as the positive electrode in some rechargeable batteries. Mixed manganese&#x2013;zinc&#x2013;iron spinels, (Mn<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Zn<sub><i>x</i></sub>)Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, are known as soft ferrites and are used in transformer cores.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">KMnF<sub>3</sub>, prepared by the addition of KF to Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> solutions, adopts the perovskite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>) with Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> octahedrally coordinated to F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> on the B-cation site and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> on the A-cation site; it acts as host for Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and has some use in imaging. Fluorination of MnF<sub>2</sub> in the presence of an alkali metal fluoride leads to the complex Mn(IV) fluorides of the composition M<sub>2</sub>MnF<sub>6</sub> (M&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;K, Rb, Cs).</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.7d">(d) Coordination complexes</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Manganese(II) is the most stable form of Mn in aqueous solution and has a high-spin d<sup>5</sup> configuration; the solution chemistry of technetium and rhenium is dominated by higher oxidation states.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Manganese (VII) and (VI) complexes (formally d<sup>0</sup> and d<sup>1</sup>, respectively) are based around the tetrahedral MO<sub>4</sub> unit (some have a halogen in place of an oxygen) and are strongly oxidizing in solution. The only other oxidation states that have a significant solution chemistry are the &#x002B;3 state (typically high-spin, Jahn&#x2013;Teller distorted d<sup>4</sup> octahedral complexes) and the &#x002B;2 state. Of these two states, it is the &#x002B;2 state that dominates: complexes are invariably high-spin (even the cyanide complex) with the half-filled d<sup>5</sup> configuration being very considerably stabilized by the quantum mechanical exchange energy (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.5">Section 1.5</a>). Mn(II) complexes have no LFSE and show little preference for any specific coordination geometry; in combination with small coordination species such as OH<sub>2</sub>, O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, the size of Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (ionic radius 65&#x2009;pm) normally produces octahedral complexes. The absence of any allowed electronic transitions means complexes of Mn(II) are essentially colourless.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">By contrast, technetium and rhenium show no solution chemistry in the &#x002B;2 state, and their coordination chemistry is dominated by high-oxidation-state complexes with oxido and nitrido ligands. These complexes show a variety of geometries, with octahedral and square-based pyramidal (with an oxido or nitrido in the apical position) being the most common. In contrast to the intense colour of the permanganate anion [MnO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, the equivalent Tc and Re anions, pertechnate and perrhenate, are colourless as the energy required for the charge-transfer process corresponds to absorption in the UV, illustrating the less oxidizing nature of Re(VII) and Tc(VII) compared to Mn(VII).</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.7e">(e) Organometallic compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>The majority of the organometallic compounds of the Group 7 metals are 18-electron species containing carbonyl ligands.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Carbonyl containing compounds make up the bulk of all organometallic compounds known for the Group 7 metals. All three metals form neutral 18-electron bimetallic carbonyl complexes [M<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>] and the metal&#x2013;metal bond in these complexes is easily cleaved, either oxidatively (e.g. with Br<sub>2</sub>) or reductively (e.g. with Na) to give monomeric octahedral complexes such as [BrMn(CO)<sub>5</sub>] or [MeMn(CO)<sub>5</sub>]. Substitution of these complexes can be used to give monocyclopentadienyl complexes such as [CpM(CO)<sub>3</sub>], and complexes of arenes and dihydrogen (<b>20</b>) are known.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3" style="margin-top:1em;"><span class="bh-nor">19.8</span><b> Group 8: iron, ruthenium, and osmium</b></h3>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.8a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The very abundant iron is both the most widely used metal on the planet, and the most exploited d-block element in biology; ruthenium and osmium are very rare and only have specialist uses and no biological roles.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Iron is the most common element (by mass) on Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth&#x2019;s outer and inner core, and is the fourth most common element in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. The <sup>56</sup>Fe nucleus is the most stable of all isotopes, and the ultimate result of all nuclear fusion. Iron is the single most important metal in human civilization: it is refined and used on the scale of more than a billion tonnes a year; more than 90 per cent of all metal refined is iron. Iron ores are widely distributed and most iron is reduced in a blast furnace with coke and limestone. Iron has been used by humans for at least 3000 years, and the alloying of iron&#x2014;which is actually rather soft when completely pure&#x2014;with other metals (V, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Ni) and carbon produces steels of a wide spectrum of properties. Iron is known to make up the inner core of the Earth (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#box_3.1">Box 3.1</a>), and its use as a catalyst in the Haber process to make ammonia from dinitrogen and hydrogen is critical to the industrial manufacture of fertilizers.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Iron is the most abundant transition metal in biology, with the average human containing over 4&#x2009;g of Fe. The numerous roles of iron include O<sub>2</sub> transport (haemoglobin), electron transfer, acid&#x2013;base, radical, and redox catalysis in a diverse range of enzymes, regulation of gene expression, and even sensing the Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Ruthenium is extremely rare, and is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper refining as well as by the processing of platinum group metal ores. It is used in platinum and palladium alloys, which it hardens, to make wear-resistant electrical contacts; ruthenium dioxide and lead and bismuth ruthenates are used in chip resistors. These two electronic applications account for more than 50 per cent of the ruthenium consumption, with the remainder used in a variety of chemical processes such as anodes for chlorine production.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Osmium is the densest of all elements (22.6&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>), twice as dense as lead. Osmium is the least abundant of the naturally occurring elements and is found in nature as the metal (together with iridium), but it is more economically recovered as a by-product of nickel refining; annual production is of the order of 100&#x2009;kg. Osmium has a very high melting point (3054&#x00B0;C) and is exceptionally hard; consequently it is very difficult to machine or work. Uses rely on hardness and wear resistance: older uses include nibs of fountain pens, bearings in clocks and compasses, gramophone needles; more modern uses include in electrical contacts and as the tetroxide in organic synthesis. Ruthenium and osmium have no known biological role; while most of their salts are considered nonpoisonous, the volatile tetraoxides, MO<sub>4</sub>, are highly toxic.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The highest oxidation state observed for iron is less than that of ruthenium and osmium; low-oxidation-state (&#x002B;2 and &#x002B;3) iron compounds are the most stable.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Iron forms a number of oxides: Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O, <i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x223C;&#x2009;0.04 (oxidation state mainly &#x002B;2), Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (oxidation state &#x002B;3), and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (a mixed-oxidation-state complex: one-third of the iron is Fe(II) and two-thirds Fe(III)) with the spinel structure. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite and may be permanently magnetized (whereupon it is known as lodestone); it has been used in navigational compasses for at least 800 years. Though iron is present as Fe(VI) in compounds of the [FeO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> anion, the equivalent oxide, FeO<sub>3</sub>, is unknown. Similarly, Fe(IV) complexes of the fluoride, such as [FeF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, are known but the simple FeF<sub>4</sub> is not. Binary halides, FeX<sub>3</sub> and FeX<sub>2</sub>, are known for all halogens. Iron forms both a sulfide, FeS, and a disulfide, FeS<sub>2</sub>, found naturally as iron pyrites and known as &#x2018;fool&#x2019;s gold&#x2019;, a complex of the disulfide ion<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>(<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#sec_16.14">Section 16.14</a>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Ruthenium metal is oxidized by air at room temperature to give a passivating layer of RuO<sub>2</sub>, and requires higher temperatures to completely oxidize the metal to RuO<sub>2</sub>. Osmium, by contrast, is very slowly oxidized by air to give volatile OsO<sub>4</sub>. Osmium dioxide, OsO<sub>2</sub>, is formed if the oxidant is not in excess, and is a black crystalline powder. Both Ru and Os dioxides adopt the rutile structure. RuO<sub>4</sub> can be made with the use of strong oxidants, though it is unstable with respect to decomposition to RuO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>; both RuO<sub>4</sub> and OsO<sub>4</sub> are yellow, volatile, and extremely toxic. RuO<sub>2</sub> has some uses as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution in fuel cells (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.16">Section 25.16</a>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Hexa-, penta-, and tetrafluorides are known for both Ru and Os, with tetrachlorides and tetrabromides also known for Os. In the &#x002B;3 oxidation state all Ru halides are known, together with Os bromide and iodides.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The Group 8 metals form a wide variety of complex solids; those of iron have important electronic and magnetic properties.</b></p>

These materials are known as soft ferrites and, because of their ferromagnetic properties and easy reversible magnetization, they have applications in transformer cores, and are also used as brown and black pigments. Hard ferrites, such as the strontium and barium ferrites with the compositions AFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>, are excellent permanent magnets. Yttrium iron garnet, Y<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, has applications in various magneto-optical applications.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Iron-based superconductors include Ln(O,F)FeAs, where Ln is a lanthanoid (La, Ce, Sm, Nd, Gd), with superconducting critical temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>) of up to 53&#x2009;K; and the arsenides LiFeAs and NaFeAs (T<sub>c</sub> of 18 and 25&#x2009;K, respectively); in these pnictides and oxopnictides the iron is coordinated to arsenic in layers, while the more electropositive cations and oxide, where present, form interleaving layers.</p>

Iron(III) complexes are typically octahedral and can be oxidizing. The balance between high- and low-spin complexes is at its most delicate here, and complexes of low-field ligands (e.g. water, halides) are high-spin, while complexes of high-field ligands (e.g. cyanide, bpy) are low-spin. It is possible to make complexes of Fe(III) that change from low to high spin with temperature, pressure, or solvent (&#x2018;spin-crossover complexes&#x2019;). Iron(III) is relatively hard and favours oxygen donor ligands; its polarizing power means that solutions of [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> are rather acidic and species such as [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(OH)]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and [(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>Fe(&#x03BC;-O)Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> are present in solution. Iron(II) complexes are normally octahedral and reducing: thus [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is oxidized by air to give the Fe(III) compound. When Fe(II) is complexed with high-field ligands such as cyanide or phenanthroline the complexes become low-spin and, with a d<sup>6</sup> electron configuration, substantially stabilized and rather inert.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">In their higher-oxidation-state coordination chemistry, ruthenium and osmium both form octahedral [MX<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions with halides, and some complicated oxo anions such as [Ru<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub>]<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> (<b>23</b>). In their lower oxidation states their chemistry is dominated by low-spin octahedral complexes, with Ru showing a surprisingly large number of stable complexes in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state. One complex, [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, is typically used as a photosensitizer: oxidation to the &#x002B;3 state is achieved when visible light excites an electron from the Ru centre to an antibonding orbital of the bpy ligand.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>The Group 8 metals form stable bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes and a wide variety of carbonyl clusters.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Organometallic compounds of the Group 8 metals include the most iconic of all organometallic complexes: ferrocene (<b>24</b>). It was the discovery of, and subsequent elucidation of the bonding of, the 18-electron ferrocene in the early 1950s that kick-started the whole of modern organometallic chemistry (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>). Ruthenium and osmium form similar sandwich complexes known as ruthenocene and osmocene; all three compounds are very stable and can be handled, and indeed sublimed, in air with no precautions. Iron forms a simple 18-electron, trigonal bipyramidal carbonyl, [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] (<b>25</b>), when finely divided iron metal is treated with carbon monoxide. Loss of carbon monoxide from [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] is possible to give clusters such as [Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>] (<b>26</b>) and [Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>] (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.20">Section 22.20</a>); the simplest stable carbonyl that Ru and Os form is in fact the [M<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>] cluster (<b>27</b>). Organometallic complexes of the Group 8 metals containing combinations of carbonyl, cyclopentadienyl, and many other ligands are easily accessible. There is a vast number of cluster compounds containing Group 8 metals.</p>

<span class="bh-nor">19.9</span> <b>Group 9: cobalt, rhodium, and iridium</b></h3>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.9a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Cobalt is used as an important component of many steels, and its salts have been used for millennia as pigments; rhodium and iridium are very rare but have important uses in catalysis.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Cobalt is found at low levels in most rocks and soils and was isolated from a meteorite in 1819. Cobalt is of considerable economic importance, with the main source being as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. Alongside its uses in steel, where it imparts hardness, it is extensively used in magnets. Cobalt compounds have been used for millennia to impart a rich blue colour to glass, glazes and ceramics: cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculptures, Persian jewellery from the third century BC, and the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in 79 AD). Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, has organometallic cobalt at its heart; though it is only required in trace amounts, cobalamin is essential to all animal life. Cobalamin-containing enzymes catalyse radical rearrangements and methyl transfer reactions, and the active site was one of the first for which the structure was determined by X-rays. Most cobalt salts are considered nontoxic.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Rhodium is one of the least abundant of the naturally occurring elements on Earth, and is found in very small amounts as the free metal. The normal source of the element is as a by- product of copper and nickel refining, and only around 20 tonnes are isolated each year. Rhodium metal is highly resistant to oxidation and is very reflective: it is used, as a thin film, to coat optical fibres, certain mirrors, and reflectors in headlights. The major use, accounting for 80 per cent of all rhodium, is as a component of catalytic converters in car exhaust systems. Rhodium compounds are also used in the Monsanto acetic acid process (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.9">Section 25.9</a>), where they catalyse the carbonylation of methanol to give acetic (ethanoic) acid.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known, but so rare that only around 3 tonnes per year are extracted and used. Most iridium found naturally is as an alloy with osmium (osmiridium), though the major commercial source is the anode sludge that forms from the electrorefining of copper. Uses of iridium rely on its hardness and corrosion resistance: it is used as alloys with osmium in bearings, fountain pen nibs, and as reflectors in X-ray telescopes. Iridium salts are used in the Cativa process for methanol carbonylation that is superseding the rhodium-based Monsanto process (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.9">Section 25.9</a>). Neither rhodium nor iridium has any known biological role, but salts of both are mildly toxic if ingested.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.9b">(b) Binary compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The highest oxidation state found for the Group 9 metals is in the fluorides and is &#x002B;6 for rhodium and iridium and &#x002B;4 for cobalt; the most stable oxidation state is &#x002B;2 for cobalt and &#x002B;3 for rhodium and iridium.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">High-oxidation-state compounds of the Group 9 metals are restricted to the fluorides RhF<sub>6</sub>, IrF<sub>6</sub>, RhF<sub>5</sub>, IrF<sub>5</sub>, and MF<sub>4</sub>, and the oxides RhO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub> (rutile structure type); the fluorides are strongly oxidizing and often unstable. While IrO<sub>2</sub> is the stable oxide of iridium, rhodium forms the more common Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Cobalt forms relatively few binary compounds in the &#x002B;3 oxidation state (the fluoride) and partly in the oxide Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, it does form rather more in solution as coordination complexes. For rhodium and iridium, it is the &#x002B;3 oxidation state that is the most stable and well developed: all halides are known, as are oxides. Cobalt is much more normally found in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state, with all four halides and the oxide well known.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.9c">(c) Complex oxides and halides</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>Intensely coloured cobalt pigments have Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in tetrahedral coordination.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">LiCoO<sub>2</sub> has a layer structure consisting of linked Co(III)O<sub>6</sub> octahedra separated by lithium ions; this lithium may be partly extracted electrochemically, leading to the use of this material in rechargeable battery systems (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). CoAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has Co(II) in a tetrahedral site, producing a deep royal blue colour for this compound with the spinel structure; it is widely used as a pigment. Other complex oxides and compounds can also contain tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt(II), including the bright blue cobalt glasses formed when Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> compounds are added to silicates.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.9d">(d) Coordination complexes</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Cobalt forms more tetrahedral complexes than any other d metal, whereas rhodium and iridium mostly form octahedral complexes.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The aqueous coordination chemistry of cobalt is dominated by Co(II) and Co(III), with the balance between the stability of the two oxidation states being ligand-dependent: [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> will oxidize water to liberate oxygen and [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, whereas [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is oxidized by air to give [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. Cobalt(II) forms both octahedral and tetrahedral complexes, with cobalt(II) forming more tetrahedral complexes that all other d metals; this is because for the d<sup>7</sup> configuration the difference in LFSEs of octahedral and tetrahedral geometries is at a minimum (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>). All of the tetrahedral complexes are high-spin, as are most of the octahedral ones; in general the octahedral complexes are pink or red and the tetrahedral ones intensely blue. Cobalt(III) complexes are normally octahedral, and the majority of those are low-spin d<sup>6</sup> and inert.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The coordination chemistry of rhodium and iridium is totally dominated by octahedral low-spin d<sup>6</sup> complexes of the M<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cation. Dissolution of MCl<sub>3</sub> in HCl(aq) results in, depending on concentration of chloride, all complexes possible between [M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and [MCl<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>. Many other complexes with hard donors such as ammonia are known.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The smallest neutral carbonyls known for the Group 9 metals are the dimeric [Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>] (<b>29</b>), and the tetrameric [Rh<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>] and [Ir<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>] compounds (<b>30</b>), with other higher clusters known too. These carbonyl complexes are useful precursors that lead into the catalytically active complexes used in hydroformylation (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.5">Section 25.5</a>) and carbonylation (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.9">Section 25.9</a>) reactions.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">It is in the formally &#x002B;1 oxidation state that we see 16-electron square-planar Rh(I) and Ir(I) complexes. Complexes of this type, such as the historic Vaska&#x2019;s complex (<b>33</b>), are ideally set up for an oxidative addition reaction to give 18-electron octahedral complexes of M(III). Examples of catalytic reactions that use the ready accessibility of oxidative additions include homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts (Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst, <a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.4">Section 25.4</a>) and the synthesis of ethanoic acid via the carbonylation of methanol (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.9">Section 25.9</a>). It is interesting to note that the very first industrial processes for methanol carbonylation used a cobalt catalyst, the second generation used rhodium catalysts, and the current generation use iridium catalysts.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3" style="margin-top:2em;"><span class="bh-nor">19.10</span> <b>Group 10: nickel, palladium, and platinum</b></h3>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.10a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>All three Group 10 metals have important uses: most nickel is used in steel, and both palladium and platinum are used in catalysis.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Nickel occurs widely throughout the Earth&#x2019;s crust and is thought to make up about 10 per cent of its core. Normally nickel is found in conjunction with iron in laterite minerals such as nickeliferous limonite (Fe, Ni)O(OH) or magmatic sulfides such as pentlandite (Ni, Fe)<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, though the huge reserves found near Sudbury, Ontario, in Canada, which are thought to have arrived via the impact of a gigantic meteorite, are millerite, NiS. Conventional roasting in air and reduction with coke gives nickel of &#x223C;75 per cent purity, which is suitable for use in most alloys. Very pure nickel is produced via electrolysis or via the Mond process. Commercialization of the Mond process (1890) relied on the volatility of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>], a molecule whose formula had been established a couple of years earlier, but whose bonding was still unexplained (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.5">Section 22.5</a>). Briefly, carbon monoxide is passed over finely divided nickel, forming the carbonyl, which is swept along to a higher-temperature region where it decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide (which is then recycled). This process can be used to nickel-plate items: hot items are placed in a flow of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] which then decomposes on the surface, depositing nickel. Some 60 per cent of nickel is used in corrosion-resistant steel alloys, and the bulk of the rest in other alloys, or for plating. Nickel features rarely in higher life forms, but is an important element in the microbial world, where it is found in enzymes that catalyse H<sub>2</sub> oxidation, H<sub>2</sub> production, and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, reactions of great interest for renewable energy. A particularly notorious use of Ni in biology is as the active catalytic metal in urease, an enzyme produced by the stomach pathogen <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, which is responsible for gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Some people develop dermatitis when exposed to metallic nickel, though most salts are nontoxic; [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] is extremely toxic, even at very low doses.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Palladium is not particularly rare, and occurs in combination with gold and platinum in nature; however, most palladium is recovered as a by-product of nickel refining. The majority of palladium refined today is used in catalytic convertors in car exhausts, where it helps oxidize partially burnt hydrocarbons. Other uses include dentistry, jewellery, and in the fabrication of microcapacitors. Synthetic chemists make significant use of palladium, either as a hydrogenation catalyst (normally suspended on carbon) or in one the of the many palladium-catalysed carbon&#x2013;carbon bond-forming reactions for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2010 (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.8">Section 25.8</a>). Palladium has no known biological role, but PdCl<sub>2</sub> was once prescribed for tuberculosis, without any harmful&#x2014;or indeed beneficial&#x2014;effect.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Although rather rare, platinum is found as the native metal across the planet. Several ancient civilizations are known to have worked the metal, though it was not recognized as a new element until around 1750. Currently it is mined in South Africa, Russia, and Canada, but is normally recovered from nickel and copper refining. As a pure metal, platinum is silvery-white, lustrous, ductile, and malleable (it is the most ductile of all pure metals). It does not oxidize in air at any temperature, is resistant to most chemicals, and has a very high melting point (1768&#x00B0;C). Thus in the laboratory platinum ware (crucibles, electrodes, etc.) are commonly used when conditions are demanding. These properties also account for its second major use: jewellery. Such is the cachet associated with platinum, it is frequently more highly regarded than gold. Currently the major use of platinum is in catalytic convertors. While platinum has no known biological role, compounds derived from <i>cis</i>-[PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (cisplatin) (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.1">Section 27.1</a>) are widely used as anticancer treatments; it is known that the platinum binds to the DNA of cells and prevents their replication.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.10b">(b) Binary compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:&#160;</span>The most commonly observed oxidation state for the Group 10 metals is &#x002B;2.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">All three Group 10 metals give compounds in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state, and these are very stable under normal conditions. <a id="page_508" class="page">page 508, The d-block elements</a>Further oxidation is relatively easy for platinum to the &#x002B;4 state, and even to the &#x002B;6 oxidation state. Thus the compounds MX<sub>2</sub> are known for all metals and all halogens, PtX<sub>4</sub> are known for all halogens, but only MF<sub>4</sub> is known for Ni and Pd. The very strongly oxidizing PtF<sub>6</sub> can oxidize both dioxygen and xenon. Oxides MO and sulfides MS are known for all metals, and the dioxide PtO<sub>2</sub> and mixed-valence Pt<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can also be isolated. NiO has the rock-salt structure (octahedral coordination of both Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and O<sup>2-</sup>), though PdO and PtO adopt a structure with square-planar metal coordination.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Palladium readily absorbs hydrogen at room temperature to form an interstitial hydride with a greater density of hydrogen than solid hydrogen itself. A porous form of nickel, known as Raney nickel, can be made, and this form is particularly able to absorb hydrogen which can then be delivered to organic substrates.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.10c">(c) Hydroxides, complex hydrides, and oxides</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Nickel hydroxides are used in batteries and the oxides in solid fuel cells.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries use the transformation between Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiO(OH) as the positive electrode. &#x03B1;-Form Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, used in these batteries, has a layer structure formed from face-sharing Ni(OH)<sub>6</sub> octahedra.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Reaction of the alloy LaNi<sub>5</sub> with hydrogen gas leads to the complex LaNi<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which contains more hydrogen per unit volume than liquid hydrogen. Heating this material under reduced pressures evolves hydrogen, and this material is of interest as a hydrogen-storage material where weight is not of critical importance.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Composites of NiO and yttrium-stabilized zirconia are used as highly catalytically active anodes in solid oxide fuel cells, and lanthanum nickelate, La<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>4&#x002B;<i>&#x03B4;</i></sub>, (0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.2), is used as a cathode. Titanium dioxide doped with nickel and antimony oxides, (Ti<sub>0.85</sub>Ni<sub>0.05</sub>Sb<sub>0.10</sub>)O<sub>2</sub>, is used a yellow pigment for plastics and ceramic glazes (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#box_24.1">Box 24.1</a>).</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.10d">(d) Coordination complexes</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Nickel complexes are known with many geometries; Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes are square-planar</b>.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Complexes of Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in solution show octahedral (e.g. [Ni(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>), trigonal bipyramidal (e.g. [Ni(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> with some cations), square-based pyramidal (e.g. [Ni(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> with some cations), tetrahedral (e.g. [NiCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>), and square-planar (e.g. [Ni(CN)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) geometries. By contrast, those of Pd<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Pt<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> are almost invariably square-planar, consistent with their d<sup>8</sup> configuration (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.7">Sections 7.7</a> and <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">20.1</a>). Platinum (and, to a lesser extent, palladium) exhibits a reasonably diverse set of complexes in the &#x002B;4 oxidation state: these complexes are all low-spin octahedral d<sup>6</sup>, and are typically very inert.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.10e">(e) Organometallic compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Nickel forms the homoleptic carbonyl [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>], but the equivalent palladium and platinum complexes are unknown; square-planar organometallic complexes of palladium are widely used in catalysis.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Organometallic compounds of the Group 10 metals include the two historic compounds, nickel tetracarbonyl and K[(CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;aCH<sub>2</sub>)PtCl<sub>3</sub>], known as Zeise&#x2019;s salt (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.9">Section 22.9</a>). [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] is a tetrahedral 18-electron species which has been used as a precursor to many other formally nickel(0) complexes, but the equivalent Pd and Pt complexes are unknown under normal conditions. It is in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state that the Group 10 metals show the greatest number of complexes: these are almost all 16-electron square-planar compounds, like Zeise&#x2019;s salt. Oxidative addition (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.22">Section 22.22</a>) to these complexes is often facile, giving 18-electron octahedral complexes (often followed by reductive elimination to generate another M(II) species). Similarly, oxidative addition is possible at formally M(0) complexes, and there are many examples of catalytic reactions of palladium that utilize this type of pathway, such as hydrogenation reactions (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.4">Section 25.4</a>), the Wacker process (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.6">Section 25.6</a>), and palladium-mediated methods of carbon&#x2013;carbon bond formation (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.8">Section 25.8</a>). There is considerable interest in the activation of simple alkanes by platinum, as it appears that organometallic platinum complexes possess the best balance of properties to allow a pathway to functionalizing hydrocarbons to be realized. Organometallic nickel complexes find uses as hydrogenation and polymerization catalysts and in the cyclotrimerization of alkynes to give arenes.</p>

<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.11a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The Group 11 metals have been used for at least 5000 years; all three are extremely malleable.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">All three of the Group 11 metals have been known and worked for at least 5000 years, their value reflected in their use as currency over the ages.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Copper is a soft, reddish metal that has very high electrical and thermal conductivity. While its surface does tarnish and weather to a soft green hue (verdigris, a basic copper carbonate), it does not corrode under normal conditions. It is easily worked and can be made into flexible wires; it has high thermal and electrical conductivity. Copper is extracted to the tune of 15 million tonnes a year, and current economically viable reserves are predicted to only last for a further 15&#x2013;20 years. Sulfide ores are roasted, treated with limestone, and decomposed by heat to give impure copper. Electrolysis of this material gives copper of 99.99 per cent purity; a sludge of other metals that were present in the crude copper forms beneath the anode and it is from this that many other metals (Ag, Au, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) are extracted. The majority of copper is used in electrical equipment and plumbing (including heat exchangers), with around 5 per cent being used in alloys such as brass. Copper is very important in biology: there are at least 10 copper-dependent enzymes, with cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.8">Section 26.8</a>) being required by all higher life forms to produce energy. Copper is also found in hemocyanin, the blue-coloured O<sub>2</sub>-transport protein found in arthropods and molluscs; copper salts find some use as antifungal agents, and large quantities are toxic by ingestion.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Silver is widely dispersed and mined as the sulfide ore argentite (Ag<sub>2</sub>S), chlorargyrite (AgCl), and pyrargyrite (Ag<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>3</sub>), though it is also produced as a by-product of the electrolytic refining of copper. Silver is a very ductile, malleable metal, with a brilliant white metallic lustre that can take a high degree of polish, though it does tarnish in the atmosphere. It has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals. Alongside <a id="page_509" class="page">page 509, The d-block elements</a>its familiar use in jewellery, silver is used in mirrors, and in the electrical industry (utilizing its excellent conductivity). The use of silver salts in photographic films is declining as digital photography continues to improve. Silver has no known biological role, but the Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation is deadly to both bacteria and viruses, and some medical dressings and preparations contain silver; a more mundane use of this property is the incorporation of silver metal at low levels into clothing (e.g. socks) to prevent the growth of bacteria that are responsible for offensive odours.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Gold was traditionally the most highly prized of all metals, though nowadays it is not always the most expensive. It occurs as the metal in many locales and is extracted at around 2000 tonnes a year. Gold is familiar as a bright-yellow metal that does not tarnish; it is the most malleable of all metals and 1&#x2009;g of it&#x2014;about the size of a grain of rice&#x2014;can be beaten into a sheet more than 1&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup> in area. Traditional uses in jewellery account for around 75 per cent of current gold production and the bulk of the remainder is used as investments, with significant amounts used as electrical contacts. Colloidal gold nanoparticles vary in colour from red to purple, depending on size: they have been used as pigments for glass and porcelain for many centuries. Though gold has no known biological role, salts are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; the metal itself has been used in dentistry for at least 2500 years.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.11b">(b) Binary compounds</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>The &#x002B;2 oxidation state is the most stable for copper; silver and gold form most compounds in the &#x002B;1 and &#x002B;3 states.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The Group 11 metals all show binary compounds in oxidation states &#x002B;1 and &#x002B;2, with gold and silver also showing compounds in the &#x002B;3 state and gold also able to form AuF<sub>5</sub>. Copper forms no binary compounds in the &#x002B;3 state, though some complex fluorides and oxides are known; the most stable state for copper is &#x002B;2, and all the Cu(II) halides except the iodide are known, together with the oxide and sulfide. Copper (I) compounds are normally unstable with respect to disproportionation in solution, but the equilibrium position of the reaction can be affected by the presence of ligands. Cu<sub>2</sub>O (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.7">Fig. 19.7</a>) is a stable, red solid formed by the reduction of Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> solutions and contains Cu<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions in linear coordination to oxygen. It is used as a pigment and component in antifouling paint for ships. CuO is a dark brown solid that contains square-planar Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

Following the discovery of La<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Ba<sub><i>x</i></sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> by Bednorz and Muller in 1986, over 50 different complex copper oxide compositions and structures have been discovered. These include the widely studied YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-d</sub> (YBCO) and Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (BISCO) phases. These compounds, whose structures are all related to that of perovskite, contain copper in an average oxidation state between &#x002B;2.15 and &#x002B;2.35. A key structural feature of these superconductors is a sheet of CuO<sub>4</sub> square planes linked through all vertices, with overall composition CuO<sub>2</sub>.(<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.8">Fig. 19.8</a>).</p>

The hexaaqua ion is blue, and substitution of the waters by amine ligands results in intense blue colours. Copper(I) salts in solution are unstable with respect to disproportionation and rapidly convert to Cu and Cu(II). Silver&#x2019;s coordination chemistry is largely that of the d<sup>10</sup> Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup> complexes, where little preference for coordination <a id="page_510" class="page">page 510, The d-block elements</a>geometry is exhibited: for instance, linear [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, trigonal [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and tetrahedral [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> geometries are all known.

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>With the exception of gold, the organometallic chemistry of the Group 11 metals is poorly represented.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The Group 11 metals show a rather restrictive organometallic chemistry, largely due to the predominance of the &#x002B;1 oxidation state with its d<sup>10</sup> configuration in their organometallic complexes. Copper organometallics are essentially restricted to simple &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-alkyl and -aryl complexes of formally Cu(I): a small number of unstable carbonyl compounds and a few examples of coordinated alkenes and arenes have been reported. Silver organometallics are likewise mostly &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-alkyl and -aryl complexes, though a limited chemistry of square-planar d<sup>8</sup> complexes of Ag(III) has been reported: these complexes are all rather unstable and oxidizing. The recent popular use of silver oxide as a base to deprotonate imidazolium salts to give NHC ligands (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.15">Section 22.15</a>) bound to silver via a carbon has resulted in a large number of new, formally organometallic complexes, but in reality the role of the silver is simply one of a convenient conduit for delivery of the NHC ligand. Gold shows the most developed organometallic chemistry of all the Group 11 metals, with the well-established Au(I) chemistry supplemented by a number of reactive (but not prohibitively so) and catalytically active square-planar complexes of Au(III). &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-Alkene complexes are known, but no complexes with a higher hapticity have yet been reported.

<h3 class="bh-h3"><span class="bh-nor">19.12</span> <b>Group 12: zinc, cadmium, and mercury</b></h3>
<h4 class="bh-h4" id="sec_19.12a">(a) Occurrence and uses</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:&#160;</span>Zinc is important both industrially and biologically; cadmium has uses in batteries; uses of mercury are being phased out because of its toxicity.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Though not initially recognized as a separate element, zinc would appear to have been used for at least 2300 years: certainly the Romans were aware of brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. Zinc is currently the fourth most widely used metal (after Fe, Al, and Cu) on Earth, with some 10 million tonnes or so produced each year. Zinc&#x2019;s principal ores are sphalerite and wurtzite (both ZnS), and these are roasted to give the oxide which can then be reduced with coke. More than half the zinc produced is used to protect steel in the form of zinc plating (galvanizing). Most of the remainder is either used as the pure metal or in alloys such as brass, or as the oxide. Zinc oxide, ZnO, is used in the vulcanization of rubber, in a variety of medical applications such as calamine lotion and antibacterial creams, as a white pigment, for example in coatings on paper, and as a UV-blocking component of plastics. Zinc sulfide, ZnS, is used as a host and activator in many phosphors. When doped with manganese, it emits an orange light when excited with UV or X-ray radiation; with silver doping, the colour produced is blue. Copper-doped ZnS is a phosphorescent material used in glow-in-the-dark paints.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Zinc is the second most abundant d metal in biology, and occurs in more than 200 different enzymes. Its main roles are as the active site metal in a very large number of enzymes that perform acid&#x2013;base catalysis, such as carbonic anhydrase (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.9">Section 26.9</a>), and as the structure-forming metal in &#x2018;Zn-finger&#x2019; transcription factors, proteins that recognize particular sequences of DNA and thus process the genetic code. Zinc is also being discovered to play a vital role in neurochemistry; zinc salts are largely nontoxic and zinc oxide is used in sunblock and to treat skin infections.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Cadmium is a soft, silvery bluish metal that tarnishes in air. It is present as an impurity in most zinc ores, and recovery of cadmium from these sources provides more than enough for current consumption. Currently around 90 per cent of cadmium is used in rechargeable batteries, with the bulk of the remainder being used as coatings in specialist steels. Cadmium in the soil is absorbed by many plants, but is not known to have any beneficial roles except in one marine diatom (where it is found in a carbonic anhydrase); it is an accumulative poison in most animals as it nonreversibly replaces zinc in enzymes, and destroys their function.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Mercury is unique amongst all the metallic elements in that it is a liquid at room temperature, a result of a unique combination of filled subshells, relativistic effects, and the lanthanoid contraction. Instantly recognizable, mercury is a fascinating liquid&#x2014;an unmistakably metallic fluid that it is possible to float lead on. The most important ore of mercury is cinnabar (HgS), which is roasted at 500&#x00B0;C, whereupon metallic mercury distils out. As a metal, mercury finds use in thermometers, in lights (as the vapour), and as various alloys (&#x2018;amalgams&#x2019;), including some used in dentistry. Cinnabar, also known as vermillion, has long been used as a red pigment: the Palaeolithic paintings from around 30 000 years ago found in caves in Spain and France were made with vermillion. Because of increasing environmental concerns, use of mercury is being phased out in most applications. Mercury has no known biological roles, and is intensely poisonous (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#box19.3">Box 19.3</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The chemistries of zinc and cadmium are very similar, and similar to that of the Group 2 metals too. Most of the differences between Zn and Cd can be attributed to the increased size of cadmium; their chemistry is almost exclusively that of the M<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> d<sup>10</sup> state, with oxides, sulfides, and halides all known. Zinc forms a stable hydride, ZnH<sub>2</sub>. Mercury forms a large number of Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> compounds but also forms compounds of the [Hg<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> cation in which two Hg ions are singly bonded to each other. Recent reports have identified HgF<sub>4</sub> in low-temperature matrices (which, with its d<sup>8</sup> configuration, would imply mercury was a transition metal), but it is still some way away from being an isolated compound.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">The biosphere evolved in close association with all the elements in the periodic table, and has had a long time to adapt to them. Metals are released from rocks by weathering, and are processed by a variety of mechanisms, including biological ones. Indeed, many metals have been harnessed for essential biochemical functions (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapters 26</a> and <a href="Chapter27.xhtml">27</a>), and other biochemical systems have evolved to sequester metals and keep them out of harm&#x2019;s way. However, the natural biogeochemical cycles have been greatly perturbed by mining: circulating levels of most metals have increased dramatically since pre-industrial times.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Many metals and metalloids, including Be, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd, Hg, Pb, Se, and As, are hazardous in occupational or environmental settings. Exposure to these elements varies widely, and depends on the pattern of their industrial use and on their environmental chemistry. The metals of greatest environmental concern are heavy metals such as mercury which, being chemically very soft, bind tightly to thiol groups in proteins.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The effect of a substance on a living organism is often plotted as a <i>dose&#x2013;response curve</i>, such as those in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_B19.6">Fig.B19.6</a>. The shape of the dose&#x2013;response curves for various metals varies widely, depending on physiological variables and on the chemistry of the metals. For example, iron and copper are both essential elements but have very different dose&#x2013;response curves: toxicity occurs at a much lower concentration for copper than for iron. It is reasonable to associate this toxicity with the higher affinity of copper ions for sulfur and nitrogen ligands, which makes copper more likely to interfere with crucial sites in proteins. Nevertheless, iron is harmful at higher doses, because it can catalyse the production of oxygen radicals, and also because excess iron can stimulate the growth of bacteria.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The ability of elements to exist in alternative redox states can be of crucial importance to the hazard they present. For example, the solubilities of different oxidation states of a particular metal are often very different. Many metals are found as insoluble sulfides in the Earth&#x2019;s crust and are thus immobile. However, when they are disturbed and brought into contact with air, which oxidizes them, they can become very mobile. An example is mercury(II) sulfide, which is oxidized to the mobile mercury(II) sulfate on exposure to air.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Another effect of oxidation is exemplified by iron, which occurs widely as the mineral pyrite, FeS<sub>2</sub>. Mining operations often lead to acid drainage, because of the reaction</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">In this process (which is generally catalysed by certain bacteria),<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>is oxidized to sulfuric acid and Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is oxidized to Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, which hydrolyses to Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>, yielding additional H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions. Streams emanating from iron mines, many of them abandoned, are thus often highly acidic.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai" style="margin-bottom:1em;">Redox status can have opposite effects on solubility for different metals. Thus, whereas manganese is mobile under reducing conditions, other metals are mobilized under oxidizing conditions. For instance, Cr(III) is immobile, forming an insoluble oxide or kinetically inert complexes with soil constituents; in addition, there is no mechanism for transporting free Cr(III) ions across biological membranes. However, Cr(III) is solubilized upon oxidation to the chromate(VI) ion, [CrO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>. Chromate(VI) is highly toxic, and is implicated in cancer. The [CrO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion has the same shape and charge as<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>SO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>and can be ferried across biological membranes by sulfate-transport proteins. Once inside a cell, chromate is converted to Cr(III) complexes by endogenous reductants, such as ascorbate. In the process, reactive oxygen species are generated, which can damage DNA; in addition, the Cr(III) reduction product can complex and cross-link DNA. Cr(III) accumulates inside the chromate-exposed cells, as it does not have a mechanism for penetrating biological membranes.</p>

</figure>
<p class="bh-boxparai">For other metals, toxicity is controlled by the interplay of membrane transport and intracellular binding with the redox state. For example, mercury salts are relatively harmless because membranes, which present a barrier to ionic species, are impermeable to Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Likewise, metallic mercury is not absorbed through the gut, so it is not toxic when swallowed. However, mercury vapour is highly toxic (that is why all mercury spills must be rigorously cleaned up) because the neutral atoms readily pass through the lungs&#x2019; membranes, and also across the blood&#x2013;brain barrier. Once in the brain, the Hg(0) is oxidized to Hg(II) by the vigorous oxidizing activity of brain-cell mitochondria, and the Hg(II) binds tightly to crucial thiolate groups of neuronal proteins. Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin, but only if it gets inside nerve cells. Even more hazardous than mercury vapour are organomercury compounds, particularly methylmercury. Thus, CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is taken up through the gut because it is complexed by the stomach&#x2019;s chloride, forming CH<sub>3</sub>HgCl, which, being electrically neutral, can pass through a membrane. Once inside cells, CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>&#x002B;</sup> binds to thiolate groups and accumulates.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The environmental toxicity of mercury is associated almost entirely with eating fish. Methylmercury is produced by the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria on Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in sediments, and accumulates as little fish are eaten by bigger fish further up the aquatic food chain. Fish everywhere have some level of mercury present. Mercury levels can increase markedly if sediments are contaminated by additional mercury. The worst known case of environmental mercury poisoning occurred in the 1950s in the Japanese fishing village of Minamata. A polyvinyl chloride plant, using Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> as a catalyst, discharged mercury-laden residues into the bay, where fish accumulated methylmercury to levels approaching 100&#x2009;ppm. Thousands of people were poisoned by eating the fish, and a number of infants suffered mental disabilities and motor disturbance from exposure <i>in utero</i>. This disaster led to strict standards for fish consumption. Limited consumption is advised for fish at the top of the food chain, such as pike and bass in fresh waters, and swordfish and tuna in the oceans.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Regulatory action has been aimed at reducing mercury discharges and emissions, and industrial point sources have been largely controlled. Chloralkali plants, producing the large-volume industrial chemicals Cl<sub>2</sub> and NaOH by electrolysis of NaCl, were a major source as a mercury-pool electrode was used to transfer metallic sodium to a separate hydroxide-generating compartment. However, this is now accomplished by separating the two electrode compartments with a cation-exchange membrane, which prevents migration of the anions. Combustion can vent mercury to the atmosphere if the fuel contains mercury compounds. Whereas municipal waste and hospital incinerators have been equipped with filters to reduce mercury emissions to the air, coal contains small amounts of mercury minerals. Because of the huge quantities burned, coal is a major contributor to environmental mercury.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Mercury is a global problem, because mercury vapour and volatile organomercurial compounds can travel long distances in the atmosphere. <a id="page_512" class="page">page 512, The d-block elements</a>Eventually elemental mercury is oxidized and organomercurials are decomposed, both to Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, by reaction with ozone or by atmospheric hydroxyl or halogen radicals. The Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions are solvated by water molecules and deposited in rainfall. Thus mercury deposition can occur far from the emission source, and is distributed fairly uniformly around the globe. For example, it is estimated that only a third of North American mercury emissions are in fact deposited in the US, and this accounts for only half of the mercury deposition in the US. Even the gold fields of Brazil contribute, because miners use mercury to extract the gold, which is recovered by heating the resultant amalgam to drive off the mercury. This practice is estimated to account for 2 per cent of global mercury emissions (half of South American emissions). The picture is further complicated by the fact that much of the deposited mercury is recirculated through processes that produce volatile compounds or mercury vapour. For example, much of the biomethylation activity of the sulfate-reducing bacteria produces dimethylmercury, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Hg, which, being volatile, is vented to the atmosphere. Other bacteria have an enzyme (methylmercury lyase) that breaks the methyl&#x2013;mercury bond of CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and another enzyme (methylmercury reductase) that reduces the resulting Hg(II) to Hg(0); this is a protective mechanism for the microorganisms, ridding them of mercury as volatile Hg(0).</p>

HgO adopts a structure which contains linear O&#x2013;Hg&#x2013;O units linked into chains (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_19.9">Fig. 19.9</a>). In the polycrystalline form it is a red solid but in the small-particle form produced by rapid precipitation from solution it is yellow. On heating it decomposes to mercury metal and oxygen gas, and it was by this route that Joseph Priestley first produced pure oxygen in 1774.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">Like ZnO, ZnS is polymorphic, and the two structure types hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blende (sphalerite) are named after these naturally occurring mineral forms. CdS shows the same polymorphic behaviour as ZnS, forming 4:4 coordination structures. It is yellow and used as a pigment (cadmium yellow). CdSe is more stable as a polymorph; with the wurtzite structure it is red and also used as a pigment (cadmium red). CdTe is a small-band-gap semiconductor and is used in photovoltaic cells. Red HgS has a structure consisting of helices formed from linear S&#x2013;Hg&#x2013;S units. The semiconductor properties and uses of the Group 12 chalcogenides are discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#box19.4">Box 19.4</a>.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">The compounds between the Group 12 and 16 elements have a number of important applications derived from their semiconducting and associated optical properties. In these metal chalcogenides, MX, the valence band is derived mainly from X<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> orbitals and the conduction band from M<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>orbitals, giving rise to the simple band structure shown in <a href="Chapter19.xhtml#fig_B19.7">Fig. B19.7</a>.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The band gap in this system depends upon the relative energies of the orbitals from M and X contributing to the bands, as this controls both the bandwidth and the separation between M<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and X<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> levels.

<p class="bh-boxparai">The interaction of light with these materials of varying band gap leads to several important applications. Visible light covers the range 1.76&#x2009;eV (red light) to 3.1&#x2009;eV (blue light), and light of sufficient energy will promote an electron in a compound MX from the valence band to the conduction band. A large-band-gap semiconductor such as ZnO (band gap greater than 3.1&#x2009;eV) will only absorb light in the ultraviolet, and this leads to its use in sunscreen creams; ZnO and ZnS are also used as white pigments, with no absorption in the visible region. As the band gap diminishes in materials such as CdS and CdSe, the absorption moves into the visible region; CdS absorbs blue light and CdSe absorbs everything except red light. Thus CdS is a bright yellow solid (the complementary colour of blue; <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig_8.14">Fig. 8.14</a>) and CdSe is red, and this leads to the application of these materials as pigments, the artist&#x2019;s cadmium yellow and cadmium red. Intermediate shades such as orange can be obtained with the solid solution CdS<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Se<sub><i>x</i></sub>. With smaller-band-gap materials such as CdTe and mixed Group 12 metal systems, (Cd,Hg)Te, the band gap becomes very small and the materials absorb across the entire ultraviolet and visible spectrum and into the near infrared. This is exploited in solar cells based on CdTe and infrared radiation detectors using cadmium mercury telluride.</p>
