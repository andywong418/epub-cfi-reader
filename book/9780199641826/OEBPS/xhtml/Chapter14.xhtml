<p class="bh-noindent">The elements of Group 14 are arguably the most important of all, carbon providing the basis for life on Earth and silicon being vital for the physical structure of the natural environment in the form of crustal rocks. The elements of this group exhibit great diversity in their properties, ranging as they do from the nonmetallic carbon to the well-known metals tin and lead. All the elements form binary compounds with other elements. In addition, silicon forms a diverse range of network solids. Many of the organocompounds of the Group 14 elements are commercially important.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent">The elements of Group 14&#x2014;carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead&#x2014;show considerable diversity in their chemical and physical properties. Carbon, of course, is the building block of life and central to organic chemistry. In this chapter, our focus with carbon is on its <i>inorganic</i> chemistry. Silicon is widely distributed in the natural environment, and tin and lead find widespread applications in industry and manufacturing.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3a1"  style="margin-top:3em;">PART A: <b>THE ESSENTIALS</b></h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">The elements of Group 14 (the carbon group) are of fundamental importance in industry and nature. We discuss carbon in many contexts throughout this text, including organometallic compounds in <a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> and catalysis in <a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>. The focus of this section is on the essential aspects of the chemistry of Group 14.</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">The lightest members of the group, carbon and silicon, are nonmetals, germanium is a metalloid, and tin and lead are metals. This increase in metallic properties on descending a <a id="page_382" class="page">page 382, The Group 14 elements</a>group is a striking feature of the p block and can be understood in terms of the increasing atomic radius and associated decrease in ionization energy down the group (<a href="#tab14.1">Table 14.1</a>). Because the ionization energies of the heavier elements are low, the metals form cations increasingly readily down the group.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">As the valence configuration <i>n</i>s<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>p<sup>2</sup> suggests, the &#x002B;4 oxidation state is dominant in the compounds of the elements. The major exception is lead, for which the most common oxidation state is &#x002B;2, two less than the group maximum. The relative stability of the low oxidation state is an example of the inert-pair effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>), which is such a prominent feature of the heaviest p-block elements.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The electronegativities of carbon and silicon are similar to that of hydrogen and they form many covalent hydrogen and alkyl compounds. Carbon and silicon are strong <b>oxophiles</b> and <b>fluorophiles</b>, in the sense that they have high affinities for the hard anions O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, respectively (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.5">Section 4.9</a>). Their oxophilic character is evident in the existence of an extensive series of oxoanions, the carbonates and silicates. In contrast, Pb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> forms more stable compounds with soft anions, such as I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and S<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, than with hard anions, and is therefore classified as chemically soft.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Two almost pure forms of carbon, <i>diamond</i> and <i>graphite</i>, are mined and can also be synthesized. There are other pure forms of carbon as well as many less pure forms, such as <i>coke</i>, which is made by the pyrolysis of coal, and <i>lampblack</i>, which is the product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Silicon is widely distributed in the natural environment and makes up 26 per cent by mass of the Earth&#x2019;s crust. It occurs as sand, quartz, amethyst, agate, and opal, and is also found in asbestos, feldspar, clays, and micas. Germanium is low in abundance and occurs naturally in the ore <i>germanite</i>, Cu<sub>13</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>Ge<sub>2</sub>S<sub>16</sub>, in zinc ores, and in coal. Tin occurs as the mineral cassiterite, SnO<sub>2</sub>, and lead occurs as <i>galena</i>, PbS.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Diamond and graphite, the two common crystalline forms of elemental carbon, are remarkably different: diamond is effectively an electrical insulator, graphite is a good conductor; diamond is the hardest known natural substance whereas graphite is soft; diamond is transparent and graphite is black. The origin of these widely different physical properties can be traced to the very different structures and bonding in the two allotropes.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">In diamond, each C atom forms single bonds of length 154&#x2009;pm with four adjacent C atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron (<a href="#fig_14.1">Fig. 14.1</a>); the result is a rigid, covalent, three-dimensional framework. Graphite consists of stacks of planar graphene layers within which each C atom has three nearest neighbours at 142&#x2009;pm (<a href="#fig_14.2">Fig. 14.2</a>). The &#x03C3; bonds between neighbours within the sheets are formed from the overlap of sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals, and the remaining perpendicular p orbitals overlap to form &#x03C0; bonds that are delocalized over the plane. The ready cleavage of graphite parallel to the planes of atoms (which is largely due to the presence of impurities) accounts for its slipperiness. Diamond can be cleaved, but this ancient craft requires considerable expertise as the forces in the crystal are more symmetrical.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">Diamond and graphite are not the only allotropes of carbon. The fullerenes (known informally as &#x2018;buckyballs&#x2019;) were discovered in the 1980s and have given rise to a new field within the inorganic chemistry of carbon. Single sheets of graphite, called graphene, can be isolated. Carbon nanotubes were discovered in the early 1990s and are composed of graphene-like tubes with hemispherical buckyball-like caps.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">All the elements of the group except lead have at least one solid phase with a diamond structure (<a href="#fig_14.1">Fig. 14.1</a>). The cubic phase of tin, which is called <i>grey tin</i> or &#x03B1;-<i>tin</i> (&#x03B1;-Sn), is not stable at room temperature. It converts to the more stable, common phase, <i>white tin</i> or &#x03B2;-<i>tin</i> (&#x03B2;-Sn), in which an Sn atom has six nearest neighbours in a highly distorted octahedral array. When white tin is cooled to 13.2&#x00B0;C, it converts to the brittle grey tin. The effects of this transformation were first recognized on organ pipes in medieval European cathedrals, where it was believed to be due to the Devil&#x2019;s work. Legend has it that Napoleon&#x2019;s armies were defeated in Russia because, as the temperature fell, the white tin buttons on the soldiers&#x2019; uniforms were converted to grey tin, which then crumbled away.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The gap between the valence and conduction bands (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>) decreases steadily from diamond, which is classed as a wide-band-gap semiconductor but is commonly regarded as an insulator, to tin, which behaves like a metal above its transition temperature.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Elemental carbon in the form of coal or coke is used as a fuel and reducing agent in the recovery of metals from their ores. Graphite is used as a lubricant and in pencils, and diamond is used in industrial cutting tools. The band gap and consequent semiconductivity of silicon leads to its many applications in integrated circuits, computer chips, solar cells, and other electronic solid-state devices. Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is the major raw material used to make glass. Germanium was the first widely used material for the construction of transistors because it was easier to purify than silicon and, having a smaller band gap than silicon (0.72&#x2009;eV for Ge, 1.11&#x2009;eV for Si), is a better intrinsic semiconductor.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Tin is resistant to corrosion and is used to plate steel for use in tin cans. Bronze is an alloy of tin and copper that typically contains less than 12 per cent by mass of tin; bronze with higher tin content is used to make bells. Solder is an alloy of tin and lead, and has been in use since Roman times. Window glass or float glass is made by floating molten glass on the surface of molten tin. The &#x2018;tin side&#x2019; of window glass can be seen as a haze of tin(IV) oxide when viewed with ultraviolet radiation. Trialkyl and triaryltin compounds are in widespread use as fungicides and biocides.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The softness and malleability of lead has resulted in its use in plumbing and in solder, although this application is now illegal in many countries because of concerns over lead poisoning. Its low melting point contributes to its use in solder and its high density (11.34&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) leads to its use in ammunition and as shielding from ionizing radiation. Lead oxide is added to glass to raise its refractive index and form &#x2018;lead&#x2019; or &#x2018;crystal&#x2019; glass.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3"  style="margin-top:2em;"><b>14.2 Simple Compounds</b></h3>
<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> All the Group 14 elements form simple binary compounds with hydrogen, oxygen, the halogens, and nitrogen. Carbon and silicon also form carbides and silicides with metals.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">All the Group 14 elements form tetravalent hydrides, EH<sub>4</sub>. In addition, carbon and silicon form series of catenated molecular hydrides. Carbon forms an enormous range of hydrocarbon compounds that are best regarded from the viewpoint of organic chemistry.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Carbon forms a series of simple hydrocarbons, the alkanes, with the general formula C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>&#x002B;2</sub>. The stability of the long-chain, catenated hydrocarbons is due to the high C&#x0064;C and C&#x0064;H bond enthalpies (<a href="#tab14.2">Table 14.2</a>; <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.7">Section 9.7</a>). Carbon also forms strong multiple bonds in the unsaturated alkenes and alkynes (<a href="#tab14.2">Table 14.2</a>). The strength of the C&#x0064;C bond and the ability to form multiple bonds are largely responsible for the diversity and stability of carbon compounds.</p>
<p class="bh-tabcap"><b><span class="bh-blue">Table 14.2</span></b> Selected mean bond enthalpies, <i>B</i>(X&#x2013;Y)/kJ mol<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p><a id="page_384" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 384, The Group 14 elements</a></p>
<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:-1em;">The data in illustrate how the E&#x0064;E bond enthalpy decreases on descending the group. As a result, the tendency to catenation decreases from C to Pb. Silicon forms a series of compounds analogous to the alkanes, the <i>silanes</i>, but the longest chain contains just seven Si atoms, as heptasilane, Si<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>. The silanes, with their greater number of electrons and stronger intermolecular forces, are less volatile than their hydrocarbon analogues. Thus, whereas propane, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, is a gas under normal conditions, its silicon analogue, trisilane, Si<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, is a liquid that boils at 53&#x00B0;C. The decreasing stability of the hydrides on going down the group severely limits the accessible chemical properties of stannanes and plumbane.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The tetrahalomethanes, the simplest halocarbons, vary from the highly stable and volatile CF<sub>4</sub> to the thermally unstable solid CI<sub>4.</sub> The full range of tetrahalides is known for silicon and germanium; all of them are volatile molecular compounds. Germanium shows signs of an inert-pair effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>) in that it also forms nonvolatile dihalides. Evidence of the inert-pair effect becomes more prominent in the chemistry of tin and lead as the &#x002B;2 oxidation state becomes increasingly stable.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The two familiar oxides of carbon are CO and CO<sub>2</sub>. Among the less familiar oxides is carbon suboxide, O&#x003D;C&#x003D;C&#x003D;C&#x003D;O. Physical data on all three compounds are summarized in <a href="#tab14.3">Table 14.3</a>. It should be noted that the bond in CO is short and strong (bond enthalpy 1076&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and its force constant is high. These features are in accord with its possession of a triple bond, as in the Lewis structure :C&#x2261;O: (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.9">Section 2.9</a>). Carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, shows a number of significant differences from carbon monoxide. The bonds are longer and the stretching force constants smaller in CO<sub>2</sub> than in CO, which is consistent with the bonds being double rather than triple. When graphite is reacted with powerful oxidizing agents such as concentrated sulfuric acid or potassium chlorate, graphite oxide is formed in which the surface of the graphite layers is decorated with epoxide and hydroxyl groups. The presence of these groups means that the graphite layers cleave easily and two-dimensional layers of graphene oxide can be formed. Graphene oxide can be reduced to produce graphene-like materials.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="bh-indent">The high affinity of silicon for oxygen accounts for the existence of a vast array of silicate minerals and synthetic silicon&#x2013;oxygen compounds, which are important in mineralogy, industrial processing, and the laboratory. The simplest oxide of silicon is the chemically stable silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, which occurs in many forms, all of which are based on the tetrahedral SiO<sub>4</sub> unit. Aside from rare high-temperature phases, the structures of silicates are confined to tetrahedral, four-coordinate Si. Thus, orthosilicate is [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> (<b>1</b>), disilicate is [O<sub>3</sub>SiOSiO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>6&#x2212;</sup> (<b>2</b>). Silica and many silicates crystallize slowly. Amorphous solids known as <b>glasses</b> can be obtained instead of crystals by cooling the melt at an appropriate rate. In some respects these glasses resemble liquids. As with liquids, their structures are ordered over distances of only a few interatomic spacings (such as within a single SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedron). Unlike liquids, however, their viscosities are very high, and for most practical purposes they behave like solids.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Germanium(IV) oxide, GeO<sub>2</sub>, resembles silica. Germanium(II) oxide, GeO, disproportionates readily to Ge and GeO<sub>2</sub>. Tin(II) oxide, SnO, exists as blue-black and red polymorphs. Both forms are readily oxidized to SnO<sub>2</sub> when heated in air. Lead forms the brown lead(IV) oxide, PbO<sub>2</sub>, red and yellow forms of lead(II) oxide, PbO, and a mixed valence oxide, Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which contains Pb(IV) and Pb(II) and is known as &#x2018;red lead&#x2019;. The inert-pair effect (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.5">Section 9.5</a>) is evident once again in the stability of Pb(II) oxide relative to the Pb(IV) oxide.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Carbon forms hydrogen cyanide, HCN, ionic cyanides containing the CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion, and the gas cyanogen (CN)<sub>2</sub>. They are all extremely toxic. The direct reaction of silicon and nitrogen gas at high temperatures produces silicon nitride, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. This substance is very hard and inert, and is used in high-temperature ceramic materials.</p>

Group 1 and 2 metals form ionic saline carbides, d-block metals form metallic carbides, and boron and silicon form covalent solids. Silicon carbide, SiC, is widely used as the abrasive <i>carborundum</i>.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> As well as forming simple binary compounds with oxygen, silicon forms a wide range of extended network solids that find a range of applications in industry.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Aluminosilicates are formed when Al atoms replace some of the Si atoms in a silicate and occur naturally as clays, minerals, and rocks. Zeolite aluminosilicates are widely used as molecular sieves, microporous catalysts, and catalyst support materials. Because Al occurs as Al(III), its presence in place of Si(IV) in an aluminosilicate renders the overall charge more negative by one unit. An additional cation, such as H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><msup><mrow><mtext>Ca</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2+</mtext></mrow></msup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>  is therefore required for each Al atom that replaces a Si atom. These additional cations have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Many important minerals are varieties of layered aluminosilicates that also contain metals such as lithium, magnesium, and iron: they include clays, talc, and various micas. An example of a simple layered aluminosilicate is the mineral <i>kaolinite</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which is used commercially as china clay and in some medical applications. It has long been used in diarrhoea remedies, and a more recent application uses kaolinite nanoparticle-impregnated bandages to stop bleeding, as the mineral triggers blood clotting.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">In the mineral <i>talc</i>, Mg<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions are sandwiched between layers of [Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>]<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> anions. The arrangement is electrically neutral, and as a result talc readily cleaves between the layers and accounts for talc&#x2019;s familiar slippery feel. Muscovite mica, KAl<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>AlO<sub>10</sub>, has charged layers because one Al(III) atom substitutes for one Si(IV) atom and the resulting negative charge is compensated by a K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion that lies between the repeating layers. Because of this electrostatic cohesion, muscovite is not soft like talc but it is readily cleaved into sheets. There are many minerals based on a three-dimensional aluminosilicate framework. The <i>feldspars</i>, for instance, are the most important class of rock-forming minerals.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The <b>molecular sieves</b> are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates having open structures with apertures of molecular dimensions. The name &#x2018;molecular sieve&#x2019; is prompted by the observation that these materials absorb only molecules that are smaller than the aperture dimensions and so can be used to separate molecules of different sizes. A subclass of molecular sieves, the <i>zeolites</i>,<sup>1</sup> have an aluminosilicate framework with cations (typically from Groups 1 or 2) trapped inside tunnels or cages (<a href="#fig_14.3">Fig. 14.3</a>). In addition to their function as molecular sieves, zeolites are used as ion-exchange resins as they can exchange their ions for those in a surrounding solution. Zeolites are also used for shape-selective heterogeneous catalysis (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">Carbon occurs as diamond and graphite, and in several forms of low crystallinity. The 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their discovery of a new allotrope of carbon, C<sub>60</sub>, named buckminsterfullerene after the geodesic domes designed by the architect Buckminster Fuller (see <a href="#sec_14.6">Section 14.6</a>). Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in natural waters, and as the insoluble carbonates of calcium and magnesium.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Elemental silicon is produced from silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, by high-temperature reduction with carbon in an electric arc furnace:</p>

<p class="bh-boxtitle"><a id="box14.1"></a><b><span class="bh-bgg">BOX 14.1</span> Synthetic diamonds</b></p>
</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:1em;">Diamonds were synthesized in 1955 after many failed attempts, using graphite and a d metal heated to 1500&#x2013;2000&#x2009;K and subjected to 7&#x2009;GPa. The graphite and metal must both be molten for diamond to be produced, so the temperature of synthesis depends on the melting point of the metal. The d metal (typically nickel) dissolves the graphite and the less soluble diamond phase crystallizes from it. The size, shape, and colour of the diamonds depend upon the conditions. Low-temperature synthesis produces dark, impure crystals. High-temperature synthesis produces paler, purer crystals. Common impurities are species that can be accommodated into the diamond lattice with minimum distortion. The diamonds are often contaminated with graphite or the metal catalyst. For example, the lattice dimensions of nickel are similar to those of diamond, and crystallites of nickel may be included in the diamond lattice.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The diamond crystals can be grown by seeding with small diamond crystals but the new growth is often uneven, with gaps and inclusions. Better quality diamonds are formed when the source of carbon is diamond and the seed crystals are in a cooler part of the apparatus. The difference in the solubility with the change in temperature causes the carbon to crystallize in a slow, controlled way, giving high-quality diamonds. Diamonds up to 1 carat (200&#x2009;mg) may take up to a week to crystallize in this way.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Diamonds can be synthesized directly from graphite without a metal catalyst if the temperature and pressure are high enough. The shock synthesis method (the <i>Du Pont method</i>) exposes graphite to the intense pressure generated by a charge of high explosive. The graphite reaches a temperature of 1000&#x2009;K and a pressure of 30&#x2009;GPa for a few milliseconds and some of it is converted to diamond. The <i>static pressure method</i> heats graphite in high-pressure equipment by the discharge from a capacitor. Polycrystalline lumps of diamond are formed at 3300&#x2013;4500&#x2009;K and 13&#x2009;GPa. Hydrocarbons may also be used as the carbon source in this method. Aromatic compounds such as naphthalene and anthracene produce graphite but aliphatic compounds such as paraffin wax and camphor produce diamond.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Because the high-pressure synthesis of diamond is costly and cumbersome, a low-pressure process would be highly attractive. It has in fact been known for a long time that microscopic diamond crystals mixed with graphite can be formed by depositing C atoms on a hot surface in the absence of air. The C atoms are produced by the pyrolysis of methane, and the atomic hydrogen also produced in the pyrolysis plays an important role in favouring diamond over graphite. One property of the atomic hydrogen is that it reacts more rapidly with the graphite than with diamond to produce volatile hydrocarbons, so the unwanted graphite is swept away. Although the process is not fully perfected, synthetic diamond films are already finding applications ranging from the hardening of surfaces subjected to wear, such as cutting tools and drills, to the construction of electronic devices. For example, boron-doped diamond films are very conducting and are used as electrodes in electrochemistry.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">A synthetic method that is more environmentally friendly and cheaper than any of the high-temperature and high-pressure methods uses silicon carbide. Carbon is extracted as diamond under an atmosphere of Cl2 and H2 gases close to 1 atm pressure and the relatively low temperature of 1300 K. .</p></div>

<h3 class="bh-h3" style="margin-top:2em;"><b>14.5 Diamond and graphite</b></h3>
<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Diamond has a cubic structure. Graphite consists of stacked two-dimensional carbon sheets; oxidizing agents or reducing agents may be intercalated between these sheets with concomitant electron transfer.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Diamond has the highest known thermal conductivity because its structure (shown in <a href="#fig_14.1">Fig. 14.1</a>) distributes thermal motion in three dimensions very efficiently. The measurement of thermal conductivity is used to identify fake diamonds. Because of its durability, clarity, and high refractive index, diamond is one of the most highly prized gemstones.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The ready cleavage of graphite parallel to the planes of atoms (as shown in <a href="#fig_14.2">Fig. 14.2</a>) is largely due to the presence of impurities and accounts for its slipperiness. These graphene planes are widely separated from each other (at 335&#x2009;pm), indicating that there are weaker forces between them. These forces are sometimes, but not very appropriately, called &#x2018;van der Waals forces&#x2019; (because in the common impure form of graphite, graphitic oxide, they are weak, like intermolecular forces), and consequently the region between the planes is called the <b>van der Waals gap</b>. Unlike diamond, graphite is soft and black with a slightly metallic lustre; it is neither durable nor particularly attractive.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The conversion of diamond to graphite at room temperature and pressure is spontaneous (&#x0394;<sub>trs</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x29B5;</sup>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;&#x2212;22.90&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) but does not occur at an observable rate under ordinary conditions: diamonds older than the solar system have been isolated from meteorites. Diamond is the denser phase (3.51&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> instead of 2.26&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>), so it is favoured by high pressures, and large quantities of diamond abrasive are manufactured commercially by a d-metal-catalysed high-temperature, high-pressure process (<a href="#box14.1">Box 14.1</a>). Thin films of boron-doped diamond are piezoresistive (their electrical resistance changes when pressure is applied) and are deposited on silica surfaces for use as high-temperature pressure sensors.</p>
<p class="bh-footnote"><sup>2</sup> A semimetal (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.19">section 3.19</a>) is a material in which there is zero energy gap between the valence and conduction band energies but the density of states at the Fermi level is zero.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The electrical conductivity and many of the chemical properties of graphite are closely related to the structure of its delocalized &#x03C0; bonds. Its electrical conductivity perpendicular to the planes is low (5&#x2009;S&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 25&#x00B0;C) and increases with increasing temperature, signifying that graphite is a semiconductor in that direction. The electrical conductivity is much higher parallel to the planes (30&#x2009;kS&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 25&#x00B0;C) but decreases as the temperature is raised, indicating that graphite behaves as a metal, more precisely a semimetal,<sup>2</sup> in that direction. This effect is most striking in pyrolytic graphite, which is manufactured by the decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas at high temperature in a vacuum furnace. The resulting graphite is of very high purity with desirable mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. <a id="page_387" class="page">page 387, The Group 14 elements</a>Pyrolytic graphite is used in ion beam grids, thermal insulators, rocket nozzles, heater elements, and as an electrode material.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-left:0em;"><span class="bh-red"><b>Figure 14.4</b></span> Potassium graphite compounds showing two types of alternation of intercalted atoms.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="bh-indent">Graphite can act as either an electron donor or an electron acceptor towards atoms and ions that penetrate between its sheets and give rise to an <b>intercalation compound</b>. Thus, K atoms reduce graphite by donating their valence electron to the empty orbitals of the &#x03C0;&#x002A; band and the resulting K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions penetrate between the layers (<a href="#fig_14.4">Fig. 14.4</a>). The electrons added to the band are mobile, and therefore alkali metal&#x2013;graphite intercalates have high electrical conductivity. The stoichiometry of the compound depends on the quantity of alkali metal and the reaction conditions. The different stoichiometries are associated with an interesting series of structures, where the alkali metal ion may insert between neighbouring layers of C atoms, every other layer, and so on in a process known as <i>staging</i> (<a href="#fig_14.4">Fig. 14.4</a>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">An example of an oxidation of graphite by removal of electrons from the &#x03C0; band is the formation of <b>graphite bisulfates</b> by heating graphite with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. In this reaction, electrons are removed from the &#x03C0; band, and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HSO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>  ions penetrate between the sheets to give substances of approximate formula <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>(C</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>24</mtext></mrow></msub><mtext>)</mtext></mrow><mtext>+</mtext></msup><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HSO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>  In this oxidative intercalation reaction, the removal of electrons from the full &#x03C0; band leads to a higher conductivity than that of pure graphite. This process is analogous to the formation of p-type silicon by electron-accepting dopants (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.20">Section 3.20</a>). When graphite bisulfates are treated with water, the layers are disrupted. When the water is subsequently removed at high temperatures, a highly flexible form of graphite is formed; this <i>graphite tape</i> is used to make sealing gaskets, valves, and brake linings. When graphite is oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents such as HNO<sub>3</sub>, KClO<sub>3</sub>, or KMnO<sub>4</sub>, graphite oxide is produced. The layers of graphite oxide are decorated with epoxide and hydroxyl groups with carboxylic acid groups at the edges of the graphite sheets. Graphite oxide cleaves into single layers of graphene oxide when dissolved in aqueous solution. Graphene oxide has attracted attention as a precursor to graphene (<a href="#box14.2">Box 14.2</a>) but currently it produces graphene with too many impurities and structural defects.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The halogens show an alternation effect in their tendency to form intercalation compounds with graphite. Graphite reacts with fluorine to produce &#x2018;graphite fluoride&#x2019;, a nonstoichiometric species with formula (CF)<sub><i>n</i></sub> (0.59&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;1). This compound is black when <i>n</i> is low in its range and colourless when <i>n</i> approaches 1. It is used as a lubricant in high-vacuum applications and as the cathode in lithium batteries. At elevated temperatures the products of the reaction also include C<sub>2</sub>F and C<sub>4</sub>F. Chlorine reacts slowly with graphite to form C<sub>8</sub>Cl, and iodine does not react at all. By contrast, bromine intercalates readily to give C<sub>8</sub>Br, C<sub>16</sub>Br, and C<sub>20</sub>Br in another example of staging.</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:1em;">Graphene is monolayer graphite: a single layer of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms completely separated from other such layers (<a href="#figb_14.2">Fig. B14.1</a>). Groundbreaking work on graphene won the 2010 Nobel Prize for Physics for Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester, UK. Graphene is often referred to as the wonder material, and it does have remarkable properties. It is the strongest known material, with a breaking strength of approximately 40&#x2009;N&#x2009;m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which is 200 times greater than structural steel. It has the highest recorded thermal conductivity and shows more elasticity than any other crystal, stretching by up to 20 per cent. Graphene also exhibits some intriguing properties. For example, it shrinks with increasing temperature, exhibits simultaneously high pliability with brittleness, so it can be folded but will shatter like glass under high strain. It is also impermeable to gases. But it is graphene&#x2019;s high electrical conductivity that excites most interest and it has been predicted to replace silicon in computing in the future. That is still some way off, however, as graphene has no band gap, and so is permanently conducting and cannot be switched off.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">At the moment developments in graphene technology are hampered by the lack of large-scale production of pure graphene sheets. The method that produces the cleanest graphene surface is exfoliation, where the</p>

This can be achieved quite simply by using sticky tape, but separating the useful thin flakes from the graphite debris is time-consuming and inefficient. A simple and inexpensive route to graphene could revolutionize its use. Consequently, there is much activity in this area in both industrial and academic research, with many novel methods being explored. Some of the more promising methods include heating sodium metal with ethanol for several days, chemical vapour deposition using a hydrocarbon precursor, electric discharge between graphite rods, Fischer&#x2013;Tropsch synthesis of graphene and water (rather than the usual alkanes and water), reduction of graphene oxide, and unzipping single-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Metal and nonmetal cluster compounds have been known for decades, but the discovery of the soccer-ball-shaped C<sub>60</sub> cluster in the 1980s created great excitement in the scientific community and in the popular press. Much of this interest undoubtedly stemmed from the fact that carbon is a common element and there had seemed little likelihood that new molecular carbon structures would be found.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">When an electric arc is struck between carbon electrodes in an inert atmosphere, a large quantity of soot is formed together with significant quantities of C<sub>60</sub> and much smaller quantities of related <b>fullerenes</b>, such as C<sub>70</sub>, C<sub>76</sub>, and C<sub>84</sub>. The fullerenes can be dissolved in a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon and separated by chromatography on an alumina column. The structure of C<sub>60</sub> has been determined by X-ray crystallography on the solid at low temperature and electron diffraction in the gas phase. The molecule consists of five- and six-membered carbon rings, and the overall symmetry is icosahedral in the gas phase (<b>3</b>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:0em;width:70%;">

<p class="bh-indent">Fullerenes can be reduced to form [60]fulleride salts, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>C</mtext><mrow><mn>60</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>  (<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1 to 12). Fullerides of alkali metals are solids having compositions such as K<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub>. The structure of K<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> consists of a face-centred cubic array of C<sub>60</sub> ions in which K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions occupy the one octahedral and two tetrahedral sites available to each C ion (<a href="#fig_14.5">Fig. 14.5</a>).

The conductivity of E<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> compounds can be explained by considering that the conduction electrons are donated to the C<sub>60</sub> molecules and are mobile because of overlapping C<sub>60</sub> molecular orbitals (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.20">Section 24.20</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> The polyhedral fullerenes undergo reversible multielectron reduction and form complexes with d-metal organometallic compounds and with OsO<sub>4</sub>.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Reasonably efficient methods of synthesizing the fullerenes have been developed and their redox and coordination chemistry have been extensively investigated. In keeping with the formation of alkali metal fullerides, C<sub>60</sub> undergoes five electrochemically reversible electron transfer steps in nonaqueous solvents (<a href="#fig_14.6">Fig. 14.6</a>). These observations suggest that the fullerenes ought to serve as either electrophiles or nucleophiles when paired with the appropriate metal. One illustration of this ability is the attack of electron-rich Pt(0) phosphine complexes on C<sub>60</sub>, yielding compounds such as (<b>4</b>), in which the Pt atom spans a pair of C atoms in the fullerene molecule. This reaction is analogous to the coordination of double bonds to Pt&#x2013;phosphine complexes. Although analogy with &#x03B7;<sup>6</sup>-benzenechromium complexes (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.19">Section 22.19</a>) suggests that a metal atom might coordinate to a six-fold face of C<sub>60</sub>, that such hexahapto complexes do not in fact form is attributed to the radial arrangement of the C2p&#x03C0; orbitals (<b>5</b>), which results in them having a poor overlap with d orbitals of a metal atom centred above a six-fold face of the molecule.</p>

<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:1em;">In contrast to the poor interaction of a fullerene six-fold face with a single metal atom, a larger array of metal atoms, the triruthenium cluster, [Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>], reacts to form a [Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>] cap on a six-fold face of C<sub>60</sub>. In the process, three CO ligands are displaced (<b>6</b>).

<p class="bh-indent">In addition to complexes formed with the metal atom outside the fullerene cage, endohedral fullerenes are formed in which one or more atoms are accommodated inside the C<sub>60</sub> shell. Such complexes are denoted M@C<sub>60</sub>, indicating that the M atom is inside the C<sub>60</sub> cage. Small inert gas atoms and molecules may be driven inside the cage at high temperatures (&#x003E;600&#x00B0;C) and pressures (&#x003E;2000&#x2009;atm) to give, for example, H<sub>3</sub>@C<sub>60</sub>. Alternatively, the carbon cage can be formed around the endohedral atom by using a metal-doped carbon rod in an electric arc. Larger shells, such as La@C<sub>82</sub> and La<sub>3</sub>@C<sub>106</sub>, are often formed.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4">(c) Carbon nanotubse</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent">One of the most interesting consequences of fullerene research has been the identification of <b>carbon nanotubes</b>. Carbon nanotubes are closely related to both fullerenes and graphene. Graphene is a single layer of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms (<a href="#box14.2">Box 14.2</a>). Carbon nanotubes consist of one or more concentric cylindrical tubes conceptually formed by rolling graphene sheets. The ends of the nanotubes are often capped by hemispheres of fullerene-like caps containing six five-membered rings of atoms (<a href="#fig_14.7">Fig. 14.7</a>). Nanotubes formed from a single graphene sheet are known as single-walled nanotubes (SWNT). The tube diameter is close to 1&#x2009;nm and the properties of the nanotubes are determined by the way the graphene is rolled, and the diameter and length of the tube. Multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT) consist of concentric tubes of graphene. The MWNT can be made up of concentric cylinders of graphene sheets, in the so-called &#x2018;Russian-doll&#x2019; model, or from a single graphene sheet rolled around itself. This is the &#x2018;parchment&#x2019; model. <b>Nanobuds</b> combine both carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. They have a fullerene covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube which can act as an anchor, reducing the amount by which the nanotubes slide over each other. Graphenated carbon nanotubes, g-CNTs, have small flakes of graphene along the outer walls of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. These g-CNTs have high-surface-area three-dimensional frameworks. The preparation of nanotubes has stimulated much research, and the compounds could ultimately find a wide range of practical applications such as hydrogen storage and catalysis and those that exploit the high mechanical strength, such as body armour. They are covered more fully in <a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Amorphous and partially crystalline carbon in the form of small particles are used on a large scale as adsorbents and as strengthening agents for rubber; carbon fibres impart strength to polymeric materials.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">There are many forms of carbon that have a low degree of crystallinity. These partially crystalline materials have considerable commercial importance; they include <i>carbon black</i>, <i>activated carbon</i>, and <i>carbon fibres</i>. Because single crystals suitable for complete X-ray analyses of these materials are not available, their structures are uncertain. However, what information there is suggests that their structures are similar to that of graphite, but the degree of crystallinity and shapes of the particles differ.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Carbon black is a very finely divided form of carbon. It is prepared (on a scale that exceeds 8&#x2009;Mt annually) by the combustion of hydrocarbons under oxygen-deficient conditions. Planar stacks, like those of graphite, and multilayer balls, reminiscent of the fullerenes, have both been proposed for its structure (<a href="#fig_14.8">Fig. 14.8</a>). Carbon black is used on a huge scale as a pigment, in printer&#x2019;s ink (as on this page), and as a filler for rubber goods, including tyres, where it greatly improves the strength and wear resistance of the rubber and helps to protect it from degradation by sunlight.</p>

It has a high surface area (in some cases exceeding 1000&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), that arises from the small particle size. It is therefore a very efficient adsorbent for molecules, including organic pollutants from drinking water, noxious gases from the air, and impurities from reaction mixtures. There is evidence that the parts of the surface defined by the edges of the hexagonal sheets are covered with oxidation products, including carboxyl and hydroxyl groups (<b>8</b>). This structure may account for some of its surface activity.</p>

Their structure bears a resemblance to that of graphite, but in place of the extended sheets the layers consist of ribbons parallel to the axis of the fibre. The strong in-plane bonds (which resemble those in graphite) give the fibre its very high tensile strength.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara"><i><b>Answer</b></i> We need to consider the valence electrons on each atom and the orbitals available for bond formation. The B and C atoms both have four orbitals available for bonding (one s and three p). However, a C atom has four valence electrons, one for each orbital, and it can therefore use all its electrons and orbitals in forming 2<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds with the four neighbouring C atoms. By contrast, B has only three electrons, so to use all four orbitals it forms 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds. The formation of these three-centre bonds brings another B atom into binding distance.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">The silanes are much more reactive than the alkanes and their stability decreases with increasing chain length. This lower stability compared to the alkanes can be attributed to the lower bond enthalpies of Si&#x0064;Si and Si&#x0064;H compared to C&#x0064;C and C&#x0064;H (<a href="#tab14.2">Table 14.2</a>). Silane itself, SiH<sub>4</sub>, is spontaneously flammable in air and reacts violently with halogens. This increased reactivity compared to hydrocarbons is attributed to the large atomic radius of Si, which leaves it open to attack by nucleophiles, the greater polarity of the Si&#x0064;H bond, and the availability of low-lying d orbitals, which may facilitate <a id="page_391" class="page">page 391, The Group 14 elements</a>the formation of adducts. Silane is a reducing agent in aqueous solution.

<p class="bh-boxtitle"><a id="box14.3"></a><b><span class="bh-bgg">BOX 14.3</span> Methane clathrates: fossil fuels from the ocean floor</b></p>
</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:1em;">Methane clathrates are crystalline solids formed at low temperatures when ice crystallizes around CH<sub>4</sub> molecules. Clathrates are also referred to as <i>methane hydrates</i> or <i>natural gas hydrates</i> and their formation has caused major problems in the past by clogging gas pipelines in cold climates. The hydrates may contain other small, gaseous molecules such as ethane and propene. Several different clathrate structures are known. The unit cell of the most common one, known as Structure I, contains 46 H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and up to eight CH<sub>4</sub> molecules. Recently, clathrates have received attention as a possible energy source because 1&#x2009;m<sup>3</sup> of clathrate liberates up to 164&#x2009;m<sup>3</sup> of methane gas.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Clathrates have been found under sediments on the ocean floors. They are thought to form by migration of methane from beneath the ocean floor along geological faults, followed by crystallization on contact with cold seawater. The methane in clathrates is also generated by bacterial degradation of organic matter in low-oxygen environments at the ocean floor. Where sedimentation rates and organic carbon levels are high, the water in the pores of the sediment is low in oxygen, and methane is produced by anaerobic bacteria. Below the zone of solid clathrates, large volumes of methane may occur as bubbles of free gas in the sediment. Methane hydrates are stable at low temperatures and high pressures. Because of these conditions and the need for relatively large amounts of organic matter for bacterial methanogenesis, clathrates are mainly restricted to high latitudes and along continental margins in the oceans. On the continental margins the supply of organic material is high enough to generate enough methane and water temperatures are close to freezing. In polar regions the gas hydrates are commonly linked to the occurrence of permafrost. The permafrost reservoir of methane has been estimated at about 400&#x2009;Gt of carbon in the Arctic, but no estimates have been made of possible Antarctic reservoirs. The oceanic reservoir has been estimated to be about 10 211&#x2009;Tt of carbon.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">In recent years, many governments have become very interested in the possible use of methane hydrates as fossil fuels. The realization that huge reservoirs of methane hydrates occur on the ocean floor and in permafrost regions has led to exploration and investigation of ways to use hydrates as an energy source. The USSR tried unsuccessfully to recover gas hydrates from permafrost reservoirs in the 1960s and 1970s. Not enough is known about how clathrate deposits occur in ocean sediments to be able to plan for their recovery, and drilling has been carried out in very few places.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The potential recovery of methane from clathrates is not without serious implications. As methane is a greenhouse gas, the discharge of large amounts of it into the atmosphere would increase global warming. Methane levels in the atmosphere were lower during glacial periods than during interglacial periods. Disturbances could destabilize sea-floor methane hydrates, triggering submarine landslides and huge releases of methane.</p></div>
<p class="bh-indentt" style="margin-top:2em;">Bonds between silicon and hydrogen are not readily hydrolysed in neutral water, but the reaction is rapid in strong acid or in the presence of traces of base. Similarly, alcoholysis is accelerated by catalytic amounts of alkoxide:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg391a.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">Kinetic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a structure in which OR<sup>&#x2212;</sup> attacks the Si atom while H<sub>2</sub> is being formed via a kind of H<sup>&#x2026;</sup>H hydrogen bond between hydridic and protic H atoms.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The silicon analogue of hydroboration (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#sec_13.6">Section 13.6c</a>) is <b>hydrosilylation</b>, the addition of SiH across the multiple bonds of alkenes and alkynes. This reaction, which is used in both industrial and laboratory syntheses, can be carried out under conditions (300&#x00B0;C or ultraviolet irradiation) that produce a radical intermediate. In practice, it is usually performed under far milder conditions by using a platinum complex as catalyst:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg391b.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The current view is that this reaction proceeds through an intermediate in which both the alkene and silane are attached to the Pt atom.</p>
<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-bottom:3em;">Silane is used in the production of semiconductor devices such as solar cells and in the hydrosilylation of alkenes; it is prepared commercially by the high-pressure reaction of hydrogen, silicon dioxide, and aluminium.</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">Carbon tetrafluoride is a colourless gas, CCl<sub>4</sub> is a dense liquid, CBr<sub>4</sub> is a pale yellow solid, and CI<sub>4</sub> is a red solid. The stabilities of the tetrahalomethanes decrease from CF<sub>4</sub> to CI<sub>4</sub> (<a href="#tab14.4">Table 14.4</a>). Carbon tetrafluoride is produced by burning any carbon-containing compound, including elemental carbon, in fluorine. The other tetrahalomethanes are prepared from methane and the halogen:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/equ392a.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">These tetrahalomethanes and analogous partially halogenated alkanes provide a route to a wide variety of derivatives, mainly by nucleophilic displacement of one or more halogen atoms. Some useful and interesting reactions from an inorganic perspective are outlined in <a href="#fig_14.9">Fig. 14.9</a>. Note in particular the metal&#x2013;carbon bond-forming reactions, which take place either by complete displacement of halogen or by oxidative addition.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The rates of nucleophilic displacement increase greatly from fluorine to iodine, and lie in the order F&#x226A;/Cl&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;Br&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;I. All tetrahalomethanes are thermodynamically unstable with respect to hydrolysis:</p>

<p class="bh-indent">Tetrahalomethanes can be reduced by strong reducing agents, such as alkali metals. For example, the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with sodium is highly exoergic:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">This reaction can occur with explosive violence with CCl<sub>4</sub> and other polyhalocarbons, so alkali metals such as sodium should never be used to dry them. Analogous reactions occur on the surface of poly(tetrafluoroethene) when it is exposed to alkali metals or strongly reducing organometallic compounds. Fluorocarbons, together with other fluorine-containing molecules, exhibit many interesting properties, such as high volatility and strong electron-withdrawing character (<a href="Chapter17.xhtml#box17.2">Box 17.2</a>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Carbon tetrachloride used to be used widely as a laboratory solvent and as a dry-cleaning fluid, refrigerant, and in fire extinguishers. Its use has declined steeply since the 1980s because it has been identified as a greenhouse gas and a carcinogen.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Because silicon can form hypervalent intermediates states, whereas carbon cannot, substitution reactions of silicon halides occur more readily than those of carbon halides.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Among the silicon tetrahalides, the most important is the tetrachloride, which is prepared by direct reaction of the elements or by chlorination of silica in the presence of carbon:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg393a.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Silicon and germanium halides are mild Lewis acids and add one or two ligands to yield five- or six-coordinate complexes:</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">The corresponding carbon tetrahalides are kinetically more resistant to hydrolysis because of the lack of access to the sterically shrouded C atom to form an intermediate aqua complex.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The substitution reactions of halosilanes have been studied extensively. The reactions are more facile than for their carbon analogues because a Si atom can readily expand its coordination sphere to accommodate the incoming nucleophile. The stereochemistry of these substitution reactions indicates that a five-coordinate intermediate is formed with the most electronegative substituents adopting the axial position. Moreover, substituents leave from the axial position. The H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion is a poor leaving group, and alkyl groups are even poorer:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg393d.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Note that, in these examples, the R<sup>4</sup> substituent replaces H with retention of configuration.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg393e.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Tin dihalides and tetrahalides are both well known. The tetrachloride, tetrabromide, and tetraiodide are molecular compounds, but the tetrafluoride is an ionic solid formed from close packing of SnF<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Lead tetrafluoride can be considered as an ionic solid but, as a manifestation of the inert-pair effect, PbCl<sub>4</sub> is an unstable, covalent, yellow oil that decomposes into PbCl<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Lead tetrabromide and tetraiodide are unknown, so the dihalides dominate the halogen compounds of lead. The arrangement of halogen atoms around the central metal atom in the dihalides of tin and lead often deviates from simple tetrahedral or octahedral coordination and is attributed to the presence of a stereochemically active lone pair. The tendency to achieve the distorted structure is more pronounced with the small F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion, and less distorted structures are observed with larger halides.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Both Sn(IV) and Sn(II) form a variety of complexes.

<p class="bh-indent">Carbon dioxide is one of several polyatomic molecules that are implicated in the <b>greenhouse effect</b>. In this effect, a polyatomic molecule in the atmosphere permits the passage of visible light but, because of its vibrational infrared absorptions, it blocks the immediate radiation of heat from the Earth. There is strong evidence for a significant increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> since the industrialization of society. In the past, nature has managed to stabilize the concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, in part by precipitation of calcium carbonate in the deep oceans, but it seems that the rate of diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> into the deep waters is too slow to compensate for the increased influx of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere (<a href="#box14.4">BOX 14.4</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara">The carbon cycle is of particular interest because all life on Earth is carbon-based. On a global scale, the biological carbon cycle cannot be discussed without also considering the oxygen cycle (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#box16.1">Box 16.1</a>). The intimate relation between the two cycles is shown in <a href="#figb_14.2">Fig. B14.2</a>. In recent decades the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere and its potential to cause climate change through an enhanced greenhouse effect have increased scientists&#x2019; focus on the carbon cycle.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Oxygen was not present when the Earth first cooled and liquid water first became available: CO<sub>2</sub> was the principal atmospheric gas. Early organisms used photosynthesis or <i>chemolithotropy</i> (inorganic reactions) to produce the energy needed to reduce carbon dioxide or hydrogencarbonate ions to the organic molecules needed for cellular function. The first photosynthetic organisms on the early Earth used very simple, non-O<sub>2</sub>-evolving forms of photosynthesis. Some of these nonoxygenic processes persist in modern bacteria, which use molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>S, S<sub>8</sub>, thiosulfate, H<sub>2</sub>, and organic acids to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>. As these molecules are in limited supply, non-O<sub>2</sub>-evolving photosynthesis is capable of reducing only a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="bh-boxparai">Later (in the last two billion years) photosynthetic processes that use water as the electron source, with O<sub>2</sub> as the by-product, have evolved. Once oxygenic photosynthesis evolved, planetary biomass could be produced and sustained at levels two to three orders of magnitude larger than previously.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Photosynthesis involves reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to organic compounds and oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub> (Sections 26.9 and 26.10). Oxygenic photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of higher plants, in a variety of algae, and in cyanobacteria. In effect, oxygenic photosynthesis produces O<sub>2</sub> produces O2 as a by-product of water splitting, the other product being &#x2018;H-atoms&#x2019; used to produce CO2. When this process first occurred, the evolved O<sub>2</sub> would have been a toxin, producing reactive oxygen species capable of destroying most contemporary biomolecules.</p>

<p class="bh-boxparai" style="margin-top:2em;">The mass balance of the biological cycle in <a href="#figb_14.2">Fig. B14.2</a> is not quantitatively complete. Whereas there is input of CO<sub>2</sub> from the eruption of volcanoes and consumption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the weathering of silicate solids, as far as oxygen and organic carbon are concerned there is no purely geochemical source. Therefore, for the cycle to be truly complete, no O<sub>2</sub> would ever accumulate: all the O<sub>2</sub> produced on the left side of the cycle by photosynthesis would be consumed on the right side by respiration and combustion. However, with each pass around the cycle, some of the reduced carbon biomass is buried in sediments, mostly land plants and algae in shallow marine basins and lakes. This small amount of buried biomass gradually becomes unavailable for oxidation, and some of it is transformed into hydrocarbon fossil fuels. Over geological time scales this buried reduced organic matter accumulates and is converted into the coal, shale, oil, and natural gas that constitute our fossil fuel reserves.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Over hundreds of millions of years, the process that created our fossil fuel reserves also formed the O<sub>2</sub> of the atmosphere and helped to decrease the initially high level of CO<sub>2</sub>. The global accumulation of O<sub>2</sub> was slow on the early Earth on account of the vast amounts of iron(II) present in the oceans. This iron was oxidized by the O<sub>2</sub>, yielding insoluble iron(III) compounds which precipitated, giving banded iron(III) formations. Once the iron(II) and reduced sulfur were consumed, O<sub>2</sub> began to accumulate in the atmosphere, achieving roughly modern levels about 1&#x2009;Ga ago.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Currently, we are extracting and burning fossil fuels on a geologically very short time scale, thereby disturbing the relationship between oxygen and carbon. The combustion reactions are obviously the major factor, but some oil or gas reaches the surface through natural and human activities. The oil or gas that is not burned can be biodegraded to produce CO<sub>2</sub> and complete the carbon cycle shown in <a href="#figb_14.3">Fig. B14.3</a>. The biodegradation is carried out by aerobic organisms that, almost exclusively, use iron-dependent enzymes.</p>

<p class="bh-noindentt">There is convincing evidence for increasing concentrations of the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and chlorofluorocarbons, and it is clear that they are having an impact on global temperatures. One proposed method of slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is <b>carbon dioxide sequestration</b> (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box_14.5">Box 14.5</a>), in which CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from industrial flues by reaction with amines. It is then released and liquefied by compression and pumped underground, often back into gas or oil wells in order to drive out further oil or gas. This technology is currently very expensive and is yet to be implemented in any large-scale power stations.</p>

</div>
<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:1em;">The increasing use of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has lead to an increase in atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub> which is contributing to the greenhouse effect and the associated climate change. Finding ways to minimize increases in the levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century. Our reliance on carbon-based fossil fuels could be reduced by using energy more efficiently and reducing our consumption. Alternatively, our use of low-carbon fuels such as nuclear and renewable energies could be increased.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Another way of managing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is by carbon dioxide sequestration. This refers to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its long-term storage underground. Major sources of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are coal and gas-fired power stations. A typical new 1&#x2009;GW coal-fired power station produces around 6&#x2009;Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> annually. Adding CO<sub>2</sub> capture scrubbers to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas can significantly reduce these emissions. One process uses aqueous solutions of various amines to remove CO<sub>2</sub> (and H<sub>2</sub>S) from gases. The CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with the amines to form solid ammonium carbamate, NH<sub>2</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub>. One of the problems with this process is that the aqueous phase evaporates in the gas stream. However, new nonvolatile CO<sub>2</sub>-capture materials have been developed. One approach is to produce ionic liquids with an attached amine group. These low-temperature molten ionic salts react reversibly with CO<sub>2</sub>, do not need water to function, and can be recycled.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Although these technologies are known they are not yet being implemented in power stations. Carbon dioxide sequestration reduces the power output of power plants by 25&#x2013;40 per cent and would increase the cost of energy production by 20&#x2013;90 per cent in purpose-built facilities, and by even more in existing power plants.</p></div>
<p class="bh-indent">The principal chemical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are summarized in <a href="#fig_14.11">Fig. 14.11</a>. From an economic perspective, an important reaction is CO<sub>2</sub> with ammonia to yield ammonium carbonate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which at elevated temperatures is converted directly to urea, CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, a fertilizer, a feed supplement for cattle, and a chemical intermediate. Another important use of CO<sub>2</sub> is in the soft-drinks industry, where it dissolves under <a id="page_396" class="page">page 396, The Group 14 elements</a>pressure to give a pleasant acidic taste of carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and comes out of solution in the form of bubbles when the pressure is released. In organic chemistry, a common synthetic reaction is that between CO<sub>2</sub> and carbanion reagents to produce carboxylic acids. In the crucial biological process known as the <i>Calvin cycle</i>, CO<sub>2</sub> is &#x2018;fixed&#x2019; (to the extent of 100&#x2009;Gt per year) into organic molecules by reaction with the electron-rich C&#x003D;C double bond of a pentose enolate ligand coordinated to a Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion in the enzyme known as &#x2018;Rubisco&#x2019; (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.9">Chapter 26.9</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The complicated silicate structures are often easier to comprehend if the tetrahedral SiO<sub>4</sub> unit from which they are built is drawn as a tetrahedron with the Si atom at the centre and O atoms at the vertices. The representation is often cut to the bone by drawing the SiO<sub>4</sub> unit as a simple tetrahedron with the atoms omitted. Each terminal O atom contributes &#x2212;1 to the charge of the SiO<sub>4</sub> unit, but each shared O atom contributes 0. Thus, orthosilicate is [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> (<b>1</b>), disilicate is [O<sub>3</sub>SiOSiO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>6&#x2212;</sup> (<b>2</b>), and the SiO<sub>2</sub> unit of silica has no net charge because all the O atoms are shared.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">With these principles of charge balance in mind, it should be clear that an endless single-stranded chain or a ring of SiO<sub>4</sub> units, which has two shared O atoms for each Si atom, will have the formula and charge [(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>]<sub><i>n</i></sub>. An example of a compound containing such a cyclic metasilicate ion is the mineral <i>beryl</i>, Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>, which contains the [Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>]<sup>12&#x2212;</sup> ion (<b>15</b>).

<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:2em;">The composition of silicate glasses has a strong influence on their physical properties. For example, fused quartz (amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub>) softens at about 1300&#x00B0;C, borosilicate glass (which contains boron oxide; <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#sec_13.8">Section 13.8</a>) softens at about 800&#x00B0;C, and soda-lime glass softens at even lower temperatures. The variation in softening point can be understood by appreciating that the Si&#x0064;O&#x0064;Si links in silicate glasses form the framework that imparts rigidity. When basic oxides such as Na<sub>2</sub>O and CaO are incorporated (as in soda-lime glass), they react with the SiO<sub>2</sub> melt and convert Si&#x0064;O&#x0064;Si links into terminal SiO groups and hence lower its softening temperature. Very different properties are found for the &#x0064;Si&#x0064;O&#x0064;Si &#x0064;backbone of silicone polymers, which are described later in this chapter.</p>

The structure of germanium(IV) oxide, GeO<sub>2</sub>, is based on tetrahedral four-coordinate GeO<sub>4</sub> units.

<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:1em;">Asbestos (from the Greek words for &#x2018;not quenchable&#x2019;, in contrast to quicklime) is a generic term that applies to six types of naturally occurring mineral fibres. Only three of these have found commercial applications. White asbestos, or chrysotile, has the formula Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> and has a sheet silicate structure. When viewed under a microscope the fibres appear as a tangled mass. Brown asbestos, amosite, and blue asbestos, crocidolite, are amphiboles. Amphiboles have a double-chain silicate structure and appear as individual needles when viewed under a microscope.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">All the fibres have properties that have made them very attractive in a range of industrial and domestic applications. These properties include thermal stability, heat resistance, nonbiodegradability, resistance to attack by a wide range of chemicals, and low electrical conductivity. Asbestos is most often used for its thermal properties or for matrix reinforcement. The first recorded use of asbestos was in 2000 BCE in Finland, where it was used to reinforce clay pottery. Marco Polo used asbestos fibres as a flame-resistant material. Demand for asbestos grew during the Industrial Revolution, and by 1900 asbestos&#x2013;cement sheets were being widely produced for use in construction. World production grew throughout the twentieth century until the 1960s, when health problems associated with exposure to asbestos led to a reduction in or ban on its use. The health effects of asbestos are respiratory disease associated with inhalation of long, thin fibres. Asbestos is responsible for asbestosis, which is lung fibrosis resulting from long-term, high-level exposure; lung cancer, which often accompanies asbestosis; and mesothelioma, which is a rare cancer of the lining of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The impact on health of each type of asbestos is not the same. The most harmful varieties are the needle-like amphiboles.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">Where asbestos is still used today it is held within a matrix such as cement or organic resins. Asbestos substitutes in thermal insulation applications include glass fibre and vermiculite. In fibre&#x2013;cement applications cellulose fibre or synthetic fibres such as polypropylene are used.</p></div>

In some respects the toxicity of the CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion is similar to that of the isoelectronic CO molecule because both form complexes with iron porphyrin molecules. However, whereas CO attaches to the Fe in haemoglobin and causes oxygen starvation, CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> targets the Fe in the active site of cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (the enzyme in mitochondria that reduces oxygen to water), which results in a rapid and catastrophic collapse of energy production.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">The direct reaction of Si and N<sub>2</sub> at high temperatures produces silicon nitride, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. This substance is very hard and inert, and is used in high-temperature ceramic materials. Current industrial research projects focus on the use of suitable organosilicon&#x2013;nitrogen compounds that might undergo pyrolysis to yield silicon nitride fibres and other shapes. Trisilylamine, (H<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>N, the silicon analogue of trimethylamine, has very low Lewis basicity. It has a planar structure, or is fluxional with a very low barrier to inversion. The low basicity and planar structure have traditionally been attributed to d-orbital participation in bonding, allowing sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization around the N atom and delocalization of the lone pair through &#x03C0; bonding. However, quantum mechanical calculations indicate that, whereas d orbitals play a role in delocalization, they are not responsible for the planar structure. Because the electronegativity of Si is lower than that of C, the Si&#x0064;N bond is more polar than the C&#x0064;N bond. This difference leads to long-range electrostatic repulsion between the silyl groups in trisilylamine and hence a planar structure.</p>

<p class="bh-boxparai">In its fully charged state, the active material on the cathode is PbO<sub>2</sub> and at the anode it is lead metal; the electrolyte is dilute sulfuric acid. One feature of this arrangement is that the lead-containing reactants and products at both electrodes are insoluble. When the cell is producing current, the reaction at the cathode is the reduction of Pb(IV) as PbO<sub>2</sub> to Pb(II), which in the presence of sulfuric acid is deposited on the electrode as insoluble PbSO<sub>4</sub>:</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Metal&#x2013;carbon compounds of highly electropositive metals are saline; nonmetal carbides are mechanically hard and are semiconductors.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Saline carbides of the Group 1 and 2 metals may be divided into three subcategories: <b>graphite intercalation compounds</b>, such as KC<sub>8</sub>, <b>dicarbides</b> (or &#x2018;acetylides&#x2019;), which contain the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>C</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>  anion, and <b>methides</b>, which formally contain the C<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> anion.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Graphite intercalation compounds are formed by the Group 1 metals (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.12">Section 11.12</a>). They are formed by a redox process, and specifically by the reaction of graphite with alkali metal vapour or with metal&#x2013;ammonia solution. For example, contact between graphite and potassium vapour in a sealed tube at 300&#x00B0;C leads to the formation of KC<sub>8</sub> in which the alkali metal ions lie in an ordered array between the graphite sheets (<a href="#fig_14.14">Fig. 14.14</a>). A series of alkali metal&#x2013;graphite intercalation compounds can be prepared with different metal:carbon ratios, including KC<sub>8</sub> and KC<sub>16</sub>.</p>

Some dicarbides have a structure related to rock salt, but replacement of the spherical Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion by the elongated [C&#x2261;C]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion leads to an elongation of the crystal along one axis, and a resulting tetragonal symmetry (<a href="#fig_14.15">Fig. 14.15</a>).

<p class="bh-noindent">The formation of graphite intercalation compounds is another example of a direct reaction, but is carried out at much lower temperatures.

<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg400b.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">This reaction occurs under mild conditions and leaves the carbon&#x2013;carbon bonds of the starting material intact. As the ethyne molecule is a very weak Br&#x00F8;nsted acid (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;25), the reaction can be regarded as a redox reaction between a highly active metal and a weak acid to yield H<sub>2</sub> (with H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> the oxidizing agent) and the metal dicarbide.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The saline dicarbides and methides have high electron density on the C atom, so they are readily oxidized and protonated. For example, calcium dicarbide reacts with the weak acid water to produce ethyne:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg400c.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(c) Metallic carbides</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> d-Metal carbides are often hard materials with the carbon atom octahedrally surrounded by metal atoms.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">The d metals provide the largest class of carbides. Examples are Co<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>C and Fe<sub>3</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>C. They are sometimes referred to as <b>interstitial carbides</b> because it was long thought that the structures were the same as those of the metals and that they were formed by the insertion of C atoms in octahedral holes. In fact, the structure of the metal and the metal carbide often differ. For example, tungsten metal has a body-centred structure whereas tungsten carbide (WC) is hexagonal close-packed. The name &#x2018;interstitial carbide&#x2019; gives the erroneous impression that the metallic carbides are not legitimate compounds. In fact the hardness and other properties of metallic carbides demonstrate that strong metal&#x2013;carbon bonding is present in them. Some of these carbides are economically and technologically useful materials. Tungsten carbide (WC), for example, is used for cutting tools and high-pressure apparatus such as that used to produce diamond. Cementite, Fe<sub>3</sub>C, is a major constituent of steel and cast iron.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Metallic carbides of composition MC have an fcc or hcp arrangement of metal atoms with the C atoms in the octahedral holes. The fcc arrangement results in a rock-salt structure. The C atoms in carbides of composition M<sub>2</sub>C occupy only half the octahedral holes between the close-packed metal atoms. A C atom in an octahedral hole is formally <b>hypercoordinate</b> (that is, has an untypically high coordination number) because it is surrounded by six metal atoms. However, the bonding can be expressed in terms of delocalized molecular orbitals formed from the C2s and C2p orbitals and the d orbitals (and perhaps other valence orbitals) of the surrounding metal atoms.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">It has been found empirically that the formation of simple compounds in which the C atom resides in an octahedral hole of a close-packed structure occurs when <i>r</i><sub>C</sub>/<i>r</i><sub>M</sub>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;0.59, where <i>r</i><sub>C</sub> is the covalent radius of C and <i>r</i><sub>M</sub> is the metallic radius of M. This relationship also applies to metal compounds containing nitrogen or oxygen.</p>

<p class="bh-noindente"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Boron and silicon form the very hard B<sub>4</sub>C and SiC.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindentt">Silicon and boron form metalloid carbides. Boron carbide is an extremely hard ceramic material that is used in tank armour, bulletproof vests, and many industrial applications such as cutting tools and wear-resistant coatings. It is also used as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors. Boron carbide is prepared by the reduction of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with carbon in an electric arc furnace:</p>

A better representation is B<sub>12</sub>C<sub>3</sub>, with the electron deficiency being explained by the presence of B<sub>12</sub>B<sub>2</sub> units. The rationale for this representation of the compound is clear when the structure is considered. Boron carbide has rhombohedral arrangement of icosahedral B<sub>12</sub> units surrounding a C&#x0064;B&#x0064;C chain (Fig. 4.16). When SiO<sub>2</sub> is heated with carbon, CO is evolved and silicon carbide, SiC, forms. This very hard material is widely used as the abrasive <i>carborundum</i>. Grains of SiC can be bonded together by high-temperature treatment to form hard ceramics which are used as car brakes, car clutches, and in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide include light-emitting diodes and high-temperature and high-voltage semiconductors. <a id="page_401" class="page">page 401, The Group 14 elements</a>Silicon carbide exists in over 200 different crystalline forms.

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Silicon, like its neighbours boron and carbon, forms a wide variety of binary compounds with metals. Some of these <b>silicides</b> contain isolated Si atoms. The structure of ferrosilicon, Fe<sub>3</sub>Si, for instance, which plays an important role in steel manufacture, can be viewed as an fcc array of Fe atoms with some atoms replaced by Si.

<h3 class="bh-h3"><span class="bh-nor">14.15</span> Extended silicon&#x2013;oxygen compounds</h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">As well as forming simple binary compounds with oxygen, silicon forms a wide range of extended network solids that find a range of applications in industry. Aluminosilicates occur naturally as clays, minerals, and rocks. Zeolite aluminosilicates are widely used as molecular sieves, catalysts, and catalyst support materials. These compounds are discussed further in <a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapters 24</a> and <a href="Chapter25.xhtml">25</a>.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4">(a) Aluminosilicates</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> Aluminium may replace silicon in a silicate framework to form an aluminosilicate. The brittle, layered aluminosilicates are the primary constituents of clay and some common minerals.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Even greater structural diversity than that displayed by the silicates themselves is possible when Al atoms replace some of the Si atoms. The resulting aluminosilicates are largely responsible for the rich variety of the mineral world. We have already seen that in &#x03B3;-alumina, Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are present in both octahedral and tetrahedral holes (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>). This versatility carries over into the aluminosilicates, where Al may substitute for Si in tetrahedral sites, enter an octahedral environment external to the silicate framework, or, more rarely, occur with other coordination numbers. Because aluminium occurs as Al(III), its presence in place of Si(IV) in an aluminosilicate renders the overall charge negative by one unit. An additional cation, such as H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or half as many Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, is therefore required for each Al atom that replaces a Si atom. As we shall see, these additional cations have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Many important minerals are varieties of layered aluminosilicates that also contain metals such as Li, Mg, and Fe: they include clays, talc, and various micas. In one class of layered aluminosilicate the repeating unit consists of a silicate layer with the structure shown in <a href="Chapter14.xhtml#fig_14.17">Fig. 14.17</a>. An example of a simple aluminosilicate of this type (simple, that is, in the sense of there being no additional elements) is the mineral <i>kaolinite</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which is used commercially as <i>china clay</i>. The electrically neutral layers are held together by rather weak hydrogen bonds, so the mineral readily cleaves and incorporates water between the layers.</p>

When M is Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and the anions in the bottom layers are replaced by an OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> group this structure is close to that of the 1:1 clay mineral kaolinite.</p>
<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:2em;">A larger class of aluminosilicates has Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions sandwiched between silicate layers (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#fig_14.18">Fig. 14.18</a>). One such mineral is <i>pyrophyllite</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>. The mineral <i>talc</i>, Mg<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, is obtained when three Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions replace two Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions in the octahedral sites. As remarked earlier, in talc (and in pyrophyllite) the repeating layers are neutral, and as a result talc readily cleaves between them. <i>Muscovite mica</i>, KAl<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>AlO<sub>10</sub>, has charged layers because one Al(III) atom substitutes for one Si(IV) atom in the pyrophyllite structure. The resulting negative charge is compensated by a K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion that lies between the repeating layers and results in greater hardness.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">There are many minerals based on a three-dimensional aluminosilicate framework. The <i>feldspars</i>, for instance, which are the most important class of rock-forming minerals (and contribute to granite), belong to this class. The aluminosilicate frameworks of feldspars are built up by sharing all vertices of <a id="page_402" class="page">page 402, The Group 14 elements</a>SiO<sub>4</sub> or AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. The cavities in this three-dimensional network accommodate ions such as K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Two examples are the feldspars <i>orthoclase</i>, KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and <i>albite</i>, NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> Zeolite aluminosilicates have large open cavities or channels, giving rise to useful properties such as ion exchange and molecular absorption.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1.5em;">The molecular sieves are crystalline aluminosilicates having open structures with apertures of molecular dimensions. These &#x2018;microporous&#x2019; substances, which include the zeolites in which cations (typically from Groups 1 or 2) are trapped in an aluminosilicate framework, represent a major triumph of solid-state chemistry, for their synthesis and our understanding of their properties combine challenging determinations of structures, imaginative synthetic chemistry, and important practical applications. The cages are defined by the crystal structure, so they are highly regular and of precise size. Consequently, molecular sieves capture molecules with greater selectivity than high-surface-area solids such as silica gel or activated carbon, where molecules may be caught in irregular voids between the small particles.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Zeolites are used for shape-selective heterogeneous catalysis. For example, the molecular sieve ZSM-5 is used to synthesize 1,4-dimethylbenzene (<i>o</i>-xylene) for use as an octane booster in petrol. The other xylenes are not produced because the catalytic process is controlled by the size and shape of the zeolite cages and tunnels. This and other applications are summarized in <a href="#tab14.6">Table 14.6</a> and discussed in <a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapters 24</a> and <a href="Chapter25.xhtml">25</a>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Synthetic procedures have added to the many naturally occurring zeolite varieties and have produced zeolites that have specific cage sizes and specific chemical properties within the cages. These synthetic zeolites are sometimes made at atmospheric pressure, but more often they are produced in a high-pressure autoclave. Their open structures seem to form around hydrated cations or other large cations such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NR</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>  ions introduced into the reaction mixture. For example, a synthesis may be performed by heating colloidal silica to 100&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;200&#x00B0;C in an autoclave with an aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide. The microcrystalline product, which has the typical composition [N(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]OH(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>48</sub>, is converted into the zeolite by burning away the C, H, and N of the quaternary ammonium cation at 500&#x00B0;C in air. Aluminosilicate zeolites are made by including high-surface-area alumina in the starting materials.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">A wide range of zeolites has been prepared with varying cage and bottleneck sizes (<a href="#tab14.7">Table 14.7</a>). Their structures are based on approximately tetrahedral MO<sub>4</sub> units, which in the great majority of cases are SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub>. Because the structures involve many such tetrahedral units, it is common practice to abandon the polyhedral representation in favour of one that emphasizes the position of the Si and Al atoms. In this scheme, the Si or Al atom lies at the intersection of four line segments and the O atom bridge lies on the line segment (<a href="#fig_14.19">Fig. 14.19</a>). This <b>framework representation</b> has the advantage of giving a clear impression of the shapes of the cages and channels in the zeolite. Some examples are illustrated in <a href="#fig_14.20">Fig. 14.20</a>.</p>

<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-bottom:2em;">The important zeolites have structures that are based on the &#x2018;sodalite cage&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_14.3">Fig. 14.3</a>), a truncated octahedron formed by slicing off each vertex of an octahedron (<b>18</b>). The truncation leaves a square face in the place of each vertex and the triangular faces of the octahedron are transformed into regular <a id="page_403" class="page">page 403, The Group 14 elements</a>hexagons. The substance known as &#x2018;zeolite type A&#x2019; is based on sodalite cages that are joined by O bridges between the square faces. Eight such sodalite cages are linked in a cubic pattern with a large central cavity called an <b>&#x03B1;-cage</b>. The &#x03B1;-cages share octagonal faces, with an open diameter of 420&#x2009;pm. Thus H<sub>2</sub>O or other small molecules can fill them and diffuse through octagonal faces. However, these faces are too small to permit the entry of molecules with van der Waals diameters larger than 420&#x2009;pm.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;"><img src="../images/pg403a.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-indent">The charge on the aluminosilicate zeolite framework is neutralized by cations lying within the cages. In the type-A zeolite, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions are present and the formula is Na<sub>12</sub>(AlO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>12</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>12</sub>&#x22C5;<i>x</i>H<sub>2</sub>O. Numerous other ions, including d-block cations and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>  can be introduced by ion exchange with aqueous solutions. Zeolites are therefore used for water softening and as a component of laundry detergent to remove the di- and tri-positive ions that decrease the effectiveness of the surfactant. Zeolites have in part replaced polyphosphates because the latter, which are plant nutrients, find their way into natural waters and stimulate the growth of algae.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">In addition to the control of properties by selecting a zeolite with the appropriate cage and bottleneck size, the zeolite can be chosen for its affinity for polar or nonpolar molecules according to its polarity (<a href="#tab14.7">Table 14.7</a>). The aluminosilicate zeolites, which always contain charge-compensating ions, have high affinities for polar molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub>. By contrast, the nearly pure silica molecular sieves bear no net electric charge and are nonpolar to the point of being mildly hydrophobic. Another group of hydrophobic zeolites is based on the <a id="page_404" class="page">page 404, The Group 14 elements</a>aluminium phosphate frameworks; AlPO<sub>4</sub> is isoelectronic with Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and the framework is similarly uncharged.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">One interesting aspect of zeolite chemistry is that large molecules can be synthesized from smaller molecules inside the zeolite cage. The result is like a ship in a bottle because, once assembled, the molecule is too big to escape. For example, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions in a Y-type zeolite may be replaced by Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions (by ion exchange). The resulting Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;Y zeolite is heated with phthalonitrile, which diffuses into the zeolite and condenses around the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion to form iron phthalocyanine (<b>19</b>), which remains imprisoned in the cage.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><span class="bh-red"><b>Key point:</b></span> <b>Methylchlorosilanes are important starting materials for the manufacture of silicone polymers; the properties of silicone polymers are determined by the degree of cross-linking and may be liquids, gels, or resins. The tetraalkyl and tetraaryl germanium(IV) compounds are chemically and thermally stable.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent"  style="margin-top:1em;">All silicon tetraalkyls and tetraaryls are monomeric with a tetrahedral Si centre. The C&#x0064;Si bond is strong and the compounds are fairly stable. Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> is unreactive in contrast to Si(SiH3)<sub>4.</sub> The unreactive Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> group is widely used in organic synthesis when an unreactive, sterically demanding group is required. The tetraalkyls and tetraaryls can be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are shown below:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg404e.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<p class="bh-noindent">The <i>Rochow process</i> provides a cost-effective industrial route to methylchlorosilane, which is an important starting material in the manufacture of silicones:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg404b.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">These methylchlorosilanes, Me<sub><i>n</i></sub>SiCl<sub>4&#x2212;<i>n</i></sub>, where <i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;3, can be hydrolysed to form silicones or polysiloxanes:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/pg404c.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The reaction yields oligomers that contain the tetrahedral silicon group and oxygen atoms that form Si&#x0064;O&#x0064;Si bridges. Hydrolysis of Me<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub> produces chains or rings and the hydrolysis of MeSiCl<sub>3</sub> produces a cross-linked polymer (<a href="#fig_14.21">Fig. 14.21</a>). It is interesting to note that most silicon polymers are based on a Si&#x0064;O&#x0064;Si backbone, whereas carbon polymers are generally based on a C&#x0064;C backbone, reflecting the strengths of the Si&#x0064;O and C&#x0064;C bonds (<a href="#tab14.2">Table 14.2</a>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Silicone polymers have a range of structures and uses. Their properties depend on the degree of polymerization and cross-linking, which are influenced by the choice and mix of reactants, and the use of dehydrating agents such as sulfuric acid and elevated temperatures. The liquid silicones are more stable than hydrocarbon oils. Moreover, unlike hydrocarbons, their viscosity changes only slightly with temperature. Thus silicones are used as lubricants and wherever inert fluids are needed, for example in hydraulic braking systems. Silicones are very hydrophobic and are used in water-repellent sprays for shoes and other items. The lower molar mass silicones are essential in personal-care products such as shampoos, conditioners, shaving foams, hair gels, and toothpastes, and impart to them a &#x2018;silky&#x2019; feel. At the other end of the spectrum of delicacy, silicone greases, oils, and resins are used as sealants, lubricants, varnishes, waterproofing, synthetic rubbers, prosthetic implants, and hydraulic fluids. The liquid decamethycyclopentasiloxane is becoming increasingly popular as an environmentally friendly dry-cleaning fluid. It is odourless, nontoxic, and decomposes to SiO<sub>2</sub> with traces of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Organogermanium (IV) compounds occur as the tetrahedral R<sub>4</sub>Ge molecules. They can be synthesized using similar reactions to those for forming organosilicon compounds:</p>

Their use is limited because of the high cost of germanium, but tetramethyl and tetraethylgermanium are used in the microelectronics industry as precursors for GeO<sub>2</sub> chemical deposition. Germanium also forms organogermanium(II) compounds. The germylenes, R<sub>2</sub>Ge, are stabilized by very bulky R groups; thus, dimethylgermylene, <a id="page_405" class="page">page 405, The Group 14 elements</a>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ge, is very unstable whereas bis(2,4,6-tertiarybutylphenyl)germylene <b>(20)</b> is stable.

<p class="bh-noindent"><span class="bh-red"><b>Key point:</b></span> <b> Tin and lead form tetravalent organo compounds; organotin compounds are used as fungicides and pesticides</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Many organometallic compounds of Group 14 are of great commercial importance, although the use of lead is illegal in many parts of the world, owing to its toxicity. Organotin compounds are used to stabilize poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as antifouling agents on ships, as wood preservatives, and as pesticides. Generally, organometallic compounds of the group are tetravalent and have low polarity bonds. Their stability decreases from silicon to lead.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Organotin compounds differ from organosilicon and organogermanium compounds in several ways. There is a greater occurrence of the &#x002B;2 oxidation state, a greater range of coordination numbers, and halide bridges are often present. Most organotin compounds are colourless liquids or solids that are stable to air and water. The structures of R<sub>4</sub>Sn compounds are all similar, with a tetrahedral tin atom (<b>21</b>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;"><img src="../images/pg405b.jpg" alt="images"/></figure> 
<p class="bh-indent">The halide derivatives, R<sub>3</sub>SnX, often contain Sn&#x0064;X&#x0064;Sn bridges and form chain structures. The presence of bulky R groups may affect the shape. For example, in (SnFMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> (<b>22</b>), the Sn&#x0064;F&#x0064;Sn backbone is in a zigzag arrangement, in Ph<sub>3</sub>SnF the chain has straightened, and (Me<sub>3</sub>SiC)Ph<sub>2</sub>SnF is a monomer. The haloalkyls are more reactive than the tetraalkyls and are useful in the synthesis of tetraalkyl derivatives.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;"><img src="../images/pg405c.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-indent">Alkyltin compounds may be prepared in a variety of ways, including by using a Grignard reagent and by metathesis:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;"><img src="../images/pg405g.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">Organotin compounds have the widest range of uses of all main-group organometallic compounds, and their annual worldwide industrial production exceeds 50&#x2009;kt. Their major application is in the stabilization of PVC plastics. Without the additive, halogenated polymers are rapidly degraded by heat, light, and atmospheric oxygen to give discoloured, brittle products. The tin stabilizers scavenge labile Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions that initiate the loss of HCl, the first step in the degradation process. Organotin compounds also have a wide range of applications relating to their biocidal <?Page pageId="406"?>effects. They are used as fungicides, algaecides, wood preservatives, and antifouling agents. However, their widespread use on boats to prevent fouling and attachment of barnacles has caused environmental concerns as high levels of organotin compounds kill some species of marine life and affect the growth and reproduction of others. Many nations now restrict the use of organotin compounds to vessels over 25&#x2009;m long.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Tetraethyl lead used to be made on a huge scale as an antiknock agent in petrol. However, concerns about the levels of lead in the environment have led to it being phased out. Alkyllead compounds, R<sub>4</sub>Pb, can be made in the laboratory by using a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound:</p>
<p class="bh-indenttb"><img src="../images/pg405h.jpg" alt="images"/> </p>
<p class="bh-noindent">They are all monomeric molecules with tetrahedral geometry around the Pb atom. The halide derivatives may contain bridging halide atoms to form chains. Monomers are favoured by more bulky organic substituents. For example, Pb(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl exists as a chain structure with bridging Cl atoms (<b>23</b>), whereas the mesityl derivative Pb(Me<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl is a monomer.</p>
