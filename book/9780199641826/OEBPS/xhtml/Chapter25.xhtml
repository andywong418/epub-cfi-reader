<p class="la-noindent"><b>In this chapter we apply the concepts of organometallic chemistry, coordination chemistry, and materials chemistry to catalysis. We emphasize general principles, such as the nature of catalytic cycles, in which a catalytic species or surface is regenerated in a reaction, and the delicate balance of reactions required for a successful cycle. We see that there are numerous requirements for a successful catalytic process: the reaction being catalysed must be thermodynamically favourable and fast enough when catalysed; the catalyst must have an appropriate selectivity towards the desired product and a lifetime long enough to be economical. We then survey homogeneously catalysed reactions and show how proposals about mechanisms are invoked. The final part of the chapter develops a similar theme in heterogeneous catalysis, and we shall see that many parallels exist between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. In neither type of catalysis are mechanisms necessarily finally settled, and there is still considerable scope for making new discoveries.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="la-noindent">A <b>catalyst</b> is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction but is not itself consumed. Catalysts are widely used in nature, in industry, and in the laboratory, and it is estimated that they contribute to one-sixth of the value of all manufactured goods in industrialized countries. As shown in <a href="#tab_25.1">Table 25.1</a>, 16 of the top 20 synthetic chemicals in the US are produced directly or indirectly by catalysis. For example, a key step in the production of a dominant industrial chemical, sulfuric acid, is the catalytic oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>3</sub>. Ammonia, another chemical essential for industry and agriculture, is produced by the catalytic reduction of N<sub>2</sub> by H<sub>2</sub>. Inorganic catalysts are also used for the production of the major organic chemicals and petroleum products, such as fuels, petrochemicals, and polyalkene plastics. Catalysts play a steadily increasing role in achieving a cleaner environment, through, for example, the destruction of pollutants (as with the catalytic converters found on the exhaust systems of vehicles), the development of better industrial processes that are more efficient with higher product yields and fewer unwanted by-products, and in clean-energy generation in fuel cells. Industrially important catalysts are almost invariably inorganic (which justifies their discussion in this book). Enzymes, a class of biochemical catalysts, often with a metal ion at the centre of a complex molecule, are discussed in <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#ch26">Chapter 26</a>.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In addition to their economic importance and contribution to the quality of life, catalysts are interesting in their own right: the subtle influence a catalyst has on reagents can completely change the outcome of a reaction. The understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic reactions has improved considerably in recent years with the greater availability of isotopically labelled molecules, improved methods for determining reaction rates, improved spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, and much more reliable molecular orbital calculations.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3a"><b>General principles</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">A catalysed reaction is faster than an uncatalysed version of the same reaction because the catalyst provides a different reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. The term <i>negative catalyst</i> is sometimes applied to substances that retard reactions. Substances that block one or more elementary steps in a catalytic reaction are called <b>catalyst poisons</b>.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3"><b>25.1 The language of catalysis</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">Before we discuss the mechanism of catalytic reactions, we need to introduce some of the terminology used to describe the rate of a catalytic reaction and its mechanism.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(a) Energetics</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> A catalyst increases the rates of processes by introducing new pathways with lower Gibbs energies of activation; the reaction profile contains no high peaks and no deep troughs.</b></p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:2em;"><span class="la-red"><b>Figure 25.1</b></span> Schematic representation of the energetics of a catalytic cycle. The uncatalysed reaction (a) has a higher &#x0394;<sup>&#x2021;</sup><i>G</i> than a step in the catalysed reaction (b). The Gibbs energy of the overall reaction, &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup>, is the same for routes (a) and (b). The curve (c) shows the profile for a reaction mechanism with an intermediate that is more stable than the product.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="la-noindent">A catalyst increases the rates of processes by introducing new pathways with lower Gibbs energies of activation, &#x0394;<sup>&#x2021;</sup><i>G</i>. We need to focus on the Gibbs energy profile of a catalytic reaction, not just the enthalpy or energy profile, because the new elementary steps that occur in the catalysed process are likely to have quite different entropies of activation. A catalyst does not affect the Gibbs energy of the overall reaction, &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup>, because <i>G</i> is a state function.<sup><a id="ich25fn1"></a><a href="#ch25fn1">1</a></sup> The difference is illustrated in <a href="#fig_25.1">Fig. 25.1</a>, where the overall reaction Gibbs energy is the same in both energy profiles. Reactions that are thermodynamically unfavourable cannot be made favourable by a catalyst.</p>
<p class="la-footnote"><sup><a id="ch25fn1"></a><a href="#ich25fn1">1</a></sup> That is, <i>G</i> depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path that led to the state.</p>
<p class="la-noindent"><a href="#fig_25.1">Figure 25.1</a> also shows that the Gibbs energy profile of a catalysed reaction contains no high peaks and no deep troughs. The new pathway introduced by the catalyst changes the mechanism of the reaction to one with a very different shape and with lower maxima. However, an equally important point is that stable or nonlabile catalytic intermediates do not occur in the cycle. Similarly, the product must be released in a thermodynamically favourable step. If, as shown by the blue line in <a href="#fig_25.1">Fig. 25.1</a>, a stable complex were formed with the catalyst, it would turn out to be the product of the reaction and the cycle would terminate. Similarly, impurities may suppress catalysis, by coordinating strongly to catalytically active sites, and act as catalyst poisons. <a id="page_730" class="page">Page 730, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a></p>



<h4 class="la-h4">(b) Catalytic cycles</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> A catalytic cycle is a sequence of reactions that consumes the reactants and forms products, with the catalytic species being regenerated after the cycle.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">The essence of catalysis is a cycle of reactions in which the reactants are consumed, the products are formed, and the catalytic species is regenerated. A simple example of a catalytic cycle involving a homogeneous catalyst is the isomerization of prop-2-en-1-ol (allyl alcohol, CH<sub>2</sub>&#x005D;CHCH<sub>2</sub>OH) to prop-1-en-1-ol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH&#x005D;CHOH) with the catalyst [Co(CO)<sub>3</sub>H]. The first step is the coordination of the reactant to the catalyst. That complex isomerizes in the coordination sphere of the catalyst and goes on to release the product and reform the catalyst (<a href="#fig_25.2">Fig. 25.2</a>). Once released, the prop-1-en-1-ol tautomerizes to propanal (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO). As with all mechanisms, this cycle has been proposed on the basis of a range of information like that summarized in <a href="#fig_25.3">Fig. 25.3</a>. Many of the components shown in the diagram were encountered in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#ch21">Chapter 21</a> in connection with the determination of mechanisms of substitution reactions. However, the elucidation of catalytic mechanisms is complicated by the occurrence of several delicately balanced reactions, which often cannot be studied in isolation.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Two stringent tests of any proposed mechanism are the determination of rate laws and the elucidation of stereochemistry. If intermediates are postulated, their detection by NMR, IR, or UV&#x2013;visible spectroscopy also provides support (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>). If specific atom-transfer steps are proposed, then isotopic tracer studies may serve as a test. The influences of different ligands and different substrates are also sometimes informative. Although rate data and the corresponding laws have been determined for many overall catalytic cycles, it is also necessary to determine rate laws for the individual steps in order to have reasonable confidence in the mechanism. However, because of experimental complications, it is rare that catalytic cycles are studied in this detail.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(c) Catalytic efficiency and lifetime</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> A highly active catalyst&#x2014;one that results in a fast reaction even in low concentrations&#x2014;has a large turnover frequency.

<p class="la-noindent">A highly active catalyst&#x2014;one that results in a fast reaction even in low concentrations&#x2014;has a high turnover frequency.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In heterogeneous catalysis, the reaction rate is expressed in terms of the rate of change in the amount of product (in place of concentration), and the concentration of catalyst is replaced by the amount present. The determination of the number of active sites in a heterogeneous catalyst is particularly challenging, and often the denominator [Q] in eqn 25.2 is replaced by the surface area of the catalyst.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The <b>turnover number</b> is the number of cycles for which a catalyst survives. If it is to be economically viable, a catalyst must have a large turnover number. However, it may be destroyed by side reactions to the main catalytic cycle or by the presence of small amounts of impurities in the starting materials (the <i>feedstock</i>). For example, many alkene polymerization catalysts are destroyed by O<sub>2</sub>, so in the synthesis of polyethene (polyethylene) and polypropene (polypropylene) the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the ethene or propene feedstock should be no more than a few parts per billion.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Some catalysts can be regenerated quite readily. For example, the supported metal catalysts used in the reforming reactions that convert hydrocarbons to high-octane gasoline become covered with carbon because the catalytic reaction is accompanied by a small amount of dehydrogenation. These supported metal particles can be cleaned by interrupting the catalytic process periodically and burning off the accumulated carbon.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">In industry, there is considerable economic incentive to develop <b>selective catalysts</b>, which yield a high proportion of the desired product with minimum amounts of side products (<a href="#box_25.1">Box 25.1</a>). For example, when metallic silver is used to catalyse the oxidation of ethene with oxygen to produce oxirane (ethylene oxide, <b>1</b>), the reaction is accompanied by the more thermodynamically favoured but undesirable formation of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. This lack of selectivity increases the consumption of ethene, so chemists are constantly trying to devise a more selective catalyst for oxirane synthesis. Selectivity can be ignored in only a very few simple inorganic reactions, where there is essentially only one thermodynamically favourable product, as in the formation of NH<sub>3</sub> from H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. One area where selectivity is of considerable and growing importance is asymmetric synthesis, where only one enantiomer of a particular compound is required and catalysts may be designed to produce one chiral form in preference to any others. <a id="page_732" class="page">Page 732, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a></p>

<p class="la-boxpara">&#x2018;Atom economy&#x2019;, one of the most important concepts in green chemistry, gives an indication of the efficiency of a chemical reaction in terms of conversion of starting materials into products.

<p class="la-boxpara">Efficient reactions have high atom economies, produce little waste, and are viewed as environmentally sustainable. Atom economy should not be confused with yield, as percentage yield gives no indication of the quantity of waste or by-products produced. Atom economy can be poor even when</p>
<p class="la-boxpara">the yield is high. For example, if the desired product is an enantiomer, the atom economy may be low with respect to that enantiomer, even though the yield of the reaction could be close to 100 per cent.</p>
<p class="la-boxpara">&#160;&#160;Catalysts play a crucial role in increasing the atom economies of reactions. Catalytic routes typically involve fewer reaction steps, greater selectivity, and regeneration of the catalyst. For example, the noncatalytic route to the industrial production of ethylene oxide (<b>1</b>), of which in excess of 15 million tonnes is produced worldwide each year, had an atom economy of 26 per cent and produced 3.5 kg of CaCl<sub>2</sub> waste for every 1 kg of ethylene oxide produced. The catalytic route is now used exclusively. It uses a heterogeneous silver catalyst in a one-step addition reaction of oxygen to ethene with an atom economy of 100 per cent.</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> Homogeneous catalysts are present in the same phase as the reagents, and are often well defined; heterogeneous catalysts are present in a different phase from the reagents.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Catalysts are classified as <b>homogeneous</b> if they are present in the same phase as the reagents; this normally means that they are present as solutes in liquid reaction mixtures. Catalysts are <b>heterogeneous</b> if they are present in a different phase from that of the reactants; this normally means that they are present as solids with the reactants present either as gases or in solution. Both types of catalysis are discussed in this chapter and will be seen to be fundamentally similar.</p>

</aside>
<p class="la-indent">From a practical standpoint, homogeneous catalysis is attractive because it is often highly selective towards the formation of a desired product. In large-scale industrial processes, homogeneous catalysts are preferred for exothermic reactions because it is easier to dissipate heat from a solution than from the solid bed of a heterogeneous catalyst. In principle, every homogeneous catalyst molecule in solution is accessible to reagents, potentially leading to very high activities. It should also be borne in mind that the mechanism of homogeneous catalysis is more accessible to detailed investigation than that of heterogeneous catalysis, as species in solution are often easier to characterize than those on a surface and because the interpretation of rate data is frequently easier. The major disadvantage of homogeneous catalysts is that a separation step is required.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Heterogeneous catalysts are used very extensively in industry and have a much greater economic impact than homogeneous catalysts. One attractive feature is that many of these solid catalysts are robust at high temperatures and therefore tolerate a wide range of operating conditions. Reactions are faster at high temperatures, so at high temperatures solid catalysts generally produce higher outputs for a given amount of catalyst and reaction time than homogeneous catalysts operating at lower temperatures in solutions. Another reason for their widespread use is that extra steps are not needed to separate the product from the catalyst, resulting in efficient and more environmentally friendly processes. Typically, gaseous or liquid reactants enter a tubular reactor at one end and pass over a bed of the catalyst, and products are collected at the other end. This same simplicity of design applies to the catalytic converter used to oxidize CO and hydrocarbons and reduce nitrogen oxides in automobile exhausts (<a href="#fig_25.4">Fig. 25.4</a>; see also <a href="#box_25.2">Box 25.2</a> in <a href="#sec_25.10c">Section 25.10c</a>).</p>

<h3 class="la-h3a"><b>Homogeneous catalysis</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">Here we concentrate on some important homogeneous catalytic reactions based on organometallic compounds and coordination complexes. We describe their currently favoured mechanisms, but it should be noted that, as with nearly all mechanistic proposals, catalytic mechanisms are subject to refinement or change as more detailed experimental information becomes available. Unlike simple reactions, a catalytic process frequently contains many steps over which the experimentalist has little control. Moreover, highly reactive <a id="page_733" class="page">Page 733, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>intermediates are often present in concentrations too low to be detected spectroscopically. The best attitude to adopt towards these catalytic mechanisms is to learn the pattern of transformations and appreciate their implications but be prepared to accept new mechanisms that might be indicated by future work.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The scope of homogeneous catalysis ranges across hydrogenation, oxidation, and a host of other processes. Often the complexes of all metal atoms in a group will exhibit catalytic activity in a particular reaction, but the 4d-metal complexes are often superior as catalysts to the complexes of their lighter and heavier congeners. In some cases the difference may be associated with the greater substitutional lability of 4d organometallic compounds in comparison with their 3d and 5d analogues. It is often the case that the complexes of costly metals must be used on account of their superior performance compared with the complexes of cheaper metals.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapters 21</a> and <a href="Chapter22.xhtml">22</a> described reactions that take place at metal centres: these reactions lie at the heart of the catalytic processes we now consider.

<p class="la-noindent">Together with the direct attack on coordinated ligands, these reaction types (and in some cases their reverse), often in combination, account for the mechanisms of most of the homogeneous catalytic cycles that have been proposed for organic transformations. Other reactions yet to be fully investigated will undoubtedly use other reaction steps.</p>

</figure>

<p class="la-indent">One of the most studied catalytic systems is the Rh(I) complex [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], which is often referred to as <b>Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst</b>. This useful catalyst hydrogenates a wide variety of alkenes and alkynes at pressures of hydrogen close to 1 atm or less at room temperature. The dominant cycle for the hydrogenation of terminal alkenes by Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst is shown in <a href="#fig_25.5">Fig. 25.5</a>. It involves the oxidative addition of H<sub>2</sub> to the 16-electron complex [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] (A), to form the 18-electron dihydrido complex (B). The dissociation of a phosphine ligand from (B) results in the formation of the coordinatively unsaturated complex (C), which then forms the alkene complex (D). Hydrogen transfer from the Rh atom in (D) to the coordinated alkene yields a transient 16-electron alkyl complex (E). This complex takes on a phosphine ligand to produce (F), and hydrogen migration to carbon results in the reductive elimination of the alkane and the reformation of (A), which is set to repeat the cycle. A parallel but slower cycle (which is not shown) is known in which the order of H<sub>2</sub> and alkene addition is reversed. Another cycle is known, based around the 14-electron intermediate [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]. Even though there is very little of this species present, it reacts much faster with hydrogen than [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] does, and makes a significant contribution to the catalytic cycle. In this cycle, (E) would eliminate alkane directly, regenerating [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], which rapidly adds H<sub>2</sub> to give (C).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst is highly sensitive to the nature of the phosphine ligand and the alkene substrate. Analogous complexes with alkylphosphine ligands are inactive, presumably because they are more strongly bound to the metal atom and do not readily dissociate. Similarly, the alkene must be just the right size: highly hindered alkenes or the sterically unencumbered ethene are not hydrogenated by the catalyst, presumably because the sterically crowded alkenes do not coordinate and ethene forms a strong complex that does not react further. These observations emphasize the point made earlier that a catalytic cycle is usually a delicately poised sequence of reactions, and anything that upsets its flow may block catalysis or alter the mechanism.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst is used in laboratory-scale organic synthesis and in the production of fine chemicals. Related Rh(I) phosphine catalysts that contain a chiral phosphine ligand have been developed to synthesize optically active products in <b>enantioselective reactions</b> (reactions that produce a particular chiral product). The alkene to be hydrogenated must be <b>prochiral</b>, which means that it must have a structure that leads to <i>R</i> or <i>S</i> chirality when complexed to the metal. The resulting complex will have two diastereomeric <a id="page_736" class="page">Page 736, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>forms, depending on which face of the alkene coordinates to the metal atom. In general, diastereomers have different stabilities and labilities, and in favourable cases one or the other of these effects leads to product enantioselectivity. Enantioselectivities are normally measured in terms of the <b>enantiomeric excess</b> (ee), which is defined as the percentage yield of the major enantiomeric product minus the percentage yield of the minor enantiomeric product.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The overall catalytic cycle is shown in <a href="#fig_25.9">Fig. 25.9</a>. Detailed stereochemical studies on related systems indicate that the hydration of the alkene/Pd(II) complex (B) occurs by the attack of H<sub>2</sub>O from the solution on the coordinated ethene rather than the insertion of coordinated OH. Hydration, to form (C), is followed by two steps that isomerize the coordinated alcohol. First, &#x03B2;-hydrogen elimination occurs with the formation of (D), and then migration of a hydride results in the formation of (E). Elimination of the ethanal and an H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion then leaves Pd(0), which is converted back to Pd(II) by the auxiliary copper(II)-catalysed air oxidation cycle.</p>
<p class="la-indent">One important observation that the mechanism must account for is that, when the reaction is carried out in the presence of D<sub>2</sub>O, no deuterium is incorporated into the final product. This observation suggests that either intermediate (D) is very short-lived and does not exchange the Pd&#x2013;H for a Pd&#x2013;D, or that intermediate (C) rearranges directly to (E).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Alkene ligands coordinated to Pt(II) are also susceptible to nucleophilic attack, but only palladium leads to a successful catalytic system. The principal reason for palladium&#x2019;s <?Page pageId="740"?>unique behaviour appears to be the greater lability of the 4d Pd(II) complexes in comparison with their 5d Pt(II) counterparts. Furthermore, the potential for the oxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) is more favourable than for the corresponding Pt couple.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The reaction is catalysed by all three members of Group 9 (Co, Rh, and Ir). Originally a Co complex was used, but then a Rh catalyst developed at Monsanto greatly reduced the cost of the process by allowing lower pressures to be used. As a result, the rhodium-based <b>Monsanto process</b> was used throughout the world. Subsequently, British Petroleum (now BP) developed the <b>Cativa process</b>, which uses a promoted Ir catalyst. Both processes are highly selective and generate ethanoic acid of sufficient purity that it can be used in human food.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The Monsanto and Cativa processes follow essentially the same reaction sequence, so the rhodium-based cycle described here captures the principal features of the iridium-based process too (<a href="#fig_25.13">Fig. 25.13</a>). Under the conditions used, iodide ions react with methanol to set up an appreciable concentration of iodomethane in the first step of the reaction. Starting with the four-coordinate, 16-electron complex [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (A), the next step is the oxidative addition of iodomethane to produce the six-coordinate, 18-electron complex [Rh(Me)(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (B). This step is followed by methyl migration, yielding a 16-electron acyl complex (C). Coordination of CO restores an 18-electron complex (D), which is then set to undergo reductive elimination of acetyl iodide with the regeneration of [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. Water then hydrolyses the acetyl iodide to acetic acid and regenerates HI. Under normal operating conditions, the rate-determining step for the rhodium-based system is the oxidative addition of iodomethane, whereas for the iridium-based system it is the migration of the methyl group. An important feature is that methyl migration on iridium is favoured by formation of a neutral intermediate, and iodide-accepting promoters help facilitate substitution of an iodide ligand by CO in the Ir analogue of complex (B).</p>

<h3 class="la-h3a"><a id="sec_25.10c"/><b>Heterogeneous catalysis</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">Numerous industrial processes are facilitated by heterogeneous catalysis. Practical heterogeneous catalysts are high-surface-area materials that may contain several different phases and operate at pressures of 1 atm and higher. In some cases the bulk of a high-surface-area material serves as the catalyst, and such a material is called a <b>uniform catalyst.</b> A simple <a id="page_743" class="page">Page 743, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>example is a very finely divided metal, as in skeletal nickel. Another example is the catalytic zeolite ZSM-5, which contains channels or pores through which molecules diffuse, producing a high internal surface area for the reaction. More often, <b>multiphasic catalysts</b> are used, which consist of a high-surface-area material that serves as a support on to which an active catalyst is deposited (<a href="#fig_25.14">Fig. 25.14</a>). Heterogeneous catalysts generally fall into two categories in terms of the location of the active surfaces. Many heterogeneous catalysts are finely divided solids where the active sites lie on the particle surfaces; others, particularly the microporous zeolite family and mesoporous materials, have pore-like structures, and the active sites are the internal surfaces, such as pores and cavities, within the individual crystallites. We shall discuss examples that illustrate some of the range of heterogeneous catalysts, but first we need to describe some of the unique mechanistic features they exhibit. We concentrate on the inorganic chemistry involved in reactions on surfaces, not the physical chemical aspects of adsorption and reaction.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3"><b>25.10 The nature of heterogeneous catalysts</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">There are many parallels between the individual reaction steps encountered in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, but we need to consider some additional points.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(a) Surface area and porosity</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Heterogeneous catalysts are high-surface-area materials formed as either finely divided substrates or crystallites with accessible internal pores.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">An ordinary dense solid is unsuitable as a catalyst because its surface area is quite low. Thus &#x03B1;-alumina, which is a dense material with a low specific surface area, is used much less as a catalyst support than the microcrystalline solid &#x03B3;-alumina, which can be prepared with small particle size and therefore a high specific surface area (the surface area divided by the mass of the sample). The high surface area results from the many small but connected particles like those shown in <a href="#fig_25.14">Fig. 25.14</a>, and a gram or so of a typical catalyst support has a surface area equal to that of a tennis court. Similarly, polycrystalline quartz is not used as a catalyst support but the high-surface-area versions of SiO<sub>2</sub> are widely used. In a typical heterogeneous catalyst this substrate surface is coated with active sites or particles, such as metals or metal oxides, producing a large number of active sites.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Both &#x03B3;-alumina and high-surface-area silica are metastable materials, but under ordinary conditions they do not convert to their more stable phases (&#x03B1;-alumina and polycrystalline quartz, respectively). The preparation of &#x03B3;-alumina involves the dehydration of an aluminium oxide hydroxide:</p>
<p class="la-eqn">
<math style="margin-left:-1em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>2 AlO(OH)</mtext><mover><mo>&#x2192;</mo><mo>&#x0394;</mo></mover><mi>r</mi><msub><mrow><mtext>-Al</mtext></mrow><mtext>2</mtext></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>3</mtext></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mtext>2</mtext></msub><mtext>O</mtext></mrow></math></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Similarly, high-surface-area silica is prepared from the acidification of silicates to produce Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which rapidly forms a hydrated silica gel from which much of the adsorbed water can be removed by heating (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.1">Section 24.1a</a>). When viewed with an electron microscope, the texture of the silica or alumina appears to be that of a rough gravel bed with irregularly shaped voids between the interconnecting particles (as in <a href="#fig_25.14">Fig. 25.14</a>). Other high-surface-area materials used as supports in heterogeneous catalysts include TiO<sub>2</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, MgO, and carbon.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="la-indent">Zeolites (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.11">Section 24.11</a>) are examples of uniform catalysts. They are prepared as very fine crystals that contain large regular channels and cages defined by the crystal structure (<a href="#fig_25.15">Fig. 25.15</a>). The openings in these channels vary from one crystalline form of the zeolite to the next, but are typically between 0.3 and 2 nm. The zeolite absorbs molecules small enough to enter the channels and excludes larger molecules. This selectivity, in combination with catalytic sites inside the cages, provides a degree of control over catalytic reactions that is unattainable with silica gel or &#x03B3;-alumina. The synthesis of new zeolites and similar shape-selective solids and the introduction of catalytic sites into them is a vigorous area of research (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.12">Section 24.12</a>).</p>

Surface acids and bases are highly active for catalytic reactions such as the dehydration of alcohols and isomerization of alkenes. Similar Br&#x00F8;nsted and Lewis acid sites exist on the interior of certain zeolites. Different oxides and their mixtures show variations in surface acidity; thus a SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> mixture is more acidic than SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and promotes different catalytic reactions.</p>

<p class="la-boxpara">Infrared spectra of hydrogen-bonded pyridine complexes (X&#x2013;H&#x2026;py) show bands near 1540 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and Lewis acid complexes of pyridine (py), such as Cl<sub>3</sub>Al(py), display bands near 1465 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, due to Al &#x2212; py Lewis acid&#x2013;base interactions. A sample of &#x03B3;-alumina that had been pretreated by heating to 200&#x00B0;C and then cooled and exposed to pyridine vapour had absorption bands near 1540 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and none near 1465 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Another sample that was heated to 500&#x00B0;C, cooled, and then exposed to pyridine had bands near 1540 and 1465 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

<p class="la-boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> The positions of the absorption bands seen in the IR spectrum are characteristic of the various functional groups of the molecules present. The types of species present at each stage of the reaction can be surmised by assigning the bands observed in the spectrum to these groups.

<p class="la-indent">Highly active acidic and basic surfaces act as useful substrates for depositing other catalytic centres, particularly metal particles. Treatment of &#x03B3;-alumina with H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> followed by heating in a reducing environment produces Pt particles of dimensions 1&#x2013;50 nm distributed over the alumina surface.</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> Very small metal particles on ceramic oxide substrates are very active catalysts for a range of reactions.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Metal particles are often deposited on supports to provide a catalyst. For example, finely divided Pt/Re alloys distributed on the surface of &#x03B3;-alumina particles are used to interconvert hydrocarbons, and finely divided Pt/Rh rhodium alloy particles supported on &#x03B3;-alumina are used in the catalytic converters of vehicles to promote the combination of O<sub>2</sub> with CO and hydrocarbons to form CO<sub>2</sub> and the reduction of nitrogen oxides to <a id="page_745" class="page">Page 745, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>nitrogen (<a href="#box_25.2">Box 25.2</a>). A supported metal particle about 2.5 nm in diameter has about 40 per cent of its atoms on the surface, and the particles are protected from fusing together into bulk metal by their separation. The high proportion of exposed atoms is a great advantage for these small supported particles, particularly for metals such as platinum and the even more expensive rhodium.</p>

<p class="la-boxtitle"><a id="box_25.2"></a><b><span class="la-green">BOX 25.2</span> Catalytic converters</b></p>
</div>
<p class="la-boxpara">Catalytic convertors are used to reduce toxic emissions from internal combustion engines, which include nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), carbon monoxide, and unburnt hydrocarbons (HC). By 2009, when the Euro V emission standards came into use in Europe, the levels of these compounds in exhaust gases were restricted to 0.50 (CO), 0.23 (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> &#x002B; HC), and 0.18 (HC) g km<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively; these values are similar to those demanded in California. The catalytic converter consists of a honeycomb stainless steel or ceramic structure on to which silica and alumina are deposited, followed by a mixture of platinum, rhodium, and palladium as nanoparticles, with diameters typically between 10 and 50 nm. A three-way converter, used with petrol (gasoline) engines, catalyses the following three reactions:</p>

<figure style="margin-left:-1em;">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_0745.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="la-boxpara">The first stage of the catalytic converter involves reduction of the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> on a reduction catalyst, which consists of a mixture of platinum and rhodium;</p>

<p class="la-boxpara">rhodium is highly reactive towards NO. The second stage involves catalytic oxidation, which removes the unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide by oxidizing them on the mixed metal platinum/palladium catalyst. A two-way catalytic converter used in conjunction with most diesel engines undertakes only the oxidation reactions (the second and third of those above).</p>
<p class="la-boxpara">In order to facilitate the near-complete conversion of the gases emerging from the engine, the correct initial air : fuel mixture is used. The ideal stoichiometric air : fuel mixture entering the engine is 14.7 : 1 so that after combustion the gases entering the catalytic converter are about 0.5 per cent oxygen. If richer or leaner air : fuel mixtures are used (that is, with lower or higher air contents, respectively), then the level of oxygen entering the exhaust stream may be too high or low for effective operation of the catalytic converter. For these reasons, various metal oxides, particularly Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub>, are incorporated into the catalytic coating to store and release oxygen as the oxygen content of the gases emerging from the engine changes.</p>

<p class="la-indent" style="margin-top:0.8em;">The metal atoms on the surface of metal clusters are capable of forming bonds such as M&#x0064;CO, M&#x0064;CH<sub>2</sub>R, M&#x0064;H, and M&#x0064;O (<a href="#tab_25.3">Table 25.3</a>). Often the nature of surface ligands is inferred by comparison of IR spectra with those of organometallic or inorganic complexes. Thus, both terminal and bridging CO groups can be identified on surfaces by IR spectroscopy, and the IR spectra of many hydrocarbon ligands on surfaces are similar to those of discrete organometallic complexes. The case of the N<sub>2</sub> ligand is an interesting <a id="page_746" class="page">Page 746, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>contrast because coordinated N<sub>2</sub> was identified by IR spectroscopy on metal surfaces before dinitrogen complexes had been prepared.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The development of new techniques for studying single-crystal surfaces has greatly expanded our knowledge of the surface species that may be present in catalysis. For example, desorption of molecules from surfaces (thermally or by ion or atom impact) combined with mass spectrometric analysis of the desorbed substance provides insight into the chemical identity of surface species. Similarly, Auger and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.9">Section 8.9</a>) provide information on the elemental composition of surfaces. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) provides information about the structure of single-crystal surfaces and, when adsorbate molecules are present, their arrangement on the surface. One important finding from LEED is that the adsorption of small molecules on a surface may bring about a structural modification of the surface. This surface reconstruction is often observed to reverse when desorption occurs. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM; <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.16">Section 8.16</a>) provides an unrivalled method for locating adsorbates on surfaces. This striking technique provides a contour map of single-crystal surfaces at, or close to, atomic resolution.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Although most of these modern surface techniques cannot be applied to the study of supported multiphasic catalysts, they are very helpful for revealing the range of probable surface species and circumscribing the structures that may plausibly be invoked in a mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis. The application of these techniques to heterogeneous catalysis is similar to the use of X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy for the characterization of organometallic homogeneous catalyst precursors and model compounds.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Before a heterogeneous catalyst is used it is usually &#x2018;activated&#x2019;. Activation is a catch-all term. In some instances it refers to the desorption of adsorbed molecules such as water from the surface, as in the dehydration of &#x03B3;-alumina. In other cases it refers to the preparation of the active site by a chemical reaction, such as by reduction of metal oxide particles to produce active metal particles.</p>
<p class="la-indent">An activated surface can be characterized by the adsorption of various inert and reactive gases. The adsorption may be either <b>physisorption</b>, when no new chemical bond is formed, or <b>chemisorption</b>, when surface&#x2212;adsorbate bonds are formed (<a href="#fig_25.16">Fig. 25.16</a>). Low-temperature physisorption of a gas such as nitrogen is useful for the determination of the total surface area of a solid, whereas chemisorption is used to determine the number of exposed reactive sites.

<p class="la-noindent">provides a good example of this balance between adsorption and catalytic activity. It is observed that the catalysis is most effective using metals for which the metal methanoate is of intermediate stability (<a href="#fig_25.17">Fig. 25.17</a>). The plot in <a href="#fig_25.17">Fig. 25.17</a> is an example of a &#x2018;volcano diagram&#x2019;, and is typical of many catalytic reactions. The implication is that the earlier d-block metals form very stable surface compounds whereas the later noble metals such as silver and gold form very weak surface compounds, both of which are detrimental to a catalytic process. Between these extremes the metals in Groups 8 to 10 have high catalytic activity, especially the platinum metals (Group 10). In <a href="#sec_25.4">Section 25.4</a> we saw a similar high activity of these metal complexes in the homogeneous catalysis of hydrocarbon transformations.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The active sites of heterogeneous catalysts are not uniform, and many diverse sites are exposed on the surface of a poorly crystalline solid such as &#x03B3;-alumina or a noncrystalline solid such as silica gel. However, even highly crystalline metal particles are not uniform. A crystalline solid has typically more than one type of exposed plane, each with its characteristic pattern of surface atoms (<a href="#fig_25.18">Fig. 25.18</a>). In addition, single-crystal metal surfaces have irregularities such as steps that expose metal atoms with low coordination numbers (<a href="#fig_25.19">Fig. 25.19</a>). These highly exposed, coordinatively unsaturated sites appear to be particularly reactive. As a result, the different sites on the surface may serve different functions in catalytic reactions. The variety of sites also accounts for the lower selectivity of many heterogeneous catalysts in comparison with their homogeneous analogues.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The surface analogue of fluxional mobility in clusters is diffusion, and there is abundant evidence for the diffusion of chemisorbed molecules or atoms on metal surfaces. For example, adsorbed H atoms and CO molecules are known to move over the surface of a metal particle. These diffusion pathways generally involve the adsorbed molecules moving through a variety of different coordination sites on the metal surface. So, for example, CO migration can result from a molecule moving between sites interacting with one (terminal CO) and between two and four (bridging CO) metal atoms on the surface. The energy barrier to this process is relatively low&#x2014;a few tens of kilojoules per mole&#x2014;and thus migration rates are very high under typical catalytic reaction conditions. This mobility is important <?Page pageId="748"?>in catalytic reactions as it allows atoms or molecules to find and approach one another rapidly.</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Catalysts based on iron metal are used for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindentt">The synthesis of ammonia has already been discussed from several different viewpoints (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.6">Section 15.6</a>). Here we concentrate on details of the catalytic steps. The formation of ammonia is exergonic and exothermic at 25&#x00B0;C, the relevant thermodynamic data being &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> &#x003D; &#x2212;116.5 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> &#x003D; &#x2212;146.1 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>S</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> &#x003D; &#x2212;199.4 J K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The negative entropy of formation reflects the fact that two NH<sub>3</sub> molecules form in place of four reactant molecules.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The great inertness of N<sub>2</sub> (and to a lesser extent H<sub>2</sub>) requires that a catalyst be used for the reaction. Iron metal, together with small quantities of alumina and potassium salts and other promoters, is used as the catalyst. Extensive studies on the mechanism of ammonia synthesis indicate that the rate-determining step under normal operating conditions is the dissociation of N<sub>2</sub> coordinated to the catalyst surface. The other reactant, H<sub>2</sub>, undergoes much more facile dissociation on the metal surface and a series of insertion reactions between adsorbed species leads to the production of NH<sub>3</sub>:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
 <img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_1486.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="la-noindent">Because of the slowness of the N<sub>2</sub> dissociation, it is necessary to run the ammonia synthesis at high temperatures, typically 400&#x00B0;C. However, because the reaction is exothermic, high temperature reduces the equilibrium constant of the reaction. To recover some of this reduced yield, pressures in the order of 100 atm are used to favour the formation products. A catalyst operating at room temperature that could give good equilibrium yields of NH<sub>3</sub>, such as the enzyme nitrogenase (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>), has long been sought.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In the course of developing the original ammonia synthesis process, Haber, Bosch, and their co-workers investigated the catalytic activity of most of the metals in the periodic table and found that the best are Fe, Ru, and U, promoted by small amounts of alumina and potassium salts. Cost and toxicity considerations led to the choice of iron as the basis <a id="page_749" class="page">Page 749, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a>of the commercial catalyst. The role of the various promoters, particularly K, in the Fe metal catalyst had been the subject of much scientific research. G. Ertl<sup><a id="ich25fn5"></a><a href="#ch25fn5">5</a></sup> found that, in the presence of potassium, N<sub>2</sub> molecules adsorb more readily on the metal surface and the adsorption enthalpy is made more exothermic by about 12 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, probably as a result of the increased electron-donating abilities of the Fe/K surface. The more strongly adsorbed N<sub>2</sub> molecule is then cleaved more easily in the rate-determining step in the process.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">This step is also exothermic and thus, as with ammonia synthesis, has a less favourable equilibrium constant at elevated temperatures. The process is therefore generally run in stages. In the first stage, the combustion of sulfur raises the temperature to about 600&#x00B0;C, but by cooling and pressurizing before the catalytic stage the equilibrium is driven to the right and high conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>3</sub> is achieved.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Several quite different catalytic systems have been used to catalyse the combination of SO<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub>. The most widely used catalyst at present is potassium or caesium vanadate molten salt covering a high-surface-area silica.

A currently more favoured view of zeolite selectivity is based on transition-state selectivity, where the orientation of reactive intermediates within the zeolite channels favours specific products.

<p class="la-noindent">The process is exothermic, with &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> &#x003D; &#x2212;165 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The product range consists of aliphatic straight-chain hydrocarbons that include methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and ethane, LPG (C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>), gasoline (C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>12</sub>), diesel (C<sub>13</sub> to C<sub>22</sub>), and light and heavy waxes (C<sub>23</sub> to C<sub>32</sub> and &#x003E;C<sub>33</sub>, respectively). Side reactions include the formation of alcohols and other oxygenated products. The distribution of the products depends on the catalyst and the temperature, pressure, and residence time. Typical conditions for the Fischer&#x2013;Tropsch synthesis are a temperature range of 200&#x2013;350&#x00B0;C and pressures of 15&#x2013;40 atm.</p>
<p class="la-indent">There is general agreement that the first stages of the hydrocarbon synthesis involve the adsorption of CO on the metal, followed by its cleavage to give a surface carbide (and water), and the successive hydrogenation of such species to surface methyne (CH), methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>), and methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) species, but there is still debate on what happens next and how chain growth occurs. One proposal suggests a polymerization of bridging surface &#x2212;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2212; groups initiated by a surface &#x2212;CH<sub>3</sub> group. However, the fact that many such species have been isolated and are stable as metal complexes suggests that the mechanism is probably not so simple. Other mechanistic investigations of these processes have suggested an alternative possibility for chain growth in the hydrocarbon synthesis, namely that it proceeds by combination of surface bridging &#x2212;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2212; groups and alkenyl chains (M&#x2212;CH &#x003D; CHR), rather than by the combination of alkyl chains (M&#x2212;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>R) with methylene groups in the surface.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Several catalysts have been used for the Fischer&#x2013;Tropsch synthesis; the most important are based on Fe and Co. Cobalt catalysts have the advantage of a higher conversion rate and a longer life (of over five years). The cobalt catalysts are in general more reactive for hydrogenation and produce fewer unsaturated hydrocarbons and alcohols than iron catalysts. Iron catalysts have a higher tolerance for sulfur, are cheaper, and produce more alkene products and alcohols. The lifetime of the iron catalysts is short, however, and in commercial installations generally limited to about eight weeks.</p>

<p class="la-noindentt">Kinetic barriers are quite common for electrochemical reactions at the interface between a solution and an electrode and, as mentioned in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.18">Section 5.18</a>, it is common to express these barriers as overpotentials <i>&#x03B7;</i> (eta), the potential in addition to the zero-current cell potential (the emf) that must be applied to bring about an otherwise slow reaction within the cell. The overpotential is related to the current density, <i>j</i> (the current divided by the area of the electrode), that passes through the cell by<sup><a id="ich25fn8"></a><a href="#ch25fn8">8</a></sup></p>

<p class="la-noindent">where <i>j</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>a</i> are best regarded for our purposes as empirical constants. The constant <i>j</i><sub>0</sub>, the <b>exchange current density</b>, is a measure of the rates of the forward and reverse electrode reactions at dynamic equilibrium. For systems obeying these relations, the reaction rate (as measured by the current density) increases rapidly with increasing applied potential difference when <i>a&#x03B7;</i> &#x003E; 1. If the exchange current density is high, an appreciable reaction rate may be achieved with only a small overpotential. If the exchange current density is low, a high overpotential is necessary.

<p class="la-indent">A catalytic electrode surface can increase the exchange current density and hence dramatically decrease the overpotential required for sluggish electrochemical reactions, such as H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, or Cl<sub>2</sub> evolution and consumption. For example, &#x2018;platinum black&#x2019;, a finely divided form of platinum, is very effective at increasing the exchange current density and hence decreasing the overpotential of reactions involving the consumption or evolution of H<sub>2</sub>. The role of platinum is to dissociate the strong H&#x2212;H bond and thereby reduce the large barrier that this bond strength imposes on reactions involving H<sub>2</sub>. Palladium also has a high exchange current density (and hence requires only a low overpotential) for H<sub>2</sub> evolution or consumption.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The effectiveness of metals can be judged from <a href="#fig_25.25">Fig. 25.25</a>, which also gives insight into the process. The volcano-like plot of exchange current density against M&#x2212;H bond enthalpy suggests that M&#x2212;H bond formation and cleavage are both important in the catalytic process. It appears that an intermediate M&#x2212;H bond energy leads to the proper balance for the existence of a catalytic cycle, and the most effective metals for electrocatalysis are clustered around Group 10.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Ruthenium dioxide is an effective catalyst for both O<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> evolution and it also is a good electrical conductor. It turns out that at high current densities RuO<sub>2</sub> is more effective for the catalysis of Cl<sub>2</sub> evolution than for O<sub>2</sub> evolution. RuO<sub>2</sub> is therefore extensively used as an electrode material in the commercial production of chorine. The electrode processes that contribute to this subtle catalytic effect do not appear to be well understood.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Although details of the mechanism are still elusive, this general set of reactions is in harmony with electrochemical measurements and the known properties of iron porphyrins.

<p class="la-indent">One application where cheap and efficient electrocatalysts are much needed is in PEM fuel cells (PEM stands for &#x2018;proton exchange membrane&#x2019; and sometimes &#x2018;polymer electrolyte membrane&#x2019;; Box 5.1). As these systems operate at quite low temperatures (50&#x2013;100&#x00B0;C), they are suitable for applications that involve transport and mobile power, such as mobile telephones (cellphones). The electrolyte, a polymer that conducts protons but not electrons, separates an anode in contact with hydrogen gas and a cathode over which flows oxygen gas. As noted above, hydrogen gas is readily dissociated at the anode using a platinum-metal catalyst, but the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode presents more of a problem. There is a substantial overpotential associated with this reduction, which considerably reduces the efficiency of the cell, giving operating voltages near 0.7 V as compared with the theoretical value of 1.23 V. Platinum may again be used to catalyse the reaction but, even so, the reaction is inefficient and use of large quantities of platinum costly. Considerable research effort is being applied to finding better electrocatalysts, and recently the alloy Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni (111 surface) has proved to have greatly enhanced properties.</p>

The best known photocatalyst is TiO<sub>2</sub>. TiO<sub>2</sub> has been used for centuries as a white pigment (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.16">Section 24.16</a>) and the result of its photocatalytic activity (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.17">Section 24.17</a>) can be observed in the flaking of white paint and the dicolouration of uPVC in window frames. TiO<sub>2</sub> occurs naturally in two crystal forms, rutile and anatase, and anatase is much more photoactive than rutile. Both forms have a wide band gap (anatase 3.2 eV, rutile 3.1 eV) and absorb radiation in the UV region below 390 nm. This absorption leads to the formation of pairs of electrons and holes. The holes diffuse to the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface and react with adsorbed water molecules, forming hydroxyl radicals, <sup>&#x2022;</sup>OH. The electrons typically react with molecular oxygen to produce superoxide radical anions <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>&#x00B7;</mo><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> These very reactive species then take part in the catalysed reaction.</p>
<p class="la-boxparai">TiO<sub>2</sub> attracted much interest as a photocatalyst when electrolysis of water to produce H<sub>2</sub> was observed using Pt deposited on TiO<sub>2</sub>. Any organic compounds present were also oxidized and this oxidizing power led to the development of TiO<sub>2</sub> for the treatment of pollutants and the purification of water. In these applications, a slurry of powdered TiO<sub>2</sub> in water can be used, although it is often immobilized on a solid support for ease of handling and</p>


<p class="la-boxparai">separation. The oxidation reactions take place only at the surface of the TiO<sub>2</sub>, so thin films are more effective and more efficient than bulk powders. Thin films of anatase are used as photocatalytic self-cleaning coatings (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#box_24.4">Box 24.4</a>) on window glass and blinds. The cleaning process is only effective when the number of incident photons is much greater than the number of organic molecules arriving on the surface, so the degree of self-cleaning is limited in some climates.</p>
<p class="la-boxparai">The photocatalytic decomposition process can also be applied to microorganisms, and <i>E. coli</i> cells are destroyed after one hour of exposure to sunlight on a TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. Light generated from incandescent and fluorescent bulbs or sunlight entering buildings is much less intense than direct sunlight, so until recently this property of TiO<sub>2</sub> had limited applications indoors. However, if TiO<sub>2</sub> is doped with Cu or Ag the photocatalytic antibacterial activity is enhanced. The reactive species generated on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface attack the cell membrane as before but this is followed by migration of the copper or silver ions into the cell, killing it.</p>
<p class="la-boxparai">Other applications of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts include sterilization of surgical instruments, removal of unwanted fingerprints from sensitive optical components, antifouling marine paints, cleanup of crude oil, decontamination of water, and decomposition of polyaromatic hydrocarbon pollutants.</p>

One very active area is the investigation of selective heterogeneous oxidation catalysts, which allow partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to useful intermediates in, for example, the polymer and pharmaceutical industries. Examples of such reactions include alkene epoxidation, aromatic hydroxylation, and ammoxidation (an oxidation in the presence of ammonia that generates nitriles) of alkanes, alkenes, and alkyl aromatics. In all these cases it is desirable to produce the products without complete oxidation of the hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide.</p>

The cumene process involves three stages, namely alkylation of benzene with propene to form cumene (a process catalysed by phosphoric acid or aluminium chloride), direct oxidation of cumene to cumene hydroperoxide using molecular oxygen, and finally cleavage of cumene hydroperoxide to phenol and acetone, which is catalysed by sulfuric acid.

<p class="la-noindent">Chemists have begun to look at catalytic systems that cannot simply be defined as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Research has centred on trying to achieve the best of both systems: the high selectivity of homogeneous catalysts coupled with the ease of separation of heterogeneous catalysts. This approach is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;heterogenizing&#x2019; homogeneous catalysts.</p>

<p class="la-noindentt">The development of alkene polymerization catalysts in the second half of the twentieth century, producing polymers such as polypropene and polystyrene, ushered in a revolution in construction materials, fabrics, and packaging. Polyalkenes are most often prepared by the use of organometallic catalysts. The catalysts used can be homogeneous, heterogenized homogeneous, or heterogeneous, and polymerization provides a good example of how homogeneous catalysis has influenced the design of industrially important heterogeneous catalysts. All three types of catalyst are discussed in this section.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Ethene is readily available from natural gas and petroleum by steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons. It can be converted to the much more valuable long-chain alkenes, sometimes still referred to as olefins, by processes such as the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP). SHOP was developed for the conversion of ethene to C10&#x2013;C14 internal alkenes&#x2014;that is, alkenes in which the double bond is not at the end of the carbon chain. The product alkenes are mainly converted into linear primary alcohols for use in detergents, but they can <?Page pageId="756"?>be modified to obtain linear alkenes of just about any range. SHOP is a three-step process. The first step is homogeneously catalysed alkene <b>oligomerization</b> to form short chains of up to 10 monomer units. The catalyst is generated <i>in situ</i> from bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) and a bidentate phosphine carboxylate ligand. A nickel hydride complex is generated by displacement of the cycooctadiene by an incoming ethene molecule. An initial hydride shift (1,2-insertion reaction; <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.25">Section 22.25</a>) is followed by successive alkene migrations to build the oligomer:</p>

<p class="la-indent">The products may then undergo isomerisation or metathesis to internal alkenes (<a href="#sec_25.3">Section 25.3</a>) or be further processed into aldehydes and alcohols by hydroformylation (<a href="#sec_25.5">Section 25.5</a>). Whereas the SHOP system is not very selective (the products have to be separated), some other catalysts are very effective for selective oligomerization. For instance, a homogeneous chromium catalyst generated <i>in situ</i> by mixing a Cr(II) or Cr(III) halide with a so-called PNP phosphine (<b>15</b>), followed by activation with methyaluminumoxane (MAO) under ethene, gives a system that is very active for trimerization of ethene, resulting in 99.9 per cent 1-hexene. This system generates no polymer by-product, which is important in industry where reactors need to be kept free from solid materials. Changing the PNP ligand can alter the products; Ph<sub>2</sub>PN(iPr)PPh<sub>2</sub> generates 1-octene and 1-hexene as the major products.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In the 1950s J.P. Hogan and R.L. Banks discovered that chromium oxides supported on silica, a so-called <b>Philips catalyst</b>, polymerized alkenes to long-chain polyenes. Also in the 1950s, K. Ziegler, working in Germany, developed a catalyst for ethene polymerization based on a catalyst formed from TiCl<sub>4</sub> and Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and soon thereafter G. Natta in Italy used this type of catalyst for the stereospecific polymerization of propene. Both the <b>Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts</b> and the chromium-based heterogeneous polymerization catalysts are widely used today.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The full details of the mechanism of Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts are still uncertain, but the <b>Cossee&#x2013;Arlman mechanism</b> is regarded as highly plausible (<a href="#fig_25.26">Fig. 25.26</a>). The catalyst is prepared from TiCl<sub>4</sub> and Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which react to give polymeric TiCl<sub>3</sub> mixed with AlCl<sub>3</sub> in the form of a fine powder. The alkylaluminium alkylates a Ti atom on the surface of the solid and an ethene molecule coordinates to the neighbouring vacant site. In the propagation steps for the polymerization, the coordinated alkene undergoes a migratory insertion reaction. This migration opens up another neighbouring vacancy, and so the reaction can continue and the polymer chain can grow. The release of the polymer from the metal atom occurs by &#x03B2;-hydrogen elimination, and the chain is terminated. Some catalyst remains in the polymer, but the process is so efficient that the amount is negligible.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The proposed mechanism of alkene polymerization on a Philips catalyst involves the initial coordination of one or more alkene molecules to a surface Cr(II) site followed by rearrangement to metallocycloalkanes on a formally Cr(IV) site. Unlike Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts, the solid-phase catalyst does not need an alkylating agent to initiate the polymerization reaction; instead, this species is thought to be generated by the metallocycloalkane directly or by formation of an ethenylhydride by cleavage of a C&#x2212;H bond at the chromium site.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Homogeneous catalysts related to the Philips and Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts provide additional insight into the course of the reaction and are of considerable industrial significance in their own right, being used commercially for the synthesis of specialized polymers.</p>

<p class="la-noindent"><b>Kaminsky catalysts</b> utilize metals from Group 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf) and are based on a bis(cyclopentadienyl) metal system: the tilted-ring complex [Zr(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-Cp)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)L]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (<b>16</b>) is a good example. These Group 4 metallocene complexes catalyse alkene polymerization by successive insertion steps that involve prior coordination of the alkene to the electrophilic metal centre. Catalysts of this type are used in the presence of a co-catalyst, the so-called methyl aluminoxane (MAO), a poorly defined compound of approximate formula (MeAlO)<sub><i>n</i></sub>, which, among other functions, serves to methylate a starting chloride complex. Kaminsky catalysts can also be supported on silica and are used industrially for the polymerization of &#x03B1;-alkenes and styrene. These are thus examples of <b>heterogenized homogeneous catalysts</b>.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Additional complications arise with alkenes other than ethene. We shall discuss only terminal alkenes such as propene and styrene, as these are relatively simple. The first complication to consider arises because the two ends of the alkene molecule are different. In principle, it is possible for the polymer to form with the different ends head-to-head (<b>17</b>), head-to-tail (<b>18</b>), or randomly. Studies on catalysts such as (<b>16</b>) show that the growing chain migrates preferentially to the more highly substituted C atom of the alkene, thus giving a polymer chain that contains only head-to-tail orientations:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_1494.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="la-noindent">If we consider propene, we can see that the coordinated alkene induces less steric strain if its smaller CH<sub>2</sub> end is pointing into the cleft of the (Cp)<sub>2</sub>Zr catalyst (<b>19</b>), rather than the larger methyl substituted end, (<b>20</b>). The migrating polymer chain is thus adjacent to the methyl-substituted end of the propene molecule, and it is to this methyl-substituted C atom that the chain attaches, giving a head-to-tail sequence to the whole polymer chain.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The second structural modification of polypropene is its <b>tacticity</b>, the relative orientations of neighbouring groups in the polymer. In a regular <b>isotactic</b> polypropene, all the methyl groups are on the same side of the polymer backbone (<b>21</b>). In regular <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropene, the orientation of the methyl groups alternates along the polymer chain (<b>22</b>). In an <b>atactic</b> polypropene, the orientation of neighbouring methyl groups is random (<b>23</b>). Control of the tacticity of a polymer is equivalent to controlling the stereospecificity of the reaction steps. The orientation of neighbouring groups is not simply of academic interest, because the orientation has a significant effect on the properties of the bulk polymer. For example, the melting points of isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic polypropene are 165&#x00B0;C, 130&#x00B0;C, and below 0&#x00B0;C, respectively.</p>
<p class="la-indent">It is not possible to control the tacticity of polypropene with a Zr catalyst such as (<b>19</b>), and an atactic polymer results. However, with other catalysts it is possible to control the tacticity. The type of catalyst normally used to control the tacticity has a metal atom bonded to two indenyl groups that are linked by a CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> bridge. Reaction of the bis(indenyl) fragment with a metal salt gives rise to three compounds: two enantiomers, (<b>24</b>) and (<b>25</b>), which have <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry, and a nonchiral compound, (<b>26</b>). These compounds are called <i>ansa</i>-metallocenes (the name is derived from the Latin for &#x2018;handle&#x2019;, and is used to indicate a bridge). It is possible to separate the two enantiomers from the nonchiral compounds, and both enantiomers of these <i>ansa</i>-metallocenes can catalyse the stereoregular polymerization of propene.</p>
<p class="la-indent">If we now consider the coordination of propene to one of the enantiomeric compounds (<b>24</b>) or (<b>25</b>), there is a second constraint in addition to the steric factor mentioned above (the CH<sub>2</sub> group pointing towards the cleft). Of the two potential arrangements of the methyl group shown in (<b>27</b>) and (<b>28</b>), the latter is disfavoured by a steric interaction with the phenyl ring of the indenyl group. During the polymerization reaction, the R group migrates preferentially to one side of the propene molecule; coordination of another</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> The tethering of a catalyst to a solid support allows easy separation of the catalyst with little loss in catalyst activity.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindentt">One popular technique has been the <b>tethering</b> of a homogeneous catalyst to a solid support. Thus, a hydrogenation catalyst such as Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst can be attached to a silica surface by means of a long hydrocarbon chain:</p>

<p class="la-noindent">When the silica monolith is immersed in a solvent, the rhodium-based catalytic site behaves as though it is in solution, and reactivity is largely unaffected. Separation of the products from the catalyst simply requires the decanting of the solvent. Commercially available functionalized silica precursors include amino-, acrylate-, allyl-, benzyl-, bromo-, chloro-, cyano-, hydroxy-, iodo-, phenyl-, styryl-, and vinyl-substituted reagents. Relatively simple reactions can result in the synthesis of a whole host of further reagents (such as the phosphine compound in the scheme above). In addition to silica, polystyrene, polyethene, polypropene, and various clays have been used as the solid support and have led to reports of the successful heterogenization of most reactions that rely on soluble metal complexes.</p>

Because of the magnetic properties of the catalyst, it can be successfully recovered by a simple external magnet, removing the need for filtration. <a id="page_760" class="page">Page 760, Chapter 25: Catalysis</a></p>


<p class="la-indent">In some cases the activity of a supported catalyst is greater than that of its unsupported analogue. This improvement normally takes the form of enhanced selectivity brought about by the steric demands of approaching a catalyst constrained to a surface, or an increase in catalyst turnover frequencies brought about by protection from the support. Often, however, supported catalysts suffer from catalyst leaching and reduced activity.</p>

If it can be arranged that the catalysts are preferentially soluble in the ionic phase (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.13">Section 4.13</a>g) (for instance, by making them ionic), immiscible organic solvents can be used to extract organic products. As an example, consider the hydroformylation of alkenes by a Rh catalyst with phosphine ligands. When the ligand used is triphenylphosphine, the catalyst is extracted from the ionic liquid together with the products. However, when an ionic sulfonated triphenylphosphine is used as the ligand, the catalyst remains in the ionic liquid and product separation from the catalyst is complete. It should be borne in mind that the ionic liquid phase is not always unreactive, and may induce alternative reactions.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The fluorous biphase system, which typically consists of a fluorinated hydrocarbon and a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; organic solvent such as methylbenzene, offers two principal advantages over aqueous/organic phases: the fluorous phase is unreactive, so sensitive groups (such as hydrolytically unstable groups) are stable in it, and polyfluorinated and hydrocarbon solvents, which are not miscible at room temperatures, become so on heating, giving rise to a genuinely homogeneous system. A catalyst that contains polyfluorinated groups is preferentially retained in the fluorous solvent, with the reactants (and products) preferentially soluble in the hydrocarbon phase. <a href="#fig_25.29">Figure 25.29</a> indicates the type of sequence that is used. Separation of the products from the catalyst becomes a trivial matter of decanting one liquid from another. A number of ligand systems that confer fluorous solubility on a catalyst have been developed; typically they are phosphine based such as (<b>34</b>), (<b>35</b>), and (<b>36</b>). Rhodium- and Pd-based catalysts of these ligands have then been prepared. With a fluorous solvent such as perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (<b>37</b>), miscibility with an organic phase can be achieved at 70&#x00B0;C, and catalysts have been used in hydrogenation (<a href="#sec_25.4">Section 25.4</a>), hydroformylation (<a href="#sec_25.5">Section 25.5</a>), and hydroboration reactions.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3g"><b>TUTORIAL PROBLEMS</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.1</b></span> A catalyst might not just lower the enthalpy of activation, but might make a significant change to the entropy of activation. Discuss this phenomenon. (See A. Haim, <i>J. Chem., Educ.</i>, 1989, <b>66</b>, 935.)</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.2</b></span> The addition of promoters can further enhance the rate of a catalysed reaction. Describe how the promoters allowed the iridium-based Cativa process to compete with the rhodium-based process in the carbonylation of methanol. (See A. Haynes, P.M. Maitlis, G.E. Morris, G.J. Sunley, H. Adams, and P.W. Badger, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, 2004, <b>126</b>, 2847.)</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.3</b></span> When direct evidence for a mechanism is not available, chemists frequently invoke analogies with similar systems. Describe how J.E. B&#x00E4;ckvall, B. &#x00C5;kermark, and S.O. Ljunggren (<i>J. Am. Chem. Soc</i>., 1979, <b>101</b>, 2411) inferred the attack of uncoordinated water on &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> in the Wacker process.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.4</b></span> Whereas many enantioselective catalysts require the precoordination of a substrate, this is not always the case. Use the example of asymmetric epoxidation to demonstrate the validity of this statement, and indicate the advantages that such catalysts might have over catalysts that require precoordination of a substrate. (See M. Palucki, N.S. Finney, P.J. Pospisil, M.L. G&#x00FC;ler, T. Ishida, and E.N. Jacobsen, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1998, <b>120</b>, 948.)</p>

<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.6</b></span> Summarize the potential impact of heterogeneous oxidation catalysts in chemistry. (See J.M. Thomas and R. Raja, Innovations in oxidation catalysis leading to a sustainable society. <i>Catalysis Today</i>, 2006, <b>117</b>, 22.)</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.7</b></span> Discuss the applications and mechanisms of oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts such as bismuth molybdate. (See, for example, R.K. Grasselli, <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 1986, <b>63</b>, 216.)</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.8</b></span> Discuss the advantages of a solid support in catalysis by reference to the use of [Ni(POEt)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>4</sub> in alkene isomerization. (See A.J. Seen, <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 2004, <b>81</b>, 383; and K.R. Birdwhistell and J. Lanza, <i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 1997, <b>74</b>, 579.)</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.9</b></span> J.A. Botas <i>et</i> al discuss the catalytic conversion of vegetable oils into hydrocarbons suitable for use as biofuels (<i>Catalysis Today</i>, 2012, <b>195</b>, 1, 59). What are the most important features of catalysts that are used for these reactions? How was the incorporation of transition metals expected to modify catalyst properties? Outline how the modified catalysts were prepared and characterized. What reactions occurred in the reactor in addition to catalytic cracking? Which reactions lead to aromatic products? Which of the modified catalysts produced most coke build-up? Explain why this did not deactivate the catalyst.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.10</b></span> &#x03B1;-Pinene is a major component of natural turpentine, and its polymer is nontoxic and used in a wide variety of industrial applications such as adhesives, varnishes, food packaging, and chewing gum. Novel catalysts for the polymerization of &#x03B1;-pinene have been produced based on niobium and tantalum pentahalides (M. Hayatifar, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Catalysis Today</i>, 2012, <b>192</b>, 1, 177). Which catalyst was the most effective for the polymerization and why are the reaction conditions so attractive? Describe the nature of the catalyst &#x2212; &#x03B1;-pinene interaction.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.11</b></span> A. Arbaoui and C. Redshaw (<i>Polym. Chem.</i>, 2010, <b>1</b>, 801) review catalysts for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers via ring-opening metathesis polymerization. Summarize the need for biodegradable polymers and why new catalysts are required. From the details given, identify which groups of metals give the most active catalysts and with which types of ligands. Illustrate with examples.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>25.12</b></span> The Schrock and Grubbs catalysts are widely used for alkene metathesis reactions. Write a review of how these homogeneous catalysts have been heterogenized.</p>
