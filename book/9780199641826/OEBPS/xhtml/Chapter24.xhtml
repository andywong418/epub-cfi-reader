<p class="av-noindentd"><b>Materials chemistry is primarily concerned with the study of solids that exhibit useful properties, covering their synthesis and characterization. It is an area of inorganic chemistry that is developing very rapidly and in this chapter we discuss the areas of current interest and recent advances. Initially, we describe how inorganic materials are synthesized as bulk solids. The important role of defects in enabling ion migration in solids is presented, building on the description of simple defects in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. We then discuss key classes of inorganic materials, including intercalation compounds, complex electronic oxides, magnetic compounds, framework structures, pigments, and molecular materials. Finally, we discuss nanomaterials, which are inorganic solids with one dimension below 100 nm.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt" style="margin-top:2em;">Much of the current research in solid-state chemistry is motivated by the search for commercially useful materials. One recent focus has been on new solids used for the generation, storage, and use of energy, including that obtained from renewable sources. Thus, materials with high efficiencies for photovoltaic and photocatalytic water-splitting applications, that convert solar energy into electricity and fuel (hydrogen), respectively, are being sought. New materials for use in the components of rechargeable batteries and fuel cells are needed for the storage and delivery of mobile power in applications such as portable electronic goods and electric vehicles. Many components of electronic and optical devices used for information processing, storage, and display are also being improved through the development of new solid-state materials. In industrial chemistry, new microporous solids for use in molecular separations and heterogeneous catalysis are being developed.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The chemistry of the solid state is a vigorous and exciting area of research, partly because of the potential technological applications of the materials, but also because their properties are challenging to understand. In this chapter we will draw on some of the concepts initially developed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> for understanding solids, such as lattice energetics and band structure. We will also introduce some new concepts that are needed to understand the events that occur in the interior of solids and discuss the useful properties that arise from nonstoichiometry and ion mobility. The fact that, in solid materials, atoms and ions can interact in a cooperative manner gives rise to many of the fascinating and useful chemical properties.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The scope for the synthesis of new inorganic solids is enormous. For example, although it is known that 100 structural types account for 95 per cent of the known binary (A<sub><i>a</i></sub>B<sub><i>b</i></sub>, such as brass, CuZn) and ternary (A<sub><i>a</i></sub>B<sub><i>b</i></sub>C<sub><i>c</i></sub>) intermetallic compounds, there are plenty of opportunities for extending these studies to the synthesis and characterization of four-, five-, and six-component&#x2014;so-called multinary&#x2014;systems. This is particularly so for</p>

Furthermore, once a new functional inorganic solid has been produced, the potential exists to produce it in different forms, such as thin layers or as nanoparticles. These nanomaterials may show new effects and properties based on their restricted scale, less than 100 nm, and so lead to new applications and uses.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3a"><b>Synthesis of materials</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">Much of synthetic inorganic chemistry, including the coordination chemistry of the metals and organometallic chemistry, makes use of the conversion of molecules by the replacement of one ligand by another in a solution-based reaction. Processes of this type generally have relatively small activation energies and can be undertaken at low temperatures, typically between 0&#x00B0;C and 150&#x00B0;C, and in solvents that permit the migration of reacting species. Rapid molecular migration in solvents results in fairly short reaction times. The formation of solid materials by reaction of solids, however, involves rather different reactions as the high lattice energies of their extended structures, often greater than 2000 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, need to be overcome and ion migration in the solid state is normally slow except at very elevated temperatures. Some inorganic materials can be prepared from solutions at much lower temperatures, where the building blocks are condensed together to form the extended structure. This section focuses on the synthesis of a bulk single-phase material rather than the control of crystallite size, particle morphology, and the production of thin films; these additional aspects of synthesis in materials chemistry, of great relevance to nanomaterial chemistry, are covered in <a href="#sec_24.22">Sections 24.22</a>&#x2013;<a href="#sec_24.26">24.26</a>.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_24.1">
<h3 class="av-h3">24.1 <b>The formation of bulk material</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">New materials can be obtained by two main methods. One is the direct reaction of two or more solids which involves breaking down their lattices and reforming the new structure; the other is the linking of polyhedral units from solution and deposition of the newly formed solid.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(a) Methods of direct synthesis</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Many complex solids can be obtained by direct reaction of the components at high temperatures. Components may be mixed initially on the atomic scale via solution and sol&#x2013;gel processes.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The most widely used method for the synthesis of bulk inorganic solids involves heating the solid reactants together at a high temperature, typically between 500 and 1500&#x00B0;C, for an extended period. Normally a complex oxide may be obtained by heating a mixture of all the oxides of the various metals present; alternatively, simple compounds that decompose to give the oxides may be used instead of the oxide itself. Thus, ternary oxides, such as BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and quaternary oxides, such as YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, are synthesized by heating together the following mixtures for several days:</p>
<figure class="av-image" style="margin-left:-2em;">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_994.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">High temperatures are used in these syntheses to accelerate the slow diffusion of ions in solids and to overcome the high Coulombic attractions between the ions. Reactants are normally in the form of powders, with small particle sizes of typically &#x003C;10 &#x00B5;m, that are thoroughly ground together before heating, with the aim of reducing the ion diffusion pathlengths. The direct method is applicable to many other inorganic material types, such as the syntheses of complex chlorides and dense, anhydrous metal aluminosilicates:</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_995.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">Most simple binary oxides are available commercially as pure, polycrystalline powders with typical particle dimensions of a few micrometres. Alternatively, the decomposition of a simple metal salt precursor, either prior to or during reaction, leads to a finely divided <a id="page_657" class="page">Page 657, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>oxide. Such precursors include metal carbonates, hydroxides, oxalates, and nitrates. An additional advantage of precursors is that they are normally stable in air, whereas many oxides are hygroscopic and pick up carbon dioxide from the air. Thus, in the synthesis of BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, barium carbonate, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, which starts to decompose to BaO above 900&#x00B0;C, would be ground together with TiO<sub>2</sub> in the correct stoichiometric proportions, using a pestle and mortar or ball mill (where the solid is shaken vigorously with small hard spheres inside a canister). The mixture is then transferred to a crucible, normally constructed of an inert material such as vitreous silica, recrystallized alumina, or platinum, and placed in a furnace. Even at high temperatures the reaction is slow and typically takes several days.</p>

When the gel is dried at high temperatures, dense ceramics or glasses are formed. Drying at low temperatures above the critical pressure of water produces porous solids known as xerogels or aerogels.</figcaption>

</aside>

<p class="av-indent">A variety of methods can be used to improve reaction rates, including pelletizing the reaction mixture under high pressure to increase the contact between the reactant particles, regrinding the mixture periodically to introduce virgin reactant interfaces, and the use of &#x2018;fluxes&#x2019;, low-melting solids that aid the ion-diffusion processes. The size of the reactant particles is a major factor in controlling the time it takes a reaction to proceed to completion. The larger the particles, the lower their total surface area and therefore the smaller the area at which the reaction can take place. Furthermore, the distances over which diffusion of ions must occur are much greater for larger particles, which are typically several micrometres in size for a polycrystalline material. In order to increase the rate of reaction and allow solid-state reactions to occur at lower temperatures, reactants having small particle sizes, between 10 nm and 1 &#x00B5;m, and large surface areas are often deliberately employed.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Improved mixing of the reactant species can also be achieved by using solutions at an early stage of the reaction process. These methods are embodied in the <b>sol&#x2013;gel process</b> (sometimes also called the Pechini method), which is described schematically in <a href="#fig_24.1">Fig. 24.1</a>. Sol&#x2013;gel processes can be used to produce crystalline complex metal oxides, ceramics, nanoparticles (<a href="#sec_24.23">Sections 24.23</a> and <a href="#sec_24.24">24.24</a>), and high-surface-area compounds such as silica gel and glasses (<a href="#sec_24.7">Section 24.7</a>). The advantages of starting with solutions is that the reactants are mixed as solvated species at the atomic level, so overcoming the problems associated with the direct reaction of two or more solid phases consisting of micrometre-sized particles. In the simplest reaction of this type, a solution of metal ions (for example, metal nitrates) is converted to a solid through a variety of methods such as evaporation of the solvent or precipitation as a simple mixed metal salt. This solid is then heated to produce the target material. Two simple examples, as routes to producing the complex oxides La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively, are</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_996.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">A typical sol&#x2013;gel process involves producing an aqueous solution of the various metal salts, adding complexing agents such as carboxylic acids or alcohols, and slow evaporation of the water leading to a viscous solution or gel. Alternatively, metal alkoxide precursors can be dissolved in an alcohol, and the addition of water then causes hydrolysis to produce a thick gel. Further drying of these gels (which consist of the metal species linked through organic alkoxides and carboxylates) at high temperatures leads to solids which can be decomposed at relatively low temperatures (300&#x2013;600&#x00B0;C) to produce the desired complex oxide product. As well as the advantages of reduced reaction times, a result of the intimate mixing of the reactants, the final decomposition temperature is somewhat lower than that needed for the direct reaction of the oxides. The use of a lower temperature can also have the effect of reducing the size of the particles formed in the final decomposition reaction. Further applications of this method for the synthesis of nanoparticles are covered in <a href="#sec_24.23">Section 24.23</a>.</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">

<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_997.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="av-indent">The reaction environment may need to be controlled if a particular oxidation state is required or one of the reactants is volatile. Solid-state reactions can be carried out in a controlled atmosphere, using a tube furnace in which a gas can be passed over the reaction mixture while it is being heated. An example of such a reaction is the use of an inert gas to prevent oxidation, as in the preparation of TlTaO<sub>3</sub>: <a id="page_658" class="page">Page 658, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>where the oxidation of Tl(I) to Tl(III), which would occur in air, is avoided.</p>
<p class="av-indent">High gas pressures may also be used to control the composition of the product. For example, Fe(III) is normally obtained in oxygen at or near normal pressures but Fe(IV) may be formed, as in the production of Sr<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> from mixtures of SrO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> under several hundred atmospheres of oxygen. For volatile reactants the reaction mixture is normally sealed in a glass tube, under vacuum, prior to heating. Examples of such reactions are</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_998.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">Sulfur and thallium(III) oxide are volatile at the respective reaction temperatures and would be lost from the reaction mixture in an open vessel, leading to products of the incorrect stoichiometry.</p>
<p class="av-indent">High pressures can also be used to affect the outcome of a solid-state chemical reaction. Specialized apparatus, typically based on large presses, allows reactions between solids to take place at pressures of up to about 100 GPa (1 Mbar) at temperatures close to 1500&#x00B0;C. Reactions carried out under such conditions promote the formation of dense, higher-coordination-number structures. An example is the production of MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, with a perovskite-like structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>) and a six-coordinate Si in an octahedral SiO<sub>6</sub> unit, rather than the normal tetrahedral SiO<sub>4</sub> unit found in most silicates. Such apparatus can also be used to make diamonds from graphite (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box14.1">Box 14.1</a>). Small-scale reactions can be undertaken at very high pressures in &#x2018;diamond anvil cells&#x2019;, in which the faces of two opposed diamonds are pushed together in a vice-like apparatus to generate pressures of up to 100 GPa.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(b) Solution methods</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Frameworks formed from polyhedral species can be obtained by condensation reactions in solution.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Many inorganic materials, especially framework structures, can be synthesized by crystallization from solution. Although the methods used are very diverse, the following are typical reactions that occur in water and lead to materials with extended structures consisting of metal centres linked through anions:</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">

</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">KMnF<sub>3</sub> adopts the perovskite structure type (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Solution methods are extended by using <b>hydrothermal techniques</b>, in which the reacting solution is heated above its normal boiling point in a sealed vessel. Such reactions are important for the synthesis of open-structure aluminosilicates (zeolites), analogous porous structures based on linked oxo-polyhedra, and related <b>metal&#x2013;organic frameworks</b> (MOF), in which metal ions are linked by coordinating organic species such as carboxylates (<a href="#sec_24.12">Section 24.12</a>). While some zeolites can be made below the boiling point of water, as with the synthesis of zeolite LTA, <sup><a id="ich24fn1" href="#ch24fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_1000.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="av-foot"><sup><a id="ch24fn1"></a><a href="#ich24fn1">1</a></sup> LTA is an example of the three-letter codes used by the International Zeolite Association to identify different zeolite (aluminosilicate) structures.</p>
<p class="noindent">others require higher temperatures and the addition of a <b>structure-directing agent</b> (SDA) which control the topology of the framework produced. Thus the synthesis of zeolite BEA, with the composition Na<sub>0.92</sub>K<sub>0.62</sub>(TEA)<sub>7.6</sub>[Al<sub>4.53</sub>Si<sub>59.47</sub>O<sub>128</sub>] (TEA &#x003D; tetraethylammonium cation), involves the reaction of sodium aluminate, silica, NaCl, KCl, and the SDA tetraethylammonium hydroxide. These porous structures are often thermodynamically metastable with respect to conversion to denser structure types, so they cannot be made by direct high-temperature reactions. For example, the sodium aluminosilicate zeolite LTA, Na<sub>12</sub>[Si<sub>12</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>O<sub>48</sub>]&#x00B7;<i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, formed in solution converts on heating above 800&#x00B0;C to the dense aluminosilicate NaSiAlO<sub>4</sub>. Recently, solvents such as liquid ammonia, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, <a id="page_659" class="page">Page 659, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>and organic amines have been used in so-called <b>solvothermal reactions</b>. Reactions in ionic liquids, often salts of organic cationic species with low melting points (below or near room temperature, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.13">Section 4.13g</a>), can also be undertaken to produce zeolites and are known as <b>ionothermal</b> reactions.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Although high-temperature direct-combination methods and solvothermal techniques are the most commonly used methods in materials chemistry, some reactions involving solids can occur at low temperatures if there is no major change in structure. These so-called &#x2018;intercalation reactions&#x2019; are discussed in <a href="#sec_24.9">Section 24.9</a>.</p>

These defects, which are mainly interstitial (Frenkel-type) or vacancies (Schottky-type), are important because they influence electrical conductivity and chemical reactivity. Electrical conduction can arise from the motion of ions through the solid, and this motion is often enhanced by the presence of defects.

Therefore, it should not be surprising that defects may cluster together and sometimes form lines and planes, thus reducing the average enthalpy of formation.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Tungsten oxides illustrate the formation of planes of defects. As illustrated in <a href="#fig_24.2">Fig. 24.2</a>, the idealized structure of WO<sub>3</sub> (which is usually referred to as the &#x2018;ReO<sub>3</sub> structure&#x2019;; see <a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>) consists of WO<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing all vertices. To picture the formation of the defect plane, we imagine the removal of shared O atoms along a diagonal. Then adjacent slabs slip past each other in a motion that results in the completion of the vacant coordination sites around each W atom. This shearing motion creates edge-shared octahedra along a diagonal. The resulting structure was named a <b>crystallographic shear plane</b> by A.D. Wadsley, who first devised this way of describing extended planar defects. Crystallographic shear planes randomly distributed in the solid are called <b>Wadsley defects</b>. Such defects lead to a continuous range of compositions, as in tungsten oxide (made by heating and reducing WO<sub>3</sub> with tungsten metal), which ranges from WO<sub>3</sub> to WO<sub>2.93</sub>. If, however, the crystallographic shear planes are distributed in a nonrandom, periodic manner, so giving rise to a new unit cell, then we should regard the material as a new stoichiometric phase. Thus, when even more O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions are removed from tungsten oxide, a series of discrete phases having ordered crystallographic shear planes and compositions W<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>3<i>n</i>&#x2212;2</sub> (<i>n</i> &#x003D; 20, 24, 25, and 40) are observed. Compounds with closely spaced compositions that contain shear planes are known for oxides of W, Mo, Ti, V, and some of their complex oxides, for example the tungsten bronzes M<sub>8</sub>W<sub>9</sub>O<sub>47</sub> (M &#x003D; Nb, Ta) and the &#x2018;Magn&#x00E9;li phases&#x2019;, V<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2<i>n</i>&#x2212;1</sub> <a id="page_660" class="page">Page 660, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>(<i>n</i> &#x003D; 3 &#x2212; 9). Electron microscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.17">Section 8.17</a>) provides an excellent method of observing these defects experimentally because it reveals both ordered and random arrays of shear planes (<a href="#fig_24.3">Fig. 24.3</a>).</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.3 <b>Atom and ion diffusion</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The diffusion of ions in solids is strongly dependent on the presence of defects.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">Diffusion of atoms or ions in solids at room temperature is very much slower than the diffusion processes that occur in gases and liquids. This is why most solid-state reactions are undertaken at high temperatures (<a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>), where ion mobility increases significantly. However, there are some striking exceptions to this generalization. Diffusion of atoms or ions in solids is in fact very important in many areas of solid-state technology, such as semiconductor manufacture, the synthesis of new solids, fuel cells, sensors, metallurgy, and heterogeneous catalysis.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The rates at which ions move through a solid can often be understood in terms of the mechanism for their migration and the activation barriers the ions encounter as they move. The lowest-energy pathway generally involves defect sites with the roles summarized in <a href="#fig_24.4">Fig. 24.4</a>. Materials that show high rates of diffusion at moderate temperatures have the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="av-indentbulletl">&#x2022;<span class="av-space">&#160;</span>Low-energy barriers: so temperatures at (or a little above) 300 K are sufficient to permit ions to jump from site to site.</p>
<p class="av-indentbulletl">&#x2022;<span class="av-space">&#160;</span>Low charges and small radii: so, for example, the most mobile cation (other than the proton) and anion are Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, respectively. Reasonable mobilities are also found for Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>. More highly charged ions develop stronger electrostatic interactions and are less mobile.</p>

<p class="av-noindent">Any electrochemical cell, such as a battery, fuel cell, electrochromic display, or electrochemical sensor, requires an electrolyte. In many applications, an ionic solution (for example, dilute sulfuric acid in a lead&#x2013;acid battery) is an acceptable electrolyte, but because it is often desirable to avoid a liquid phase because of the possibility of spillage, there is considerable interest in the development of solid electrolytes. Two important and thoroughly studied solid electrolytes with mobile cations are silver tetraiodidomercurate(II), Ag<sub>2</sub>HgI<sub>4</sub>, and sodium &#x03B2;-alumina with the composition Na<sub>1&#x002B;<i>x</i></sub>Al<sub>11</sub>O<sub>17&#x002B;<i>x</i>/2</sub>. Other important fast-cationic conductors include NASICON (a name formed from the letters in &#x2018;Na superionic conductor&#x2019;) of composition Na<sub>1&#x002B;<i>x</i></sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Si<sub><i>x</i></sub>O<sub>12</sub>, lithium garnets such as Li<sub>7&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub> Ta<sub><i>x</i></sub>O<sub>12</sub>, and a number of proton conductors that operate at, or moderately above, room temperature, such as CsHSO<sub>4</sub> above 160&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Solids exhibiting high anion mobility are rarer than cationic conductors and generally show high conductivity only at elevated temperatures: anions are typically larger than cations and so the energy barrier for diffusion through the solid is high. As a consequence, fast anion conduction in solids is limited to F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> (with ionic radii 133 pm and 140 pm, respectively). Despite these limitations, anionic conductors play an important role in sensors and fuel cells, where a typical material is yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), of composition Y<sub><i>x</i></sub>Zr<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i>/2</sub>. <a href="#tab_24.1">Table 24.1</a> summarizes some typical ionic conductivity values of solid electrolytes and other ionically conducting media.</p>

In this case, the rigid and dense Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> slabs are bridged by a sparse array of O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions (<a href="#fig_24.7">Fig. 24.7</a>). The plane containing these bridging oxide ions also contains Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions, which can move from site to site because there are no major bottlenecks to hinder their motion. Many similar rigid materials having planes or channels through which ions can move are known; they are called <b>framework electrolytes</b>. Another closely related material, sodium &#x03B2;&#x2032;-alumina, has even less restricted motion of ions than &#x03B2;-alumina, and it has been found possible to substitute doubly-charged cations such as Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> or Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> for Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Anion mobility can occur at high temperatures in certain structures that contain high levels of anion vacancies.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">Michael Faraday reported in 1834 that red-hot solid PbF<sub>2</sub> is a good conductor of electricity. Much later it was recognized that the conductivity arises from the mobility of F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions through the solid. The property of anion conductivity is shared by other crystals having the fluorite structure. Ion transport in these solids is thought to be by an <b>interstitial mechanism</b> in which an F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion first migrates from its normal position into an interstitial site (a Frenkel-type defect, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.16">Section 3.16</a>) and then moves to a vacant F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> site.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Structures that have large numbers of vacant sites generally show the highest ionic conductivities because they provide a path for ion motion (although at very high levels of defects, clustering of the defects or the vacancies can lower the conductivity). These vacancies, which are equivalent to extrinsic defects, can be introduced in fairly high numbers into many simple oxides and fluorides by doping with appropriately chosen metal ions in different oxidation states. Zirconia, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, has a fluorite structure at high temperatures, but on cooling the pure material to room temperature it distorts to a monoclinic polymorph. The cubic fluorite structure may be stabilized at room temperature by replacing some Zr<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> with other ions, such as the similarly sized Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Y<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions. Doping with these ions of lower oxidation state results in the introduction of vacancies on the anion sites to preserve the charge neutrality of the material and produces, for example, Y<sub><i>x</i></sub>Zr<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x/</i>2</sub>, the material mentioned previously as yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). This material has completely occupied cation sites in the fluorite structure but high levels of anion vacancies, with 0 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 0.15. These vacant sites provide a path for oxide-ion diffusion through the structure so that a typical electrical conductivity in, for example, Ca<sub>0.15</sub>Zr<sub>0.85</sub>O<sub>1.85</sub> is 5 S cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 1000&#x00B0;C; note that this conductivity is much lower than typical solid-state cation conductivities, even at these very high temperatures, because of the large anion size.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The high oxide-ion conductivity of calcium-oxide-doped zirconia is exploited in a solid-state electrochemical sensor for measuring the partial pressure of oxygen in automobile exhaust systems (<a href="#fig_24.9">Fig. 24.9</a>).<sup><a id="ich24fn2" href="#ch24fn2">2</a></sup> The platinum electrodes in this cell adsorb O atoms and, if the partial pressures of oxygen are different between the sample and reference sides, there is a thermodynamic tendency for oxygen to migrate through the electrolyte as the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion.

As well as having uses in sensor devices, materials possessing oxide and proton ion conductivity are important in a number of types of fuel cell (<a href="#box_24.1">Box 24.1</a>).</p>

<p class="av-boxtitle"><a id="box_24.1"></a><b><span class="av-bgg">BOX 24.1</span> Solid oxide fuel cells</b></p>
</div>
<p class="av-boxpara">A fuel cell consists of an electrolyte sandwiched between two electrodes; oxygen passes over one electrode and the fuel over the other, generating electricity, water, and heat. The general operation and construction of a fuel cell that converts a fuel, such as hydrogen, methane, or methanol, by reaction with oxygen into electrical energy (and combustion products H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>) was described in Box 5.1. A variety of materials can be used as the electrolyte in such cells, including phosphoric acid, proton-exchange membranes, or, in <i>solid oxide fuel cells</i> (SOFCs), oxide-ion conductors.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">SOFCs operate at high temperatures and use an oxide-ion conductor as the electrolyte. The design of a typical SOFC is shown in <a href="#fig_b24.1">Fig. B24.1</a>. Each cell generates a limited potential difference but, as with the cells of a battery, a connected stack may be constructed in series to increase the potential difference and power supplied. Cells are connected electrically through an &#x2018;interconnect&#x2019; that can also be used to isolate the fuel and air supplies for each cell.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">The attraction of SOFCs is based on several aspects, including the clean conversion of fuel to electricity, low levels of noise pollution, the ability to cope with different fuels, and, most significantly, a high efficiency. Their high efficiency is a result of their high operating temperatures, typically between 500 and 1000&#x00B0;C. In high-temperature SOFCs the interconnect may be a ceramic such as lanthanum chromite (the perovskite LaCrO<sub>3</sub>); if the temperature is below 1000&#x00B0;C, an alloy such as Y/Cr may be used. The oxide-ion conductor used as the electrolyte in these very high-temperature SOFCs is normally YSZ.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="av-boxparai" style="margin-top:1em;">Intermediate-temperature SOFCs, which typically operate between 500 and 700&#176;C, have a number of advantages over very high-temperature devices in that there is reduced corrosion, a simpler design, and a muchreduced time to heat the system to the operating temperature. However, such devices require a material with excellent oxide-ion conductivities at lower temperatures to act as the electrolyte. The best-developed intermediate-temperature (less than about 600&#176;C) SOFC consists of an anode of Gd-doped CeO<sub>2</sub> (CGO)/Ni, an electrolyte of Gd-doped cerium oxide, and a cathode of the perovskite LSCF, (La,Sr)(Fe,Co)O<sub>3</sub> . The electrolyte material, CGO, possesses a much higher ionic conductivity than YSZ at these lower temperatures. Unfortunately, however, its electronic conductivity is also higher, and the use of a CGO electrolyte can result in reduced effi ciency as energy is wasted as a result of electrons fl owing through the electrolyte. For this reason new and better oxide-ion conductors are being sought, such as those mentioned in the text.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">One of the main advantages of SOFCs over other fuel-cell types is their ability to handle more convenient hydrocarbon fuels: other types of fuel cells have to rely on a clean supply of hydrogen for their operation. Because SOFCs operate at high temperature there is the opportunity to convert hydro carbons catalytically to hydrogen and carbon oxides within the system. Because of their size and the requirement to be heated to, and operate at, high temperatures, the applications of SOFCs focus on medium- to large-scale static systems, including small residential systems producing about 2 kW.</p></div>
<h4 class="av-h4" style="margin-top:2em;">(c) Mixed ionic–electronic conductors</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Solid materials can exhibit both ionic and electronic conductivity.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">Most ionic conductors, such as sodium &#946;<sup>&#8242;</sup>-alumina and YSZ, have low electronic conductivity (that is, conduction by electron rather than ion motion). Their application as solid electrolytes, in sensors for instance, requires this feature to avoid shorting out the cell. In some cases a combination of electronic and ionic conductivity is desirable, and this type of behaviour can be found in some d-metal compounds where defects allow O<sup>2-</sup>. conduction and the metal d orbitals provide an electronic conduction band. Many such materials re perovskite-based structures with mixed oxidation states at the B cation sites (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>). Two examples are La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-y</sub>	and La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>FeO<sub>3-y</sub>. These oxide systems are good electronic conductors with partially fi lled bands as a result of the nonintegral d-metal oxidation number, and can conduct by O<sup>2-</sup>. migration through the perovskite O 2. ion sites. This type of material is of use in solid oxide fuel cells (<a href="#box_24.1">Box 24.1</a>), one of the fuel cell types mentioned in Box 5.1, in which one electrode has to allow diffusion of ions through an electrically conducting electrode. <a id="page_665" class="page">Page 665, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>

<h3 class="av-h3a">Metal oxides, nitrides, and fluorides</h3>
<p class="av-noindent">In this section, we explore the binary compounds of O, N, and F with metals. These compounds, particularly oxides, are central to much solid-state chemistry on account of their stability, ease of synthesis, and variety in composition and structure. These attributes lead to the vast number of compounds that have been synthesized and the ability to tune the properties of a compound for a specific application based on their electronic, magnetic, or optical characteristics. As we shall see, a discussion of the chemical properties of these compounds also provides insight into defects, nonstoichiometry, ion diffusion, and the influence of these characteristics on physical properties.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The chemical properties of metal fluorides parallel much of that of metal oxides, but the lower charge of the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion means that equivalent stoichiometries are produced with cations having lower charges, as in KMn(II)F<sub>3</sub> compared with SrMn(IV)O<sub>3</sub>. Compounds containing the nitride ion, N<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>, in combination with one or more metal ions have only been developed to a significant extent in the last 20 years. The area of mixed-anion solid-state chemistry, where compounds containing transition metals in combination with more than one anion, such as oxide-nitrides and oxide-fluorides, is one where rapid advances are being made in terms of new materials and structure types.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.5 <b>Monoxides of the 3d metals</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">The monoxides of most of the 3d metals adopt the rock-salt structure (<a href="#tab_24.2">Table 24.2</a>), though these seemingly simple compounds are usually obtained with significant deviations from the nominal MO stoichiometry.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(a) Defects and nonstoichiometry</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The nonstoichiometry of Fe</b><sub><b>1&#x2212;</b><b><i>x</i></b></sub><b>O arises from the creation of vacancies on the Fe</b><sup><b>2&#x002B;</b></sup> <b>octahedral sites, with each vacancy charge-compensated by the conversion of two Fe</b><sup><b>2&#x002B;</b></sup> <b>ions to two Fe</b><sup><b>3&#x002B;</b></sup> <b>ions.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">The origin of nonstoichiometry in FeO has been studied in more detail than that in most other MO compounds. In fact, it is found experimentally that stoichiometric FeO does not exist but rather a range of iron-deficient compounds Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O, 0.13 &#x003C; <i>x</i> &#x003C; 0.04, can be obtained by quenching (cooling very rapidly) iron(II) oxide from high temperatures. The compound Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O is in fact <b>metastable</b> at room temperature, meaning that it is thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation into iron metal an-
  d Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> but does not convert for kinetic reasons. The general consensus is that the structure of Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O is derived from the rock-salt structure of an idealized &#x2018;FeO&#x2019; by the presence of vacancies on the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> octahedral sites, and that each vacancy is charge-compensated by the conversion of two adjacent Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions to two Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions. The relative ease of oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(III) accounts for the fairly broad range of compositions of Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O. At high temperatures, the interstitial Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions associate with the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> vacancies (or defects) to form clusters distributed throughout the structure (<a href="#fig_24.10">Fig. 24.10</a>).</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The 3d-metal monoxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO are semiconductors; TiO and VO are metallic conductors.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">The 3d-metal monoxides MnO, Fe<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O, CoO, and NiO have low electrical conductivities that increase with temperature (corresponding to semiconducting behaviour) or have such large band gaps that they are insulators. The electron or hole migration in these oxide semiconductors is attributed to a hopping mechanism. In this model, the electron hops from one localized metal atom site to the next. When it lands on a new site it causes the surrounding ions to adjust their locations and the electron or hole is trapped temporarily in the potential well produced by this distortion. The electron resides at its new site until it is thermally activated to migrate into another nearby site. Another aspect of this charge-hopping mechanism is that the electron or hole tends to associate with local defects, so the activation energy for charge transport may also include the energy of freeing the hole from its position next to a defect.</p>

</aside>
<p class="av-indent">Hopping contrasts with the band model for semiconductivity, discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.20">Section 3.20</a>, where the conduction and valence electrons occupy orbitals that spread through the whole crystal. The difference stems from the less-diffuse d orbitals in the monoxides of the mid-to-late 3d metals, which are too compact to form the broad bands necessary for metallic conduction. When NiO is doped with Li<sub>2</sub>O in an O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere a solid solution Li<sub><i>x</i></sub>(Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>)<sub>1&#x2212;2<i>x</i></sub>(Ni<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>)<sub><i>x</i></sub>O is obtained, which has greatly increased conductivity for reasons similar to the increase in conductivity of Si when doped with In (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.20">Section 3.20</a>). The characteristic pronounced increase in electronic conductivity with increasing temperature of metal oxide semiconductors is used in &#x2018;thermistors&#x2019; to measure temperature.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In contrast to the semiconductivity of the monoxides in the centre and right of the 3d series, TiO and VO have high electronic conductivities that decrease with increasing temperature. This metallic conductivity persists over a broad composition range from highly oxygen-rich Ti<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>O to metal-rich TiO<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>. In these compounds, a conduction band is formed by the overlap of the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals of metal ions in neighbouring octahedral sites that are oriented towards each other (<a href="#fig_24.11">Fig. 24.11</a>). The radial extension of the d orbitals of these early d-block elements is greater than for elements later in the period, and a band results from their overlap (<a href="#fig_24.12">Fig. 24.12</a>); this band is only partly filled. The widely varying composition of TiO appears to be associated with the electronic delocalization: the conduction band serves as a rapidly accessible source and sink of electrons that can readily compensate for the formation of vacancies.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Another interesting aspect of the M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> compounds is the formation of solid solutions of dark-green Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and colourless Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to form brilliant red ruby. As remarked in <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.7">Section 20.7</a>, this shift in the ligand-field transitions of Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> stems from the compression of the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions around Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> host structure (in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> the lattice constants are <a id="page_668" class="page">Page 668, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a><i>a</i> &#x003D; 475 pm and <i>c</i> &#x003D; 1300 pm while in Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> the corresponding values are larger at 493 pm and 1356 pm, respectively). The compression shifts the absorption towards the blue as the strength of the ligand field increases, and the solid appears red in white light. The responsiveness of the absorption (and fluorescence) spectrum of Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions to compression is sometimes used to measure pressure in high-pressure experiments. In this application, a tiny crystal of ruby in one segment of the sample can be interrogated by visible light and the shift in its fluorescence spectrum provides an indication of the pressure inside the cell.</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The rhenium trioxide structure can be constructed from ReO<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing all vertices in three dimensions.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">The rhenium trioxide structure type is very simple, consisting of a cubic unit cell with Re atoms at the corners and O atoms at the midpoint of each edge (<a href="#fig_24.16">Fig. 24.16</a>). Alternatively, the structure can be considered to be derived from ReO<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing all vertices. The structure is also closely related to a perovskite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>) in which the A-type cation has been removed from the unit cell. Materials adopting the rhenium trioxide structure are relatively rare. This rarity is in part due to the requirement of the oxidation state M(VI) when M is in combination with oxygen. Rhenium(VI) oxide, ReO<sub>3</sub>, itself and one form of UO<sub>3</sub> (&#x03B4;-UO<sub>3</sub>) have this structure type, and WO<sub>3</sub> exists in a slightly distorted version of it. In WO<sub>3</sub>, the WO<sub>6</sub> octahedra are slightly distorted and tilted relative to each other so that the W&#x0064;O&#x0064;W bond angle is not 180&#x00B0;.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Rhenium trioxide itself is a bright-red, lustrous solid. Its electrical conductivity at room temperature is similar to that of copper metal. The band structure for this compound contains a band derived from the Re t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals and the O2p orbitals (<a href="#fig_24.17">Fig. 24.17</a>). This band can contain up to six electrons per Re atom but is only partially filled for the Re<sup>6&#x002B;</sup> d<sup>1</sup> configuration, so producing the observed metallic properties.</p>

<p class="av-noindent">The d-block higher oxides Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and many related mixed-metal compounds, such as ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, have very useful magnetic properties. They all adopt the structural type of the mineral spinel, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and have the general formula AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Most oxide spinels are formed with a combination of A<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and B<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cations (that is, as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mtext>A</mtext><mrow><mtext>2+</mtext></mrow></msup><msubsup><mtext>B</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><mtext>in</mtext><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msup><mrow><mtext>Mg</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2+</mtext></mrow></msup><msub><mrow><mo stretchy='false'>[</mo><msup><mrow><mtext>Al</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>3+</mtext></mrow></msup> <mo stretchy='false'>]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub></mrow></math>), although there are a number of spinels that can be formulated with A<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> and B<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> cations (as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mtext>A</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msup><msup><mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo></msup><msubsup><mtext>B</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> as in Ge<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>[Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The spinel structure was described briefly in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>, where we saw that it consists of an fcc array of O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions in which the A ions reside in one-eighth of the tetrahedral holes and the B ions inhabit half the octahedral holes (<a href="#fig_24.18">Fig. 24.18</a>); this structure is commonly denoted A[B<sub>2</sub>]O<sub>4</sub>, where the atom type in the square bracket represents that occupying the octahedral sites. In the inverse spinel structure, the cation distribution is B[AB]O<sub>4</sub>, with the more abundant B-type cation distributed over both coordination geometries. Lattice-enthalpy calculations based on a simple ionic model indicate that, for A<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and B<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, the normal spinel structure, A[B<sub>2</sub>]O<sub>4</sub>, should be the more stable. The observation that many d-metal spinels do not conform to this expectation has been traced to the effect of ligand-field stabilization energies on the site preferences of the ions.</p>

<p class="av-indent">The <b>occupation factor</b>, <i>&#x03BB;</i>, of a spinel is the fraction of B atoms in the tetrahedral sites: <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 0 for a normal spinel and <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 0,5 for an inverse spinel, B[AB]O<sub>4</sub>. Intermediate <i>&#x03BB;</i> values indicate a level of disorder in the distribution, where B-type cations occupy that portion of the tetrahedral sites. The distribution of cations in (A<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>,B<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) spinels (<a href="#tab_24.3">Table 24.3</a>) illustrates that, for d<sup>0</sup> A and B ions, the normal structure is preferred, as predicted by electrostatic considerations. <a href="#tab_24.3">Table 24.3</a> shows that, when A<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is a d<sup>6</sup>, d<sup>7</sup>, d<sup>8</sup>, or d<sup>9</sup> ion and B<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, the inverse structure is generally favoured. This preference can be traced to the lack of ligand-field stabilization (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a> and <a href="#fig_24.13">Fig. 24.13</a>) of the high-spin d<sup>5</sup> Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion in either the octahedral or the tetrahedral site and the ligand-field stabilization of the other d<sup><i>n</i></sup> ions in the octahedral site. For other combinations of d-metal ions on the A and B sites the relative ligand-field stabilization energies of the different arrangements of the two ions on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites need to be calculated. It is also important to note that simple ligand-field stabilization appears to work over this limited range of cations. More detailed <a id="page_669" class="page">Page 669, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>analysis is necessary when cations of different radii are present or any ions that are present do not adopt the high-spin configuration typical of most metals in spinels (for instance, Co<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is low-spin d<sup>6</sup>). Moreover, because <i>&#x03BB;</i> is often found to depend on the temperature, care has to be taken in the synthesis of a spinel with a specific distribution of cations because slow cooling or quenching of a sample from a high reaction temperature can produce quite different cation distributions.</p>

<p class="av-indent" style="margin-top:1em;">The inverse spinels of formula AFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are sometimes classified as <b>ferrites</b> (the same term also applies in different circumstances to other iron oxides). When <i>RT</i> &#x003E; <i>J</i>, where <i>J</i> is the energy of interaction of the spins on different ions, ferrites are paramagnetic. However, when <i>RT</i> &#x003C; <i>J</i>, a ferrite may be either ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic. The antiparallel alignment of spins characteristic of antiferromagnetism is illustrated by ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which has the cation distribution Fe[ZnFe]O<sub>4</sub>. In this compound the Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions (with <i>S</i> &#x003D; 5/2) in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites are antiferromagnetically coupled, through a superexchange mechanism (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>), below 9.5 K to give nearly zero net magnetic moment to the solid as a whole; note that Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> as a d<sup>10</sup> ion makes no contribution to the magnetic moment of the material.</p>

<p class="av-indent">The perovskite structure is often observed to be distorted such that the unit cell is no longer centrosymmetric, and a portion of the crystal can acquire an overall permanent electric polarization as a result of aligning the directions of ion displacements within that part of the crystal. Some polar crystals are <b>ferroelectric</b> in the sense that they resemble ferromagnets, but instead of the electron spins being aligned over a region of the crystal (often termed a <i>domain</i>), the electric dipole moments of many unit cells are aligned. As a result, the relative permittivity, which reflects the polarity of a compound, for a ferroelectric material often exceeds 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>3</sup> and can be as high as 1.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup>; for comparison, the relative permittivity of liquid water is about 80 at room temperature. Barium titanate, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, is the most extensively studied example of such a material. At temperatures above 120&#x00B0;C this compound has the perfect cubic perovskite structure. At room temperature, it adopts a lower-symmetry tetragonal unit cell in which the various ions can be considered as having been displaced from their normal high-symmetry sites (<a href="#fig_24.20">Fig. 24.20</a>). This displacement results in a spontaneous polarization of the unit cell and formation of an electric dipole; coupling between these ion displacements, and therefore the induced dipoles, is very weak. Application of an external electric field aligns these dipoles throughout the material, resulting in a bulk polarization in a particular direction, which can persist after removal of the electric field. The temperature below which this spontaneous polarization can occur and the material behaves as a ferroelectric is called the <b>Curie temperature</b> (<i>T</i><sub>C</sub>; <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>). For BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>C</sub> &#x003D; 120&#x00B0;C. The high relative permittivity of barium titanate leads to its use in capacitors, where its presence allows up to 1000 times the charge to be stored in comparison with a capacitor with air between the plates. The introduction of dopants into the barium titanate structure, forming solid solutions, allows various properties of the compound to be tuned. For example, the replacement of Ba by Sr or of Ti by Zr causes a sharp lowering of <i>T</i><sub>C</sub>.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Another characteristic of many crystals, including a number of perovskites that lack a centre of symmetry, is <b>piezoelectricity</b>, the generation of an electrical field when the crystal is under stress or the change in dimensions of the crystal when an electrical field is applied. Piezoelectric materials are used for a variety of applications, such as pressure transducers (for example in mechanical ignition devices for gas cookers and fires), ultramicromanipulators (where very small movements can be controlled), sound detectors, and as the probe support in scanning tunnelling microscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.16">Section 8.16</a>).

<p class="av-indent">Another common structure type, that adopted by potassium tetrafluoridonickelate(II), K<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub> (<a href="#fig_24.21">Fig. 24.21</a>), is related to perovskite. The compound can be thought of as containing individual slices from the perovskite structure that share the four F atoms from the octahedra within the layer, but have terminal F atoms above and below the layer. These layers are displaced relative to each other and separated by the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions (which are nine-coordinate, to eight F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions of one layer and one terminal F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion from the next). Compounds with the K<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub> structure type have come under renewed investigation because some high-temperature superconductors, such as La<sub>1.85</sub>Sr<sub>0.15</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, crystallize with this structure. Apart from their importance in superconductivity, compounds with the K<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub> structure also provide an opportunity to investigate two-dimensional magnetic domains, as coupling between electron spins is much stronger within the layers of linked octahedra than between the layers.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The K<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub> structure has been introduced as being derived from a single slice of the perovskite structure; other related structures are possible where two or more perovskite layers are displaced horizontally relative to each other.

<p class="av-noindent">The versatility of the perovskites extends to superconductivity because most of the high-temperature superconductors (which were first reported in 1986) can be viewed as variants of the perovskite structure. Superconductors have two striking characteristics. Below a critical temperature, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> (not to be confused with the Curie temperature of a ferroelectric, <i>T</i><sub>C</sub>), they enter the superconducting state and have zero electrical resistance. In this superconducting state they also exhibit the <b>Meissner effect</b>, the exclusion of a magnetic field. The Meissner effect is the basis of the common demonstration of superconductivity in which a pellet of superconductor levitates above a magnet. It is also the basis for a number of potential applications of superconductors that include magnetic levitation, as in &#x2018;maglev&#x2019; trains.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Following the discovery in 1911 that mercury is a superconductor below 4.2 K, physicists and chemists made slow but steady progress in the discovery of superconductors with higher values of <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>; after 75 years, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> had been edged up to 23 K in Nb<sub>3</sub>Ge. Most of these superconducting materials were metal alloys, although superconductivity had been found in many oxides and sulfides (<a href="#tab_24.4">Table 24.4</a>); magnesium diboride is superconducting below 39 K (see Box 13.4). Then, in 1986, the first <b>high-temperature superconductor</b> (HTSC) was discovered. Several materials are now known with <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> well above 77 K, the boiling point of the relatively inexpensive refrigerant liquid nitrogen, and in a few years the maximum <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> was increased by more than a factor of 5 to around 134 K.</p>

<p class="av-noindent">of the original perovskite and Cu atoms in the B sites. However, unlike in a true perovskite structure, the B sites are not surrounded by an octahedron of O atoms: the 123 structure has a large number of sites that would normally be occupied by O but are in fact vacant. As a result, some Cu atoms have five O atom neighbours in a square-pyramidal arrangement and others have only four, as square-planar CuO<sub>4</sub> units. Similarly, the Y and Ba in the A sites have less than 12-coordination. The compound YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> readily loses oxygen from some sites within the CuO<sub>4</sub> square planes, forming YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub> (0 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 1), but as <i>x</i> increases above 0.1 the critical temperature drops rapidly from 93 K.

<p class="av-indent">The square-planar CuO<sub>4</sub> units in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-x</sub> are arranged in chains and the CuO<sub>5</sub> units link together to form infinite sheets. The stoichiometry of an infinite sheet of vertex-sharing CuO<sub>4</sub> square planes is CuO<sub>2</sub>. The addition of one or two additional apical O atoms in the cases where the layers are constructed from, respectively, linked square-based pyramids or octahedra, maintains the CuO<sub>2</sub> sheet. This structural feature is also seen in all other oxocuprate HTSCs and it is thought to be an important component of the mechanism of superconduction in these materials.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Some HTSC and other superconducting materials are listed in <a href="#tab_24.4">Table 24.4</a>. All of them may be considered to have at least part of their structure derived from that of perovskite, as a layer of linked CuO<sub>n</sub> (n&#x003D;4, 5, 6) polyhedra is a section of that structural type. Lying between these cuprate layers (which may include up to six such perovskite-derived CuO<sub>2 </sub>sheets) can be a variety of other simple structural units containing s- and p-block metals in combination with oxygen, such as rock-salt and fluorite structures. Thus Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> can be considered as having three perovskite layers based on Cu, O, and Ca separated by double layers of a rock-salt structure built from Tl and O; the Ba lie between the rock-salt and perovskite layers (<a href="#fig_24.25">Fig. 24.25</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">The synthesis of high-temperature superconductors has been guided by a variety of qualitative considerations, such as the demonstrated success of the layered structures and of mixed oxidation state Cu in combination with heavy p-block elements. Additional considerations are the radii of ions and their preference for certain coordination environments. Many of these materials are prepared simply by heating an intimate mixture of the metal oxides to 800-900&#x00B0;C in an open alumina crucible. Others, such as mercury- and thallium-containing complex copper oxides, require reactions involving the volatile and toxic oxides Tl<sub>2</sub>O and HgO; in such cases the reactions are normally carried out in sealed gold or silver tubes (<a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">There is, as yet, no settled explanation of high-temperature superconductivity. It is believed that the movement of pairs of electrons, known as &#x2018;Cooper pairs&#x2019; and responsible for conventional superconductivity, is also important in the high-temperature materials, but the mechanism for pairing is hotly debated.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">The observation of superconductivity in the complex cuprates is unusual in terms of the high critical temperatures reached, but many other oxides and oxide phases demonstrate a transition to zero electrical resistance, albeit normally at considerably lower temperatures. Some compositionally simple examples include phases from the solid solution Li<sub>1&#x002B;x</sub>Ti<sub>2-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, (which adopts the spinel structure and has T<sub>c</sub> &#x003D; 13.7 K for <span class="av-italic">x&#x003D;</span> 0) and Na<sub>0.35</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;H<sub>2</sub>O with T<sub>c</sub> &#x2248; 5 K (see also <a href="#tab_24.4">Table 24.4</a>).</p>

Several complex oxides that adopt the pyrochlore structure (<a href="#fig_24.26">Fig. 24.26</a>) and have composition M<sub>2-x</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7-x</sub>, where M is a Group I, Group II, or post-transition metal cation such as Cs, Ca, or Cd and where B is a heavy d metal, show superconductivity. For example, Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is superconducting below 1.4K, and KOs<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is superconducting below 10 K. Recently, interest has centred on a new family of superconductors with critical temperatures approaching the best cuprates. These new lanthanoid iron arsenic oxides, of composition LnFeAs(O,F)<sub>1-x</sub>, were first reported for Ln&#x003D;La in LaFeAsO<sub>1-x</sub>F<sub>x</sub> with T<sub>c</sub>&#x003D;26K, and for compositionally similar Pr and Sm compounds critical temperatures of 52K and 55K, respectively, have been achieved. The structures of these compounds are based on alternating layers of composition LnO and FeAs (<a href="#fig_24.27">Fig. 24.27</a>). Related materials that also exhibit superconductivity include LiFeAs (T<sub>c</sub> &#x003D; 18K) and AFe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> (A&#x003D;Ca, Sr, Ba; T<sub>c</sub> up to 38K). <a id="page_674" class="page">Page 674, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>

The basic process of this mechanism is the transfer of an electron from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>Mn</mtext></mrow><mtext>3</mtext></msup><msup><mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo></msup> <mo stretchy='false'>(</mo><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msubsup><msubsup><mtext>e</mtext><mtext>g</mtext><mn>1</mn></msubsup> <mo stretchy='false'>)</mo></mrow></math> to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>Mn</mtext></mrow><mtext>4</mtext></msup><msup><mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo></msup> <mo stretchy='false'>(</mo><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msubsup> <mo stretchy='false'>)</mo></mrow></math> through the O atom, so that the Mn(III) and Mn(IV) positions change places. In manganites at high temperatures, the electrons in these systems effectively become trapped on a specific site, leading to ordering of the Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species; that is, the trapping results in <span class="av-bold">charge ordering.</span> The charge-ordered state is generally associated with insulating and paramagnetic behaviour, whereas the charge-disordered state, in which the electron can move between sites, is associated with metallic behaviour and ferromagnetism. The high-temperature charge-ordered state can be transformed into <a id="page_675" class="page">Page 675, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>a metallic, spin-ordered (ferromagnetic) state just by the application of a magnetic field; therefore, application of a magnetic field to a manganite just above its critical temperature causes the transformation of charge ordering into electron delocalization and hence a massive decrease in resistance.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The GMR effect is used in magnetic data-storage devices, such as computer hard drives (<a href="#box24.2">Box 24.2</a>), and manganites exhibiting CMR have been studied for such applications. Further work using these compounds is aimed at <span class="av-bold">spintronics</span>, where, rather than using electron movements to transmit information, as is the basis of electronics and the functioning of the silicon chip, the movement of spin through materials could be used in a similar way. As spin transfer is much faster than electron motion and does not develop heat through resistive effects, computing devices based on spintronics should have much higher processing powers and not require cooling; the latter is an increasing problem with semiconductor technology as transistors become ever more densely packed on computer processors.</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">Information on computer hard-disk drives (HDDs) is encoded using minute magnetic domains with their direction of magnetization representing the logical levels 0 and 1. This information can be read using a simple iron spinel (<a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>) magnet &#x2018;head&#x2019;and coil, where passing the head over the encoded surface generates small electrical currents in the coil depending on the direction of the magnetization. However, such devices have a low sensitivity, demanding relatively large regions of magnetic material, and the amount of information that can be stored on such a device is limited.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">In the 1990s HDDs were developed that used magnetoresistive effects, allowing much greater sensitivity and hence higher data storage densities. A giant magnetoresistive (GMR) based HDD in essence consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, which results in a weak coupling between the layers; a layer of an antiferromagnetic material fixes or &#x2018;pins&#x2019; the orientation of one of the ferromagnetic layers. This overall structure is known as a <span class="av-bold">spin valve.</span> When a weak magnetic field, such as that from an encoded bit on a hard disk, passes beneath such a structure, the magnetic orientation of the unpinned magnetic layer is modified relative to that of the pinned layer and this reorientation generates a significant change in the electrical resistance of the device through the magnetoresitive effect. This can be easily measured electronically as the readout of the encoded surface.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">The majority of materials used in such HDDs are layers of simple ferromagnetic metals or alloys such as FeCr, but the interest in developing even more sensitive devices has led to research on materials exhibiting CMR effects, such as the manganites described in the main text.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">The battery is discharged through the reverse electrochemical reaction. Lithium cobalt oxide, which is used in many commercial lithium-ion batteries, has many of the characteristics required for this type of application. The specific energy (the stored energy divided by the mass) of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (140 Whkg<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) is maximized by using light elements such as Li and Co; the 3d metals are almost invariably used in such applications because they are the lowest-density elements with variable oxidation states. The high mobility of the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion and good reversibility of electrochemical charging and discharging stem from the lithium ion's small ionic radius and the layer-like structure of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, which allows the Li&#x002B; to be extracted without major disruption of the structure. High capacities are obtained from the large amount of Li (one Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion for each LiCoO<sub>2</sub> formula unit) that may be reversibly extracted (about 500 discharge/recharge cycles) from the compound, and the current is delivered at a constant and high potential difference (of between 3.5 and 4V). The high potential difference is partly due to the high oxidation states of cobalt (&#x002B;3 and &#x002B;4) that are involved. <a id="page_676" class="page">Page 676, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>

The term <span class="av-bold">glass</span> is used in a variety of contexts but for our present purposes it implies an amorphous ceramic with a viscosity so high that it that can be considered to be rigid. A substance in its glassy form is said to be in its <span class="av-bold">vitreous</span> state. Although ceramics and glasses have been utilized since antiquity, their development is currently an area of rapid scientific and technological progress. This enthusiasm stems from <a id="page_677" class="page">Page 677, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>interest in the scientific basis of their properties and the development of novel synthetic routes to new high-performance materials. We confine our attention here to glasses. The most familiar glasses are alkali-metal or alkaline-earth-metal silicates and borosilicates.</p>

<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-bold">(a) Glass formation</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Silicon dioxide readily forms a glass because the three-dimensional network of strong covalent Si&#x2014;O bonds in the melt does not easily break and reform on cooling; the Zachariasen rules summarize the properties likely to lead to glass formation.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">A glass is prepared by cooling a melt more quickly than it can crystallize. Cooling molten silica, for instance, gives vitreous quartz. Under these conditions the solid has no long-range order as judged by the lack of X-ray diffraction peaks, but spectroscopic and other data indicate that each Si atom is surrounded by a tetrahedral array of O atoms. The lack of long-range order results from variations of the Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si angles. <a href="#fig_24.32">Figure 24.32a</a> illustrates in two dimensions how a local coordination environment can be preserved but long-range order lost by variation of the bond angles around O. This loss of long-range order is readily apparent when X-rays are scattered from a glass (<a href="#fig_24.32">Fig. 24.32b</a>): in contrast to a long-range, periodically ordered crystalline material where diffraction gives rise to a series of diffraction maxima (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>), the X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from a glass shows only broad features as the long-range order is lost. Silicon dioxide readily forms a glass because the three-dimensional network of strong covalent Si&#x2014;O bonds in the melt does not readily break and reform on cooling. The lack of strong directional bonds in metals and simple ionic substances makes it much more difficult to form glasses from these materials. Recently, however, techniques have been developed for ultrafast cooling and, as a result, a wide variety of metals and simple inorganic materials can now be frozen into a vitreous state.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="av-indent">The concept that the local coordination sphere of the glass-forming element is preserved but that bond angles around O are variable was originally proposed by W.H. Zachariasen in 1932. He reasoned that these conditions would lead to similar molar Gibbs energies and molar volumes for the glass and its crystalline counterpart. Zachariasen also proposed that the vitreous state is favoured by polyhedral corner-sharing O atoms, rather than edge- or face-shared, which would enforce greater order. These and other <span class="av-bold">Zachariasen rules</span> hold for common glass-forming oxides, but exceptions are known.</p>
<p class="av-indent">An instructive comparison between vitreous and crystalline materials is seen in their change in volume with temperature (<a href="#fig_24.33">Fig. 24.33</a>). When a molten material crystallizes, an abrupt change in volume (usually a decrease) occurs, representing the more efficient and closer packing of atoms, ions, or molecules in the solid phase. By contrast, a glass-forming material that is cooled sufficiently rapidly persists as a metastable supercooled liquid. When cooled below the <span class="av-bold">glass transition temperature</span>, Tg, the supercooled liquid becomes rigid, and this change is accompanied by only an inflection in the cooling curve <a id="page_678" class="page">Page 678, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a>rather than an abrupt change in slope; this indicates that the structure of the glassy solid is similar to that of the liquid. The rates of crystallization are very slow for many complex metal silicates, phosphates, and borates, and it is these compounds that often form glasses.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Glasses or ceramics containing TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be prepared using sol-gel methods (<a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>) at much lower temperatures than required to produce the ceramic from the simple oxides. Often a special shape can be fashioned at the gel stage. Thus, the gel may be shaped into a fibre and then heated to expel water; this process produces a glass or ceramic fibre at much lower temperatures than would be necessary if the fibre were made from the melt of the components.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-blue">(b) Glass composition, production, and application</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Low-valence metal oxides, such as Na<sub>2</sub>O and CaO, are often added to silica to reduce its softening temperature by disrupting the silicon-oxygen framework. Other cations may be incorporated into glasses, giving applications as diverse as lasers and nuclear-waste containment.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Although vitreous silica is a strong glass that can withstand rapid cooling or heating without cracking, it has a high glass transition temperature and therefore must be worked at inconveniently high temperatures. Therefore, a <b>modifier</b>, such as Na<sub>2</sub>O or CaO, is commonly added to SiO<sub>2</sub>. A modifier disrupts some of the Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si linkages and replaces them with terminal Si&#x2014;O<sup>&#x2013;</sup> links that associate with the cation (<a href="#fig_24.34">Fig. 24.34</a>). The consequent partial disruption of the Si&#x2014;O network leads to glasses that have lower softening points. The common glass used in bottles and windows is called &#x2018;sodalime glass&#x2019;and contains Na<sub>2</sub>O and CaO as modifiers. When B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is used as a modifier, the resulting &#x2018;borosilicate glasses&#x2019; have lower thermal expansion coefficients than sodalime glass and are less likely to crack when heated. Borosilicate glass (such as Pyrex&#x00AE;) is therefore widely used for ovenware and laboratory glassware.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Glass formation is a property of many oxides, and practical glasses have been made from sulfides, fluorides, and other anionic constituents. Some of the best glass formers are the oxides of elements near silicon in the periodic table (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, GeO<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), but the solubility in water of most borate and phosphate glasses and the high cost of germanium limit their usefulness.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The development of transparent crystalline and vitreous materials for light transmission and processing has led to a revolution in signal transmission. For example, optical fibres are currently being produced with a composition gradient from the interior to the surface. This composition gradient modifies the refractive index and thereby decreases light loss. Fluoride glasses are also being investigated as possible substitutes for oxide glasses because oxide glasses contain small numbers of OH groups, which absorb near-infrared radiation and attenuate the signal. Doping lanthanoid ions into the glass fibres produces materials that can be used to amplify the signals by using lasing effects (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.5">Section 23.5b</a>). Optical circuit elements are being developed that may eventually replace all the components in an electronic integrated circuit and lead to very fast optical computers.</p>
<p class="av-indent">As modifier cations effectively become trapped in a glass, which is chemically inert and thermodynamically very stable with respect to transformation to a soluble, crystalline phase, such glassy materials offer a potential method for containing and storing nuclear waste as &#x2018;Synroc&#x2019;(&#x2018;synthetic rock&#x2019;).Thus vitrification of metal oxides containing a radioactive species with glass-forming oxides produces a stable glass that can be stored for long periods, allowing the radionucleides to decay.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The incorporation of functional inorganic compounds into glasses has led to the development of so-called &#x2018;smart glasses&#x2019; that have switchable properties, such as <b>electro-chromism</b>, the ability to change colour or light transmission properties in response to application of a potential difference, and reversible <b>photochromism</b>, the ability to change colour under certain light conditions. An electrochromic glass generally consists of a glass coated with colourless tungsten trioxide, WO<sub>3</sub>, or a sandwich-like layer structure consisting of these two components. When a potential difference is applied to the WO<sub>3</sub> layer, cations are inserted and the W is partially reduced to form M<sub>x</sub>W(VI,V)O<sub>3</sub>, which is dark blue. The coating maintains its dark colour until the potential difference is reversed, when the glass becomes colourless. Application of electrochromic glasses include privacy glass, auto-dimming rear-view mirrors in vehicles, and aircraft windows. A similar coating is used in self-cleaning glasses, where a metal oxide coating on the glass acts as a photocatalyst for the breakdown of organic dirt on their surfaces (see <a href="#box_24.4">Box 24.4</a> in <a href="#sec_24.17">Section 24.17</a>). <a id="page_679" class="page">Page 679, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a></p>



<p class="av-noindent">A photochromic glass incorporates a small amount of a colourless silver halide, normally AgCl, within the glass. When exposed to UV radiation, such as that in sunlight, the AgCl dissociates to form small clusters of Ag atoms, which absorb light across the visible region of the spectrum, imparting a grey colour to the glass. When the UV radiation is removed, the AgCl reforms and the glass returns to its optically transparent state. Photochromic glasses are widely used in the lenses of spectacles and sunglasses.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.8 <b>Nitrides, fluorides, and mixed-anion phases</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">The solid-state chemistry of the metals in combination with anions other than O<sup>2-</sup> is not as highly developed or extensive as that of the complex oxides described so far. However, complex nitrides and fluorides and mixed-anion compounds&#x2014;oxide-nitrides, oxide-sulfides, and oxide-fluorides&#x2014;are of growing importance.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-blue">(a) Nitrides</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Complex metal nitrides and oxide-nitrides are materials containing the N<sup>3-</sup> anion; many new compounds of this type have recently been synthesized.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Simple metal nitrides of main-group elements, such as AlN, GaN, and Li<sub>3</sub>N, have been known for decades. Many of the recent advances in nitride chemistry have centred on d-metal compounds and complex nitrides. That nitrides are less common than oxides stems, in part, from the high enthalpy of formation of N<sup>3-</sup> compared with that of O<sup>2-</sup>. Furthermore, because many nitrides are sensitive to oxygen and water, their synthesis and handling are problematic. Some simple metal nitrides can be obtained by the direct reaction of the elements; for example, Li<sub>3</sub>N is obtained by heating lithium in a stream of nitrogen at 400&#x00B0;C. The instability of sodium nitride allows sodium azide to be used as a nitriding agent:</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">

<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_1007.jpg" alt="Image"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">The ammonolysis of oxides (the dehydrogenation of NH<sub>3</sub> by oxides with the formation of water as a by-product) provides a convenient route to some nitrides. For instance, tantalum nitride can be obtained by heating tantalum pentoxide in a fast-flowing stream of ammonia:</p>
<figure class="av-indentt-new">

<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_1008.jpg" alt="Image"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">In such reactions, the equilibrium is driven towards the products by removal of the steam in the gas flow. Similar reactions may be used for the preparation of complex nitrides from complex oxides, although competing reactions involving partial reduction of the metal oxide by ammonia can also occur. There is also a tendency with nitrides for the formation of compounds in which the metallic element is in a lower oxidation state because nitrogen, on account of its high bond energy, is not as potent an oxidant as oxygen or fluorine. Thus, whereas heating titanium in oxygen readily produces TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>N and TiN are known but Ti<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is difficult to prepare and poorly characterized. Likewise, V<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> is unknown whereas V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is readily obtained from the decomposition of many vanadium salts in air.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Many of the early d-metal nitrides are interstitial compounds and are used as high-temperature refractory ceramics. Similarly, the nitrides of Si and Al, such as Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (<a href="#fig_24.35">Fig. 24.35</a>), are stable at very high temperatures, particularly under nonoxidizing conditions, and are used for crucibles and furnace elements. Recently, GaN, which can exist in both wurtzite and sphalerite structural types, has been the focus of considerable research on account of its semiconducting properties. The nitride Li<sub>3</sub>N has an unusual structure based on hexagonal Li<sub>2</sub>N<sup>&#x2013;</sup> layers separated by Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions (<a href="#fig_24.36">Fig. 24.36</a>).

<p class="av-noindentt">As noted above, heating oxides under ammonia can lead to the complete or partial displacement of oxide by nitride. In general, complete elimination of O<sup>2-</sup> ions from the product can be troublesome, so the reactions give products that contain both the oxide and nitride ions:</p>

</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">In comparison with the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion, the higher charge of the N<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> ion results in a greater degree of covalence in its bonding and therefore nitrides, particularly those of less electropositive elements such as d metals, should not be described in purely ionic terms. In terms of their band structures, the higher energy of a nitride valence band causes a narrowing of the band gap in oxide-nitrides in comparison with pure oxides. This ability to reduce the band gap is of importance in designing materials that absorb visible light (effectively a valence-to-conduction-band or nitride-to-metal charge-transfer electron transition), as opposed to many oxides (such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) which only absorb in the UV region because of their large band gaps. Thus titanium and tantalum oxide-nitrides, such as CaTaO<sub>2</sub>N synthesized as above, are intensely coloured, typically yellow, orange, and red, and have been used as pigments. Oxide-nitrides are also being considered for applications as photocatalysts (<a href="#sec_24.17">Section 24.17</a>).</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-blue">(c) Fluorides and other halides</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span>Because fluorine and oxygen have similar ionic radii, fluoride solid-state chemistry parallels much of oxide chemistry.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The ionic radii of F &#x2212; and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> are very similar (at between 130 and 140 pm), and as a result metal fluorides show many stoichiometric and structural analogies with the complex oxides but with lower charge on the metal ion to reflect the lower charge on the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion. Many binary metal fluorides adopt the simple structural types expected on the basis of the radius-ratio rule (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>). For example, FeF<sub>2</sub> and PdF<sub>2</sub> have a rutile structure and AgF has a rock-salt structure; similarly, NbF<sub>3</sub> adopts the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure. For complex fluorides, analogues of typical oxide structural types are well known, including perovs-kites (such as KMnF<sub>3</sub>), Ruddlesden&#x2013;Popper phases (for example, K<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>F<sub>7</sub>), and spinels (Li<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub>) (<a href="#sec_24.6">Sections 24.6c</a> and <a href="#sec_24.6">d</a>).

Lithium borofluoride glasses are used to contain samples for X-ray work because they are highly transparent to X-rays on account of their low electron densities. Framework and layer structures based on linked MF<sub>4</sub> (M&#x003D;Li, Be) tetrahedra have also been described. Some metal fluorides are used as fluorination agents in organic chemistry. However, few of the solid complex metal fluorides are technologically important in comparison with the wealth of applications associated with analogous complex oxides.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Metal chloride structures reflect the greater covalence associated with bonding to chloride in comparison with fluoride: the chlorides are less ionic and have structures with lower coordination numbers than the corresponding fluorides. Thus, simple metal chlorides, bromides, and iodides normally adopt the cadmium-chloride or cadmium-iodide structures based on sheets formed from edge-sharing MX<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Complex chlorides often contain the same structural unit; for example, CsNiCl<sub>3</sub> has chains of edge-sharing NiCl<sub>6</sub> octahedra separated by Cs<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions. Many analogues of oxide structures also occur among the complex chlorides, such as KMnCl<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>MnCl<sub>4</sub>, and Li<sub>2</sub>MnCl<sub>4</sub>, which have the perovskite, K<sub>2</sub>NiF<sub>4</sub>, and spinel structures, respectively.</p>

For example, we noted there that MO compounds generally adopt the rock-salt structure whereas ZnS and CdS can crystallize with either of the sphalerite or the wurtzite structures, in which the lower coordination numbers indicate the presence of directional bonding. Similarly, the d-block monosulfides generally adopt the more characteristically covalent nickel-arsenide structure rather than the rock-salt structure of alkaline-earth oxides such as MgO.

<p class="av-noindentt">Compounds of the chalcogens with d metals are prepared by heating mixtures in a sealed tube (to prevent the loss of the volatile elements). The products obtained in this manner can have a variety of compositions. The preparation of crystalline dichalcogenides suitable for chemical and structural studies is often performed by <b>chemical vapour transport</b> (CVT), as described below. It is possible in some cases simply to sublime a compound, but the CVT technique can also be applied to a wide variety of nonvolatile compounds in solid-state chemistry.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In a typical procedure, the crude material is loaded into one end of a borosilicate or fused-quartz tube.

 ions are formed by metals in the middle and towards the right of the block (such as pyrite, FeS<sub>2</sub>). We concentrate here on the layered materials.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In TaS<sub>2</sub> and many other layered disulfides, the d-metal ions are located in octahedral holes between close-packed AB layers (<a href="#fig_24.38">Fig. 24.38a</a>). The Ta ions form a close-packed layer denoted X, so the metal and adjoining sulfide layers can be portrayed as an AXB sandwich. These sandwich-like slabs form a three-dimensional crystal by stacking in sequences such as &#x2026;AXBAXBAXB&#x2026;, where the strongly bound AXB slabs are held to their neighbours by weak dispersion forces. An alternative view of these MS<sub>2</sub> structures, which have the metal ions in octahedral holes, is as MS<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing edges (<a href="#fig_24.39">Fig. 24.39a</a>), which reinforces the idea of the greater degree of covalent bonding that occurs in these materials than in, for instance, Li<sub>2</sub>S, which has the antifluorite structure.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The Nb atoms in NbS<sub>2</sub> reside in the trigonal-prismatic holes between sulfide layers that are in register with one another (AA, <a href="#fig_24.38">Fig. 24.38b</a> and <a href="#fig_24.39">Fig. 24.39b</a>). The Nb atoms, which are strongly bonded to the adjacent sulfide layers, form a close-packed array denoted <i>m</i>, so we can represent each slab as AmA or CmC. These slabs form a three-dimensional crystal by stacking in a pattern such as &#x2026;A<i>m</i>AC<i>m</i>CA<i>m</i>AC<i>m</i>C.&#x2026;Weak dispersion forces also contribute to holding these A<i>m</i>A and C<i>m</i>C slabs together. Polytypes (versions that differ only in the stacking arrangement along a direction perpendicular to the plane of the slabs) can occur; thus, NbS<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> form several polytypes, including one with the sequence &#x2026;C<i>m</i>CA<i>m</i>AB<i>m</i>B.&#x2026; Molybdenum sulfide, MoS<sub>2</sub>, is used as a high-performance lubricant in, for example, racing cars and machining, as it can be used at much higher temperatures and pressures than oils. Lubrication occurs with a dry coating of the material, as the MoS<sub>2 </sub>layers are able to slip over each other easily because of the weak interlayer interactions.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">We have already introduced the idea that alkali metal ions may insert between graphite sheets (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.5">Section 14.5</a>), metal disulfide slabs (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#sec_16.11">Section 16.11</a>), and metal oxide layers (as in Li<sub><i>x</i></sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>; <a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6h</a>) to form intercalation compounds. For a reaction to qualify as an intercalation, or as an <b>insertion reaction</b>, the basic structure of the host should not be altered when it occurs. Reactions in which the structure of one of the solid starting materials is not radically altered are called <b>topotactic reactions.</b> They are not limited to the type of insertion chemistry we are discussing here. For example, hydration, dehydration, and ion-exchange reactions may also be topotactic.</p>

The insertion of an alkali metal atom into a dichal-cogenide involves a similar process: the electron is accepted into the d band and the <a id="page_683" class="page">Page 683, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a>charge-compensating alkali metal ion diffuses to positions between the slabs.

<p class="av-noindentt">with 0.4&#x003C;<i>x</i>&#x003C;0.7. Insertion may also be achieved by using a highly reducing alkali metal compound, such as butyllithium, or the electrochemical technique of <b>electrointercalation</b> (<a href="#fig_24.40">Fig. 24.40</a>). One advantage of electrointercalation is that it is possible to measure the amount of alkali metal incorporated by monitoring the current, <i>I</i>, passed during the synthesis (using <i>n<sub>e</sub>&#x003D;It/F)</i>. It also is possible to distinguish solid-solution formation from discrete-phase formation. As illustrated in <a href="#fig_24.41">Fig. 24.41</a>, the formation of a solid solution is characterized by a gradual change in potential as intercalation proceeds. In contrast, the formation of a new discrete phase yields a steady potential over the range in which one solid phase is being converted into the other, followed by an abrupt change in potential when that reaction is complete.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Insertion compounds are examples of mixed ionic and electronic conductors. In general, the insertion process can be reversed either chemically or electrochemically. This reversibility makes it possible to recharge a lithium cell by removal of Li from the compound. In a clever synthetic application of these concepts, the previously unknown layered disulfide VS<sub>2</sub> can be prepared by first making the known layered compound LiVS<sub>2</sub> in a high-temperature process. The Li is then removed by reaction with I<sub>2</sub> to produce the metastable layered VS<sub>2</sub>, which has the TiS<sub>2</sub> structure:</p>

The orga-nometallic compound appears to undergo oxidation upon intercalation, so the favourable Gibbs energy in these reactions arises in the same way as in alkali metal intercalation. In agreement with this interpretation, [Fe(&#x03B7;|<sup>5</sup>&#x2212;Cp)<sub>2</sub>], which is more difficult to oxidize than its Co analogue, does not intercalate (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.19">Section 22.19</a>).</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Chevrel phases form an interesting class of ternary compounds first reported by R. Chevrel in 1971. These compounds, which illustrate three-dimensional intercalation, have formulas such as Mo<sub>6</sub>X<sub>8</sub> and A<sub><i>x</i></sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>; Se or Te may take the place of S and the intercalated A atom may be a variety of metals such as Li, Mn, Fe, Cd, or Pb. The parent compounds, Mo<sub>6</sub>Se<sub>8</sub> and Mo<sub>6</sub>Te<sub>8</sub>, are prepared by heating the elements at about 1000&#x00B0;C. A structural unit common to this series is M<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, which may be viewed as an octahedron of M atoms face-bridged by S atoms, or alternatively as an octahedron of M atoms in a cube of S atoms (<a href="#fig_24.43">Fig. 24.43</a>).

<p class="av-indent">A further possible application of Chevrel phases is in the thermoelectric devices used to convert heat into electrical energy or in devices that use electrical energy directly for cooling purposes. The ideal thermoelectric materials have good electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivities. This requirement often involves designing a material with a combination of structural elements: one that allows for rapid electron transport, a property associated with crystalline solids where there is little electron scattering by the regular placement of atoms; and a second disordered or glassy structural feature, which scatters the vibrational modes responsible for heat transport, thus producing low thermal conductivity. In Chevrel phases the ability to incorporate various cations between the M<sub>6</sub>X<sub>8</sub> <a id="page_685" class="page">Page 685, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a>blocks that &#x2018;rattle&#x2019; around on their sites reduces the material&#x2019;s thermal conductivity but not at the expense of electronic conductivity. Many other metal chalcogenide phases are being investigated for thermoelectric device applications. The compounds Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, in common with many metal chalcogenides, have layer-like structures similar to those of the MS<sub>2</sub> phases described in <a href="#sec_24.9">Section 24.9b</a>, and devices built on these materials can be designed to produce good electrical conductivity within the layers but poor thermal conductivity perpendicular to them, leading to useful thermoelectric efficiencies. Another important family of thermoelectric materials are the so-called &#x2018;skutterudites&#x2019; (named after the mineral <i>skutterudite</i>, CoAs<sub>3</sub>), with the general formula M<sub><i>x</i></sub>(Co,Fe,Ni)(P,As,Sb)<sub>3</sub> with various inserted cations, M, such as Ln or Na, as in Na<sub>025</sub>FeSb<sub>3</sub>. The skutterudite structure is similar to that of ReO<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>), although the CoAs<sub>6</sub> octahedra are tilted to produce some large cavities within the structure, into which the cations may be inserted. These cations reduce the thermal conductivity of the structure by absorbing heat to rattle around within their cavities, while the high electronic conductivity of the (Co,Fe,Ni) (P,As,Sb)<sub>3</sub> network is maintained.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Much of this chapter has concerned structures derived from close-packed anions accompanying d-metal ions typically with coordination number 6. Many of these structures (for example, ReO<sub>3</sub>, perovskites, and MS<sub>2</sub>) can also be described in terms of linked polyhedra in which MX<sub>6</sub> octahedra connect through their vertices or edges to form a variety of arrays. Coordination number <i>6</i> is preferred for most d metals in their typical oxidation states, but, for smaller metal species (for example, the later 3d series and the lighter p-block metals and metalloids such as Al and Si), four-fold tetrahedral coordination to O is commonplace and leads to structures that are best described as based on linked MO<sub>4 </sub>tetrahedra. These tetrahedral units may be the only building block present, as in zeolites, or may link together with metal-oxygen octahedra to produce new structural types (<a href="#fig_24.45">Fig. 24.45</a>). Many of these linked polyhedral structures link together in three dimensions and are known as <b>framework structures.</b></p>

<p class="av-indent">Zeolites, with three-dimensional frameworks formed from linked SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra only, have the general formula (M<sup><i>n&#x002B;</i></sup>)<sub><i>x/n</i></sub>[(AlO<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>x</i></sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>].<i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, where M is a cation, typically Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or Ca<sup>2</sup>&#x002B;; the cations and water molecules occupy sites within pores or channels of the fully connected framework. In zeolites synthesized from solution, where all the vertices of the SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> building units are shared between two tetrahedra, <b>Lowenstein&#x2018;s rule</b> states that no O atom is shared between two AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahe-dra. Lowenstein&#x2018;s rule applies only to frameworks synthesized from solution, as directly linked AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra are readily obtained in compounds generated from reactions at high temperatures.

<p class="av-noindentt">The role of structure-directing agents in the synthesis of zeolitic materials was described in <a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.15">Section 14.15</a>. Following the discovery of a large number of new microporous structures from the 1950s onwards, many of which were prepared in the laboratory using organic templates, more recent work on zeolites has been directed towards the systematic study of template-framework relationships. These studies can be divided into two major categories. One is to understand the interaction between the framework and template through computer modelling and experiment. The other is to design templates with specific geometries to direct the formation of zeolites with particular pore sizes and connectivity.</p>

</figure> </aside>
<p class="av-indent">One particular area that has become the focus of much attention is the use of bulky organic and organometallic molecules as templates in the quest for new, very large pore structures. This approach has been used to make the first zeolitic materials containing 14-ring channels.<sup>5</sup> Thus, the microporous silica UTD-1 (<a href="#fig_24.46">Fig. 24.46</a>) has been prepared by using the bulky bis-pentamethylcyclopentadienylcobalt(II) [Co(Cp*)<sub>2</sub>], and the siliceous CIT-5 (CFI structure type) was prepared by using a polycyclic amine and lithium (<a href="#fig_24.47">Fig. 24.47</a>). Other more complex amines have been synthesized with the aim of using them as templates in zeolite synthesis and to obtain desirable pore geometries. The addition of fluorides into the zeolite precursor gel improves reaction rates and acts as a template for some of the smaller cage units, for example where linked TO<sub>4</sub> (T &#x003D; Si, Al, P, etc.) tetrahedra arranged at the corners of a cube surround a central F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion.</p>
<p class="av-foot"><sup>5</sup> An <i>n</i>-ring channel (in this case <i>n</i> &#x003D; 14) refers to the number of tetrahedral units (MO<sub>4</sub>) linked together to define the circumference of the channel: the larger <i>n</i> is, the greater is the diameter of the channel.</p>

<p class="av-indent">There has been a significant increase in the proportion of synthetic zeolites that can be made in (essentially) pure silica form, so that over 20 structural types of zeolitic silica polymorphs are now known. The use of low H<sub>2</sub>O/SiO<sub>2</sub> ratios is a key factor in producing these materials, and the new &#x2018;silica&#x2019; phases so produced are of unusually low density; for <a id="page_687" class="page">Page 687, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>example, a purely siliceous framework with the same topology as the naturally occurring mineral chabazite, Ca<sub>1.85</sub>(Al<sub>3.7</sub>Si<sub>8.3</sub>O<sub>24</sub>), is the least dense silica polymorph known, with&#x2014; according to the normal atomic radii&#x2014;only 46 per cent of the unit cell volume occupied. These pure-silica zeolites are hydrophobic, leading to specific applications in molecular absorption of low-polarity molecules and catalysis (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.14">Section 25.14</a>).</p>

(b) The maximum molecular size that can be absorbed into various zeolite channel diameters. NaY is faujasite, a moderately large pore zeolite.</p></aside></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="av-indent">Two of the main applications of zeolites are as absorbents for small molecules and as ion exchangers. Zeolites are excellent absorbents for most small molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, linear and branched hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ketones in the gas or liquid phase. Zeolites with different sized pores may be used to separate mixtures of molecules based on size, and this application has led to their description as <b>molecular sieves.</b> Through the correct selection of zeolite pore, it is possible to control the rates of diffusion of various molecules with different effective diameters, leading to separation and purification. <a href="#fig_24.48">Figure 24.48</a> illustrates this application schematically.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Industrial applications of zeolites for separation and purification include petroleum refining processes, where they are used to remove water, CO<sub>2</sub>, chlorides, and mercury; the desulfurization of natural gas, where the removal of H<sub>2</sub>S and other sulfurous compounds protects transmission pipelines and removes the undesirable smell from home supplies; the removal of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> from air before liquefaction and separation by cryogenic distillation; and the drying and the removal of odours from pharmaceutical products. One area of growing importance is the separation of air into its main components other than by cryogenic means. Many dehydrated zeolites adsorb N<sub>2</sub> more strongly into their pores than O<sub>2</sub>, and this is believed to be due to the fact that N<sub>2</sub> has a higher quadrupole moment than O<sub>2</sub> and interacts more strongly with the resident cations. By passing air over a bed of zeolite at controlled pressure it is possible to produce oxygen of over 95 per cent purity. Zeolites such as NaX (the sodium-exchanged form of an aluminium-rich zeolite of structure type X) and CaA (a calcium-exchanged form of zeolite framework structure type A, also known as LTA) were originally developed for this purpose. The selectivity of the process can be much improved by exchanging selected cations into the zeolite pores and thus changing the dimensions of the sites onto which the nitrogen and oxygen molecules adsorb. Thus lithium-, calcium-, strontium-, and magnesium-exchanged forms of the faujasite (FAU, type X) and Linde Type A (LTA) structures are now used very effectively in this process.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The excellent ion-exchange properties of zeolites result from their open structures and ability to trap significant quantities of cations selectively within these pores. High capacities for ion exchange are derived from the large numbers of exchangeable cations. This is especially true of those zeolites with a high proportion of Al in the framework, which includes the zeolites with the LTA and gismondine (GIS) topologies that have the highest <a id="page_688" class="page">Page 688, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>attainable Si:Al ratio of 1:1. The ion-exchange selectivity has led to a major application of zeolitestes as a &#x2018;builder&#x2019; in laundry detergents, where they are used to remove the &#x2018;hard&#x2019; ions Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and replace them with &#x2018;soft&#x2019; ions such as Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Phosphates, which may also be used as detergent builders, have been the subject of environmental concerns linked to rapid algal growth and eutrophication of natural waters (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.15">Section 5.15</a>). Spherical Na-form LTA zeolite particles, a few micrometres in diameter, are small enough to pass through the openings in the weave of clothingand so may be added to detergents to remove the hard cations in natural waters, and are then washed away harmlessly intothe environment.</p>

</figure></aside>

<p class="av-indent">Another important area where the ion-exchange properties of zeolites are exploited is in the trapping and removal of radionuclides from nuclear waste. Several zeolites, including the widely used clinoptilolite, have high selectivities for the larger alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations, which in nuclear waste include <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>90</sup>Sr (<a href="#fig_24.49">Fig.24.49</a>). These zeolites may be vitrified by further reaction with glass-forming oxides, as discussed in <a href="#sec_24.7">Section 24.7.</a></p>
<p class="av-indent">The structural and electronic equivalence of two silicate tetrahedra, (SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and the alumino-phosphate unit, AlO<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, can be recognized in the simple compounds SiO<sub>2</sub> and AlPO<sub>4</sub>, both of which adopt a similar range of dense polymorphs, including the quartz structure. The development of zeolites with very high Si content, which are effectively silica polymorphs, in turn led to the discovery of the aluminophosphate (ALPO) framework structures based on a 1:1 mixture of AlO<sub>4</sub> and PO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra; AlPO<sub>4</sub> itself has the same structure as quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) but with an arrangement of alternating Al and Si atoms at the centres of the tetrahedra. A wide range of ALPOs has been developed that parallel the zeolites in, for example, their synthesis under hydrothermal conditions (although in acid conditions rather than the basic ones used for zeolites) and their adsorption and catalytic properties. Again, organic template molecules have been designed and used to prepare many different ALPO structures, such as those with the structure codes VPI (with a large channel formed from 18 AlO<sub>4</sub>/PO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra), DAF, BOZ, and STA (<a href="#fig_24.50">Fig.24.50</a>). Although aluminophosphate frameworks are neutral, substitution of either Al(III) or P(V) with metal ions of lower charge leads to the formation of &#x2018;solid acid catalysts&#x2019; that can, for example, convert methanol into hydrocarbons selectively, although the aluminosilicate zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, remain the best materials for this application (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.14">Section 25.14</a>). The incorporation of Co and Mn, both of which have redox properties, into ALPO frameworks yields materials that can be used for the oxidation of alkanes.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">The diameters of the largest pores found in synthetic zeolites are of the order of 1.2 nm. In an attempt to increase this diameter and allow larger molecules to be absorbed into inorganic structures, chemists have turned to mesoporous materials (<a href="#sec_24.29">Section 24.29</a>) and structures produced by &#x2018;pillaring&#x2019; (that is, stacking and connecting together two-dimensional materials). The two-dimensional nature of many d-metal disulfides and some of their intercalation compounds are discussed in <a href="Chapter16.xhtml#sec_16.11">Sections 16.11</a> and <a href="#sec_24.9">24.9.</a> Similar intercalation reactions, when applied to aluminosilicates from the clay family, allow the synthesis of large-pore materials.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Naturally occurring clays such as kaolinite, hectorite, and montmorillonite have layer structures like those shown in <a href="#fig_24.52">Fig. 24.52.</a> The layers are constructed from vertex- and edge-sharing octahedra (MO<sub>6</sub>) and tetrahedra (TO<sub>4</sub>), and exist as double-layer systems (two layers, one formed from octahedra and one from tetrahedra; <a href="#fig_24.52">Fig. 24.52</a>), as in kao-linite, and triple-layer (a central layer based on octahedra sandwiched between two tet-rahedra-based layers) systems, as in bentonite. The atoms, M and T, contained within the layers, which have an overall negative charge, are typically Si (on tetrahedral sites) and Al (occupying octahedral and tetrahedral sites). Small singly and doubly charged ions, such as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, occupy sites between the layers. These interlayer cations are often hydrated and can readily be replaced by ion exchange. Other materials with similar structures are the layered double hydroxides with structures similar to that of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the naturally occurring mineral <i>brucite.</i></p>

The resulting product is a pillared clay with excellent thermal stability to at least 500&#x00B0;C. The expanded interlayer region can now absorb large molecules in the same way as zeolites. However, because the distribution of pillaring ions between the layers is difficult to control, the pillared clay structures are less regular than zeolites. Despite this lack of uniformity, pillared clays have been widely studied for their potential as catalysts because they act in a similar way to zeolites, as acid catalysts promoting isomerization and dehydration.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(b) Inorganic framework chemistry</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span>Enormous structural diversity can be obtained from linked polyhedra and, with the use of templates, can lead to porous frameworks.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The extensive development of aluminosilicates and zeolites has motivated synthetic inorganic chemists to seek similar structural types built from other tetrahedral and octahedral polyhedra for use in ion exchange, absorption, and catalysis. The use of different and larger polyhedra provides more flexibility in the framework topologies, and there is also the potential to incorporate d-metal ions with their associated properties of colour, redox properties, and magnetism. Tetrahedral species that have been incorporated into such frameworks include ZnO<sub>4</sub>, AsO<sub>4</sub>, CoO<sub>4</sub>, GaO<sub>4</sub>, and GeO<sub>4</sub>, as well as the aluminate, silicate, and phosphate groups mentioned previously. Octahedral units are mainly based on d metals and the heavier and larger metals from Groups 13 and 14. Other polyhedral units such as five-coordinate square pyramids also occur, but less commonly.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Zeolite analogues are called <b>zeotypes.</b> Ring sizes larger than 12 tetrahedrally coordinated atoms were first seen in metallophosphate systems, and structures with 20 and 24 linked tetrahedra have been made. Aluminophosphates were the first synthesized micropo-rous frameworks that contain polyhedra with coordination numbers greater than 4. Other so-called <b>hypertetrahedral frameworks</b> are now well established, such as the titanosilicate families (which have four-coordinate Si and five- and six-coordinate Ti sites) and a series of octahedral molecular sieves based on linked MnO<sub>6</sub> units.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Good examples of this structural family are the titanosilicate zeotypes built from SiO<sub>4 </sub>tetrahedra and various TiO<sub><i>n</i></sub> polyhedra, with <i>n&#x003D;</i>4-6. These compounds are made under the hydrothermal conditions similar to those used for synthesizing many zeolites but by using a source of Ti, such as TiCl<sub>4</sub> or Ti(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, that hydrolyses under the basic conditions in the autoclave. Templates may also be used in such media and act as structure-directing units, giving rise to particular pore sizes and geometries. In a typical reaction the titanosilicate ETS-10 (Engelhard TitanoSilicate 10) is prepared by the reaction of TiCl<sub>4</sub>, <a id="page_691" class="page">Page 691, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, and sometimes a template such as tetraethylammo-nium bromide, in a sealed PTFE-lined autoclave at between 150 and 230&#x00B0;C. The number of titanosilicate materials continues to grow, but two, ETS-10 and Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, are worthy of further consideration here as specific examples of this type of material.</p>

The structure has 12-membered rings (that is, pores formed from 12-unit polyhedra) in all three directions. Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><b>.</b>2H<sub>2</sub>O also has TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, but in this structure these octahedra form clusters with four TiO<sub>6 </sub>units linked by the tetrahedral SiO<sub>4</sub> units (as in <a href="#fig_24.54">Fig. 24.54a</a>). This connectivity gives rise to large octagonal pores containing hydrated Na&#x002B; ions. This compound, in common with several other titanosilicates such as K<sub>3</sub>H(TiO)<sub>4</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><b>.</b>4H<sub>2</sub>O, a synthetic analogue of a natural mineral pharmacosiderite (<a href="#fig_24.54">Fig. 24.54b</a>), shows excellent ion-exchange properties, particularly with large cations. These large ions replace Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> with very high selectivity, so that, for example, Cs<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Sr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions may be extracted into the titanosilicate structure from their dilute solutions. This ability has led to the development of these materials for removal of radionuclides from nuclear waste, in which <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>90</sup>Sr are highly radioactive.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The aim of much of the recent work on porous framework structures has been to incorporate d-metal ions. Materials that have been synthesized include antiferromagnetic porous iron(III) fluorophosphates with Neel temperatures in the range 10&#x2013;40 K. These temperatures are relatively high for iron clusters linked by phosphate groups and indicate the presence of moderately strong magnetic interactions. Zeotypic cobalt(II), vanadium(V), titanium(IV), and nickel(II) phosphates have been prepared, including the material known as VSB-1 (Versailles-Santa Barbara), which was the first microporous solid with 24-membered ring tunnels, and is simultaneously porous, magnetic, and an ion-exchange medium(<a href="#fig_24.55">Fig. 24.55</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Tetrahedral coordination is common in simple metal sulfide chemistry, as we saw in the discussion of ZnS in wurtzite and sphalerite (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>), and some compounds may be considered as containing linked fragments of these structures known as <b>supertetrahedral clusters.</b> For example, [N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>4</sub>[Zn<sub>10</sub>S<sub>4</sub>(SPh)<sub>16</sub>] contains the isolated supertetrahedral unit Zn<sub>10</sub>S<sub>20</sub> terminated by phenyl groups (<a href="#fig_24.56">Fig. 24.56</a>).</p>

<p class="av-noindentt" style="margin-top:2em;">these compounds have now been made, and include positively charged frameworks with balancing anions in the cavities (for instance, Ag(4,4&#x0027;-bpy)NO<sub>3</sub>) and electrically neutral frameworks, such as Zn2(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)NO<sub>3</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, from which the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules may be removed reversibly.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Synthesis of MOFs is normally achieved under solvothermal conditions through a reaction of a salt of the metal with the linking organic anion; unlike with zeolite chemistry, no SDA is necessary and the framework structure often contains just solvent molecules in any pores. Post-synthetic modification of MOFs is also possible, particularly on the bridging ligands, via typical organic group modification chemistry. Often the aim of this chemistry is to produce sites tailored for gas adsorption or catalysis or to improve the thermal and chemical stability of the MOF.</p>
<p class="av-indent">MOFs have properties analogous to those of zeolites, with high porosities leading to potential applications in gas adsorption, separation, and storage, and the potential for similar catalytic reactions to those that occur inside zeolite pores and channels (<a href="#sec_24.14">Section 25.14</a>), so they are being very actively researched for these applications. Potential advantages of MOFs over zeolites include the much greater structural diversity available with large numbers of linking organic groups and, through the use of long linking groups based on aromatic carboxylates, very highly porous structures. Of note is the framework of a chromium terephthalate (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) which has pore diameters of about 3 nm and a specific internal surface area for N<sub>2</sub> of over 5000 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> (<a href="#fig_24.58">Fig. 24.58</a>). Through choice of linking ligand and post-synthesis modification it is also possible to tune the properties of MOFs to strongly adsorb one molecule in preference to another. Systems that adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> in preferences to other molecules, especially N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, are being studied for the sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> from air and power plant waste gases as part of carbon-capture schemes.</p>

<p class="av-indent">These materials also have potential applications in gas storage, for example of H<sub>2</sub> and hydrocarbons, though for H<sub>2</sub> the physisorption of molecules only occurs on the internal surfaces to an appreciable extent at liquid-nitrogen temperatures. Therefore the most likely use of MOFs is to reduce the pressure during storage of liquid natural gas. The very large pores of MOFs allow large, complex molecules such as many pharmaceutically active compounds to be inserted into them, and a further possible application involves using MOFs as drug-delivery agents. Here an active compound, for example the painkiller ibuprofen, is adsorbed within the MOF pore; when the impregnated MOF is ingested or injected into the human body the active pharmaceutical ingredient will be slowly released and, potentially, just where required. A further proposed application of MOFs is in catalysis, where the ability to control the dimensions and shape of the pore and also to introduce chiral motifs, using a chiral organic linking unit, is highly exciting.</p>
<p class="av-indent">A disadvantage of MOFs over zeolites and other purely inorganic nanoporous materials is that they are thermally and chemically much less stable because of the organic component in their structures, though some MOFs can persist to above 500&#x00B0;C and are stable in strong acid or base conditions. <a id="page_694" class="page">Page 694, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>

<h3 class="av-h3a"><b>Hydrides and hydrogen-storage materials</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">The development of materials for use in a future hydrogen-based energy economy is a key challenge facing inorganic chemists. One of the main areas where new materials are needed is in hydrogen storage. High-pressure gas cylinders and liquification routes are unlikely to meet the requirements of some hydrogen-storage applications in, for example, transport or distributed power supplies because of weight and safety issues. New materials for storing hydrogen will be required to have high capacities, both volumetrically and gravimetrically, while also being relatively cheap. Technical targets that have been proposed for transport applications are materials that have 6&#x2013;9 per cent of the system mass as hydrogen and cost a few dollars per kilowatt-hour of stored energy. A further requirement is that the hydrogen should become available from the storage system at between 60 and 120&#x00B0;C. Two main approaches to these new materials are being pursued: chemically bound hydrogen in, for example, metal hydrides, and new porous or high-surface-area compounds that physisorb hydrogen. In this section the inorganic chemistry behind these two approaches is discussed, together with a description of the latest advances in the materials that have been produced.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_24.13">
<h3 class="av-h3">24.13 <b>Metal hydrides</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">Hydrogen forms metal hydrides by reaction with many metals and metal alloys (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.6">Sections 10.6b and c</a>). In many cases this process can be reversed, liberating H<sub>2</sub> and regenerating the metal or alloy, by heating the (complex) metal hydride. These metal hydrides have an important safety advantage over pressurized or liquefied hydrogen (and many physisorbed hydrogen systems) that are also being considered for hydrogen storage, where rapid uncontrolled release of hydrogen could be a concern (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box_10.4">Boxes 10.4</a> and <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#fig_13.1">13.1</a>). For hydrogen-storage applications, compounds that contain hydrogen in combination with the light elements (such as Li, Be, Na, Mg, B, and Al) offer some of the most promising materials, particularly as H:M ratios can reach 2 or more. Simple metal-hydride systems have been dealt with in the appropriate sections of Chapters 10, 11, and 12. Here we expand on the chemistry of these compounds and the related complex metal hydrides.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(a) Magnesium-based metal hydrides</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span>Magnesium hydride contains a high weight per cent of hydrogen and is a potential hydrogen-storage material.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Magnesium hydride, MgH<sub>2</sub> (rutile structure type; <a href="#fig_24.59">Fig. 24.59</a>), potentially offers a high capacity of 7.7 per cent hydrogen by mass combined with the low cost of magnesium and good reversibility for hydrogen uptake and evolution at high temperatures. However, its decomposition temperature of 300&#x00B0;C under 1 atm of hydrogen gas is uneconomically high, and considerable effort has been expended to develop new, related materials that have lower hydrogen-release temperatures. Doping of MgH<sub>2</sub> with a variety of metals has been undertaken to produce the solid solutions Mg<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>M<sub><i>x</i></sub>H<sub>2&#x00B1;<i>y</i></sub> for M&#x003D;Al, V, Ni, Co, Ti, Ge, and La/Ni mixtures, some of which have slightly lower decomposition temperatures. More promising are changes in the microstructure of MgH<sub>2</sub> which are caused by ball-milling (<a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>), particularly when done in combination with other materials, such as metals (Ni, Pd) and metal oxides (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Ball-milling of MgH<sub>2</sub> increases the surface area of the solid by a factor of about 10 and the number of defects in the crystallites, promoting both adsorption and de-adsorption of hydrogen.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Physisorption on to the surface of very high-surface-area materials, including any internal pores, offers high hydrogen-storage capacities. However, these high values may be reached only by cooling the system or use of very high pressures, neither of which may be applicable to eventual applications.

Whereas many insoluble organic compounds (for example, C.I. Pigment Red 48, which is calcium 4-((5-chloro-4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo)-3-hydroxy- <a id="page_697" class="page">Page 697, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid) are also used as pigments, inorganic materials often have advantages in terms of applications associated with their chemical, light, and thermal stability. Pigments were originally developed from naturally occurring compounds such as hydrated iron oxides, manganese oxides, lead carbonate, vermilion (HgS), orpiment (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), and copper carbonates. These compounds were even used in prehistoric cave paintings. Synthetic pigments, which are often analogues of naturally occurring compounds, were developed by some of the earliest chemists and alchemists, and the first synthetic chemists were probably those involved in making pigments. Thus, the pigment Egyptian blue (CaCuSi<sub>4</sub> O<sub>10</sub>) was made from sand, calcium carbonate, and copper ores as long as 3000 years ago. This compound and a structural analogue, Chinese blue (BaCuSi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>), which was first made about 2500 years ago, adopt structures containing square-planar copper(II) ions surrounded by Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> groups (<a href="#fig_24.63">Fig. 24.63</a>). Inorganic pigments continue to be important commercial materials, and this section summarizes some of the recent advances in this field.</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">Luminescence is the emission of light by materials that have absorbed energy in some form. Photoluminescence occurs when photons, usually in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, are the source of energy and the output usually is visible light. Cathodoluminescence uses electron beams as a source of energy, and electroluminescence uses electrical energy. Two types of photoluminescence can be distinguished: fluorescence, which has a period of less than 10<sup>&#x2013;8</sup> s between photon absorption and emission, and phosphorescence, for which there are much longer delay times (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.7">Section 20.7</a>).</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">Photoluminescent materials, frequently referred to as phosphors, generally consist of a host structure, such as ZnS (wurtzite structure; <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>), CaWO<sub>4</sub> (scheelite structure type with discrete WO<span class="av-bold">4<sup>&#x2013;</sup></span> tetrahedra separated by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions), or Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, into which an activator ion is introduced by doping. These activator ions are certain d-metal or lanthanoid ions, such as Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> , Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, and Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, that have the ability to absorb and emit light of the desired wavelengths. In some cases a second dopant is added as a sensitizer to aid the absorption of light of the desired wavelength. Well-known applications of such materials include fluorescent lamps and television screens, where there is a need for materials that fluoresce in specific regions of the visible spectrum.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">Many host/activator combinations have been studied as potential phosphor materials, with the aim of producing a material that efficiently converts UV radiation or cathode rays (electron beams) to pure emission of a desirable colour. The modification of the host structure and the nature and environment of the activator ion allows these properties to be tuned:</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">In many fluorescent lamps, a mercury discharge produces UV radiation at 254 and 185 nm. Then a coating of ZnS that has been doped with various activators produces fluorescence at several wavelengths that combine to give an effective white light.</p>

<p class="av-boxparai">Colour television requires three primary-colour, cathodoluminescent materials to produce a picture. These phosphors are typically ZnS:Ag<sup>&#x002B; </sup>(blue), ZnS:Cu<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (green), and YVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (red). In YVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> the vanadate group absorbs the incident electron energy and the activator is Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. The emission mechanism involves electron transfer between the vanadate group and Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, and the efficiency of this process depends on the M&#x2014;O&#x2014;M bond angle in a similar way to the superexchange process in antiferromag-nets (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>). The nearer this angle is to 180&#x00B0;, the faster and more efficient is the electron transfer process. In YVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu this angle is 170&#x00B0;, and this material is a highly efficient phosphor.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">Anti-Stokes phosphors convert two or more photons of lower energy to one of higher energy (such as infrared radiation to visible light). They act by absorbing two or more photons in the excitation process before emitting one photon.

<p class="av-indent">Colour also arises in many inorganic compounds from charge transfer (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.5">Section 20.5</a>) or what is often electronically an equivalent process in solids, the promotion of an electron from a valence band (derived mainly from anion orbitals) into a conduction band (derived mainly from metal orbitals). Charge-transfer pigments include compounds such as lead chromate (PbCrO<sub>4</sub>), containing the yellow-orange chromate(VI) anion, and BiVO<sub>4</sub>, with the yellow vanadate(V) anion. The compounds CdS (yellow) and CdSe (red) both adopt the wurtzite structure and their colour arises from transitions from the filled valence band (which is mainly derived from chalcogenide p orbitals) to orbitals based mainly on Cd (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#box19.4">Box 19.4</a>). For a material with a band gap of 2.4 eV (as for CdS at 300 K) these transitions occur as a broad absorption corresponding to wavelengths shorter than 515 nm; thus CdS is bright yellow, as the blue part of the visible spectrum is fully absorbed. For CdSe the band gap is smaller on account of the higher energies of the Se4p orbitals, and the absorption edge shifts to lower energies. As a result, only red light is not absorbed by the material. In some mixed-valence compounds, electron transfer between differently charged metal centres can also occur in the visible region, and as these transfers are often fully allowed they give rise to intense colour. Prussian blue, [Fe(III)]<sub>4</sub>[Fe(II)(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig_24.64">Fig. 24.64</a>), is one such compound and its dark-blue colour has resulted in its widespread use in inks. Intensely coloured, often dark brown, blue, or black, Ru compounds, such as the tris(carboxyl)-terpyridine complex [Ru(2,2',2"-(COOH)<sub>3</sub>-terpy)(NCS)<sub>3</sub>], absorb efficiently right across the visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum and are used as photosensitizers in Gratzel-type solar cells (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#box_21.1">Box 21.1</a>).</p>

<p class="av-indent">Inorganic radicals often have fairly low-energy electronic transitions that can occur in the visible region. Two well-known examples are NO<sub>2</sub> (brown) and ClO<sub>2</sub> (yellow). One inorganic pigment is based on an inorganic radical, but because of the high reactivity normally associated with main-group compounds containing unpaired electrons, this species is trapped inside a zeolite cage. Thus the royal-blue pigment ultramarine, a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring semiprecious stone lapis lazuli, has the idealized formula Na<sub>8</sub>[SiAlO<sub>4</sub>]<sub>6</sub>&#x00B7;(S<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and contains the S<sup>&#x2013;</sup> polysulfide radical anion occupying a sodalite cage formed by the aluminosilicate framework (<a href="#fig_24.65">Fig. 24.65</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Current developments in inorganic pigment chemistry are focused on finding replacements for some of the yellow and red materials that contain heavy metals, such as Cd and Pb. Although these materials themselves are not toxic, as the compounds are very stable and the metal is difficult to leach into the environment, their synthesis and disposal can be problematic. Compounds that have been investigated to replace cadmium chalcogenides and lead-based pigments are the lanthanoid sulfides, such as Ce<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (red), and early d-metal oxide-nitrides, such as Ca<sub>0&#x00B7;5</sub>La<sub>0&#x00B7;5</sub>Ta(O<sub>1&#x00B7;5</sub>N<sub>1&#x00B7;5</sub>) (orange). In both cases, the replacement of O<sup>2-</sup> by S<sup>2-</sup> or N<sup>3-</sup> ion has the effect of narrowing the band gap in these solids (compared to the colourless solids CeO<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which have large band gaps and absorb only in the UV region of the spectrum) and bringing the electron excitation energy into the visible. However, neither of these materials has the stability of the cadmium- and lead-based pigments.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.16 <b>White and black pigments</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">Some of the most important compounds used to modify the visual characteristics of polymers and paints have visible-region absorption spectra that result in them appearing either white (ideally no absorption in the visible region) or black (complete absorption between 380 and 800 nm).</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(a) White pigments</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Titanium dioxide is used extensively as a white pigment.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">White inorganic materials can also be classified as pigments, and vast quantities of these compounds are synthesized for applications such as the production of white plastics and paints. Important commercial compounds of this class that have been used extensively historically are TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, ZnS, lead(II) carbonate, and lithopone (a mixture of ZnO and BaSO<sub>4</sub>); note that none of the metals in these materials has an incomplete d-electron shell that might otherwise induce colour through d-d transitions. Titanium dioxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, in <a id="page_699" class="page">Page 699, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>either its rutile or anatase form (<a href="#fig_24.66">Fig. 24.66</a>), is produced from titanium ores, often ilmenite, FeTiO<sub>3</sub>, by the <i>sulfate process</i> (which involves dissolution in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and subsequent precipitation through hydrolysis) or the <i>chloride process</i> (which is based on the reaction of mixed complex titanium oxides with chlorine to produce TiCl<sub>4</sub>, which is then combusted with oxygen at over 1000&#x00B0;C). These routes produce very high-quality TiO<sub>2</sub>, free from impurities (which is essential for a bright white pigment) and of controlled particle size. The desirable qualities of TiO<sub>2</sub> as a white pigment derive from its large band gap (&#x003E;3 eV so no transition absorbing visible light can occur); its excellent light-scattering power, which in turn is a result of its high refractive index (<i>n</i><sub>r</sub> &#x003D; 2.70); the ability to produce very pure materials of a desired particle size; its good light-fastness and weather resistance; and its nontoxicity (compared with the previously used lead carbonate). Uses of titanium dioxide, which nowadays dominates the white-pigment market, include paints, coatings, and printing ink (where it is often used in combination with coloured pigments to increase their brightness and hiding power), plastics, fibres, paper, white cements, and even foodstuffs (where it can be added to icing sugar, sweets, processed fish fillets, and flour to improve their brightness).</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Special colour, light-absorbing, and interference effects can be induced in inorganic materials</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The most important black pigment is <i>carbon black</i>, which is a better-defined, industrially manufactured form of soot. Carbon black is obtained by partial combustion or pyrolysis (heating in the absence of air) of hydrocarbons. The material has excellent absorption properties right across the visible region of the spectrum, and applications include printing inks, paints, plastics, and rubber. Copper(II) chromite, CuCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, with the spinel structure (<a href="#fig_24.18">Fig. 24.18</a>), is used less frequently as a black pigment. These black pigments also absorb light outside the visible region, including the infrared, which means that they heat up readily on exposure to sunlight. Because this heating can have drawbacks in a number of applications, there is interest in the development of new materials that absorb in the visible region but reflect infrared wavelengths; Bi<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> is one compound that exhibits these properties.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Examples of more specialist inorganic pigments are magnetic pigments based on coloured ferromagnetic compounds such as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CrO<sub>2</sub>, and anticorrosive pigments such as zinc phosphates. The deposition of inorganic pigments on to surfaces in thin layers can produce additional optical effects beyond light absorption. Thus deposition of TiO<sub>2</sub> or Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as layers a few hundred nanometres thick, on flakes of mica produces lustrous or pearlescent pigments in which interference effects between light scattered from the various surfaces and layers produces shimmering and iridescent colours.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.17 Photocatalysts</h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">In an inorganic pigment the light absorbed is generally reemitted or transformed into vibrational energy (or heat) in the solids. In a photovoltaic material (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.20">Sections 3.20</a> and <a href="#sec_24.18">24.18</a>), the light energy excites an electron and the separation of this electron and the remaining hole, provided they do not recombine immediately, can give rise to electrical current. An alternative method of harvesting the light energy absorbed is through the catalysis of a chemical process such as the splitting of water into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> or through the reaction or decomposition of organic molecules. Materials that promote these processes are known as <b>photocatalysts</b>.</p>
<p class="av-indent">One of the most studied photocatalysts is TiO<sub>2</sub>, whose optical properties have been discussed previously (<a href="#sec_24.16">Section 24.16a</a>). The wide band gap in TiO<sub>2</sub> (anatase polymorph, 3.2 eV rutile, 3.1 eV) leads to absorption of light with wavelengths only below &#x223C;390 nm&#x2014;that is, in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This energy is significantly greater than that required to split water (1.23 eV) through the processes as shown in <a href="#fig_24.67">Figure 24.67</a>; the excited electron can combine with H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to produce H<sub>2</sub> and the hole with OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to generate oxygen. Thus a TiO<sub>2</sub> surface placed in water photocatalytically produces H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases when illuminated by UV light or sunlight (which contains &#x223C;5 percent of its light as UV radiation). However, such processes are very inefficient for harvesting solar energy for many reasons; these include the low efficiency of light absorption, inefficiencies in the electron&#x2013;hole separation process, and the low surface area of bulk TiO<sub>2</sub> at which the photocatalysis reactions can occur. A variety of methods is being investigated to improve the <a id="page_700" class="page">Page 700, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>efficiencies of such photocatalytic cells. These include the use of dyes to extend the range of solar light wavelengths absorbed (as in Gr&#x00E4;tzel cells; <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#box_21.1">Box 21.1</a>), the formation of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with high surface areas (<a href="#sec_24.23">Section 24.23</a>), and the development of coatings for TiO<sub>2</sub> such as NiO and (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> which promote photocatalysis using visible wavelengths of light (a larger component of the solar spectrum). Materials other than TiO<sub>2</sub> that perform the photocatalysis process are also being actively researched. These include other transition-metal oxides with smaller band gaps, such as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and compounds where the band gap is narrowed through the incorporation of dopants, as in TiO<sub>2,</sub> and anion substitutions, as in the oxide-nitrides TiO<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>N<sub><i>y</i></sub> and metal oxide-sulfides. Complex oxides, such as NaTaO<sub>3</sub> and SnWO<sub>4</sub>, are also being studied.</p>

When ultraviolet light in sunlight strikes the TiO 2 coating of a self-cleaning window, mobile electrons are generated, as shown in <a href="#fig_24.67">Fig. 24.67</a> , and react with water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals on the TiO 2 surface. The hydroxyl radicals attack aliphatic organic molecules that form greasy deposits on the window surface, reducing their chain length and producing more hydrophilic, oxygen-containing organic species. When the external surface of the glass is wetted by rain, the hydrophilicity of the TiO 2 surface reduces contact angles for water droplets to very low values, causing the water to form a thin layer and wash the residual organic species away. Since the photocatalytic reactions happen on the surface of the TiO 2 coating they are very effective at loosening the lowest layers of the greasy deposits and so all the dirty material gets washed away.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3a">Semiconductor chemistry</h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">The basic inorganic chemistry of semiconducting materials, particularly their electronic band structures, was covered in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. The aim of this section is to discuss the inorganic semiconducting compounds themselves in more detail and to describe some of the applications that result from using chemistry to control their electronic properties.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Semiconductors are classified on the basis of their composition. To produce materials with band gaps typical of a semiconductor (a few eV corresponding to 100&#x2013;200 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), compounds usually contain the p-block metals and Group 13/14 metalloids, often in combination with heavier Group 15 and 16 elements. For these combinations, the atomic orbitals form into bands with energies such that the valence and conduction <a id="page_701" class="page">Page 701, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>band separation is in the desired range of 0.2&#x2013;4 eV. A further factor that influences the band gap of a semiconductor material is its dimension, and the formation of nanoparticles of semiconducting materials, such as those combining the Group 13/15 or Group 12/16 elements, is currently a topic of intense research (<a href="#sec_24.30"> Section 24.30</a>).</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.18 <b>Group 14 semiconductors</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Crystalline and amorphous silicon are cheap semiconducting materials and are widely used in electronic devices.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The most important semiconducting material is Si, which in its pure crystalline form (with a diamond structure) has a band gap of 1.1 eV. As would be expected from considerations of atomic radii, orbital energies, and the extent of orbital overlap, Ge has a smaller band gap, 0.66 eV and C as diamond has a band gap of 5.47 eV. When doped with a Group 13 or 15 element, Si&#x2014;and indeed C and Ge&#x2014;are extrinsic semiconductors. The conductivity of pure Si, an intrinsic semiconductor, is around 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> S cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at room temperature but increases by several orders of magnitude on doping with either a Group 13 element (to give a p-type semiconductor) or a Group 15 element (to give an n-type semiconductor); thus the properties of doped Si can be tuned for a particular semiconductor application.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Amorphous Si can be obtained by chemical vapour deposition, by thermal decomposition of SiH<sub>4</sub>, or by heavy-ion bombardment of crystalline Si. The deposited material contains a small proportion of H that is present in Si&#x0064;H groups in a three-dimensional glass-like structure with many Si&#x0064;Si links. The lack of regular structure in this material and the presence of Si&#x0064;H groups alters the semiconducting properties of the material considerably. One of the main applications of amorphous Si is in silicon solar cells. Thin films of p- and n-type amorphous Si forming a p&#x2013;n junction generate current when illuminated (<a href="#box_24.5">Box 24.5</a>). The electron and hole pairs produced from the energy supplied by the incident photon separate rather than recombine because of the normal p&#x2013;n junction bias, with the tendency for the electrons to travel towards the p-type Si and holes towards the n-type Si. If a load is connected across the junction, a current can flow and electrical energy is generated from the electromagnetic illumination. The efficiency of such devices depends on a number of factors. For example, amorphous Si absorbs solar radiation 40 times more efficiently than does single-crystal Si, so a film only about 1 &#x00B5;m thick can absorb 90 per cent of the usable solar energy. Also, the lifetimes and mobility of the electrons and holes are longer in amorphous Si, which results in high photoelectric efficiencies (the proportion of radiant energy converted into electrical energy), of the order of 10 percent. Other economic advantages are that amorphous Si can be produced at a lower temperature and can be deposited on low-cost substrates. Amorphous Si solar cells are widely used in pocket calculators but, as production costs diminish, are likely to find much wider applications as renewable-energy devices.</p>

The Fermi levels in the differently doped materials are different, but when they are placed in contact electrons will flow from the n-type (high potential) to the p-type (low potential) region across the junction so as to reach an equilibriumdistribution in which the Fermi levels are equal. If a potential difference is applied in the right direction across the junction this process will continue, with electrons able to move from n-type to p-type, and a currentflows in this direction. However,current can flow only in this direction, from n-type to p-type. The p–n junction thus forms the basis of a rectifier, allowing current to pass in only one direction.</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">It is possible to produce white light with a single LED by using a phosphor layer (yttrium aluminium garnet, Box 23.1) on the surface of a blue (gallium nitride) LED. These white-light LEDs are highly efficient at converting electricity into light, much more so than incandescent lamps and even &#x2018;low-energy&#x2019; fluorescent lights (<a href="#box_24.3">Box 24.3</a>). At present they are more expensive to produce than fluorescent light bulbs and their use is limited to small-scale, battery-driven devices, but they are likely to form the basis of many lighting products of the future.</p>
<p class="av-boxpara">Another advantage of being able to produce blue LEDs is that they can be used as lasers in high-capacity optoelectronic storage devices such as Blu-ray discs. The wavelength of blue light produced by these LEDs (405 nm) is shorter than that used in DVD-format devices (red light, 650 nm), which allows data to be written in smaller bits on an optical disk.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.19 <b>Semiconductor systems isoelectronic with silicon</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Semiconductors formed from equal amounts of Group 13/15 or Group 12/16 elements are isoelectronic with silicon and can have enhanced properties based on changes in the electronic structure and electron motion.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Gallium arsenide, GaAs, is one of a number of so-called Group 13/15 (or, still more commonly, III/V) semiconductors, which also include GaP, InP, AlAs, and GaN, formed by combination of equal amounts of a Group 13 and a Group 15 element. Ternary and quaternary Group 13/15 compounds, such as Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>As, InAs<sub>1&#x2212;<i>y</i></sub>P<sub><i>y</i></sub>, and In<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>As<sub>1&#x2212;<i>y</i></sub>P<sub><i>y</i></sub>, can also be formed and many of them also have valuable semiconducting properties. Note that these compositions are isoelectronic with pure Group 14 elements, but the changes in the element electronegativity and thus bonding type (for instance, pure Si can be considered as having purely covalent bonding whereas GaAs has a small degree of ionic character due to the difference in the electronegativities of Ga and As) leads to changes in the band structures and fundamental properties associated with electron motion through the structures.</p>
<p class="av-indent">One of the advantageous properties of GaAs is that semiconductor devices based on it respond more rapidly to electrical signals than those based on silicon. This responsiveness makes GaAs better than silicon for a number of tasks, such as amplifying the high-frequency (1&#x2013;10 GHz) signals of satellite TV. Gallium arsenide can be used with signal frequencies up to about 100 GHz. At even higher frequencies materials such asindium phosphide (InP) may be used. At present, frequencies above about 50 GHz are rarely used commercially, so most of the electronics in the world tend to be based on silicon, with some GaAs and only a few InP devices. Gallium arsenide is also far more expensive than Si, in terms of both the cost of raw materials and the chemical processes required to produce the pure material.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In some Group 13/15 semiconductors, such as GaN, the cubic, diamond-like sphalerite structure is only metastable, the stable polymorph being the hexagonal, wurzite structure. Both structures can be grown by altering the synthetic routes and conditions. Because of their large and direct energy band gaps, these semiconductors allow the fabrication of luminescent devices that produce blue light at high intensity (<a href="#box_24.5">Box 24.5</a>), and their stabilities to high temperatures and good thermal conductivities also make them valuable for the fabrication of high-power transistors.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The Group 12/16 (II/VI) semiconductors comprise the compounds containing Zn, Cd, and Hg as cations and O, S, Se, and Te as anions. These semiconductor materials can crystallize in either the cubic sphalerite phase or the hexagonal wurzite phase, and the form synthesized has characteristic semiconducting properties. For example, the band gap is 3.64 eV in cubic ZnS but 3.74 eV in hexagonal ZnS. These Group 12/16 compounds are more ionic in nature than the Group 13/15 semiconductors and Group 14 elements, particularly for the lighter elements, and the band gap is around 3&#x2013;4 eV for ZnO and ZnS but 1.475 eV for CdTe. Although amorphous Si is the leading thin-film photovoltaic (PV) material, cadmium telluride (CdTe) is also being studied for similar applications.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Some other semiconducting oxides and sulfides were mentioned in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.20">Section 3.20</a>, and research continues on other complex metal oxides and chalcogenides with improved <a id="page_703" class="page">Page 703, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>characteristics. For example, the current world-record thin-film solar cell efficiency of 17.7 percent is held by a device based on copper indium diselenide (CuInSe<sub>2</sub>; CIS), which has a similarstructure to cubic ZnS but with an ordered distribution of Cu and In atoms in the tetrahedral holes. Tin sulfide, SnS<sub>2</sub>, also has promising characteristics for photovoltaic devices and contains cheap, readily available, nontoxic elements.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3a" style="margin-top:2em;">Molecular materials and fullerides</h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">The majority of compounds discussed so far in this chapter have been materials with extended structures in which ionic or covalent interactions link all the atoms and ions together into a three-dimensional structure. Examples include infinite structures based on ionic, as in NaCl, or covalent interactions, as in SiO<sub>2</sub>. These materials are widely used in applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, rechargeable batteries, and electronic devices because of the chemical and thermal stability that derives from their linked structures. It is often possible to tune the properties of many solids exactly, for example by doping, introducing defects, or forming solid solutions. However, control of the arrangement of atoms into a particular structure cannot be achieved to the same degree for solids as for molecular systems. Thus a chemist working with coordination compounds or organometallics can modify a complex or molecule by introducing a wide range of ligands, often through simple substitution reactions. The desire to combine the synthetic and chemical flexibility of molecular chemistry with the properties of classical solid-state materials has led to the rapid emergence of the area of <b>molecular materials chemistry</b>, where functional solids are produced from linked and interacting molecules or molecular ions.</p>

The solid structure has a face-centred cubic array of the C<sub>60</sub> molecules, as shown in <a href="#fig_24.68">Fig. 24.68</a>, as would be expected on the basis of efficient packing of these almost-spherical molecules. At room temperature the molecules can rotate freely in their lattice positions, and powder X-ray diffraction data collected from crystalline C<sub>60</sub> are typical of an fcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 1417 pm. The molecules are separated by a distance of 296 pm, which is similar to the value found for the interlayer separation in graphite (335 pm). On cooling of the solid, the rotation halts and adjacent molecules align relative to each other such that an electron-rich region of one C<sub>60</sub> molecule is close to an electron-poor region in its neighbour.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.21 <b>Molecular materials chemistry</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">The ability to modify the shapes, and thus the packing and arrangements of inorganic molecules in the solid state, is one valuable aspect of molecular materials chemistry. This capability, when associated with some of thespecific properties of inorganic compounds such as the unpaired d electrons of d metals, can allow control of magnetic and electronic properties. This section considers a number of such inorganic molecular materials being developed at the frontiers of the subject.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(a) One-dimensional metals</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>A stack of molecules that interact with each other along one dimension, as occurs in a number of crystalline platinum complexes, can show conductivity in that direction; a Peierls distortion ensures that no one-dimensional solid is a metallic conductor below a critical temperature.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">A one-dimensional metal is a material that exhibits metallic properties along one direction in the crystal and nonmetallic properties orthogonal to that direction. This should be contrasted to one-dimensional structures and nanomaterials, such as those discussed in <a href="#sec_24.27">Section 24.27</a>, which have a structural or physical component that is one-dimensional in nature. One-dimensional metallic properties arise when the orbital overlap occurs along a single direction in the crystal (as in VO<sub>2</sub>). Several classes of one-dimensional metals are known and include (SN)<sub><i>x</i></sub> and organic polymers, such as doped polyacetylenes [(CH)I<sub>0.25</sub>]<sub><i>n</i></sub>, but this section is concerned specifically with chains of interacting d metals, particularly Pt.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In such materials, the structural requirements for a one-dimensional metal are satisfied by the presence of square-planar complexes that stack one above another (<a href="#fig_24.71">Fig. 24.71</a>). The ligands surrounding the metal atom ensure large interchain separations, of at least 900 pm, while the average intrachain metal&#x2013;metal distance is less than 300 pm. Square-planar complexes are commonly found for metal ions with d<sup>8</sup> configurations, and the overlap of orbitals between d<sup>8</sup> species is greatest for the heavy d metals of Period 6 (which use 5d orbitals). Hence the compounds of interest are mainly associated with Pt(II) and Ir(I), where a band is formed from overlapping <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mtext>d</mtext><mrow><msup><mi>z</mi><mtext>2</mtext></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> and p<sub><i>z</i></sub> orbitals.

Many d<sup>8</sup> tetracyanidoplatinate(II) complexes are semiconductors with <i>d</i><sub>Pt&#x0064;Pt</sub> &#x003C; 310 pm, and the partial oxidation of these salts <a id="page_705" class="page">Page 705, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>results in Pt&#x0064;Pt distances of less than 290 pm and metallic behaviour. Typical means of oxidizing the chain are the incorporation of extra anions into the structure or the removal of cations. The first one-dimensional metal Pt complex was made in 1846 by oxidation of a solution of K<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>&#x00B7;3H<sub>2</sub>O with bromine, which on evaporation gave crystals of K<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>0.3</sub>&#x00B7;3H<sub>2</sub>O, known as KCP (as in <a href="#fig_24.71">Fig. 24.71</a>).</p>

<p class="av-indent">The electronic properties of one-dimensional metals are not quite as simple as has been implied by the discussion so far, as a theorem due to Rudolph Peierls states that, at <i>T</i> &#x003D; 0, <i>no</i> one-dimensional solid is a metal! The origin of Peierls&#x2019; theorem can be traced to a hidden assumption in the discussion so far: we have supposed that the atoms lie in a line with a regular separation. However, the actual spacing in a one-dimensional solid (and any solid) is determined by the distribution of the electrons, not vice versa, and there is no guarantee that the state of lowest energy is a solid with a regular lattice spacing. In fact, in a one-dimensional solid at <i>T</i> &#x003D; 0, there always exists a distortion, a <b>Peierls distortion</b>, which leads to a lower energy than in the perfectly regular solid.</p>d
<p class="av-indent">An idea of the origin and effect of a Peierls distortion can be obtained by considering a one-dimensional solid of <i>N</i> atoms and <i>N</i> valence electrons (<a href="#fig_24.72">Fig. 24.72</a>). Such a line of atoms distorts to one that has alternating long and short bonds. Although the longer bond is energetically unfavourable, the strength of the short bond more than compensates for the weakness of the long bond and the net effect is a lowering of energy below that of the regular solid. Now, instead of the electrons near the Fermi surface being free to move through the solid, they are trapped between the longer-bonded atoms (these electrons have antibonding character, and so are found outside the internuclear region between strongly bonded atoms). The Peierls distortion introduces a band gap in the centre of the original conduction band, and the filled orbitals are separated from the empty orbitals. Hence, the distortion results in a semiconductor or insulator, not a metallic conductor.</p>

<p class="av-indent">The conduction band in KCP is a d band formed principally by overlap of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mtext>Pt</mtext><mn>5</mn><msub><mtext>d</mtext><mrow><msup><mi>z</mi><mtext>2</mtext></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> orbitals. The small proportion of Br in the compound, which is present as Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, removes a small number of electrons from this otherwise full d band, so turning it into a conduction band. Indeed, at room temperature, doped KCP is a lustrous bronze colour with its highest conductivity along the axis of the Pt chain. However, below 150 K the conductivity drops sharply on account of the onset of a Peierls distortion. At higher temperatures, the motion of the atoms averages the distortion to zero, the separation is regular (on average), the gap is absent, and the solid is a one-dimensional metal. Mixed-valence platinum chain complexes, such as [Pt(en)<sub>2</sub>][PtCl<sub>2</sub>(en)<sub>2</sub>](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, may be isolated as insulated, one-dimensional wires by surrounding the Pt chain with a sheath of electronically inert molecules such as anionic lipids. Nanowires of this type are discussed more fully in <a href="#sec_24.27">Section 24.27</a>.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The observation of metallic behaviour in one-dimensional solids formed from interacting molecules has in turn led to a search for superconductivity in this class of materials. One type of material in which superconductivity has been found is a series of metal complexes derived from the organic metal and superconductors based on stacked molecules with interacting &#x03C0; systems. Thus salts of TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyano-<i>p</i>-quinodimethane (<b>1</b>) with TTF (tetrathiafulvalene, <b>2</b>) show some metallic properties, in that they are conducting and absorb a range of wavelengths of light. Salts of tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF, <b>3</b>) such as (TMTSF)<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub> show superconductivity, albeit at less than 10 K and often only under pressure. Molecular metal complexes involving types of sulfur-containing ligand, such as dmit (<b>4</b>) (dmit<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> &#x003D; 1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolato), can also show superconductivity. The compound [TTF][Ni(dmit)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>, which consists of stacks of both TTF and [Ni(dmit)<sub>2</sub>], shows superconductivity at 10 kbar and below 2 K.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Magneto-optical effects are based on the interaction between light and a magnetic material. For example, the <b>Faraday effect</b> is observed when linearly polarized light propagates through a magnetically ordered material. The polarized light undergoes a rotation of the plane of polarization that is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field in the direction of propagation. In Prussian blue analogues, which are often intensely coloured because of the presence of transition-metal ions and intervalence electron transfer between the metal centres, the Faraday effect is wavelength-dependent. This behaviour has potential use in opto-magnetic data storage devices, in which light of a specific wavelength may be used to write or read information that is stored in the form of local magnetic-moment orientations in the material.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Humans have, in fact, practised nanotechnology for centuries, though it is only recently that the chemistry of nanosized particles has engendered such high levels of interest and research funding. For example, gold and silver compounds have been used to produce red and yellow stained glass, respectively, for centuries. In stained glass, the gold and silver metal atoms exist as nanoparticles (known previously as &#x2018;colloidal particles&#x2019;) with optical properties that depend strongly on their size. Metallic nanopigments are now becoming a focal point of biomedical nanotechnology because they can be used to tag DNA and other active nanoparticles. Other classical examples of nanotechnology include the photosensitive nanosized particles in silver halide emulsions used in photography, nanoparticulate TiO<sub>2</sub> pigments, and the nanosized carbon granules in the &#x2018;carbon black&#x2019; used for reinforcing tyres and in printer&#x2019;s ink.</p>
<p class="av-indent">There are two basic techniques for the fabrication of nanoscale entities (<a href="#fig_24.75">Fig. 24.75</a>).

<h3 class="av-h3">24.23 <b>Solution-based synthesis of nanoparticles</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Solution-based, bottom-up, synthetic methods are mainly used for nanoparticle synthesis because they have atomically mixed and highly mobile reagents; the two stages of crystallization from solution are nucleation and growth.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">As discussed in <a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>, the two basic techniques used to generate inorganic solids are direct-combination methods and solution-based methods. The former does not lend itself well to the synthesis of nanoparticles because the reactants tend to be micrometre-sized particles which react over long periods to reach equilibrium. Moreover, the use of elevated temperatures leads to particle growth during the reaction, resulting in large crystallites, typically of sizes greater than 1 &#x03BC;m. There are, however, some examples of the use of mechanical ball-milling at low temperature to break micrometre-sized powders into nanoparticles; such methods have been used for producing nanosized particles of metal hydrides important as hydrogen-storage materials (<a href="#sec_24.13">Section 24.13</a>). Solution-based methods, however, permit excellent control over the crystallization of inorganic materials and are widely used in nanochemistry. By fine-tuning the crystallization process from solution, highly monodispersed, uniformly shaped nanoparticles of a wide range of compositions can be prepared by appropriate combinations of elements from throughout the periodic table.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Because the reactants in solution-based methods are mixed on an atomic scale and solvated in a liquid medium, diffusion is fast and diffusion distances are typically small. Therefore, reactions can be carried out at low temperature, which minimizes the thermally driven particle growth process that is problematic in direct-combination methods (<a href="#sec_24.1">Section 24.1</a>). Although the specifics of each reaction differ greatly, the basic stages in solution chemistry are:</p>
<p class="av-indenthanging">1. Solvation of reactant species and additives.</p>
<p class="av-indenthanging">2. Formation of stable solid crystallization nuclei from the solution.</p>
<p class="av-indenthanging">3. Controlled growth of the solid nuclei to a specific nanoparticle size through the addition of controlled amounts of reactant species.</p>
<p class="av-indent" style="margin-top:1em;">The basic aim in solution synthesis is to generate, in a controlled manner, the simultaneous formation of large numbers of stable nuclei that undergo little further growth. If growth is to occur, it should occur independently of the nucleation step because then all particles have a chance to grow to similar sizes. If performed successfully, the particles will be monodispersed&#x2014;that is, all of a similar size in the nanometre range. The drawback to the solution method is that the particles can undergo <span class="av-bold">Ostwald ripening,<sup>6</sup></span> in which smaller particles in the distribution redissolve and their solvated species subsequently re-precipitate on to larger particles, so increasing the average particle size and decreasing the total particle count. To prevent this unwanted ripening, <span class="av-bold">stabilizers</span>&#x2014;surfactant molecules that help prevent both dissolution and growth of small particles&#x2014;are added. As there are many methods to synthesize nanoparticles, we limit this discussion to a few well-known examples.</p>
<p class="av-foot"><sup>6</sup> This is a thermodynamically driven process that reduces the surface energy of the particles in the system.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt"> <a id="page_709" class="page">Page 709, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>In 1857, Michael Faraday found that reduction of an aqueous solution of [AuCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> with phosphorus in CS<sub>2</sub> produced a deep-red coloured suspension; this solution contained nanoparticles of gold. Because sulfur ligands form stable complexes with gold (soft-soft interaction; <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.9">Section 4.9</a>), sulfur-containing species are good stabilizing agents and the most widely used stabilizers for gold nanoparticles contain a thiol group (&#x2014;SH). An approach has been developed, in the same spirit as Faraday&#x0027;s, to control the size and dispersity of gold nanoparticles obtained from [AuCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> using thiol stabilizers; this produces air-stable gold nanoparticles with diameters between 1.5 and 5.2 nm. In the so-called <span class="av-bold">Brust-Schiffrin method</span>, [AuCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is first transferred from a solution in water to methylbenzene (toluene) by using tetraoctylammonium bromide as a phase-transfer agent. The methylbenzene contains dodecanethiol as a stabilizer and, after transfer, NaBH<sub>4</sub> is used as a reducing agent to precipitate Au nanoparticles with dodecanethiol surface groups:</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">where 'sol' is methylbenzene. The ratio of stabilizer (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>25</sub>SH) to metal (Au) controls the particle size, with higher stabilizer:metal ratios leading to smaller metal particles. By adding the NaBH<sub>4</sub> reductant quickly and cooling the system as soon as possible after the reaction terminates, smaller and more monodisperse nanoparticles are formed. The rapid addition of reductant increases the probability of simultaneous formation of all nuclei. By cooling the solution quickly, both post-nucleation growth and dissolution of particles are minimized. Similar approaches can be used for other metal nanoparticles.</p>

An early description of the preparation of CdSe nanoparticles involved dissolving dimethyl-cadmium, Cd(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in a mixture of trioctylphosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and adding a solution of Se, also dissolved in TOP or TOPO, at room temperature. The solution mixture was then injected into a reactant vessel containing vigorously stirred, hot TOPO, leading to the nucleation of TOPO-stabilized CdSe nanoparticles, also known as quantum dots (QDs; see <a href="#sec_24.30">Section 24.30</a>). Careful cooling and heating of the solution, to control the rates of nucleation and particle growth, led to nanoparticles with narrow size distributions and sizes in the range 2-12 nm. Alternative, less hazardous synthetic methods, avoiding the highly toxic Cd(CH<sub>3</sub><sub>2</sub>, have been developed more recently.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Cadmium sulfide can be grown in pH-controlled aqueous solutions of Cd(II) salts with polyphosphate stabilizers by the addition of a sulfur source. For example, at pH &#x003D; 10.3 the addition of Na<sub>2</sub>S causes the precipitation of CdS nanoparticles from aqueous solutions containing Cd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and sodium polyphosphate. These QDs range in size from 1 to 10 nm, and the size is controllable through the reactant concentrations and the rate of addition of the reactant.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Many applications use colloidal particles of oxides, such as SiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>, for food, ink, paints, and coatings, and these can also be grown by solution methods. Many of the efforts to achieve controlled oxide-nanoparticle growth stem from earlier work in traditional ceramic and colloidal applications, where particle sizes from 1 nm to 1 &#x03BC;m are widely used. Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) are probably the best-known nanoparticulate oxides grown from solution, and schemes typically involve the controlled hydrolysis of metal alkoxides. In all cases, strict monitoring of the pH, precursor chemistry, reactant concentration, rate of addition of reactant, and temperature is required to control the final size and shape of the particles.</p>
<p class="av-indent">An important example of nanoparticle oxide use is in the photoelectrochemical solar cell known as the <span class="av-bold">Gratzel cell</span> (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#box_21.1">Box 21.1</a>).

<h3 class="av-h3">24.24 <b>Vapour-phase synthesis of nanoparticles via solutions or solids</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points: </span>Vapour-phase synthetic methods are alternative techniques for nanoparticle synthesis using solutions or solids.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The same fundamentals concerning nucleation and growth that are relevant to solution synthesis apply to vapour-phase synthesis. The vapour phase needs to be supersaturated to the point at which a high density of homogeneous nucleation events produces solid particles in one short burst, and growth must be limited and controlled in a subsequent step, if it is to occur at all. Commercially, vapour-phase synthesis is carried out to produce nanoscale carbon black and fumed silica in large quantities. Metals, oxides, nitrides, carbides, and chalcogenides can also easily be formed by using vapour-phase techniques.</p>
<p class="av-indent">There are significant differences between vapour-phase and solution-based techniques. In the latter, stabilizers can be added in a straightforward and controllable fashion, and particles remain dispersed and independent of one another. In vapour-phase techniques, however, surfactants or stabilizers are not easily added, and, without surface stabilizers, nanoparticles tend to agglomerate into larger particles. The size dispersion of nanoparticles tends to be better for solution-based techniques than for vapour-phase techniques.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Vapour-phase techniques are classified by the physical state of the precursor used as a reagent and by the reaction method, such as <span class="av-italic">plasma synthesis</span> or <span class="av-italic">flame pyrolysis.</span> In each case, the reagent is converted to a supersaturated or superheated vapour that is allowed to react or to cool to force nucleation. Solid reagents are vaporized and then recondensed in gas-condensation (thermal evaporation to produce vapour), laser-ablation, sputtering, and spark-discharge methods. Liquid or vapour precursors are used in spray pyrolysis, flame synthesis, laser pyrolysis, plasma synthesis, and chemical vapour deposition. In spray pyrolysis a solution is directed onto a hot surface that causes the solvent to evaporate very quickly, leaving the solid product on the surface, while in flame synthesis or pyrolysis a liquid or solution is directed into a flame and thermal decomposition yields a fine particulate of the product. Laser pyrolysis uses a direct laser beam to rapidly heat the solution, causing evaporation of the solvent and decomposition of the nanoparticulate. In chemical vapour deposition, the vapour is transported to a substrate where reaction and solid nucleation occurs (<a href="#fig_24.76">Fig. 24.76</a>). In a variation of this procedure, gaseous precursors are delivered into a hot-walled reactor and allowed to react homogeneously in the vapour phase to nucleate solids, and particles are collected downstream. Particle sizes are controlled by the flow rates, precursor chemistry, concentrations, and residence times in the reactor. <span class="av-bold">Plasma synthesis</span> can be used to synthesize elemental solids, alloys, and oxides, as well as core-shell nanoparticles (see <a href="#sec_24.30">Section 24.30b</a>). In this method, gas or solid particles are fed into a plasma where they vaporize and ionize to highly energetic charged species. Inside a plasma, the temperatures can exceed 10 000 K. On leaving the plasma, the temperature falls rapidly and crystallization occurs under conditions far from equilibrium. The nano-particles are collected downstream from the plasma zone. Depending on the carrier gas (that is, the oxidation conditions), elemental solids, core-shell, or compound particles can be formed. Examples of other materials synthesized by vapour-phase techniques include metals, oxides, nitrides, and carbides such as SiC, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiC<sub><i>x</i></sub>O<sub><i>y</i></sub>N<sub><i>z</i></sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, TiN, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and ZrN.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Both solution and vapour-phase methods can be used to make composite nanoparti-cles, such as core-shell nanocomposites. In both techniques the approach is to grow a second phase on an initial nucleus or nanoparticle. Reaction design to produce core-shell nanoparticles by solution is straightforward provided the solution characteristics of both materials are similar. In practice, however, it is difficult to find materials where the synthesis conditions overlap. Vapour-phase techniques offer another approach to the design of core-shell particles, by injecting a second vapour into a reactor at the growth stage. <a id="page_711" class="page">Page 711, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.25 <b>Templated synthesis of nanomaterials using frameworks, supports, and substrates</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">Heterogeneous nucleation, nucleation that occurs on an existing surface, can be used to generate important kinds of nanostructures, including zero-, one-, and two-dimensional materials. The methods are similar to those already described: they are either physical or chemical and involve crystallization from either liquids or vapours. The principal difference is that an outside agent is also involved and permits the direct control of the nanoparticle formation. The outside agent can be a framework or a support structure that limits the size of the reaction volume for nanoparticle synthesis by using, for example, inverse micelle frameworks. During two-dimensional thin film growth, the outside agent is a substrate.</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points: </span>By carrying out reactions in nanoscale reaction vessels, the ultimate dimensions of solid products are confined to the vessel size; a reverse micelle has an aqueous core in which reactions can occur.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">When the synthesis of a particle is carried out in a nano-vessel, the ultimate particle size is limited by the vessel size. One popular route is the <span class="av-bold">inverse micelle synthesis</span> approach. An inverse micelle consists of a two-phase dispersion of immiscible liquids, such as water and a nonpolar oil. By including amphipathic surfactant molecules (molecules having a polar and a nonpolar end), the aqueous phase can be stabilized as dispersed spheres with a size dictated by the water:surfactant ratio (<a href="#fig_24.77">Fig. 24.77</a>). The size of the crystalline particles is limited by the micelle volume, which can be controlled on the nanoscale. Examples of nanoparticles formed by this technique are Cu, Fe, Au, Co, CdS, CdSe, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, ferrites, and core-shell particles such as Fe/Au.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">In <span class="av-bold">physical vapour deposition</span> (PVD) methods, vapours are delivered from their source to a solid substrate on which they crystallize. The arriving gaseous species are typically atoms, ions, or clusters of elements. There are several general forms of PVD that are widely used: <span class="av-bold">molecular beam epitaxy</span> (MBE), sputtering, and <span class="av-bold">pulsed-laser deposition</span> (PLD). The gas-phase species can have either relatively low kinetic energies on arrival (as in MBE) or relatively high kinetic energies (as in sputtering and PLD). The most important feature that all PVD methods have in common is the ability to achieve complex film stoichiometries, and because vapour deposition methods allow single atomic layers to be deposited in a controlled fashion on a support or substrate, nanoscale architectures can be built from the bottom up.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is an ultrahigh-vacuum technique for growing thin <span class="av-bold">epitaxial films</span>, films that have a definite crystallographic relationship with the underlying substrate. In MBE, molecular beams are formed by heating elemental sources until atoms evaporate and are transported ballistically at low pressures to the substrate surface. Film stoichiometry and film-growth rates are highly dependent on the beam fluxes, which can be controlled by adjusting the temperatures of the elemental sources. <span class="av-bold">Homoepitaxy</span> is the epitaxial growth of a thin film of a material on a substrate of the same material. <span class="av-bold">Heteroepitaxy</span> is the epitaxial growth of a thin film of a material on a substrate of a different material. Heteroepitaxy introduces a strain between the growing material and the substrate, caused by crystallographic mismatch of their lattice parameters.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile PVD technique that can be used to synthesize a wide variety of high-quality thin films (<a href="#fig_24.78">Fig. 24.78</a>). In PLD, a pulsed laser is used to ablate a target, which releases a plume of atomized and ionized particles from its surface that condenses onto a nearby target. The PLD process usually produces films of composition identical to that of the substrate, which is a major simplification compared with techniques that require fine-tuning or expensive control equipment to achieve a specific stoichiometry. PLD has been used to grow a variety of high-quality superlattices, such as alternating layers of SrMnO<sub>3</sub> and PrMnO<sub>3</sub>, each only 1 nm thick. <a id="page_712" class="page">Page 712, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a></p>



<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-bold">(c) Chemical vapour deposition</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point: </span>In chemical vapour deposition methods, a vapour of molecules chemically interact or decompose at or near the substrate, where they adsorb on the surface and combine with other species to create a solid and residual gaseous products.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The control over complex stoichiometries, the ability to achieve monolayer-by-monolayer growth, and the attainment of high-quality films is not limited to physical vapour techniques. Chemical techniques, such as <span class="av-bold">metal-organic chemical vapour deposition</span> (MOCVD) and <span class="av-bold">atomic layer deposition</span> (ALD), also provide these levels of control. In contrast to physical methods, in which species condense directly on to a substrate and react with one another, chemical techniques require that a precursor decompose chemically on or near the substrate in order to deliver the reactant species to the growing film. Therefore, in chemical vapour methods, the decomposition thermodynamics of the selected precursors must be considered because the vapour often contains elements that must not be incorporated in the growing films. The layout of a typical chemical vapour deposition (CVD) system is shown in <a href="#fig_24.76">Fig. 24.76.</a> Such systems normally operate at moderate vacuum or even at atmospheric pressure (in the region of 0.1-100 kPa). Their growth rates can be quite high, more than 10 times that of MBE or PLD. In CVD techniques, chemical decomposition of the feed molecules proceeds upstream of a substrate surface on which the desired product will be grown. The decomposition of the gaseous reactants is activated by high temperatures, lasers, or plasmas. Large numbers of different materials have been grown using CVD methods. For Group 13/15 (III/V) semiconductors (such as GaAs), the typical sources are organometallic precursors for the Group 13 element (such as Ga(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), and hydrides or chlorides for the Group 15 element (such as AsH<sub>3</sub>). A typical reaction is</p>

</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">carried out in a hydrogen environment. For complex oxides, such as the superconducting cuprate YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, suitable precursors are required for each of the metals; the challenge is to find volatile molecules of the electropositive elements Ba and Y, which normally form ionic compounds. Metal &#x03B2;-diketonates have been found to be useful in this respect, as compounds such as the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione complex of yttrium sublime at about 150&#x00B0;C. Another approach to molecules that can be used for CVD involves incorporating into a single-molecule precursor more than one of the atom types to be deposited. This procedure has the potential advantage of improving the control of the product stoichiometry. Thus, zinc sulfide can be deposited from a variety of zinc thiocomplexes, such as Zn(S<sub>2</sub>PMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. A future goal is to make complex volatile molecules containing, for example, several different metal atoms that can be deposited simultaneously to make a complex oxide.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The CVD technique can be fine-tuned to produce very high-quality films. The drawbacks of CVD include the use of toxic chemicals, turbulent flow in the reaction chamber, and the incorporation of unwanted chemical species owing to incomplete decomposition. This technique can be used without a substrate to create nanoparticles by pyrolysis of the vapour species. Furthermore, MOCVD and MBE have been combined to allow for <span class="av-italic">in situ</span> monitoring of growth. This technique has been called <span class="av-bold">chemical beam epitaxy</span> (CBE).</p>
<p class="av-indent">A final chemical approach aims to control the precise chemical interactions that occur at a surface. In the process called <span class="av-bold">atomic layer deposition</span> (ALD), chemical species are delivered sequentially to a substrate on which a single monolayer deposits. The excess reactant is removed. Repetition of this monolayer coverage, subsequent reaction, and removal of excess reactants allows for precise control over the growth of complex materials. In this process, it is necessary to control the chemical species and their interactions to ensure monolayer-only coverage and facile subsequent reaction. To do so means that the vapour of each reagent must interact in the proper manner with the film layer deposited previously. The technique produces flat, homogeneously coated layers. Some examples of ALD-grown nanomaterials are Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, CuS, and BaTiO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point: </span>Dimensionality plays a crucial role in determining the properties of materials.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The elongated one-dimensional morphology of nanorods, nanowires, nanofibres, nano-whiskers, nanobelts, and nanotubes has been studied extensively because one-dimensional systems are the lowest-dimensional structures that can be used for efficient transport of electrons and optical excitation. There are also many applications where one-dimensional nanostructures could be exploited, including nanoelectronics, very strong and tough composites, functional nano-structured materials, and novel scanning probe microscopy tips.</p>
<p class="av-indent">A key class of nanomaterials is <span class="av-bold">carbon nanotubes</span> (CNTs). Carbon nanotubes are perhaps the best example of new nanostructures fabricated through bottom-up chemical synthesis approaches. They have a very simple chemical composition and atomic bonding configuration but exhibit remarkably diverse structures and unparalleled physical properties. These new nanomaterials have proposed applications as chemical sensors, fuel cells, field-effect transistors, electrical interconnects, and mechanical reinforcers. Carbon nano-tubes are cylindrical shells formed conceptually by rolling graphene sheets (<a href="#sec_24.28">Section 24.28</a>) into closed tubular nanostructures with diameters matching that of C<sub>60</sub> (0.5 nm) but exhibiting lengths up to micrometres. A single-walled nanotube (SWNT) is formed by rolling a sheet of graphene into a cylinder along an <span class="av-italic">(m,n)</span> lattice vector in the graphene plane (<a href="#fig_24.80">Fig. 24.80</a>). The <span class="av-italic">(m,n)</span> indices determine the diameter and chirality of the CNT, which in turn control its physical properties. Most CNTs have closed ends where hemispherical units cap the hollow tubes. Carbon nanotubes self-assemble into two distinct classes, SWNTs and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). In MWNTs, the tube wall is composed of multiple graphene sheets wrapped concentrically around each other.</p>
<p class="av-indent">CNTs may be synthesized using a variety of techniques. Laser vaporization methods typically make relatively small amounts of nanocarbons while specialized CVD techniques have been developed to synthesize CNTs in quantities in excess of a few milligrams. In the CVD approach, a hydrocarbon gas such as methane is decomposed at elevated temperatures and C atoms are condensed on to a cooled substrate that may contain various catalysts, such as Fe. This CVD method is attractive because it produces open-ended tubes (which are not produced in the other methods), allows continuous fabrication, and can easily be scaled up to large-scale production. Because the tubes are open, the method also allows for the use of the nanotube as a templating agent. In the arc-discharge method, extremely high temperatures are obtained by shorting two carbon rods together, which causes a plasma discharge. Low potential differences and moderately high currents are needed to produce this arc but these plasmas easily achieve temperatures in excess of where carbon vaporizes (at about 4500 K). The typical CNT formed by either the arc-discharge method or CVD is multiwalled. To encourage SWNT formation, it is necessary <a id="page_714" class="page">Page 714, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>to add a metal catalyst such as Co, Fe, or Ni to the carbon source. These metal catalyst particles block the end-cap of each carbon hemisphere and thus promote SWNT growth. In addition, the growth directions of the nanotubes can be controlled by van der Waals forces, applied electric fields, and patterning of the metal catalyst onto different substrates. The patterned-growth approach is feasible with discrete catalytic nanoparticles, and scalable on large wafers to achieve large arrays of nanowires (<a href="#fig_24.81">Fig. 24.81</a>).</p>

<p class="av-indent">The repeating axial hexagonal patterns of CNTs are graphitic structures; however, the electrical properties of nanotubes depend on the relative orientation of the repeating hexagons. The nanotubes can be either semiconductors or metallic conductors. When oriented in the chair configuration, CNTs exhibit remarkably high electrical conductivity. Electrons can travel through the micrometre-length nanowire with zero scattering and zero heat dissipation. CNTs also have very high thermal conductivity, comparable to the best thermal conductors known (such as their counterparts, diamond, graphite, and graphene). In common with graphene, they are being heralded as the ideal nanomaterial for the development of interconnects for integrated circuits. They may solve two key challenges in the computer industry: heat dissipation and increased processing speeds.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">24.28 <b>Two-dimensional control: graphene, quantum wells, and solid-state superlattices</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">Perhaps the most famous of two-dimensional structures is graphene: single sheets of carbon atoms forming a hexagonal net as in a single sheet of the graphite structure. While the interest in graphene centres on its highly unusual and useful physical properties rather than its chemistry, it is worthwhile considering the various routes to its preparation. Other materials which form layered structures, such as some metal sulfides (as discussed in <a href="#sec_24.9">Section 24.9</a>), can also be produced in single-sheet form less than a nanometer in width. Various of the processing methods described in <a href="#sec_24.25">Section 24.25</a> permit the deposition of films only one atomic (or one unit-cell) layer thick, and of many materials. By varying sequentially the types of atomic (or unit-cell) layers being deposited, it is possible to control the material architecture along the growth direction at a subnanometre scale, thereby allowing the bottom-up development of artificially layered nanostructures. A quantum well (QW) is a thin layer of one material sandwiched between two thick layers of another material, and is the two-dimensional equivalent of a zero-dimensional quantum dot (QD; <a href="#sec_24.30">Section 24.30</a>). In a superlattice, two (or more) materials are grown alternately with an artificially induced periodicity along the growth direction. Superlattices often have repeat periods of about 1.5&#x2013;20 nm or greater, and sublayer thicknesses that range from two unit cells to many tens of unit cells. Artificial crystal structures usually have repeat distances similar to bulk crystals (about 0.3&#x2013;2.0 nm) and have sublayer thicknesses that range from an atomic layer to two unit cells (about 1 nm). These structures have found broad commercial application as key device elements in computer-chip manufacturing, including hard-disk read heads.</p>

<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-bold">(a) Graphene and other single-layer nanomaterials</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> Single sheets of graphite, known as graphene, may be obtained by the exfoliation of bulk graphite or by chemical vapour deposition.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Graphene is a single sheet of graphite (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box14.2">Box 14.2</a>), and it can be produced by rubbing a lump of graphite; for example, drawing a line with a pencil on a hard surface will produce some graphene sheets. In 2004, physicists at the University of Manchester (UK) and the Institute for Microelectronics Technology, Chernogolovka (Russia) produced graphene from graphite by using adhesive tape. They used the sticky tape (this is sometimes referred to as the Scotch&#x00AE;-tape method) to split or exfoliate graphite into increasingly thinner sheets. Repeated application of this process eventually produces graphite particles less than 0.05 mm thick, including some single layers. The tape can be dissolved in acetone to detach the graphene sheets, which end up suspended in the solvent; they can then be deposited by sedimentation or evaporation on to a substrate such as a silicon wafer. In the original experiment, graphene sheets were then identified using optical microscopy. Similar exfoliation procedures have been scaled up, and it is now possible to buy graphene in multigram quantities. This method of producing graphene leads to material with a variety of particle shapes and sizes and is not ideal for detailed investigation and applications. Other methods of producing graphene as large orientated sheets on substrates mainly involve CVD (<a href="#sec_24.25">Section 24.25c</a>). Epitaxial growth via CVD may be undertaken on metal substrates using various carbon-containing sources, and a typical deposition uses a CH<sub>4</sub>/ H<sub>2</sub> mixture at &#x003E;1000&#x00B0;C. By using a copper foil as the substrate and very low pressures, the growth of graphene automatically stops after the formation of a single graphene layer. Following deposition on a copper foil, the graphene film can be transferred in a roll-to-roll process on to a polymer backing. In this process a polymer film is pressed on to the top of the graphene-coated copper foil and the metal is then etched away by acid. In this <a id="page_716" class="page">Page 716, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>way single-layer graphene films with dimensions over 50 cm can be produced, of potential importance for many applications in the electronics industry.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Thin films produced by the exfoliation of graphite have been known for many decades, but the discovery by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov that graphene has highly unusual but useful physical properties led to the award of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010. Graphene is an excellent electron conductor and should theoretically display a resistivity lower than that of the best simple metals such as silver. Graphene also displays a very high thermal conductivity (&#x003E;5000W m<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> K<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) at room temperature, a value better than those exhibited by carbon nanotubes (<a href="#sec_24.27">Section 24.27</a>), graphite, and diamond. This is potentially important for any future electronic applications based on graphene-containing components. As electronic devices continue to shrink and circuit density increases, low resistive heat losses and high thermal conductivities (that dissipate any heat generated efficiently) would lead to higher device reliability.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Perpendicular to the layers, graphene is one of the strongest and stiffest materials known, and it is also very lightweight; even so, it can be stretched in the direction of the layers by up to 20 per cent of its initial length. These properties mean that graphene can be added to polymers to make composites (<a href="#sec_24.29">Section 24.29</a>) which have good specific physical properties (for example, strength per unit mass). As graphene is also electrically conductive, its incorporation into polymers instills a level of conductivity, and such composite plastics do not build up static electrical charges on being rubbed; plastics of this type have uses where static discharges can be detrimental&#x2014;for example, in the packaging of circuit boards.</p>
<p class="av-indent">When a light source is viewed through graphene it absorbs 2.3 per cent of the light, which makes a single film visible to the naked eye. However, the high overall light transmission, in conjunction with the high electrical conductivity, leads to potential applications in displays, particularly flexible electronic displays and &#x2018;smart windows&#x2019;. In a smart window of this type, a layer of polar liquid-crystal molecules (<a href="#sec_24.21">Section 24.21d</a>) is sandwiched between two flexible electrodes comprised of graphene and a transparent polymer. With no voltage applied to the device the random alignment of liquid crystals scatters light and the smart window is opaque. Application of a voltage across the graphene layers will align the polar molecules, allowing some light to pass through the device, and the smart window turns transparent.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Similar to the surfaces of most metals and graphite (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.10">Section 25.10</a>), graphene can adsorb various atoms and molecules&#x2014;for example, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, K, and H<sub>2</sub>O/OH. These adsorbate species act as donors or acceptors to the graphene layer and lead to changes in the number of mobile electrons in the film. Measurement of this change in conductivity can be exploited in a sensor for the adsorbed species. Point defects can be introduced into graphene sheets in the form of carbon vacancies, substituted sites (for example, replacing carbon by nitrogen), or atoms added onto its surface. This may lead to applications in spintronics (<a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6g</a>) based on &#x2018;magnetic graphene&#x2019;. Finally, graphite has important applications as a battery material (<a href="#fig_24.31">Fig. 24.31</a>) and graphene, with its very high surface area, may show enhanced properties for these applications.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Since the discovery that graphite could be exfoliated into, and deposited as, single sheets, chemists have returned to the study of other compounds with layered structures, with a view to investigating their properties when produced in this form.

<p class="av-noindentt">A quantum well is typically composed of two semiconductor materials with different band gaps, such as Al<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>As and GaAs. The smaller-band-gap material (GaAs) is sandwiched between layers of the larger-band-gap material (Al<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>As), and the thickness of the layer of the small-band-gap material is confined to the nanometre scale (<a href="#fig_24.83">Fig. 24.83</a>). The optical properties of quantum wells can be tailored and both interband (between the valence and conduction band) and intraband (between the quantized sub-bands that are present because of the nanoscale thickness of the material) absorption and emission can be controlled. Both In<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>As/GaAs and Al<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>As/GaAs quantum wells have been widely <a id="page_717" class="page">Page 717, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>studied, and the optical transition has been observed to move to higher energies compared to the bulk when the thickness drops to about 20 nm. The main use of quantum wells is in semiconductor lasers, where the small-band-gap quantum well is the active layer in the device.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Many of the effects that occur in quantum wells can be enhanced by using <span class="av-bold">superlattice structures</span>, the periodic repetition of quantum wells along one direction. In the context of semiconductors these superlattices are called <span class="av-bold">multiple quantum well</span> (MQW) structures. If the active layers (the small-band-gap layers) do not interact, then the electrons are confined to a given layer and are unable to tunnel between them. The use of MQW structures in this case increases the absorption or emission from a given device, as there are multiple levels. For example, an MQW laser has much higher power output than the corresponding single-quantum-well laser.</p>
<p class="av-indent">If the large-band-gap layers are thin enough, one QW interacts with the adjacent QW and electrons can tunnel between them. This phenomenon is used in <span class="av-bold">quantum cascade</span> (QC) lasers, which operate at high powers in the IR region. The laser characteristics of these materials are fundamentally different from those of semiconductor diodes and MQW lasers in a variety of ways. In a QC laser, only one type of carrier (electrons) is necessary to achieve laser action; in the other two, both electrons and holes are required. In addition, in the QC laser the transitions are intraband transitions that arise from the quantization of the valence band. QC lasers are constructed from 13/15 (III/V) semiconducting materials such as GaAs, InAs, and AlAs. All these superlattice systems have been grown by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy on single-crystal substrates.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Perovskite oxides (<a href="#sec_24.6">Section
24.6</a>) are used in numerous applications on account of their ferroelectric, acoustic, microwave, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. The most widely used perovskite is BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, which is a very important dielectric material. It has been discovered that layering ferroelectric BaTiO<sub>3</sub> with the isostructural perovskite SrTiO<sub>3</sub> can lead to enhanced dielectric properties arising from lattice strain. The techniques of PLD, MBE, and CVD have all been used to create SrTiO<sub>3</sub>/BaTiO<sub>3</sub> superlattice thin films (<a href="#fig_24.87">Fig. 24.87</a>). Although the misfit between the two crystal structures is small enough to allow for epitaxial growth and the formation of coherent interfaces between each bilayer, the stress introduced at the interface is sufficient to improve the dielectric response, specifically the remanent polarization (the polarization in the absence of an applied field) of the superlat-tices, compared to undoped BaTiO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Perovskite-based structures can also exhibit interesting magnetic effects. In particular, manganese-based perovskite films such as (La,Sr)MnO<sub>3</sub> possess useful ferromagnetic and magnetoresistive properties (<a href="#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). The PLD procedure has been used to deposit superlattices of LaMnO<sub>3</sub>/SrMnO<sub>3</sub>; the Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> cations are found in the LaMnO<sub>3</sub> layers and the Mn<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> are found in the SrMnO<sub>3</sub> layers.

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Mesoporous materials have ordered pore structures that are defined over the nanoscale; the synthesis of these materials relies upon control of self-assembly; guest species can be incorporated into the inorganic host framework.</b></p>

<p class="av-noindentt">An important class of three-dimensionally ordered nanomaterials is <b>mesostructured nanomaterials</b>, which includes <b>mesoporous</b> materials. Mesoporous materials are well known in heterogeneous catalysis (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>) and are of great interest because of the ability to tune the pores present in their structures from 1.5 to 10 nm (<a href="#fig_24.89">Fig. 24.89</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Mesoporous inorganic nanomaterials are synthesized in a multistep process based on the initial self-assembly of surfactant molecules and block copolymers that self-organize into supramolecular structures (which are liquid crystalline assemblies of cylindrical, spherical, or lamellar micelles; <a href="#fig_24.90">Fig. 24.90</a>). These supramolecular frameworks serve as structure-directing templates for the growth of mesostructured inorganic materials (often silica or titania). During a solvothermal reaction step, oxide particles (silica, <a href="#fig_24.91">Fig. 24.91</a>) form at the surfaces of the hexagonal rods, assembling around the supra-molecular structures. The templating agent can be removed through an acid wash or by calcination to yield inorganic materials having hexagonal pores with uniform and controllable dimensions. This porosity offers unique capabilities for both catalysis and inclusion chemistry.</p>
<p class="av-indent">A wide range of mesostructured and mesoporous inorganic materials have been obtained by varying the choice of templating agent and reaction conditions (<a href="#fig_24.91">Fig. 24.91</a>). For instance, the family known as M41S has silica or alumina-silica inorganic phases and various cationic surfactants, leading to three distinct types of structures: hexagonal lamellar (MCM-50), cubic (MCM-48), and hexagonal (MCM-41) (<a href="#fig_24.91">Fig. 24.91</a>). The shape of the surfactant and the water content used during synthesis control the resulting nanoarchitec-ture, as can be seen from the figure. Surfactants can also be used to tailor the structure; for example, surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium cations (C<sub>16</sub>TMAC) have been used to fabricate silica nanofibres with hexagonal pores.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Mesoporous nanomaterials also offer routes to functionalize pores to increase catalytic activity and selectivity. They have received much attention as host materials for the inclusion of guests such as organometallic complexes, polymers, d-metal complexes, macromolecules, and optical laser dyes. The silica nanofibres shown in <a href="#fig_24.92">Fig. 24.92</a> can even be used as hosts to grow nanowires of various other oxide materials.</p>

(a) ZSM-5 is a microporous zeolite with pore sizes of approximately 0.5 nm. It has three-dimensional intersecting pores similar to the cubic mesoporous phases but with smaller dimensions. MCM-41 is a mesoporous solid with hexagonal, one-dimensional pores with tunable dimensions of 2 nm up to 10 nm. (b) The choice of surfactant must match the pore size of the solid. The longer-chain surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium cation) is a better choice for the self-assembly of the MCM-41 material owing to its longer hydrocarbon tails and larger spontaneous curvature. This increased tail size encourages larger pore dimensions that are a direct consequence of the packing of the surfactants within the micellar rods that lead to the hexagonal mesophase.</p>

Hybrid nanomaterials offer the materials chemist new routes that use rational materials design to optimize structure-property relationships. Their nanoarchitectures and resulting properties depend on the chemical nature of the components and the synergy between them, producing, for example, enhanced strength and robustness. A key part of the design of these hybrids is the selective tuning of the nature, extent, and accessibility of the interfaces between the inorganic and organic building blocks.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Nanocomposites have already entered the marketplace in sunscreens, fire-retardant fabrics, stain-resistant clothing, thermoplastics, water filters, and automobile parts. Examples include the use of nylon-6/montmorillonite clay nanocomposites for timing-belt covers, television screens that are coated with indigo dyes embedded in a silica/zirconia matrix, organically doped sol-gel glassware, and sol-gel-entrapped enzymes.</p>
<p class="av-indent"><b>Polymer nanocomposites</b> (PNCs) are composed of inorganic nanoparticles dispersed in a polymeric matrix. Early commercial PNCs used two-dimensional ordered or lamellar clays, such as sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT), dispersed in the polymer matrix. Such dispersants (or fillers) have sandwich-type structures (with channels between layers), a total thickness of 0.3&#x2013;1 nm, and a length of 50&#x2013;100 nm for each layer; these sandwich structures typically form micrometre-sized agglomerates. The dispersion of the inorganic phase within the organic polymeric matrix in a PNC is accomplished by intercalation (inserting the polymer between the layered sheets of the clay). Intercalation involves the expansion of the interlamellar spacing as a consequence of ion exchange, using organic amines or quaternary ammonium salts. Exfoliation is achieved through reactive chemical compounding or by intensive melt mixing of the clay and polymer phases.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The nature of the filler (dispersant) and any cavities (voids) present in a PNC greatly influences the mechanical properties of the composites because these can control the distribution of stress through the composite matrix. Both the yield strength (a measure of the material's ability to resist permanent deformation) and toughness (a measure of the energy absorbed prior to fracture) of nanocomposites are controlled by the nanoparticle size and <a id="page_721" class="page">Page 721, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nano materials</a>dispersion, and nanoparticle-to-polymer contact interactions. Therefore, control of the nanoparticle dispersion and alignment of these fillers offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.</p>

<p class="av-indent">One important class of PNCs uses nanocarbons as the dispersants. SWNTs have exceptional mechanical properties; their very high Young&#x2019;s modulus (resistance to mechanical stress), low densities, and high length-to-width ratios make them very attractive as fillers to enhance polymer strength. SWNTs have high tensile strength&#x2014;almost 100 times that of steel&#x2014;whereas their density is only about one-sixth that of steel. SWNT-reinforced composites have been developed by the physical mixing of SWNTs in solutions of preformed polymers, <i>in situ</i> polymerization in the presence of SWNTs, surfactant-assisted processing of SWNT/polymer composites, and chemical modification of the incorporated SWNTs. Melt processing can be carried out easily by compression moulding at high temperatures and pressures, followed by rapid quenching. So-called <b>electrospinning methods</b> use electrostatic forces to distort a droplet of polymer solution into a fine filament, which is then deposited on a substrate (<a href="#fig_24.93">Fig. 24.93</a>). The nanofibres created from electrospinning can be configured into a variety of forms including membranes, coatings, and films, and can be deposited on targets of different shapes. Fibres can be prepared with diameters smaller than 3 nm, with high surface-to-volume and length-to-diameter ratios, and with controlled pore sizes. Electrospun polymer nanocomposites have been made with homogeneously dispersed SWNTs and have exhibited significantly improved mechanical strength.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Different organofunctional groups, covalently attached to the nanotubes through oxidation reactions, have been used to improve their chemical compatibility with specific polymers (<a href="#fig_24.94">Fig. 24.94</a>). The use of SWNTs with different functionalities allows the study of interfacial interactions between the filler and the polymer matrix. This chemical function-alization is an effective approach to improving the processability of the nanocomposite and the chemical compatibility of the components. Specific functionalization can be used to separate the SWNT bundles and prevent their agglomeration.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Metal-oxide fillers have also been used to optimize polymer strengths and thermal properties. A particularly interesting example involves control over the mechanical properties of alumina/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanocomposites by engineering the distribution of weak particle-to-polymer interactions. The filler nanoparticles (alumina) are dispersed in the composite matrix in the form of &#x2018;net-like&#x2019; structures as opposed to &#x2018;isolated-island&#x2019; structures formed when microparticles are dispersed in the polymer matrix. In contrast to microparticle/polymer composites, these net-like structures inhibit crazing, the propagation of microscopic cracks during tensional loading. Alumina/ PMMA composites also display higher yield strengths and a shift from brittle to ductile behaviour when nanoparticulate alumina is used (<a href="#fig_24.95">Fig. 24.95</a>). Ductility is advantageous as the composite can then be drawn into thin wires and can withstand sudden impact, making the composite more mechanically resilient. The addition of nano-alumina with the anti-agglomerant methacrylic acid lowers the glass transition temperature enough to change the stress-strain curve of the composite and shift from brittle to ductile under tensile loading.</p>

<p class="av-h3">24.30 <b><span class="av-blue">Special optical properties of nanomaterials</span></b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Confinement effects lead to some of the most fundamental manifestations of nanoscale phenomena in materials and are frequently used as a point of departure for the study of nanoscience. Novel optical properties appear in nanoparticles as a result of such effects and are being exploited for information, biological sensing, and energy technologies.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><span class="av-blue">(a) Semiconducting nanoparticles</span></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> The colour of quantum dots is dictated by quantum confinement phenomena and particle localization; quantization of the HOMO-LUMO bands leads to new optical effects involving interband and intraband transitions.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Semiconducting nanoparticles have been investigated intensively for their optical properties. These particles are often called <b>quantum dots</b> (QD) because quantum effects become important in these three-dimensionally confined particles (dots). Two important effects occur in semiconductors when electrons are confined to tiny regions. First, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap increases from the value observed in bulk crystals; second, the energy <a id="page_722" class="page">Page 722, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a>levels of electrons in the LUMOs (and holes&#x2014;the absence of electrons&#x2014;in the HOMOs) become quantized. Both effects play an important role in determining the optical properties of QDs.</p>

</div>
<p class="av-boxpara">Cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals have found application in a wide variety of commercial venues including LEDs, solar cells, fluorescent dis-plays, and <span class="av-italic">in vivo</span> cellular imaging of cancer cells. Their high photolumines-cence efficiencies and emission colour tunability based on nanocrystal size make them attractive for full-colour displays. Close-packed QD monolayers have been self-assembled using soft nanolithography contact printing to achieve light-emitting devices (<a href="#fig_b24.4">Fig. B24.4</a>). In soft nanolithography, pho- tolithography or electron-beam lithography is used to produce a pattern in a layer of photoresist on the surface of a silicon wafer. A chemical precursor to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a free-flowing liquid, is then poured over the patterned surface and cured into a rubbery solid. After curing, a PDMS stamp that matches the original pattern reproduces features from the master as small as a few nanometres. Whereas making a master is expensive, copying the pattern on PDMS stamps is inexpensive and easy.One stamp can be used in various inexpensive ways, including microcontact printing and micromoulding to make nanostructures. These techniques can be employed to produce subwavelength optical devices (in which the dimensions of the device element are shorter than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation used), waveguides, and optical polarizers used in optical-fibre networks&#x2014;and eventually perhaps in all-optical computers.</p>

<p class="av-indent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Quantum confinement</b>, the trapping of electrons and holes in tiny regions, provides a method of tailoring or engineering the band gap of materials. The crucial feature is that as the critical dimension of a material decreases, the band gap increases. Transitions of electrons between states in the valence band (the so-called HOMO states) and the conduction band (the LUMO states) are called <b>interband transitions</b>, and the minimum energy for these transitions is increased in QDs relative to those in bulk semiconductors. The wavelengths of interband transitions depend on the size of the dots, and it is possible to tailor their luminescence simply by changing their size. A key example of these QD materials is CdSe. By varying the size of the CdSe nanoparticle it is possible to tune emission over the entire visible spectrum, making them ideal for LED and fluorescent display technologies (Box 24.6). Another exciting use of QDs is as chromophores for &#x2018;biotags&#x2019;, in which dots of different sizes are functionalized to detect different biological analytes. It turns out that, <a id="page_723" class="page">Page 723, Chapter 24: materials chemistry and nano materials</a>although they emit at specific tuneable wavelengths, QDs exhibit broadband absorption for energies above the band gap. The intriguing point for bioapplications is that it is possible to excite an array of distinct QD chromophores with a single broadband excitation and to simultaneously detect multiple analytes by their distinct optical emissions. These materials have been used to image breast-cancer cells and live nerve cells to track small-molecule transport to specific organelles.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The second manifestation of quantum confinement is
that the available quantized energy levels inside a QD have no net
linear momentum and therefore transitions between them do not require any momentum transfer. As a result, the transition probabilities between any two states are high. This lack of momentum dependence also explains the broadband absorption nature of QDs because probabilities are high for most transitions from the occupied valence-band states to unoccupied conduction-band states. Probabilities are also high for <b>intraband transitions</b>, transitions of electrons between states in the LUMO band or of holes in the HOMO band. These relatively intense intraband transitions are typically in the infrared region of the spectrum and are currently being exploited to make devices such as infrared photodetectors, sensors, and lasers.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(b) Metallic nanoparticles</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The colours of metallic nanoparticles dispersed in a dielectric medium are dominated by localized surface plasmon absorption, the collective oscillation of electrons at the metal-dielectric interface.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles
arise from a complex electrodynamic effect that is strongly
influenced by the surrounding dielectric medium. Light impinging on metallic particles causes optical excitation of their electrons. The principal type of optical excitation that occurs is the collective oscillation of electrons in the valence band of the metal. Such coherent oscillations occur at the interface of a metal with a dielectric medium and are called <b>surface plasmons.</b></p>
<p class="av-indent">In bulk particles, the surface plasmons are travelling waves and are characterized by a linear momentum. To excite plasmons using photons in bulk metals, the momenta of the plasmon and the photon must match. This matching is possible only for very specific geometries of the interaction between light and matter, and is a weak contributor to the optical properties of the metal. In nanoparticles, however, the surface plasmons are localized and have no characteristic momentum. As a result, the momenta of the plasmon and the photon do not need to match, and plasmon excitation occurs with a greater intensity. The peak intensity of the surface plasmon absorption for gold and silver occurs in the optical region of the spectrum, and so these metallic nanoparticles are useful as pigments.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The characteristics of plasmon absorption depend
strongly on the metal and the dielectric surroundings as well as
on the size and shape of the nanoparticle. To control the dielectric surroundings, so-called <b>core-shell composite nanoparticles</b> have been designed in which metallic shells of nanometre-scale thickness encapsulate a dielectric nanoparticle. Metallic nanoparticles and metallic nanoshells are used as dielectric sensors because their optical properties change when they come into contact with different dielectric materials. In particular, biological sensing is of interest because biological analytes can bind to the surface of the nanoparticle, causing a detectable shift in the plasmon absorption band.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Gold nanoparticles are common examples of metallic nanoparticles and have found practical applications as biological and chemical sensors, &#x2018;smart bombs&#x2019; for cancer therapy, and optical switching and fluorescent display materials. Many of these applications are possible owing to the development of techniques to bind photoresponsive chromo-phores to the surface of the nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles can be tagged with biomol-ecules that afford delivery to specific cells, and have found applications as immunoprobes for early detection of disease. Nanomaterials have also been used as key electron-transfer <a id="page_724" class="page">Page 724, Chapter 24: Materials chemistry and nanomaterials</a>agents in a new generation of solar materials that couples photoresponsive π-conjugated,
polyaromatic molecules to gold nanoparticle surfaces. Chromophore-functionalized gold
nanoparticles afford unique device architectures and fl exibility in design as these hybrid
materials can be coupled covalently to conductive glass substrates that serve as electrodes,
so leading to improved charge transport and photoeffi ciencies.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Silver nanoplates with sizes in the range 40&#x2013;300 nm have been synthesized by a simple
room-temperature solution-phase chemical reduction method in the presence of dilute
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, (C<sub>16</sub> H<sub>33</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NBr). These plates are single crystals having as their basal plane the (111) plane of face-centred cubic silver. The
stronger adsorption of CTAB on the (111) basal plane than on the (100) side plane of
these plates may account for the anisotropic growth of nanoplates. As discussed earlier in
this section, metal nanoparticles have interesting optical properties related to their surface
plasmon excitations. The optical (in-plane dipole) plasmon resonance peaks can be shifted
to wavelengths of 1000 nm in the near-IR when the aspect ratio (the ratio of long axis to
short axis, or width to thickness) of the nanoplates reaches 9. Such control over the optical
properties of simple metals opens up new possibilities for various near-IR applications,
including remote sensing.</p>
