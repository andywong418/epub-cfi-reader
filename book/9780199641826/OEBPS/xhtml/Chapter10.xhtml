<p class="noindentd"><b>Hydrogen has a very rich chemistry despite its simple atomic structure. In this chapter we discuss reactions of hydrogen species that are particularly interesting in terms of fundamental chemistry as well as important applications, including energy. We describe how H<sub>2</sub> is produced in the laboratory, on an industrial scale from fossil fuels and, looking to the future, by making increasing use of renewable resources. We explain how hydrogen bonding stabilizes the structures of H<sub>2</sub>O and DNA. We summarize the synthesis and properties of binary compounds that range from volatile molecular compounds to salt-like and metallic solids. We shall see that many of the properties of these compounds are understandable in terms of their ability to supply H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions, and that it is possible to anticipate which one is likely to dominate. We consider how the H<sub>2</sub> molecule is activated by binding to catalysts, the processes that can produce H<sub>2</sub> from water using solar energy, and the efforts being made to make it a more convenient fuel for vehicles.</b></p>

<h3 class="h3d">PART A: <b>THE ESSENTIALS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and the tenth most abundant by mass on Earth, where it is found in the oceans, minerals, and in all forms of life. The partial depletion of elemental hydrogen from Earth reflects its volatility during formation of the planet. The stable form of elemental hydrogen under normal conditions is <i>dihydrogen</i>, H<sub>2</sub>, which occurs at trace levels in the Earth&#x2019;s lower atmosphere (0.5&#x2009;ppm) and is essentially the only component of the extremely thin outer atmosphere. Dihydrogen has many uses (<a href="#fig_10.1">Fig. 10.1</a>). It is produced naturally, as a product of fermentation and as a by-product of ammonia biosynthesis (<a href="#box_10.1">Box 10.1</a>). It is often cited as the &#x2018;fuel of the future&#x2019; on account of its availability from fully renewable resources (water and sunlight) and its clean and highly exothermic reaction with O<sub>2</sub>. The volatility and low energy density of H<sub>2</sub> pose challenges for its direct use as a fuel for vehicles, but it can be used to produce energy-dense hydrocarbon fuels and is an essential raw material for the industrial production of ammonia.</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">Hydrogen is cycled by microbial organisms using metalloenzymes (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.14">Section 26.14</a>). Although H<sub>2</sub> is present only to the extent of about 0.5&#x2009;ppm at the Earth&#x2019;s surface, its levels are hundreds of times higher in anaerobic environments, such as wetland soils and sediments at the bottoms of deep lakes and hot springs. Hydrogen is produced in these O<sub>2</sub>-free zones as a waste product by strict anaerobes (fermentative bacteria) which break down organic material (biomass) by using H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> as an oxidant acting as a terminal electron acceptor. It is also produced by thermophilic organisms that derive their carbon and energy entirely from CO, and by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which yield H<sub>2</sub> as a by-product of ammonia. Some microorganisms, many of them aerobic, use H<sub>2</sub> instead as a &#x2018;food&#x2019; (a fuel) and are responsible for the formation of the familiar gases CH<sub>4</sub> (by methanogens) and H<sub>2</sub>S (by <i>Desulfovibrio</i>) as well as nitrite and other products. <a href="#fig_B10.1">Figure B10.1</a> summarizes some of the overall processes occurring in a freshwater environment.</p>
<p class="boxparai">In animals, including humans, the anaerobic environment of the large intestine is host to bacteria that form H<sub>2</sub> by the breakdown of carbohydrates. The mucus layer of the mouse intestine has been found to contain H<sub>2</sub> at levels above 0.04&#x2009;mmol&#x2009;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, equivalent to a partial atmosphere of 5 per cent H<sub>2</sub>. In turn, this H<sub>2</sub> is utilized by methanogens, such as those found in ruminating mammals, to produce CH<sub>4</sub> and by other bacteria, including dangerous pathogens such as those of the <i>Salmonella</i> genus and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> which is responsible for gastric ulcers. High levels of H<sub>2</sub> in the breath have been used to diagnose conditions related to carbohydrate intolerance, and these levels may reach &#x003E;70&#x2009;ppm following lactose ingestion by lactose-intolerant patients.</p>

<p class="boxparai">Industrial production of H<sub>2</sub> by microorganisms (<i>biohydrogen</i>) is an important area for research and development. There are two different approaches, each of which uses renewable energy. The first of these approaches is to use anaerobic organisms to ferment biomass from sources ranging from cultivated biomass (including seaweed) to domestic waste. The second involves manipulation of photosynthetic organisms such as green algae and cyanobacteria to produce H<sub>2</sub> as well as biomass. In either case H<sub>2</sub> can be extracted continuously by gas filters without the interruptions that would be required were harvesting required.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>10.1 The element</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The hydrogen atom, with ground-state configuration 1s<sup>1</sup>, has only one electron so it might be thought that the element&#x2019;s chemical properties will be limited, but this is far from the case. Hydrogen has richly varied chemical properties and forms compounds with nearly every other element. It ranges in character from being a strong Lewis base (the hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) to being a strong Lewis acid (as the hydrogen cation, H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, the proton; <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.1">Section 4.1</a>). Under certain circumstances H atoms can form bonds to more than one other atom simultaneously. The &#x2018;hydrogen bond&#x2019; formed when an H atom bridges two electronegative atoms is fundamental to life: it is because of hydrogen bonding that water occurs as a liquid rather than a gas, and proteins and nucleic acids fold into the complex, highly organized three-dimensional structures that determine their functions.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) The atom and its ions</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The proton, H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, is always found in combination with a Lewis base and is highly polarizing; the hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, is highly polarizable</b>.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are three isotopes of hydrogen: hydrogen itself (<sup>1</sup>H), deuterium (D, <sup>2</sup>H), and tritium (T, <sup>3</sup>H); tritium is radioactive. The lightest isotope, <sup>1</sup>H (very occasionally called protium), is by far the most abundant. Deuterium has variable natural abundance with an average value of about 16 atoms in 100 000. Tritium occurs to the extent of only 1 in 10<sup>21</sup>. The different names and symbols for the three isotopes reflect the significant differences in their masses and the chemical properties that stem from mass, such as the rates of diffusion and bond-cleavage reactions. The nuclear spin of <sup>1</sup>H (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math>) is exploited in NMR spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>) for identifying hydrogen-containing molecules and determining their structures.</p>
<p class="indent">The free hydrogen cation (H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, the proton) has a very high charge-to-radius ratio and it is not surprising to find that it is a very strong Lewis acid. In the gas phase it readily attaches to other molecules and atoms; it even attaches to He to form HeH<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. In the condensed phase, H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is always found in combination with a Lewis base, and its ability to transfer between Lewis bases gives it the special role in chemistry explored in detail in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> The molecular cations <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> have only a transitory existence in the gas phase and are unknown in solution. In contrast to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which is highly polarizing, the hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, is highly polarizable because two electrons are bound by just one proton. The radius <a id="page_298" class="page">Page 298, Hydrogen</a>of H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> varies considerably depending on the atom to which it is attached. The lack of core electrons to scatter X-rays means that bond distances and angles involving an H atom in a compound are difficult to measure by X-ray diffraction: for this reason, neutron diffraction is used when it is crucial to determine the precise positions of H atoms.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Properties and reactions</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Hydrogen has unique atomic properties that place it in a unique position in the periodic table. Dihydrogen is quite an inert molecule and its reactions require a catalyst or initiation by radicals</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Hydrogen&#x2019;s unique properties distinguish it from all other elements in the periodic table. It is often placed at the head of Group 1 because like the alkali metals it has only one electron in its valence shell. That position, however, does not truly reflect the chemical or physical properties of the element. In particular, its ionization energy is far higher than the other Group 1 elements, so hydrogen is not a metal, although it is predicted to exist naturally in a metallic state where extreme pressures exist, such as the core of Jupiter. In some versions of the periodic table hydrogen is placed at the head of Group 17 because, like the halogens, it requires only one electron to complete its valence shell. But the electron affinity of hydrogen is far lower than any of the elements of Group 17 and the discrete hydride ion, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, is encountered only in certain compounds. To reflect its unique characteristics, we place H in its own special position at the head of the entire table.</p>
<p class="indent">Because H<sub>2</sub> has so few electrons, the intermolecular forces between H<sub>2</sub> molecules are weak, and at 1 atm the gas condenses to a liquid only when cooled to 20&#x2009;K. If an electric discharge is passed through H<sub>2</sub> gas at low pressure, the molecules dissociate, ionize, and recombine, forming a plasma containing, in addition to H<sub>2</sub>, spectroscopically observable amounts of H, H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math></p>
<p class="indent">The H<sub>2</sub> molecule has a high bond enthalpy (436&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and a short bond length (74 pm). The high bond strength results in H<sub>2</sub> being quite an inert molecule, and reactions of H<sub>2</sub> do not occur readily unless a special activation pathway has been provided. In the gas phase it is much more difficult to dissociate H<sub>2</sub> heterolytically than homolytically,<sup><a id="ich10fn1"></a><a href="#ch10fn1">1</a></sup> because the former incurs a large additional energy cost to separate the opposite charges. Heterolytic cleavage is therefore assisted by reagents that form strong bonds to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page298-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Both homolytic and heterolytic dissociation are catalysed by molecules or active surfaces. In the gas phase, the explosive reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub>,</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12em;">
 <img src="../images/page298-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">proceeds by a complex radical chain mechanism. Hydrogen is an excellent fuel for large rockets on account of its high specific enthalpy (the standard enthalpy of combustion divided by the mass), which is approximately three times that of a typical hydrocarbon (<a href="#box_10.2">Box 10.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to reactions that result in dissociation of the H&#x2013;H bond, H<sub>2</sub> can also react reversibly without cleavage to form dihydrogen d-metal complexes (<a href="#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>d and <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>).</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_10.2">
<h3 class="h3"><b>10.2 Simple compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The nature of the bonding in binary compounds of hydrogen, i.e. with other elements E (EH<sub><i>n</i></sub>), is largely rationalized by noting that an H atom has a high ionization energy (1310&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and a low but positive electron affinity (77&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Although binary hydrogen compounds are often known as &#x2018;hydrides&#x2019; (we will use this term throughout this chapter), very few actually contain a discrete H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anion. The (Pauling) electronegativity of 2.2 (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.15">Section 2.15</a>) is intermediate in value, so it is normally assigned the oxidation number &#x2013;1 when in combination with metals (as in NaH and AlH<sub>3</sub>) and &#x002B;1 when in combination with nonmetals (as in H<sub>2</sub>O and HCl).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch10fn1"></a><a href="#ich10fn1">1</a></sup>In homolytic dissociation the bond breaks symmetrically to give one product. In heterolytic dissociation the bond breaks unsymmetrically to give two different products.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The use of H<sub>2</sub> as a fuel (an energy carrier) has been investigated seriously since the 1970s, when oil prices first rose dramatically; interest has increased greatly in more recent times owing to environmental pressures on further use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen is clean burning, nontoxic, and its production from fully renewable resources is slowly but inevitably replacing its production from fossil carbon feedstocks. <a href="#tabB10.1">Table B10.1</a> compares the performance data for H<sub>2</sub> and other energy carriers including hydrocarbon fuels and the lithium-ion battery. Among all fuels, H<sub>2</sub> has the highest specific enthalpy (its standard enthalpy of combustion divided by its mass) and this makes it a good fuel for aerospace applications such as rockets. However, H<sub>2</sub> has a very low energy density (its standard enthalpy of combustion divided by its volume) and it falls far below hydrocarbon fuels in this respect.</p>

<p class="boxparai">It is obvious that H<sub>2</sub> is an excellent fuel for vehicles provided the problems of on-board containment are solved (see Boxes 10.4, 12.3 and <a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.13">Section 24.13</a>). In addition to its choice as a rocket fuel, H<sub>2</sub> can be used in conventional internal combustion engines with little, if any, modification to their design or specifications. However, the most important way of utilizing H<sub>2</sub> in a vehicle is to react it in a fuel cell to produce electricity directly (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>). The efficient and reliable power output of H<sub>2</sub> fuel cells (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#box_5.1">Box 5.1</a>) makes it viable to produce H<sub>2</sub> &#x2018;on board&#x2019; by steam reforming of methanol, a transportable and energy-dense fuel. (Direct methanol fuel cells, discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#box_5.1">Box 5.1</a>, produce less power than H<sub>2</sub> fuel cells and are therefore less attractive for vehicles.) An <i>automotive steam reformer</i> (<a href="#fig_B10.2">Fig. B10.2</a>) mixes methanol vapour with H<sub>2</sub>O (steam) and with O<sub>2</sub> (air) to produce H<sub>2</sub> by the following reactions:</p>

<p class="noindent">The standard Gibbs energies of formation of the hydrogen compounds of s- and p-block&#x00A0;elements reveal a regular variation in stability (<a href="#tab10.1">Table 10.1</a>). With the possible exception&#x00A0;of BeH<sub>2</sub> (for which good data are not available), all the s-block hydrides are exergonic (<img src="../images/page300-2.jpg" alt="images"/>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;0) and therefore thermodynamically stable with respect to their elements at room&#x00A0;temperature. No hydride of Group 13 is exergonic at room temperature. In all the other groups of the p block, the simple hydrogen&#x00A0;compounds of the first members of the groups (CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and HF) are exergonic but the analogous compounds of their congeners become progressively less stable&#x00A0;down the group, a trend that is illustrated by decreasing E&#x2013;H bond energies (Fig.&#x00A0;10.3). The heavier&#x00A0;hydrides become more stable on going from Group 14 across&#x00A0;to&#x00A0;the halogens. For example, SnH<sub>4</sub> is highly endergonic (<img src="../images/page300-2.jpg" alt="images"/>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;0) whereas HI is barely so.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">These thermodynamic trends can be traced to the variation in atomic properties. The H&#x2013;H bond is the strongest single homonuclear bond known (apart from D&#x2013;D or T&#x2013;T bonds) and in order for a compound to be exergonic and stable with respect to its elements, it needs to have E&#x2013;H bonds that are even stronger than H&#x2013;H. For molecular hydrides of the p-block elements, bonding is strongest with the Period 2 elements and becomes progressively weaker down each group. The weak bonds formed by the heavier p-block elements are due to the poor overlap between the relatively compact H1s orbital and the more diffuse s and p orbitals of their atoms. Although d-block elements do not form binary molecular compounds, many complexes contain one or more hydride ligands. Metal&#x2013;hydrogen bond strengths in the d block increase down a group because the 3d orbitals are too contracted to overlap well with the H1s orbital and better overlap is afforded by 4d and 5d orbitals.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(c) Reactions of binary compounds</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The reactions of binary compounds of hydrogen fall into three classes depending on the polarity of the E&#x2013;H bond</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In compounds where E and H have similar electronegativities, cleavage of the E&#x2013;H bond tends to be homolytic, producing, initially, an H atom and a radical, each of which can go on to combine with other available radicals:</p>

 <img src="../images/page301-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Common examples of homonuclear cleavage include the thermolysis and combustion of

</figure>
<p class="noindent">The compound behaves as a Br&#x00F8;nsted acid and is able to transfer H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to a base. In such compounds the H atom is termed <b>protonic</b>. Heterolytic bond cleavage also occurs in compounds where E is less electronegative than H, including saline hydrides:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-16.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page301-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In this case the H atom is <b>hydridic</b> and an H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion is transferred to a Lewis acid, such as a boron-containing reagent (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.6">Section 4.6</a>). The reducing agents NaBH<sub>4</sub> and LiAlH<sub>4</sub> used in organic synthesis are examples of hydride-transfer reagents. By analogy with Br&#x00F8;nsted acidity, which measures the ability of a species to donate a proton, a <b>hydridicity</b> scale (<a href="#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>d) can be compiled that compares the abilities of species to donate a hydride. The scale may be based on calculations performed for species in the gas phase or experimental data for hydride transfer equilibria in a suitable solvent. Through its ability to exist in both protonic (H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and hydridic (H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) states, a bound hydrogen atom can act as a two-electron redox agent.</p>

We explain how dihydrogen is prepared on a small scale in the laboratory and how it is produced industrially from fossil fuels; then we outline methods for its production from water by using renewable energy.

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The three hydrogen isotopes H, D, and T have large differences in their atomic masses and different nuclear spins, which give rise to easily observed changes in IR, Raman, and NMR spectra of molecules containing these isotopes</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Neither <sup>1</sup>H nor <sup>2</sup>H (deuterium, D) is radioactive, but <sup>3</sup>H (tritium, T) decays by the loss of a &#x03B2; particle to yield a rare, but stable, isotope of helium:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-20em;">
 <img src="../images/page302-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The half-life for this decay is 12.4 years. Tritium&#x2019;s abundance of 1 in 10<sup>21</sup> hydrogen atoms in surface water reflects a steady state between its production by bombardment of cosmic rays on the upper atmosphere and its loss by radioactive decay. Tritium can be synthesized by neutron bombardment of <sup>6</sup>Li or <sup>7</sup>Li:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-15.3em;">
 <img src="../images/page302-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindente">Continuous production of tritium from lithium is a key step in the projected future generation of energy from nuclear fusion rather than nuclear fission. In a fusion reactor, tritium and deuterium are heated to over 100 MK to give a plasma in which the nuclei react to produce <sup>4</sup>He and a neutron:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12em;">
 <img src="../images/page302-3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="noindente">The neutron is used to bombard a lithium blanket that has been enriched in <sup>6</sup>Li to generate further tritium. This process carries far fewer environmental risks than fission of <sup>235</sup>U and is essentially renewable: of the two primary fuels required, deuterium is readily available from water and lithium is also widely distributed (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The physical and chemical properties of <b>isotopologues</b>, isotopically substituted molecules, are usually very similar, but not when D is substituted for H, as the mass of the substituted atom is doubled. <a href="#tab10.2">Table 10.2</a> shows that the differences in boiling points and bond enthalpies are easily measurable for H<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>. The difference in boiling point between H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O reflects the greater strength of the O&#x2026;D&#x0064;O hydrogen bond compared with that of the O&#x2026;H&#x0064;O bond, because the zero-point energy of the former is lower. The compound D<sub>2</sub>O is known as &#x2018;heavy water&#x2019; and is used as a moderator in the nuclear power industry; it slows down emitted neutrons and increases the rate of induced fission.</p>

<p class="noindentf"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> An <i>isotopologue</i> is a molecular entity that differs only in isotopic composition. An <i>isotopomer</i> is an isomer having the same number of each isotopic atom but differing in their positions in the molecule.</p>
</div>
<p class="indentt">Reaction rates are often measurably different for processes in which E&#x0064;H and E&#x0064;D bonds, where E is another element, are broken, made, or rearranged. The detection of this <b>kinetic isotope effect</b> can often help to support a proposed reaction mechanism. Kinetic isotope effects are frequently observed when an H atom is transferred from one atom to another in an activated complex. For example, the electrochemical reduction of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>(aq) to H<sub>2</sub>(g) occurs with a substantial isotope effect, with H<sub>2</sub> being liberated much more rapidly. A practical consequence of the difference in rates of formation of H<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> is that D<sub>2</sub>O may be concentrated electrolytically, thus facilitating separation of the two isotopes: the pure D<sub>2</sub>O that accumulates is then used to produce pure HD (by reaction with LiAlH<sub>4</sub>) or D<sub>2</sub> (by electrolysis). In general, reactions involving D<sub>2</sub>O occur more slowly than those involving H<sub>2</sub>O and, not surprisingly, D<sub>2</sub>O and D-substituted foods ingested in large quantities are poisonous for higher organisms.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the frequencies of molecular vibrations depend on the masses of atoms, they are strongly influenced by substitution of D for H. The heavier isotope results in the lower frequency (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">Section 8.5</a>). The isotope effect can be exploited by observing the IR spectra of isotopologues to determine whether a particular infrared absorption involves significant motion of a hydrogen atom in the molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">The distinct properties of the isotopes make them useful as <b>tracers</b>. The involvement of H and D through a series of reactions can be followed by infrared (IR, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">Section 8.5</a>) or mass spectrometry (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.11">Section 8.11</a>) as well as by NMR spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>). Tritium can be detected by its radioactivity, which can be a more sensitive probe than spectroscopy.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important property of the hydrogen nucleus is its spin.

<h3 class="h3">10.4 <b>Production of dihydrogen</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen is important both as a raw material for the chemical industry and, increasingly, as a fuel. Although it is not present in significant quantities in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere or in underground gas deposits, there is a high biological turnover, because various microorganisms use H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> as an oxidant or H<sub>2</sub> as a fuel (<a href="#box_10.1">Box 10.1</a>). Industrially, most H<sub>2</sub> is produced from natural gas by using steam reforming (in the US, about 95 per cent is produced in this way). Increasingly, H<sub>2</sub> is being produced by other methods, notably coal gasification (ideally this would be with carbon dioxide capture, (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box_14.5">Box 14.5</a>) and thermally assisted electrolysis. In 2012, world production of H<sub>2</sub> exceeded 65 Mt. Most H<sub>2</sub> is used close to its site of production, for the synthesis of ammonia (the Haber process), hydrogenation of unsaturated fats, hydrocracking of crude oil, and large-scale manufacture of organic chemicals. In the future, H<sub>2</sub> may be produced from entirely renewable sources such as water, capturing the energy of sunlight. Reaction of &#x2018;green&#x2019; H<sub>2</sub> with CO<sub>2</sub> or CO to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels would amount to a carbon-neutral technology.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Small-scale preparation</h4>

<p class="indent">The reaction of metal hydrides with water provides a convenient way to obtain small amounts of H<sub>2</sub> outside a laboratory. Calcium dihydride is particularly suited for remote, on-site H<sub>2</sub> production as it is commercially available and inexpensive and it reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O at room temperature:</p>

<p class="noindent">By implementing a system for capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from the mixture (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box_14.5">Box 14.5</a>), it is possible to use fossil fuels and minimize release of the greenhouse gas CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.

The best catalysts are based on platinum, but this is too expensive to justify its use in large-scale plants. As a consequence, electrolysis of water is economical and environmentally benign only if the electrical power stems from cheap, renewable resources or if it is surplus to demand. These conditions are already met in countries that have plenty of hydroelectric or nuclear energy.

Solar energy is already harnessed in several familiar ways, such as wind turbines, photosynthesis (biomass), and photovoltaic cells but, ultimately, using solar energy to generate H<sub>2</sub> from water (water splitting) provides the greatest opportunity to end the world&#x2019;s dependence on fossil fuels and help curb global climate change. Two technologies under development are high-temperature solar H<sub>2</sub> production and solar photoelectrochemical H<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The so-called &#x2018;sunbelt&#x2019; regions, which include Australia, southern Europe, the Sahara desert, and southwestern states of the US, receive about 1 kW m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> of solar power. These regions are suitable sites for high-temperature solar H<sub>2</sub> production using solar concentrating systems that reflect and focus solar radiation onto a receiver furnace, producing temperatures in excess of 1500&#x00B0;C. The intense heat, which is also available in the mantle surrounding a nuclear reactor, can be used to drive a turbine for generating electricity or to split water into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, thus producing a fuel.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Direct, single-step thermolysis of water requires temperatures in excess of 4000&#x00B0;C&#x2014;well above the threshold readily attainable in a solar concentrator or compatible with containment materials and engineering. By using a multi-step process it is possible to produce H<sub>2</sub> at much lower temperatures. Many systems are under investigation and development, the simplest of which are two-stage processes involving metal oxides, such as the sequence</p>

<p class="boxparai">Solar photoelectrochemical H<sub>2</sub> production (&#x2018;artificial photosynthesis&#x2019;) combines and adopts principles similar to those used in photovoltaic cells and by plants for natural photosynthesis. To split water electrochemically we require a cell potential greater than 1.23 V, which can be provided by light with a wavelength below 1000&#x2009;nm. The basis of a photoelectrochemical water splitting system based on light-sensitive particles is shown in <a href="#fig_B10.3">Fig. B10.3</a>. The essentials are (a) a mechanism for generating an excited electronic state by photon capture, (b) efficient transfer of electrons between the site of excitation and the catalytic sites, (c) catalytic sites for the H<sub>2</sub> production half-reaction, and (d) catalytic sites for the O<sub>2</sub> production half-reaction. The photoexcitation typically occurs at a semiconductor. The catalytic sites for H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> production must be sufficiently active to compete with the rate at which the photoexcited state relaxes to the ground state. For H<sub>2</sub> the catalyst can be Pt, although much cheaper alternatives are necessary in order to achieve a feasible industrial-scale system. The major challenge for photoelectrochemical water splitting is to achieve rapid and efficient production of O<sub>2</sub>, and there are intense efforts to find substances that mimic the Mn catalyst used in plant photosynthesis (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#box_16.2">Box 16.2</a> and <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>).</p>

<p class="noindentt">water is increasingly seen as a way of storing the energy derived from sunlight (photovoltaic, solar-thermal, wind) and thus levelling its intermittency, but new technology is required to lower costs and improve rates. Some physical methods for &#x2018;solar water splitting&#x2019; are outlined in <a href="#box_10.3">Box 10.3</a>. New electrocatalysts for H<sub>2</sub> production must be based on abundant elements, and one example is a NiMoZn alloy that has been used as the cathode in a photoelectrochemical device referred to as an &#x2018;artificial leaf&#x2019;.

</figure>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Homolytic dissociation</h4>
<p class="noindent">High temperatures are required to dissociate H<sub>2</sub> into atoms. An important example of homolytic dissociation at normal temperatures is the reaction of H<sub>2</sub> at finely divided Pt or Ni metal (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.11">Sections 25.11</a>, <a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.16">25.16</a>). This reaction, in which H<sub>2</sub> is dissociatively chemisorbed as H atoms, is used to catalyse the hydrogenation of alkenes and the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. Platinum is also used as the electrocatalyst for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells that are suitable for transport purposes (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#box_5.1">Box 5.1</a>). The optimized chemisorption of H<sub>2</sub> at Pt anodes, which is neither too weak nor too strong, results in a minimal overpotential requirement for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation and high rates (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#fig_25.25">Fig. 25.25</a>). There is much interest in finding alternatives to Pt, and we mention this aspect again in <a href="#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another example of homolytic cleavage involves the initial coordination of molecular H<sub>2</sub> as an &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-H<sub>2</sub> species in discrete metal complexes, which is described briefly in <a href="#sec_10.6">Section 10.6d</a> and in more detail in <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>. Dihydrogen complexes provide examples of species intermediate between molecular H<sub>2</sub> and a dihydrido complex. No dihydrogen complexes are known for the early d-block (Groups 3, 4, and 5), the f-block, or the p-block metals. If the metal is sufficiently electron-rich, back-donation of d electrons into the 1&#x03C3;<sub>u</sub> orbital splits the H&#x2013;H bond, resulting in the formation of a <i>cis</i>-dihydrido complex in which the formal oxidation number of the metal has increased by 2:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-18em;">
 <img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_0961.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Heterolytic dissociation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Heterolytic dissociation of H<sub>2</sub> depends upon a metal ion (for hydride coordination) and a Br&#x00F8;nsted base being in close proximity. Reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with a ZnO surface appears to produce a Zn(II)-bound hydride and an O-bound proton. This reaction is involved in the production of methanol by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over Cu/ZnO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17em;">
 <img src="../images/page305-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Another example in which H<sub>2</sub> is dissociated into a hydride and a proton is during its oxidation at the active site of metalloenzymes known as hydrogenases (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.14">Section 26.14</a>). As shown in <a href="#sec_10.6">Section 10.6</a>e, the enzyme reaction is mimicked in the development of synthetic catalysts for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation and production.</p>
<p><a id="page_306" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 306, Hydrogen</a></p>
<h4 class="h4">(c) Radical chain reactions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Radical chain mechanisms account for the thermally or photochemically initiated reactions between H<sub>2</sub> and the halogens in which atoms are generated that act as radical chain carriers in the propagation reaction. Chain termination occurs when the radicals recombine:</p>

<p class="indent"><img src="../images/page306-1.jpg" alt="images"/></p>

<p class="noindent">Once initiated, the activation energy for radical attack is low because a new bond is formed as one bond is lost.</p>
<p class="indent">The highly exothermic reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub> also occurs by a radical chain mechanism. Certain mixtures explode violently when detonated:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>10.6 Compounds of hydrogen</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen forms compounds with most of the elements. These compounds are classified into molecular hydrides, saline hydrides (salts of the hydride anion), metallic hydrides (interstitial compounds of d-block elements), and discrete complexes of d-block elements in which hydride or dihydrogen are ligands.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Molecular hydrides</h4>
<p class="noindent">Molecular hydrides are formed with p-block elements and Be. The bonding is covalent but variations in bond polarity (depending on the electronegativity of the atoms to which hydrogen is attached) result in a range of reaction types in which hydrogen is formally transferred as H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, or H.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><i>(i) Nomenclature and classification</i></h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Molecular compounds of hydrogen are classified as electron-rich, electron-precise, or electron-deficient. Electron-deficient hydrides provide some of the most intriguing examples of molecular structure and bonding as their simplest units tend to associate via bridging hydrogen atoms to form dimers and higher polymers</b>.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The systematic names of the molecular hydrogen compounds are formed from the name of the element and the suffix &#x2018;-ane&#x2019;, as in phosphane for PH<sub>3</sub>. The more traditional names, however, such as phosphine and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S, sulfane) are still widely used (<a href="#tab10.3">Table 10.3</a>). The common names ammonia and water are used universally rather than their systematic names azane and oxidane.</p>
<p class="indent">Molecular compounds of hydrogen are divided further into three sub-categories:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><b>Electron-precise</b>, in which all valence electrons of the central atom are engaged in bonds</p>
<p class="blockquotea"><b>Electron-rich</b>, in which there are more electron pairs on the central atom than are needed for bond formation (that is, there are lone pairs on the central atom)</p>
<p class="tabcap"><a id="tab10.3"></a><b><span class="blue">Table 10.3</span></b> Some molecular hydrogen compounds</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12.3em;">
 <img src="../images/page306-6.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="blockquote"><b>Electron-deficient</b>, in which there are too few electrons available to fill the bonding and nonbonding orbitals.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Electron-precise molecular hydrogen compounds include hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, and their heavier analogues silane, SiH<sub>4</sub>, and germane, GeH<sub>4</sub> (<a href="Chapter14.xhtml#sec_14.7">Section 14.7</a>). All these molecules are characterized by the presence of two-centre, two-electron bonds (2<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds) and the absence of lone pairs on the central atom. Electron-rich compounds are formed by the elements in Groups 15 to 17. Important examples include ammonia, water, and the hydrogen halides. Electron-deficient hydrogen compounds are common for boron and aluminium. The analogous simple hydride of boron, BH<sub>3,</sub> is not found; instead it occurs as a dimer, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (diborane, <b>4</b>) in which the two B atoms are bridged by a pair of H atoms in two three-centre, two-electron bonds (3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bonds).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page306-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-left:0em;width:100%;"><b>4</b> Diborane, B<sub>2</sub> H<sub>6</sub></figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="indent">The shapes of the molecules of the electron-precise and electron-rich compounds can all be predicted by the VSEPR rules (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>). Thus, CH<sub>4</sub> is tetrahedral (<b>1</b>), NH<sub>3</sub> is trigonal pyramidal (<b>2</b>), and H<sub>2</sub>O is angular (<b>3</b>).</p>
<p class="indent">Electron-deficient compounds provide some of the most interesting and unusual examples of structure and bonding. A Lewis structure for diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, would require at least 14 valence electrons to bind the eight atoms together, but the molecule has <a id="page_307" class="page">Page 307, Hydrogen</a>only 12 valence electrons. The simple explanation of its structure is the presence of B&#x2013;H&#x2013;B three-centre, two-electron bonds (3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i>; <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>e) acting as bridges between the two B atoms, so two electrons contribute to binding three atoms. These bridging B&#x2013;H bonds are longer and weaker than the terminal B&#x2013;H bonds. Another way of viewing this structure is that each BH<sub>3</sub> moiety is a strong Lewis acid and gains the share of an electron pair from a B&#x2013;H bond in the other BH<sub>3</sub> moiety. Being so small, the H atoms pose little or no steric hindrance to dimer formation. The structures of boron hydrides are described more fully in <a href="Chapter13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As expected, aluminium shows related behaviour that is modified by the larger atomic radius of this Period 3 element. The compound AlH<sub>3</sub> does not exist as a monomer but forms a polymer in which each relatively large Al atom is surrounded octahedrally by six H atoms. Beryllium, unlike its congeners, exhibits a diagonal relationship with Al and also forms a polymeric covalent hydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>. Although BH<sub>3</sub> and AlH<sub>3</sub> do not exist as monomers they do form important complex anions in combination with the hydride anion. The common reagents sodium tetrahydridoborate (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) and lithium tetrahydridoaluminate (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>) are examples of adduct formation between BH<sub>3</sub> or AlH<sub>3</sub>, each a Lewis acid, and the Lewis base H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><i>(ii) Reactions of molecular hydrides</i></h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Homolytic dissociation of an E&#x2013;H bond to produce a radical, E&#x00B7;, and hydrogen atom, H, occurs most readily for the hydrides of the heavy p-block elements. Hydrogen attached to an electronegative element has protic character and the compound is typically a Br&#x00F8;nsted acid. Hydrogen attached to an electropositive element can be transferred to an acceptor as a hydride ion.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">As was summarized briefly in <a href="#sec_10.2">Section 10.2</a>, the reactions of binary molecular hydrides are discussed in terms of their ability to undergo homolytic dissociation and, when the dissociation is heterolytic, in terms of their protic or hydridic character.</p>
<p class="indent">Homolytic dissociation occurs readily for the hydrogen compounds of some p-block elements, especially the heavier elements. For example, the use of a radical initiator greatly facilitates the reaction of trialkylstannanes, R<sub>3</sub>SnH, with haloalkanes, RX, as a result of the formation of R<sub>3</sub>Sn&#x00B7; radicals:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.3em;">
 <img src="../images/page307-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Thermal decomposition reactions of molecular hydrides yielding H<sub>2</sub> and the element occur by homolytic dissociation. Decomposition temperatures usually correlate with E&#x2013;H bond energies and inversely with enthalpies of formation. For example, AsH<sub>3</sub> (As&#x2013;H bond enthalpy 297&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), which is an <i>endothermic</i> hydride, i.e. its formation from the elements is endothermic, decomposes quantitatively at 250&#x2013;300&#x00B0;C:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page307-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In contrast, water (O&#x2013;H bond enthalpy 464&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), which is a highly <i>exothermic hydride</i>, i.e. its formation from the elements is exothermic, is only 4 per cent dissociated into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> at 2200&#x00B0;C:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-12.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page307-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Direct thermolysis of water is therefore not a practical solution for H<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
<p class="indent">As we saw in <a href="#sec_10.5">Section 10.5</a>, compounds reacting by proton donation are said to show protic behaviour: in other words, they are Br&#x00F8;nsted acids. We saw in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.1">Section 4.1</a> that Br&#x00F8;nsted acid strength increases from left to right across a period in the p block (in the order of increasing electron affinity) and down a group (in the order of decreasing bond energy). One striking example of this trend is the increase in acidity from CH<sub>4</sub> to HF and then from HF to HI. Binary hydrogen compounds of elements on the right of the periodic table typically undergo these reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Molecules in which hydrogen is bound to a more electropositive element can act as hydride-ion donors. Important examples are the complex hydrido anions such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>BH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>AlH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> which are used to hydrogenate compounds containing a multiple bond. Other examples include numerous compounds of d-block elements, including many catalysts.</p>
<p class="indent">Hydride affinities, analogous to proton affinities, can be calculated. For instance, the hydride affinity of a boron compound BX<sub>3</sub> is the negative of the enthalpy (<img src="../images/page307-10.jpg" alt="images"/>) for the reaction</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-17.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page307-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, a strong hydride <i>donor</i> is associated with a low value of <img src="../images/page307-10.jpg" alt="images"/>.</p>
<p class="indent">A practical hydridicity scale may also be determined experimentally by comparing the hydride ion donor abilities of different species HY in a particular aprotic solvent, such as acetontrile. The scale is derived by considering the following equilibria, which include the heterolytic cleavage of H<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<p class="noindent">Values of equilibrium constants (hence<img src="../images/page307-11.jpg" alt="images"/>) for reactions (10.1) and (10.2) are experimentally measurable, and <img src="../images/page307-11.jpg" alt="images"/> for reaction (10.3) in acetonitrile is set at 317&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 298&#x2009;K.

<h4 class="h4"><i>(iii) Hydrogen bonding</i></h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> Compounds and functionalities containing H atoms attached to electronegative elements with at least one lone pair often associate through hydrogen bonds.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">An E&#x2013;H bond between an electronegative element E and hydrogen is highly polar, <sup>&#x03B4;&#x2212;</sup>E&#x2013;H<sup>&#x03B4;&#x002B;</sup>, and the partially positively charged H atom can interact with a lone pair on the E atom of another <a id="page_308" class="page">Page 308, Hydrogen</a>molecule, forming a bridge that is known as a <b>hydrogen bond.</b> Striking evidence for hydrogen bonding is provided by the trends in normal boiling points (<a href="#fig_10.6">Fig. 10.6</a>), which are unusually high for the strongly hydrogen-bonded molecules water (in which there are O&#x0064;H&#x2026;O bonds), ammonia (containing N&#x0064;H&#x2026;N bonds), and hydrogen fluoride (containing F&#x0064;H&#x2026;F bonds). The relatively low boiling points of PH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, HCl, and the heavier p-block molecular hydrides indicate that these molecules do not form strong hydrogen bonds. Although hydrogen bonds are usually much weaker than conventional bonds (<a href="#tab10.4">Table 10.4</a>), their collective action is responsible for stabilizing complex structures such as the open network structure of ice (<a href="#fig_10.7">Fig. 10.7</a>). Collective hydrogen bonding interactions play a large part in maintaining the structure of protein molecules (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Section 26.2</a>). They are also responsible for the recognition between specific DNA bases, adenine/thymine and guanine/cytosine, that underlies gene replication (<a href="#fig_10.8">Fig. 10.8</a>). Similarly, solid HF consists of chain structures that survive partially even in the vapour (<b>5</b>).</p>

X-ray single-crystal structure determinations often show the same patterns, as for example in the structure of ice and of solid HF, but packing forces in solids may have a strong influence on the orientation of the relatively weak hydrogen bond.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most interesting manifestations of hydrogen bonding is the structure of ice. There are at least 10 different phases of ice but only one is stable under ordinary conditions. The familiar low-pressure phase of ice, ice-I<sub>h</sub>, crystallizes in a hexagonal unit cell with each O atom surrounded tetrahedrally by four others (as shown in <a href="#fig_10.7">Fig. 10.7</a>). These O atoms are held together by hydrogen bonds with O&#x0064;H&#x2026;O and O&#x2026;H&#x0064;O bonds largely randomly distributed through the solid. The resulting structure is quite open, which accounts for the density of ice being lower than that of water. When ice melts, the network of hydrogen bonds partially collapses.</p>
<p class="indent">Water can also form <b>clathrate hydrates</b>, consisting of hydrogen-bonded cages of water molecules surrounding foreign molecules or ions. One example is the clathrate hydrate of composition Xe<sub>4</sub>(CCl<sub>4</sub>)<sub>8</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>68</sub> (<a href="#fig_10.12">Fig. 10.12</a>). In this structure, the cages with O atoms defining their corners consist of 14-faced and 12-faced polyhedra in the ratio 3:2. These O atoms are held together by hydrogen bonds, and guest molecules occupy the interiors of the polyhedra. Aside from their interesting structures, which illustrate the organization that can be enforced by hydrogen bonding, clathrate hydrates are often used as models for the way in which water appears to become organized around nonpolar groups, such as those in proteins. Methane clathrate hydrates occur in the Earth at high pressures, and it is estimated that huge quantities of CH<sub>4</sub> are trapped in these formations (see <a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box14.3">Box 14.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some ionic compounds form clathrate hydrates in which the anion is incorporated into the framework by hydrogen bonding. This type of clathrate is particularly common with the very <a id="page_310" class="page">Page 310, Hydrogen</a>strong hydrogen bond acceptors F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.

<p class="noindentt">The saline hydrides are ionic solids containing discrete H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions and are analogous to corresponding halide salts. The ionic radius of H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> varies from 126 pm in LiH to 154 pm in CsH. This wide variability reflects the poor control that the single charge of the proton has on its two surrounding electrons and the resulting high compressibility and polarizability of H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. Hydrides of Group 1 and 2 elements, with the exception of Be, are ionic compounds. All Group 1 hydrides adopt the rock-salt structure.

<p class="indent">Saline hydrides are pyrophoric; indeed, finely divided sodium hydride can ignite simply if it is left exposed to humid air.

</div>
<p class="boxpara">The need to develop practical systems for on-board hydrogen storage is considered a major obstacle to the future use of H<sub>2</sub> as an energy carrier in vehicles. The problem is only partly resolved by compression and liquefaction. Compression to high-pressure gaseous H<sub>2</sub> at 200 bar (energy density 0.53 kWh dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) followed by refrigeration to form liquid H<sub>2</sub> (energy density 2.37 kWh dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) require considerable energy and containment costs, and are particularly prohibitive for small private vehicles for which space and cost are also of prime concern. The challenge, therefore, is to identify and&#x00A0;develop materials that can store H<sub>2</sub> in a fully reversible manner, at high rates under reasonable temperatures and pressure conditions. One such material is LaNi<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub> which stores H<sub>2</sub> reversibly with a gravimetric density of 2 per cent; but for transport, these materials also have to be lightweight. Materials under investigation include hydrides, borohydrides, and amides of the lightest metals. Examples of these compounds and their gravimetric H<sub>2</sub> storage densities are MgH<sub>2</sub> (8 per cent), LiBH<sub>4</sub> (20 per cent), LiNH<sub>2</sub> (10 per cent), and Al(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (17 per cent), which is a liquid and melts at &#x2013;65&#x00B0;C. The structure of MgH<sub>2</sub> is described in <a href="Chapter12.xhtml#box_12.3">Box 12.3</a>.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Some of the principles are illustrated by the LiNH<sub>2</sub> system, for which reversible hydrogen storage takes place in two reactions:</p>

<p class="boxparai">Comparisons of the structures of Li<sub>2</sub>NH and LiNH<sub>2</sub> suggest how the kinetics of absorption and desorption depend upon ion mobility (<a href="#fig_B10.4">Fig. B10.4</a>). The structure of Li<sub>2</sub>NH (antifluorite) is closely related to that of LiNH<sub>2</sub> (defect antifluorite structure with half the Li sites occupied). The small Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions can migrate within such a structure by a hopping mechanism involving transitory defect sites, thus allowing H<sub>2</sub> uptake by protonation of NH<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> and coupled formation of a contiguous LiH phase. A problem which must be overcome with amides and other complex</p>
<p class="boxpara">hydrides is their tendency to decompose to undesirable products, such as NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, <a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.12">Section 24.12</a>) are low-density porous materials that adsorb H<sub>2</sub> molecules without breaking the H&#x0064;H bond. MOF-5 (Zn<sub>4</sub>O(1,4 benzene dicarboxylate)<sub>3</sub>) physi-adsorbs 7.1 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by mass at 77&#x2009;K and 40 bar, in a fully reversible manner. Hydrogen is released by decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, but the low temperature of operation of this process, because of the weak interaction of the framework with the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, means that such systems are unlikely to be commercially useful.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Liquid organic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds which can take up H<sub>2</sub> reversibly are also under investigation.

<h4 class="h4">(c) Metallic hydrides</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span></b> <b>No stable binary metal hydrides are known for the metals in Groups 7 to 9; metallic hydrides have metallic conductivity and in many the hydrogen is very mobile.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Many of the d- and f-block elements react with H<sub>2</sub> to produce metallic hydrides. Most of these compounds (and the hydrides of alloys) have a metallic lustre and are electrically conducting (hence their name). They are less dense than the parent metal and are brittle&#x2014;a property that poses challenges for the construction of pipes carrying H<sub>2</sub>. Most metallic hydrides have variable composition (they are nonstoichiometric). For example, at 550&#x02DA;C zirconium hydride exists over a composition range from ZrH<sub>1.30</sub> to ZrH<sub>1.75</sub>; it has the fluorite structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.38">Fig. 3.38</a>) with a variable number of anion sites unoccupied. The variable stoichiometry and metallic conductivity of these hydrides can be understood in terms of a model in which the band of delocalized orbitals responsible for the conductivity accommodates the electrons supplied by arriving H atoms. In this model, the H atoms as well as the metal atoms take up equilibrium positions in the electron sea. The conductivities of metallic hydrides typically vary with hydrogen content, and this variation can be correlated with the extent to which the conduction band is filled or emptied as hydrogen is added or removed. Thus, whereas compounds CeH<sub>2&#x002B;<i>x</i></sub> (<i>x</i> values are typically up to 0.75) are metallic conductors, CeH<sub>3</sub> is an insulator and is more like a saline hydride.</p>
<p class="indent">Metallic hydrides are formed by all the d-block metals of Groups 3, 4, and 5 and by almost all f-block elements (<a href="#fig_10.13">Fig. 10.13</a>). However, the only hydride in Group 6 is CrH, and no hydrides are known for the unalloyed metals of Groups 7, 8, and 9. The region of the periodic table covered by Groups 7 through to 9 is sometimes referred to as the <b>hydride gap</b> because few, if any, stable binary metal&#x2013;hydrogen compounds are formed by these elements. However, these metals are important as hydrogenation catalysts because they can <i>activate</i> hydrogen.</p>
<p class="indent">The Group 10 metals, especially Ni and Pt, are often used as hydrogenation catalysts in which surface hydride formation is thought to be involved (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.11">Sections 25.11</a>, <a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.16">25.16</a>). However, somewhat surprisingly, at moderate pressures only Pd forms a stable bulk phase; its composition is PdH<sub><i>x</i></sub>, with <i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;1. Nickel forms hydride phases at very high pressures but Pt does not form <a id="page_312" class="page">Page 312, Hydrogen</a>any&#x00A0;at all. Apparently the Pt&#x2013;H bond enthalpy is sufficiently great to disrupt the H&#x2013;H bond but not strong enough to offset the loss of Pt&#x2013;Pt bonding, which would occur upon formation of a bulk platinum hydride. In agreement with this interpretation, the enthalpies of sublimation, which reflect M&#x2013;M bond enthalpies, increase in the order Pd (378&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;Ni (430&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;Pt (565&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The M&#x2013;H bond enthalpy is a crucial factor in the design of metal hydride batteries, which are described in <a href="#box_10.5">Box 10.5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Another striking property of many metallic hydrides is the high mobility of hydrogen within the material at slightly elevated temperatures. This mobility is used in the ultrapurification of H<sub>2</sub> by diffusion through a palladium/silver alloy tube (<a href="#fig_10.14">Fig. 10.14</a>). The high mobility of the hydrogen they contain and their variable composition make the metallic hydrides potential hydrogen storage media. Upon cooling from red heat, palladium absorbs up to 900 times its own volume of H<sub>2</sub>, which is given off again upon heating. As a result, palladium is sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;hydrogen sponge&#x2019;. The intermetallic compound LaNi<sub>5</sub> forms a hydride phase with a limiting composition LaNi<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and at this composition it contains a greater density of hydrogen than liquid H<sub>2</sub>. A less expensive system with the composition FeTiH<sub><i>x</i></sub> (<i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;1.95) is now commercially available for low-pressure hydrogen storage.</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">A nickel metal-hydride battery is a type of rechargeable battery similar to the widely used nickel&#x2013;cadmium (NiCad) battery. The main advantages of the metal hydride over the NiCad batteries are that they are more easily recycled and do not contain the very toxic element Cd. However, nickel metal-hydride batteries have a high self-discharge rate of approximately 30 per cent per month. This rate is higher than that of NiCad batteries, which is around 20 per cent per month. Despite this, nickel metal-hydride batteries are being investigated as possible power sources for electric vehicles. In contrast to vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine, electric vehicles are emission-free (if the generation of electricity elsewhere is ignored). In addition, the energy efficiency of generating electricity for vehicles is almost twice that of the internal combustion engine. Electric power also reduces society&#x2019;s reliance on oil and increases the opportunities for using renewable energy and also using coal and gas in such a way that the CO<sub>2</sub> can be captured (see <a href="Chapter14.xhtml#box_14.5">Box 14.5</a>)</p>
<p class="boxparai">The attractive properties of nickel metal-hydride batteries include high power, long life, a wide range of operating temperatures, short recharging times, and sealed, maintenance-free operation. The cathode is made from a mixed metal alloy at which the metal hydrides are formed reversibly. The anode is made from nickel hydroxide. The electrolyte is a basic solution of 30 per cent by mass KOH. The electrode reactions are:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-14em;">
 <img src="../images/page312-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="boxpara">There is no net change in the electrolyte concentration over the charge&#x2212;discharge cycle.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The strength of the M&#x2013;H bond in the metal hydride is crucial to the operation of the battery. The ideal bond enthalpy falls in the range 25&#x2212;50&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. If the bond enthalpy is too low, the hydrogen does not react with the alloy and H<sub>2</sub> is evolved instead. If the bond enthalpy is too high, the reaction is not reversible. Other factors influence the choice of metal. For example the alloy must not react with KOH solution, must be resistant to oxidation and corrosion, and must tolerate overcharge (during which O<sub>2</sub> is generated at the Ni(O)OH electrode) and overdischarge (during which H<sub>2</sub> is generated at the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> electrode). To satisfy these diverse requirements the alloys have disordered structures and use metals that would not be suitable if used alone, including Li, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zr. The number of H atoms per metal atom can be increased by using Mg, Ti, V, Zr, and Nb, and the M&#x2212;H bond enthalpy can be adjusted by using V, Mn, and Zr. The charge and discharge reactions are catalysed by Al, Mn, Co, Fe, and Ni and the corrosion resistance is improved by using Cr, Mo, and W. This wide range of properties allows nickel metal-hydride battery performance to be optimized for different applications.</p>

The compound CsH is a compound of a Group 1 element, and so it is expected to be a saline hydride, typical of the s-block metals. It is an electrical insulator with the rock-salt structure. As with the hydrogen compounds of other p-block elements, the hydrides PH<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> are molecular with low molar masses and high volatilities. They are in fact gases under normal conditions. The Lewis structure indicates that PH<sub>3</sub> has a lone pair on the phosphorus atom and that it is therefore an electron-rich molecular compound.

<p class="noindentt">The H atom and the H<sub>2</sub> molecule play an important role in organometallic chemistry, particularly homogeneous catalysis involving hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyl groups (see <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.7">Sections 22.7</a>, <a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.4">25.4</a> and <a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.5">25.5</a>). An individual, bound H atom is usually regarded as a H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (hydrido) ligand: H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is highly polarizable and behaves as a soft, two-electron &#x03C3;-donor (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>). There is a very large number of complexes of d-block and f-block elements containing one or more hydride ligands; these complexes include those of elements in the &#x2018;hydride gap&#x2019; that do not form binary metallic hydrides. Hydrido complexes can be synthesized by many routes, such as the reaction of a metal ion or complex with a suitable hydrogen source (water) and (usually) a reducing agent.</p>

As with binary compounds of the main group, the coordinated H ligand can be protonic or hydridic depending on the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating character of the metal atom, which in turn depends upon the nature of the other ligands. Electron-withdrawing CO ligands in the coordination shell render the H atom protonic because they can stabilize the conjugate base that results from proton release. As explained in more detail in <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.18">Section 22.18</a>, compounds such as [CoH(CO)<sub>4</sub>] are Br&#x00F8;nsted acids that can be ranked in terms of their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values, that for [CoH(CO)<sub>4</sub>] being 8.3 when measured in acetonitrile.

<p class="noindentt">A negative Gibbs energy of formation is a clue that the direct combination of hydrogen and an element may be the preferred synthetic route for a hydrogen compound. When a compound is thermodynamically unstable with respect to its elements, an indirect synthetic route from other compounds can often be found, but each step in the indirect route must be thermodynamically favourable.</p>

<p class="noindent">In such general equations, the symbol E can also denote an element with higher valence, with corresponding changes of detail in the formulas and stoichiometric coefficients.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct combination is used commercially for the synthesis of compounds that have negative Gibbs energies of formation, including NH<sub>3</sub> and the hydrides of lithium, sodium, and calcium. However, in some cases high pressure, high temperature, and a catalyst are necessary to overcome unfavourable kinetic barriers. The high temperature used for the lithium reaction is an example: it melts the metal and hence helps to break up the surface layer of hydride that would otherwise passivate it. This inconvenience is avoided in many laboratory preparations by adopting one of the alternative synthesis routes, which may also be used to prepare compounds with positive Gibbs energies of formation.</p>

<p class="indenthangd" style="width:66%;"><b>(c)</b> The structures of the hydrides of the Group 1 and 2 elements are typical of ionic compounds because the H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion is compact and has a well-defined radius.</p>
<p class="indenthangd" style="width:66%;"><b>(d)</b> The structures of the hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals are adequately described by VSEPR theory.</p>
<p class="indenthangd" style="width:66%;"><b>(e)</b> The compound NaBH<sub>4</sub> is a versatile reagent because it has greater hydridic character than the simple Group 1 hydrides such as NaH.</p>
<p class="indenthangd" style="width:66%;"><b>(f)</b> Heavy-element hydrides such as the tin hydrides frequently undergo radical reactions, in part because of the low E&#x2013;H bond energy.</p>
<p class="indenthangd" style="width:66%;"><b>(g)</b> The boron hydrides are called electron-deficient compounds because they are easily reduced by hydrogen.</p>
<p class="noindentex" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="vie"><b>10.21</b></span> What is the expected infrared stretching wavenumber of gaseous <sup>3</sup>H<sup>35</sup>Cl given that the corresponding value for <sup>1</sup>H<sup>35</sup>Cl is 2991&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>?</p>

<h3 class="h3c"><b>TUTORIAL PROBLEMS</b></h3>
<p class="noindentex" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="vie"><b>10.1</b></span> In their article, &#x2018;Hydrogen storage in metal&#x2013;organic frameworks&#x2019; (<i>Chem. Soc. Rev</i>., 2009, <b>38</b>, 1294), Jeffrey Long and co-workers discuss some of the design principles for hydrogen-storage materials. List the advantages and disadvantages of storing H<sub>2</sub> by using weak rather than strong binding interactions.</p>
<p class="noindentex" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="vie"><b>10.2</b></span> In his paper, &#x2018;The proper place for hydrogen&#x2019; (<i>J. Chem. Educ.</i>, 2003, <b>80</b>, 947), M.W. Cronyn argues that hydrogen should be placed at the head of Group 14 immediately above carbon. Summarize his reasoning.</p>
<p class="noindentex" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="vie"><b>10.3</b></span> Spectroscopic evidence has been obtained for the existence of [Ir(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(H<sub>3</sub>)(PR<sub>3</sub>)]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, a complex in which one ligand is formally <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> Devise a plausible molecular orbital scheme for the bonding in the complex, assuming that an angular H<sub>3</sub> unit occupies one coordination site and interacts with the e<sub>g</sub> and t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals of the metal. An alternative formulation of the structure of the complex, however, is as a trihydro species with very large coupling constants (see <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1991, <b>113</b>, 6074 and the references therein, and especially <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1990, <b>112</b>, 909 and 920). Review the evidence for this alternative formulation.</p>
<p class="noindentex" style="width:70%;text-align:left;"><span class="vie"><b>10.4</b></span> In their article, &#x2018;Reversible, metal-free hydrogen activation&#x2019; (<i>Science</i>, 2006, <b>314</b>, 1124), Douglas Stephan and co-workers describe how H<sub>2</sub> is heterolytically cleaved at a molecule containing only main group elements. By referring also to Section 4.9, explain the principles of this reaction, the procedures used to investigate the mechanism, and the possible implications for H<sub>2</sub> storage.</p>
