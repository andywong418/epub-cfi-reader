<p class="noindent">The authors of <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i>, sixth edition, gratefully acknowledge the contribution made by Peter Atkins to the first five editions of the book &#x2013; an extensive input without which those editions would not have happened. In recent previous editions, he shaped the final prose and originated the artwork programme; his contribution continues to pervade <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i>, and has provided the solid foundation on which this edition is built.</p>
