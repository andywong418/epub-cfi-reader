Rates of reaction are as important as equilibria in coordination chemistry. The numerous isomers of the ammines of Co(III) and Pt(II), which were so important to the development of the subject, could not have been isolated if ligand substitutions and interconversion of the isomers had been fast. But what determines whether one complex will survive for long periods whereas another will undergo rapid reaction?</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The rate at which one complex converts into another is governed by the height of the activation energy barrier that lies between them. Thermodynamically unstable complexes that survive for long periods (by convention, at least a minute) are commonly called &#x2018;inert&#x2019;, but <b>nonlabile</b> is perhaps more appropriate and is the term we shall use. Complexes that undergo more rapid equilibration are called <b>labile</b>. An example of each type is the labile complex [Ni(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, which has a half-life of the order of milliseconds before the H<sub>2</sub>O is replaced by another H<sub>2</sub>O or a stronger base, and the nonlabile complex [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, in which H<sub>2</sub>O survives for many hours as a ligand before it is replaced by a stronger base.</p>
<p class="bh-indent"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.1">Figure 21.1</a> shows the characteristic lifetimes of the important aqua metal ion complexes. We see a range of lifetimes starting at about 1&#x2009;ns, which is approximately the time it takes for a molecule to diffuse one molecular diameter in solution. At the other end of the scale are lifetimes in years. Even so, the illustration does not show the longest times that could be considered, which are comparable to geological eras.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">We shall examine the lability of complexes in greater detail when we discuss the mechanism of reactions later in this section, but we can make two broad generalizations now. The first is that complexes of metals that have no additional factor to provide extra stability&#x2014;for instance, the ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) and chelate effects&#x2014;are among the most labile. Any additional stability of a complex results in an increase in activation energy for a ligand replacement reaction and hence decreases the lability of the complex. A second generalization is that very small ions are often less labile because they have greater M&#x2014;L bond strengths and it is sterically very difficult for incoming ligands to approach the metal atom closely.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Some further generalizations are as follows:</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>All complexes of s-block ions except the smallest (Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) are extremely labile.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>Complexes of the M(III) ions of the f block are all very labile.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>Complexes of the d<sup>10</sup> ions (Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, Cd<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, and Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) are normally very labile.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>Across the 3d series, complexes of d-block M(II) ions are generally moderately labile, with distorted Cu(II) complexes among the most labile.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>Complexes of d-block M(III) ions are distinctly less labile than d-block M(II) ions.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>d-Metal complexes with d<sup>3</sup> and low-spin d<sup>6</sup> configurations (for example Cr(III), Fe(II), and Co(III)) are generally nonlabile as they have large LFSEs. Chelate complexes with the same configuration, such as [Fe(phen)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, are particularly nonlabile.</p>
<p class="bh-indenthanging1"><span class="bh-blue">&#x2022;</span><span class="bh-space">&#160;</span>Nonlability is common among the complexes of the 4d and 5d series, which reflects the high LFSE and strength of the metal&#x2013;ligand bonding.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">The natures of the ligands in the complex also affect the rates of reactions. The identity of the incoming ligand has the greatest effect, and equilibrium constants of displacement reactions can be used to rank ligands in order of their strength as Lewis bases. However, a different order may be found if bases are ranked according to the rates at which they displace a ligand from the central metal ion. Therefore, for kinetic considerations, we replace the equilibrium concept of basicity by the kinetic concept of <b>nucleophilicity</b>, the rate of attack on a complex by a given Lewis base relative to the rate of attack by a reference Lewis base. The shift from equilibrium to kinetic considerations is emphasized by referring to ligand displacement as <b>nucleophilic substitution</b>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Ligands other than the entering and leaving groups may play a significant role in controlling the rates of reactions; these ligands are referred to as <b>spectator ligands</b>. For instance, it is observed for square-planar complexes that the ligand <i>trans</i> to the leaving group X has a great effect on the rate of substitution of X by the entering group Y.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3"><span class="bh-nor">21.2</span> The classification of mechanisms</h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">The <b>mechanism</b> of a reaction is the sequence of elementary steps by which the reaction takes place. Once a suitable mechanism has been identified, attention turns to the details of the activation process of the rate-determining step. In some cases the overall mechanism is poorly resolved, and the only information available is the rate-determining step.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(a) Association, dissociation, and interchange</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> The mechanism of a nucleophilic substitution reaction is the sequence of elementary steps by which the reaction takes place and is classified as associative, dissociative, or interchange; an associative mechanism is distinguished from an interchange mechanism by demonstrating that the intermediate has a relatively long life.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">The first stage in the kinetic analysis of a reaction is to study how its rate changes as the concentrations of reactants are varied. This type of investigation leads to the identification of <b>rate laws</b>, the differential equations governing the rate of change of the concentrations of reactants and products. For example, the observation that the rate of formation of [Ni(NH<sub>3</sub>)(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> from [Ni(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is proportional to the concentration of both NH<sub>3</sub> and [Ni(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> implies that the reaction is first order in each of these two reactants, and that the overall rate law is</p>

<p class="bh-indent">In simple sequential reaction schemes, the slowest elementary step of the reaction dominates the overall reaction rate and the overall rate law, and is called the <b>rate-determining step</b>. However, in general, all the steps in the reaction may contribute to the rate law and affect its rate. Therefore, in conjunction with stereochemical and isotopic labelling studies, the determination of the rate law is the route to the elucidation of the mechanism of the reaction.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Three main classes of reaction mechanism have been identified. A <b>dissociative mechanism</b>, denoted <i>D</i>, is a reaction sequence in which an <i>intermediate</i> of reduced coordination number is formed by the departure of the leaving group:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_889.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-indent">Here ML<sub><i>n</i></sub> (the metal atom and any spectator ligands) is a true intermediate that can, in principle, be detected (or even isolated). The typical form of the corresponding reaction profile is shown in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.2">Fig. 21.2</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:-1em;">The leaving and entering groups exchange in a single step by forming a transition state but not a true intermediate. The interchange mechanism is common for many reactions of six-coordinate complexes. The typical form of the reaction profile is shown in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.4">Fig. 21.4</a>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The distinction between the <i>A</i> and <i>I</i> mechanisms hinges on whether or not the <i>intermediate</i> persists long enough to be detectable. One type of evidence is the isolation of an <a id="page_554" class="page">page 554, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a>intermediate in another related reaction or under different conditions. If an argument by extrapolation to the actual reaction conditions suggests that a moderately long-lived intermediate might exist during the reaction in question, then the <i>A</i> path is indicated. For example, the synthesis of the trigonal-bipyramidal Pt(II) complex, [Pt(SnCl<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup>, indicates that a five-coordinate platinum complex may be plausible in substitution reactions of square-planar Pt(II) ammine complexes. Similarly, the fact that [Ni(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> is observed spectroscopically in solution, and that it has been isolated in the crystalline state, provides support for the view that it is involved when CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> exchanges with the square-planar tetracyanidonickelate(II) ion.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="bh-indent">A second indication of the persistence of an intermediate is the observation of a stereochemical change, which implies that the intermediate has lived long enough to undergo rearrangement. <i>Cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> isomerization is observed in the substitution reactions of certain square-planar phosphine Pt(II) complexes, which is in contrast to the retention of configuration usually observed. This difference implies that the trigonal-bipyramidal intermediate lives long enough for an exchange between the axial and equatorial ligand positions to occur.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Direct spectroscopic detection of the intermediate, and hence an indication of <i>A</i> rather than <i>I</i>, may be possible if a sufficient amount accumulates. Such direct evidence, however, requires an unusually stable intermediate with favourable spectroscopic characteristics.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(b) The rate-determining step</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> The rate-determining step is classified as associative or dissociative according to the dependence of its rate on the identity of the entering group.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Now we consider the rate-determining step of a reaction and the details of its formation. The step is called <b>associative</b> and denoted <i>a</i> if its rate depends strongly on the identity of the incoming group. Examples are found among reactions of the d<sup>8</sup> square-planar complexes of Pt(II), Pd(II), and Au(III), including</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_896.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">where dien is diethylenetriamine (NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). It is found, for instance, that use of I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> instead of Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> increases the rate constant by an order of magnitude. Experimental observations on the substitution reactions of square-planar complexes support the view that the rate-determining step is associative.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The strong dependence of the rate-determining step on entering group Y indicates that the <i>transition state</i> must involve significant bonding to Y. A reaction with an associative mechanism (<i>A</i>) will be associatively activated (<i>a</i>) if the attachment of Y to the initial reactant ML<sub><i>n</i></sub>X is the rate-determining step; such a reaction is designated <i>A</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>, and in this case the intermediate ML<sub><i>n</i></sub>XY would not be detected. A reaction with a dissociative mechanism (<i>D</i>) is associatively activated (<i>a</i>) if the attachment of Y to the intermediate ML<sub><i>n</i></sub> is the rate-determining step; such a reaction is designated <i>D</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>. <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.5">Figure 21.5</a> shows the reaction profiles for associatively activated <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> mechanisms. For the reactions to proceed, it is necessary to have established a population of an encounter complex {X&#x0064;M, Y} in a pre-equilibrium step.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The rate-determining step is called <b>dissociative</b> and denoted <i>d</i> if its rate is largely independent of the identity of Y. This category includes some of the classic examples of ligand substitution in octahedral d-metal complexes, including</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">where it is found that the rate changes only by a few per cent at most when pyridine is used as the incoming ligand instead of NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The weak dependence on Y of a dissociatively activated process indicates that the rate of formation of the transition state is determined largely by the rate at which the bond to the leaving group X can break. A reaction with an associative mechanism (<i>A</i>) will be dissociatively activated (<i>d</i>) provided the loss of X from the intermediate YML<sub><i>n</i></sub>X is the rate-determining step; such a reaction is designated <i>A</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>. A reaction with a dissociative mechanism (<i>D</i>) is dissociatively activated (<i>d</i>) if the initial loss of X from the reactant ML<sub><i>n</i></sub>X is the rate-determining step; such a reaction is designated <i>D</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>. In this case, the intermediate ML<sub><i>n</i></sub> would not be detected. <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.6">Figure 21.6</a> shows the reaction profiles for dissociatively activated <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> mechanisms.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3a" style="margin-top:2em;">Ligand substitution in square-planar complexes</h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">The mechanism of ligand exchange in square-planar Pt complexes has been studied extensively, largely because the reactions occur on a timescale that is very amenable to investigation. We might expect an associative mechanism of ligand exchange because square-planar complexes are sterically uncrowded&#x2014;they can be considered as octahedral complexes with two ligands missing&#x2014;but it is rarely that simple. The elucidation of the mechanism of the substitution of square-planar complexes is often complicated by the occurrence of alternative pathways. For instance, if a reaction such as <a id="page_556" class="page">page 556, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a>is first-order in the complex and independent of the concentration of I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, then the rate of reaction will be equal to <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>[PtCl(dien)<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]. However, if there is a pathway in which the rate law is first order in the complex <i>and</i> first order in the incoming group (that is, overall second order) then the rate would be given by <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[PtCl(dien)<sup>&#x002B;</sup>][I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]. If both reaction pathways occur at comparable rates, the rate law has the form</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:0.5em;">A reaction like this is usually studied under the conditions [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;&#x003E;[complex] so that [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] does not change significantly during the reaction. This simplifies the treatment of the data as <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] is effectively constant and the rate law is now pseudo-first order:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Careful studies of the variation of the reaction rates of square-planar complexes with changes in the composition of the reactant complex and the conditions of the reaction shed light on the general shape of the transition state. They also confirm that substitution almost invariably has an associative rate-determining stage; hence intermediates are rarely detected.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4">(a) The <i>trans</i> effect</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> A strong &#x03C3;-donor ligand or &#x03C0;-acceptor ligand greatly accelerates substitution of a ligand that lies in the <i>trans</i> position in square-planar complexes.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent">The spectator ligands T that are <i>trans</i> to the leaving group in square-planar complexes influence the rate of substitution. This phenomenon is called the rans <b>effect</b>. It is generally accepted that the <i>trans</i> effect arises from two separate influences, one arising in the ground state and the other in the transition state itself.</p>

</aside>
<p class="bh-indent">The trans <b>influence</b> is the extent to which the ligand T weakens the bond <i>trans</i> to itself in the ground state of the complex. The <i>trans</i> influence correlates with the &#x03C3;-donor ability of the ligand T because, broadly speaking, ligands <i>trans</i> to each other use the same orbitals on the metal for bonding. Thus if one ligand is a strong &#x03C3; donor, then the ligand <i>trans</i> to it cannot donate electrons to the metal so well, and thus has a weaker interaction with the metal. The <i>trans</i> influence is assessed quantitatively by measuring bond lengths, stretching frequencies, and metal-to-ligand NMR coupling constants (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>). The <b>transition-state effect</b> correlates with the &#x03C0;-acceptor ability of the ligand. Its origin is thought to be the increase in electron density on the metal atom arising from the incoming ligand: any ligand that can accept this increased electron density will stabilize the transition state (<b>1</b>). The <i>trans</i> effect is the combination of both effects; it should be noted that the same factors contribute to a large ligand-field splitting. <i>Trans</i> effects are listed in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.4">Table 21.4</a> and follow the order:</p>

<p class="bh-indent">The effect is smaller if L is <i>trans</i> to Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.

This behaviour is explained by the formation of an approximately trigonal-bipyramidal transition state with the entering, leaving, and <i>trans</i> groups in the trigonal plane (<b>4</b>).<sup>1</sup> Trigonal-bipyramidal intermediates of this type account for the relatively small influence that the two <i>cis</i> spectator ligands have on the rate of substitution, as their bonding orbitals will be largely unaffected by the course of the reaction.</p>
<p class="bh-footnote"><sup>1</sup> Note that the stereochemistry is quite different from that of p-block central atoms, such as Si(IV) and P(V), where the leaving group departs from the more crowded axial position.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The steric course of the reaction is shown in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.9">Fig. 21.9</a>. We can expect a <i>cis</i> ligand to exchange places with the T ligand in the trigonal plane only if the intermediate lives long <a id="page_559" class="page">page 559, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a>enough to be stereomobile. That is, it must be a long-lived associative (<i>A</i>) intermediate, with release of the ligand from the five-coordinate intermediate being the rate-determining step.</p>

<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(d) Temperature and pressure dependence</b></h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> Negative volumes and entropies of activation support the view that the rate-determining step of square-planar Pt(II) complexes is associative.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Another clue to the nature of the transition state comes from the entropies and volumes of activation for reactions of Pt(II) and Au(III) complexes (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.5">Table 21.5</a>). The entropy of activation is obtained from the temperature dependence of the rate constant, and indicates the change in disorder (of reactants and solvent) when the transition state forms. Likewise, the volume of activation, which is obtained (using special equipment) from the pressure dependence of the rate constant, is the change in volume that occurs on formation of the transition state. The limiting cases for the volume of activation in ligand substitution reactions correspond to the increase in molar volume of the outgoing ligand (for a dissociative reaction) and the decrease in molar volume of the incoming ligand (for an associative reaction). As an example, the molar volume of H<sub>2</sub>O is 18&#x2009;ml (0.018&#x2009;dm<sup>3</sup>) so a reaction in which the transition state was reached by complete dissociation of a H<sub>2</sub>O ligand would have a volume of activation approaching 0.018&#x2009;dm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The two striking aspects of the data in the table are the consistently strongly negative values of both quantities. The simplest explanation of the decrease in disorder and the decrease in volume is that the entering ligand is being incorporated into the transition state without release of the leaving group. That is, we can conclude that the rate-determining step is associative.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4"><b>(e) The first-order pathway</b></h4>

<figure style="margin-left:1em;width:70%;text-align:left"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_909.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The evidence for this two-step mechanism comes from a correlation of the rates of these reactions with the nucleophilicity parameters of the solvent molecules and the observation that reactions of entering groups with solvent complexes are rapid when compared to the step in which the solvent displaces a ligand. Thus, the substitution of a ligand at a square-planar platinum complex results from two competing associative reactions.</p>

<h3 class="bh-h3a" style="margin-top:2em;">Ligand substitution in octahedral complexes</h3>
<p class="bh-noindent">Octahedral complexes occur for different metals in a wide range of oxidation states and with a great diversity of bonding modes. We might therefore expect a huge variety of mechanisms of substitution; however, almost all octahedral complexes react by the interchange (<i>I</i>) mechanism. The only real question is whether the rate-determining step is associative or dissociative. The analysis of rate laws for reactions that take place by such a mechanism helps to formulate the precise conditions for distinguishing these two possibilities and identifying the substitution as <i>I</i><sub>a</sub> (interchange with an associative rate-determining stage) or <i>I</i><sub>d</sub> (interchange with a dissociative rate-determining stage). The difference between the two classes of reaction hinges on whether the rate-determining step is the formation of the new Y&#x2026;M bond or the breaking of the old M&#x2026;X bond.</p>

<h4 class="bh-h4">(b) The effects of spectator ligands</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> In octahedral complexes, spectator ligands affect rates of substitution; the effect is related to the strength of the metal&#x2013;ligand interaction, with stronger donor ligands increasing the reaction rate by stabilizing the transition state.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent"> In Co(III), Cr(III), and related octahedral complexes, both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> ligands affect rates of substitution in proportion to the strength of the bonds they form with the metal atom. For instance, hydrolysis reactions such as</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">are much faster when L is NH<sub>3</sub> than when it is H<sub>2</sub>O. This difference can be explained on the grounds that, as NH<sub>3</sub> is a stronger &#x03C3; donor than H<sub>2</sub>O, it increases the electron density at the metal atom and hence facilitates the scission of the M&#x0064;X bond and the formation of X<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. In the transition state, the stronge
r donor stabilizes the reduced coordination number.</p>
<h4 class="bh-h4">(c) Steric effects</h4>
<p class="bh-noindent"><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Steric crowding favours dissociative activation because formation of the transition state can relieve strain.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Steric effects on reactions with dissociative rate-determining steps can be illustrated by considering the rate of hydrolysis of the first Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ligand in two complexes of the type [CoCl<sub>2</sub>(bn)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>:</p>
<figure style="width:70%;margin-left:1em;text-align:left;"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_math_925.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">The ligand bn is 2,3-butanediamine, and may be coordinated in either a chiral (<b>5</b>) or achiral (<b>6</b>) fashion. The important observation is that the complex formed with the chiral form of the ligand hydrolyses 30 times more slowly than the complex of the achiral form. The two ligands have very similar electronic effects, but the CH<sub>3</sub> groups are on the opposite sides of the chelate ring in (<b>5</b>) but adjacent and crowded in (<b>6</b>). The latter arrangement is more reactive because the strain is relieved in the dissociative transition state with its lowered coordination number. In general, steric crowding favours an <i>I</i><sub>d</sub> process because the five-coordinate transition state can relieve strain.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Quantitative treatments of the steric effects of ligands have been developed using molecular modelling computer software that takes van der Waals interactions into account. However, a more pictorial semiquantitative approach was introduced by C.A. Tolman. In this approach, the extent to which various ligands (especially phosphines) crowd each other is assessed by approximating the ligand by a cone with an angle determined from a space-filling model and, for phosphine ligands, an M&#x0064;P bond length of 228&#x2009;pm (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.12">Fig. 21.12</a> and <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.7">Table 21.7</a>).<sup>2</sup> The ligand CO is small in the sense of having a small cone angle; P(<sup><i>t</i></sup>Bu)<sub>3</sub> is regarded as bulky because it has a large cone angle. Bulky ligands have considerable steric repulsion with each other when packed around a metal centre. They favour dissociative activation and inhibit associative activation.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">As an illustration, the rate of the reaction of [Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>)(SiCl<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>7</b>) with Y to give [Ru(CO)<sub>2</sub>Y(PR<sub>3</sub>)(SiCl<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] is independent of the identity of Y, which suggests that the rate-determining step is dissociative. Furthermore, it has been found that there is only a small variation in rate for the substituents Y with similar cone angles but significantly different values of p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>. This observation supports the assignment of the rate changes to steric effects because changes in p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> should correlate with changes in electron distributions in the ligands.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">One factor that has a strong bearing on the activation of complexes is the difference between the ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE, <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>) of the reacting complex and that of the transition state (the LFSE<sup>&#x2021;</sup>). This difference is known as the <b>ligand field activation energy</b> (LFAE):</p>

Thus, we can begin to see why Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and V<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> complexes are not very labile: they have large activation energies which arise, in part, from a significant loss of LFSE on moving from an octahedral complex to a transition state.</p>

A negative volume of activation can be interpreted as the result of shrinkage when an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule becomes part of the transition state (implying significant associative character), whereas a <a id="page_565" class="page">page 565, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a>positive volume of activation can be interpreted as the result of expansion when an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule leaves to form the transition state (implying significant dissociative character).<sup>3</sup> We see that &#x0394;<sup>&#x2021;</sup><i>V</i> becomes more positive, from &#x2212;4.1&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup>&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for V<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to &#x002B;7.2&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup>&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, corresponding to a decrease in associative character across the 3d series. In part, this arises because of the decrease in ionic radius as the first row is traversed and in part from the increase in the number of nonbonding d electrons from d<sup>3</sup> to d<sup>8</sup> across the 3d series: associative activation needs the metal centre to be accessible to nucleophilic attack, either by being large or having a low (nonbonding or &#x03C0;&#x002A;) d-electron population (so that incoming lone pairs can be donated into these orbitals). Negative volumes of activation are also observed for the larger 4d and 5d ions, such as for Rh(III), and indicate an associative interaction of the entering group in the transition state of the reaction.</p>

In contrast to the strong dependence of the hexaaqua complex, the pentaammine complex shows only a weak dependence on the identity of the nucleophile, suggesting a transition from <i>I</i><sub>a</sub> to <i>I</i><sub>d</sub>.

<p class="bh-boxpara" style="margin-top:0.5em;"><i><b>Answer</b></i> We need to consider the factors that might affect the rate of the reaction. All three ligands are singly charged anions of similar size, so we can expect the encounter equilibrium constants to be similar. Therefore, the second-order rate constants are proportional to first-order rate constants for substitution in the encounter complex. The second-order rate constant is equal to <i>K<sub>E</sub> <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>, where <i>K</i><sub>E</sub> is the pre-equilibrium constant and <i>k</i><sub>2</sub></i> is the first-order rate constant for substitution of the encounter complex.

For instance, whereas the replacement of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> by OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is fast, the replacement of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> by F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is slow, even though F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> resembles OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> more closely in terms of size and nucleophilicity. There is a considerable body of indirect evidence relating to the problem, but one elegant experiment makes the essential point. This conclusive evidence comes from a study of the <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O isotope distribution in the product [Co(OH)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. It is known that the <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratio differs between H<sub>2</sub>O and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> at equilibrium, and this fact can be used to establish whether the incoming group is H<sub>2</sub>O or OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O isotope ratio in the cobalt product matches that for H<sub>2</sub>O, not that for the OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions, proving that it is an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule that is the entering group.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The mechanism that takes these observations into account supposes that the role of OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is to act as a Br&#x00F8;nsted base, not an entering group:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">In the first step, a coordinated NH<sub>3</sub> ligand acts as a Br&#x00F8;nsted acid and a rapid equilibrium is established between the starting complex and its conjugate base which contains an amido <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>N</mi><msubsup><mi>H</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> ligand. The deprotonated form of the complex has a lower charge and it will be able to lose a Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion more readily than the protonated form, thus accelerating the reaction.

<p class="bh-noindent"><span class="bh-red">Key points:</span> Isomerization of a complex can take place by mechanisms that involve substitution, bond cleavage, and reformation, or twisting.</p>
<p class="bh-noindent">Isomerization reactions are closely related to substitution reactions; indeed, a major pathway for isomerization is often via substitution. The square-planar Pt(II) and octahedral Co(III) complexes we have discussed can form five-coordinate trigonal-bipyramidal transition states. The interchange of the axial and equatorial ligands in a trigonal-bipyramidal complex can be pictured as occurring by a Berry pseudorotation through a square-pyramidal conformation (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.9">Section 7.9</a> and <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.14">Fig. 21.14</a>). As we have seen, when a trigonal-bipyramidal complex adds a ligand to produce a six-coordinate complex, a new direction of attack of the entering group can result in isomerization.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">If a chelate ligand is present, isomerization can occur as a consequence of metal&#x2013;ligand bond breaking, and substitution need not occur. An example is the exchange of the &#x2018;outer&#x2019; CD<sub>3</sub> group with the &#x2018;inner&#x2019; CH<sub>3</sub> group during the isomerization of a substituted tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt(III) complex, (<b>11</b>)&#x2009;&#x2192;&#x2009;(<b>12</b>). An octahedral complex can also undergo isomerization by an intramolecular twist without loss of a ligand or breaking of a bond. There is evidence, for example, that racemization of [Ni(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> occurs by such an internal twist. Two possible paths are the <b>Bailar twist</b> and the <b>Ray</b>&#x2013;<b>Dutt twist</b> (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.15">Fig. 21.15</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">As remarked in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, redox reactions can occur by the direct transfer of electrons (as in some electrochemical cells and in many solution reactions) or by the transfer of atoms and ions (as in the transfer of O atoms in reactions of oxidoanions).

In an inner-sphere mechanism, the coordination spheres of the reactants share a ligand transitorily and form a bridged transition state.

In an outer-sphere mechanism, the complexes come into contact without sharing a bridging ligand and the electron tunnels from one metal atom to the other.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The mechanisms of some redox reactions have been definitively assigned as inner- or outer-sphere. However, the mechanisms of a vast number of reactions are unknown because it is difficult to make unambiguous assignments when complexes are labile. Much of the study of well-defined examples is directed towards the identification of the parameters that differentiate the two paths, with the aim of being able to make correct assignments in more difficult cases.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent"><b><span class="bh-red">Key point:</span> The rate-determining step of an inner-sphere redox reaction may be any one of the component processes, but a common one is electron transfer.</b></p>
<p class="bh-noindent">The inner-sphere mechanism was first confirmed for the reduction of the nonlabile complex [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> by labile Cr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(aq). The products of the reaction included both labile Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(aq) and nonlabile [CrCl(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, and addition of <sup>36</sup>Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to the solution did not lead to the incorporation of any of the isotope into the Cr(III) product. The electron-transfer step is much faster than reactions that remove Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> from nonlabile Co(III) or introduce Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> into the nonlabile [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> complex. These observations suggested that Cl moves directly from the coordination sphere of one complex to that of the other during the reaction. Since the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> attached to nonlabile Co(III) can easily enter into the labile coordination sphere of [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to produce the bridged complex (<b>13</b>), it was suggested that this type of complex was an intermediate in the reaction.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Inner-sphere reactions, though involving more steps than outer-sphere reactions, can be fast. <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.16">Figure 21.16</a> summarizes the steps necessary for such a reaction to occur. The first two steps of an inner-sphere reaction are the formation of a precursor complex and the formation of the bridged binuclear intermediate. The first step is identical to the first step in the Eigen&#x2013;Wilkins mechanism (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#sec_21.5">Section 21.5</a>). The final steps are electron transfer through the bridging ligand to give the successor complex, followed by dissociation to give the products.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The rate-determining step of the overall reaction may be any one of these processes, but the most common one is the electron-transfer step. However, if both metal ions have a nonlabile electron configuration after electron transfer, then the break-up of the bridged complex is rate determining. An example is the reduction of [RuCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> by [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, in which the rate-determining step is the dissociation of the Cl-bridged complex [Ru<sup>II</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(&#x03BC;-Cl)Cr<sup>III</sup>(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>. Reactions in which the formation of the bridged complex is rate determining tend to have similar rate constants for a series of partners of a given species. For example, the oxidation of V<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(aq) has similar rate constants for a long series of Co(III) oxidants with different bridging ligands. The explanation is that the rate-determining step is the substitution of an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule from the coordination sphere of V(II), which is quite slow (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.8">Table 21.8</a>).</p>

<p class="bh-indent" style="margin-top:1em;">The numerous reactions in which electron transfer is rate determining do not display such simple regularities. Rates vary over a wide range, as metal ions and bridging ligands are varied.<sup>4</sup> The data in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.11">Table 21.11</a> show some typical variations as bridging ligand, oxidizing metal, and reducing metal are changed.</p>

<p class="bh-indent">There is no difficulty in assigning an inner-sphere mechanism when the reaction involves ligand transfer from an initially nonlabile reactant to a nonlabile product. With more labile complexes, an inner-sphere mechanism should always be considered likely when ligand transfer occurs as well as electron transfer, and if good bridging groups such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>Cl</mtext></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msup><mrow><mtext>Br</mtext></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msup><mtext>I</mtext><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msubsup><mtext>N</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msup><mrow><mtext>CN</mtext></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msup><mrow><mtext>SCN</mtext></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> pyrazine (<b>15</b>), 4,4&#x2032;-bipyridine (<b>16</b>), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (<b>17</b>) are present. Although all these ligands have lone pairs to form the bridge, this may not be an essential requirement. For instance, just as the carbon atom of a methyl group can act as a bridge between OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in the hydrolysis of iodomethane, so it can act as a bridge between Cr(II) and Co(III) in the reduction of methylcobalt species by Cr(II).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The oxidation of a metal centre by oxidoanions is also an example of an inner-sphere process, and is important in some enzymes (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.12">Section 26.12</a>). For example, in the oxidation of Mo(IV) by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> ions, an O atom of the nitrate ion binds to the Mo atom, facilitating the electron transfer from Mo to N, and then remains bound to the Mo(VI) product:</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">Self-exchange reactions can be studied over a wide dynamic range with techniques ranging from isotopic labelling to NMR, with EPR being useful for even faster reactions. The rate constant of the Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>/Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> reaction is about 1&#x2009;dm<sup>3</sup>&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2009;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 25&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">To set up a scheme for the mechanism, we suppose that Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> come together to form a weak outer-sphere complex (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.17">Fig. 21.17</a>). We need to consider, by assuming that the overlap of their respective acceptor and donor orbitals is sufficient to give a reasonable tunnelling probability,<sup>5</sup> how rapidly an electron transfers between the two metal ions. To explore this problem, we invoke the Franck&#x2013;Condon principle, introduced originally to account for the vibrational structure of electronic transitions in spectroscopy, which states that electronic transitions are so fast that they take place in a stationary nuclear framework. In <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.18">Fig. 21.18</a> the nuclear motions associated with the &#x2018;reactant&#x2019; Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and its &#x2018;conjugate product&#x2019; Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> are represented as displacements along a reaction coordinate. If [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> lies at its energy minimum, then an instantaneous electron transfer would give a compressed state of [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Likewise, the removal of an electron from Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> at its energy minimum would give an expanded state of [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. The only instant at which the electron can transfer within the precursor complex is when both [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> have achieved the same nuclear configuration by thermally induced fluctuations. That configuration corresponds to the point of intersection of the two curves, and the energy required to reach this position is the Gibbs energy of activation, &#x0394;<sup>&#x2021;</sup><i>G</i>. If [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> differ in their nuclear configurations, &#x0394;<sup>&#x2021;</sup><i>G</i> is larger and electron exchange is slower. The rate of electron transfer across the encounter complex is expressed quantitatively by the equation</p>

<p class="bh-noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">where &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x29B5;</sup> is the standard reaction Gibbs energy (obtained from the difference in standard potentials of the redox partners) and <i>&#x03BB;</i> is the reorganization energy, the energy required to move all the nuclei associated with the reactant to the positions they adopt in the product but without transferring the electron. This energy depends on the changes in metal&#x2013;ligand bond lengths (the so-called <i>inner-sphere reorganization energy</i>) and alterations in solvent polarization, principally the orientation of the solvent molecules around the complex (the <i>outer-sphere reorganization energy</i>).</p>
<p class="bh-indent">The pre-exponential factor in eqn 21.14 has two components, the nuclear frequency factor <i>&#x03BD;</i><sub>N</sub> and the electronic factor <i>&#x03BA;</i><sub>e</sub>. The former is the frequency at which the two complexes, having already encountered each other in the solution, attain the transition state. The electronic factor gives the probability on a scale from 0 to 1 that an electron will transfer when the transition state is reached; its precise value depends on the extent of overlap of the donor and acceptor orbitals, and it increases as orbital overlap improves.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">A small reorganization energy and a value of <i>&#x03BA;</i><sub>e</sub> close to 1 correspond to a redox couple capable of fast electron self-exchange. The first requirement is achieved if the transferred electron is removed from or added to a nonbonding orbital, as the change in metal&#x2013;ligand bond length is then minimized. It is also likely if the metal ion is shielded from the solvent, in the sense of it being sterically difficult for solvent molecules to approach close to the metal ion, because the polarization of the solvent is normally a major component of the reorganization energy. Simple metal ions such as aqua species typically have <i>&#x03BB;</i> well in excess of 1&#x2009;eV, whereas buried redox centres in enzymes, which are very well shielded from the solvent, can have values as low as 0.25&#x2009;eV.</p>

<p class="bh-footnote"><sup>5</sup> Tunnelling refers to a process where, according to classical physics, the electrons do not have suffi cient energy to overcome the barrier but penetrate into or through it.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">For a self-exchange reaction, &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x29B5;</sup>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0 and therefore, from eqn 21.15, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mo>&#x2021;</mo></msup><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mi>l</mi></mrow></math> and the rate of electron transfer is controlled by the reorganization energy (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.19">Fig. 21.19a</a>). To a considerable extent, the rates of self-exchange can be interpreted in terms of the types <a id="page_572" class="page">page 572, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a>of orbitals involved in the transfer (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#tab21.12">Table 21.12</a>). In the [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;/2&#x002B;</sup> self-exchange reaction, an electron is transferred between antibonding &#x03C3;&#x002A; orbitals, and the consequent extensive change in metal&#x2013;ligand bond lengths results in a large inner-sphere reorganization energy and therefore a slow reaction. The [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;/2&#x002B;</sup> couple has an even greater reorganization energy because two electrons are moved into the &#x03C3;&#x002A; orbital as rearrangement occurs and the reaction is even slower. With the other hexaaqua and hexaammine complexes in the table, the electron is transferred between weakly antibonding or nonbonding &#x03C0; orbitals, the inner-sphere reorganization is less extensive, and the reactions are faster. The bulky, hydrophobic chelating ligand bipyridyl acts as a solvent shield, thus decreasing the outer-sphere reorganization energy.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Bipyridyl and other &#x03C0;-acceptor ligands allow electrons in an orbital with &#x03C0; symmetry on the metal ion to delocalize on to the ligand. This delocalization effectively lowers the reorganization energy when the electron is transferred between &#x03C0; orbitals, as occurs with Fe and Ru, where the electron transfer is between t<sub>2&#x2009;g</sub> orbitals (which, as explained in <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.2">Section 20.2</a>, can participate in &#x03C0; bonding), but not with Ni, where the electron transfer is between e<sub>g</sub> orbitals. Delocalization can also increase the electronic factor.</p>

Photosystems are complex proteins containing light-excitable pigments such as chlorophyll and a chain of redox centres having low reorganization energies. In this chain, one highly exergonic recombination of the photoelectron with oxidized chlorophyll is sufficiently retarded (to 30&#x2009;ns) to allow the electron to escape (in 200&#x2009;ps) and proceed down the photosynthetic electron-transport chain, ultimately to produce reduced carbon compounds (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>). The theoretical dependence of the reaction rate of a reaction on the standard Gibbs energy is plotted in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.20">Fig. 21.20</a>, and <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.21">Fig. 21.21</a> shows the observed variation of reaction rate with &#x0394;<sub>r</sub><i>G</i><sup>&#x29B5;</sup> for the iridium complex (<b>20</b>). The results plotted in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.21">Fig.21.21</a> represent the first unambiguous experimental observation of an inverted region for a synthetic complex. Practically, intramolecular electron-transfer reactions are more straightforward to study because the rate will not be limited by diffusion.</p>

<p class="bh-noindent">The absorption of a photon of ultraviolet radiation or visible light increases the energy of a complex by between 170 and 600&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Because these energies are larger than typical activation energies, it should not be surprising that new reaction channels are opened.

<p class="bh-noindent">There are two main types of spectroscopically observable electron promotion in d-metal complexes, namely d&#x2014;d transitions and charge-transfer transitions (Sections 20.4 and 20.5). A d&#x2014;d transition corresponds to the essentially angular redistribution of electrons within a d shell. In octahedral complexes, this redistribution often corresponds to the occupation of M&#x0064;L antibonding e<sub>g</sub> orbitals. An example is the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mtext>4</mtext></msup><msub><mtext>T</mtext><mrow><mtext>1g</mtext></mrow></msub><msup><mo>&#x2190;</mo><mtext>4</mtext></msup><msub><mtext>A</mtext><mrow><mtext>2g</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy='false'>(</mo><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msubsup><mtext>e</mtext><mtext>g</mtext><mn>1</mn></msubsup><mo>&#x2190;</mo><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy='false'>)</mo></mrow></math> transition in [Cr(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. The occupation of the antibonding e<sub>g</sub> orbital results in a quantum yield close to 1 (specifically 0.6) for the photosubstitution</p>

</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">This is a prompt reaction, occurring in less than 5&#x2009;ps.</p>
<p class="bh-indent">Charge-transfer transitions correspond to the <i>radial</i> redistribution of electron density. They correspond to the promotion of electrons into predominantly ligand orbitals if the transition is metal-to-ligand or into orbitals of predominantly metal character if the transition is ligand-to-metal. The former process corresponds to oxidation of the metal centre and the latter to its reduction. These excitations commonly initiate photoredox reactions of the kind already mentioned in connection with Co(III) and Ru(II).</p>
<p><a id="page_575" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 575, Coordination chemistry: reactions of complexes</a></p>
<p class="bh-indent">Although a useful first approximation is to associate photosubstitution and photo-isomerization with d&#x2013;d transitions and photoredox with charge-transfer transitions, the rule is not absolute. For example, it is not uncommon for a charge-transfer transition to result in photosubstitution by an indirect path:</p>
<figure style="width:70%;margin-left:1em;text-align:left;">

</figure>
<p class="bh-noindent">In this case, the aqua complex formed after the homolytic fission of the Co&#x0064;Cl bond is reoxidized by the Cl atom. The net result leaves the Co substituted. Conversely, some excited states show no differences in substitutional reactivity compared with the ground state: the long-lived excited <sup>2</sup>E state of [Cr(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> results from a pure d&#x0064;d transition and its lifetime of several microseconds allows the excess energy to enhance its redox reactions. The standard potential (&#x002B;1.3&#x2009;V), calculated by adding the excitation energy to the ground-state value, accounts for its function as a good oxidizing agent, in which it undergoes reduction to [Cr(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

<p class="bh-boxpara">Commercial solar cells that convert sunlight to electricity are mainly based on silicon, though systems based on semiconducting oxides such as TiO<sub>2</sub> are also being developed. The harvesting of sunlight generally involves the excitation of an electron in the semiconductor from a valence band to a conduction band; the energy difference between these two bands controls the wavelengths of sunlight that can be converted to electricity. In pure TiO<sub>2</sub> the band gap is large (&#x003E;3&#x2009;eV) so only UV light can be harvested directly in this material, leading to low conversion efficiencies of only a few per cent. However, through the use of dyes that absorb visible light, the proportion of sunlight that can be harvested increases significantly. Cells which combine TiO<sub>2</sub> with dyes, known as Gratzel cells or dye solar cells (DSCs), have demonstrated efficiencies for light-to-electricity conversion of around 11&#x0025;. The key to this increased efficiency is the dye, and those most commonly used are based on ruthenium(II).</p>

<p class="bh-boxparai">Complexes such as compound <b>S1</b> (known as an N-3 dye) exhibit ligand-centred charge transfer (LCCT) transitions (&#x03C0;&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;&#x03C0;&#x002A;) as well as metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions (4d&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;&#x03C0;&#x002A;). These transitions give rise to strong light absorption between 400 and 600&#x2009;nm (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_B21.1">Fig B21.1</a>). In the Gratzel cell, sunlight is absorbed by a monomolecular layer of a dye coated onto a thin film of nanocrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub>. This photon promotes an electron from the Ru<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-based ground state to an excited state (Ru<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>)&#x002A;. The excited electron is then transferred, within a picosecond, into the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This leads to an effective charge separation, with the electron in the TiO<sub>2</sub> and a positive charge on surface-adsorbed Ru<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> dye molecule. The Ru<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> species is then reduced within nanoseconds by iodide (I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) present in the electrolyte system of the cell. The electron injected into TiO<sub>2</sub> diffuses to a conductive surface for current collection and the generation of electricity.</p>
<p class="bh-boxparai">The effectiveness of the light conversion in DSCs depends on the kinetics of the various processes. The electron transfer to the TiO<sub>2</sub> conduction band from the excited state of the ruthenium dye is much faster than electronic relaxation processes back to the ground state or chemical side reactions. Moreover, the reduction of the oxidized dye (Ru<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) by I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is significantly faster than the direct recombination reaction between the injected electron and Ru<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

The HOMO&#x0064;LUMO pattern indicates that excitation populates a bonding orbital between the two metal atoms (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.23">Fig. 21.23</a>). The lowest-lying excited state has a lifetime of 9&#x2009;&#x00B5;s and is a powerful reducing agent, reacting by both electron and halogen-atom transfer. The most interesting oxidation products contain single Pt(III)&#x0064;Pt(III) bonds with X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ligands at both ends (the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is a halide or pseudohalide and was previously present in solution).

<p class="bh-noindent" style="text-align:left;width:70%;">derive the rate law for the formation of the chelate. Discuss the step that is different from that for two monodentate ligands. The formation of chelates with strongly bound ligands occurs at the rate of formation of the analogous monodentate complex, but the formation of chelates of weakly bound ligands is often significantly slower. Assuming an <i>I</i><sub>d</sub> mechanism, explain this observation. (See R.G. Wilkins, <i>Acc. Chem. Res</i>., 1970, <b>3</b>, 408.)</p>

In the absence of excess ligand the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum in the hydride region exhibits a doublet of triplets. As excess PEt<sub>3</sub> ligand is added the hydride signal begins to change, the line shape depending on the ligand concentration.
