<p class="av-noindentd"><b>Organometallic chemistry is the chemistry of compounds containing metal&#x2013;carbon bonds. Much of the basic organometallic chemistry of the s- and p-block metals was understood by the early part of the twentieth century, and has been discussed in <a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapters 11</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter16.xhtml">16</a>. The organometallic chemistry of the d and f blocks has been developed much more recently. Since the mid-1950s this field has grown into a thriving area that spans new types of reactions, unusual structures, and practical applications in organic synthesis and industrial catalysis. We discuss the organometallic chemistry of the d and f blocks separately, covering d metals in this chapter and f metals in the next. The widespread use of organometallic compounds in synthesis is covered in <a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> (catalytic processes).</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">A few d-block organometallic compounds were synthesized and partially character-ized in the nineteenth century. The first of them (1), an ethene complex of platinum(II), was prepared by W.C. Zeise in 1827, with the first metal carbonyls, [PtCl<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>] and [PtCl<sub>2</sub>(CO)]<sub>2</sub>, being reported by P. Sch&#x00FC;tzenberger in 1868. The next major discovery was tetracarbonylnickel (2), which was synthesized by L. Mond, C. Langer, and F. Quinke in 1890. Beginning in the 1930s, W. Hieber synthesized a wide variety of metal carbonyl cluster compounds, many of which are anionic, including [Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)13]<sub>2&#x2212;</sub> (3). It was clear from this work that metal carbonyl chemistry was potentially a very rich field. However, as the structures of these and other d- and f-block organometallic compounds are difficult or impossible to deduce by chemical means alone, fundamental advances had to await the development of X-ray diffraction for precise structural data on solid samples, and of IR and NMR spectroscopy for structural information in solution. The discovery of the remarkably stable organometallic compound ferrocene, [Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (4), occurred at a time (in 1951) when these techniques were becoming widely available. The &#x2018;sandwich&#x2019; struc-ture of ferrocene was soon correctly inferred from its IR spectrum and then determined in detail by X-ray crystallography.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The stability, structure, and bonding of ferrocene defied the classical Lewis description and therefore captured the imagination of chemists. This puzzle in turn set off a train of synthesizing, characterizing, and theorizing that led to the rapid development of d-block organometallic chemistry. Two highly productive research workers in the formative stage of the subject, Ernst-Otto Fischer in Munich and Geoffrey Wilkinson in London, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973 for their contributions. Similarly, f-block organometallic chemistry blossomed soon after the discovery in the late 1970s that the pentamethylcyclo&#x2013;pentadienyl ligand, C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5<sup>&#x2212;</sup></sub>, forms stable f-block compounds (5).

<p class="av-indent">We adhere to the convention that an organometallic compound contains at least one metal&#x2013;carbon (M&#x2013;C) bond. Thus, compounds (1) to (5) clearly qualify as organometallic, <a id="page_580" class="page">page 580, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>whereas a complex such as [Co(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, which contains carbon but has no M&#x0064;C bonds, does not. Cyano complexes, such as hexacyanidoferrate(II) ions, do have M&#x0064;C bonds, but as their properties are more akin to those of conventional coordination complexes they are generally not considered as organometallic. In contrast, complexes of the isoelectronic ligand CO are considered to be organometallic. The justification for this somewhat arbitrary distinction is that many metal carbonyls are significantly different from coordination complexes, both chemically and physically.</p>

<p class="av-indent">In general, the distinctions between the two classes of compounds are clear: coordination complexes normally are charged, with variable d-electron count, and are soluble in water; organometallic compounds are often neutral, with fixed d-electron count, and are soluble in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. Most organometallic compounds have properties that are much closer to organic compounds than inorganic salts, with many of them having low melting points (some are liquid at room temperature).</p>

<p class="av-noindent">Although there are many organometallic compounds of the s and p blocks, the bonding in these compounds is often relatively simple and normally adequately described solely by &#x03C3; bonds. The d metals, in contrast, form a large number of organometallic compounds with many different bonding modes. For instance, to describe fully the bonding of a cyclopentadienyl group to iron in ferrocene (and in general to any d metal), we need to invoke &#x03C3;, &#x03C0;, and &#x03B4; bonds.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Unlike coordination compounds, d-metal organometallic compounds normally have relatively few stable electron configurations and often have a total of 16 or 18 valence electrons around the metal atom. This restriction to a limited number of electronic configurations is due to the strength of the &#x03C0; (and &#x03B4;, where appropriate) bonding interactions between the metal atom and the carbon-containing ligands.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">22.1 <b>Stable electron configurations</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">We start by examining the bonding patterns so that we can appreciate the importance of &#x03C0; bonds and understand the origin of the restriction of the d-metal organometallic compounds to certain electron configurations.</p>

<p class="av-noindent">In the 1920s, N.V. Sidgwick recognized that the metal atom in a simple metal carbonyl, such as [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] (<b>2</b>), has the same valence electron count (18) as the noble gas that terminates the long period to which the metal belongs. Sidgwick coined the term &#x2018;inert gas <a id="page_581" class="page">page 581, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>rule&#x2019; for this indication of stability, but it is now usually referred to as the <b>18<i>-</i>electron rule</b>.<a href="#ftn1" id="ft1"><sup>1</sup></a> It becomes readily apparent, however, that the 18-electron rule is not as uniformly obeyed for d-block organometallic compounds as the octet rule is obeyed for compounds of Period 2 elements, and we need to look more closely at the bonding to establish the reasons for the stability of both the compounds that have the 18-electron configurations and those that do not.</p>

</aside>

<p class="av-indent"><a href="#fig_22.1 ">Figure 22.1</a> shows the energy levels that arise when a strong-field ligand such as carbon monoxide bonds to a d-metal atom (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.2">Section 20.2</a>). Carbon monoxide is a strong-field ligand, even though it is a poor &#x03C3; donor, because it can use its empty &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals to act as a good &#x03C0; acceptor. In this picture of the bonding, the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals of the metal atom are no longer nonbonding, as they would be in the absence of &#x03C0; interactions, but are bonding. The energy-level diagram shows six bonding MOs that result from the ligand&#x2013;metal &#x03C3; interactions, and three bonding MOs that result from &#x03C0; interactions. Thus up to 18 electrons can be accommodated in the nine bonding MOs. Compounds that have this configuration are remarkably stable; for instance, the 18-electron [Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>] is a colourless, air-stable compound. An indication of the size of the HOMO&#x0064;LUMO gap (&#x0394;<sub>O</sub>) can be gained from a consideration of its lack of colour, which results from a lack of any electronic transitions in the visible region of the spectrum; that is, &#x0394;<sub>O</sub> is so large that such transitions are shifted to the UV.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="av-indent">The only way to accommodate more than 18 valence electrons in an octahedral complex with strong-field ligands is to use an antibonding orbital. As a result, such complexes are unstable, being particularly prone to electron loss and acting as reducing agents. Compounds with fewer than 18 electrons will not necessarily be very unstable, but such complexes will find it energetically favourable to acquire extra electrons by reaction and so populate their bonding MOs fully. As we shall see later, compounds with fewer than 18 electrons often occur as intermediates in reaction pathways.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The bonding characteristic of the carbonyl ligand is replicated with other ligands, which are often poor &#x03C3; donors but good &#x03C0; acceptors. Hence, octahedral organometallic compounds are most stable when they have a total of 18 valence electrons around their central metal ion.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Similar arguments can be used to rationalize the stability of the 18-electron configuration for other geometries, such as tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal. The steric requirements of most ligands normally preclude coordination numbers greater than 6 for d-metal organometallic compounds.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4">(b) 16-Electron square-planar compounds</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> With strong-field ligands, a square-planar complex has only eight bonding MOs, so a 16-electron configuration is the most energetically favourable configuration.</b></p>

<p class="av-noindentt">One other geometry already discussed in the context of coordination chemistry is the square-planar arrangement of four ligands (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>), where we noted that it occurred generally for strong-field ligands and a d<sup>8</sup> metal ion. Because organometallic ligands often produce a strong field, many square-planar organometallic compounds exist. Stable square-planar complexes are normally found with a total of 16 valence electrons, which results in the population of all the bonding and none of the antibonding MOs (<a href="#fig_22.2">Fig. 22.2</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">The ligands in square-planar complexes can normally provide only two electrons each, for a total of eight electrons. Therefore, to reach 16 electrons, the metal ion must provide an additional eight electrons. As a result, organometallic compounds with 16 valence electrons are common only on the right of the d block, particularly in Groups 9 and 10 (<a href="#tab_22.1">Table 22.1</a>). Examples of such complexes include [IrCl(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>6</b>) and the anion of Zeise&#x2019;s salt, [Pt(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)Cl<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (<b>1</b>). Square-planar 16-electron complexes are particularly common for the heavier elements in Groups 9 and 10, especially for Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), and Pt(II), because the ligand-field splitting is large and the ligand-field stabilization energy of these complexes favours the square-planar configuration.</p>

<figure class="av-image" style="text-align:left;">
 <img src="../images/table02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="av-indent" style="margin-top:2em;">The preference of a metal atom for one particular geometry and electron count is not normally so strong that other geometries do not occur. For instance, although the chemistry of both Pd(II) and Rh(I) is dominated by 16-electron square-planar complexes, the cyclopentadienyl palladium(II) complex (<b>7</b>) and the rhodium(I) complex (<b>8</b>) are both 18-electron compounds.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Steric factors may restrict the number of ligands that can bond to a metal atom, and stabilize compounds with lower electron counts than might have been expected. For instance, the tricyclohexylphosphine ligands (<b>9</b>) in the trigonal Pt(0) compound [Pt(PCy<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] are so large that only three can be fitted around the metal atom, which consequently has only 16 valence electrons. Steric stabilization of the metal centre is partially a kinetic effect, in which the large groups protect the metal centre from reaction. Many complexes readily lose or gain ligands, forming other configurations transitorily during reactions&#x2014;indeed, the accessibility of these other configurations is precisely why the organometallic chemistry of the d metals is so interesting.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Unusual electron configurations are common on the left of the d block, where the metal atoms have fewer electrons, and it is often not possible to crowd enough ligands around the atom to bring the electron count up to 16 or 18. For example, the simplest carbonyl in Group 5, [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>], is a 17-electron complex. Other examples include [W(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>], which has 12 valence electrons, and [Cr(Cp)(CO)<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)] (<b>10</b>), with 17. The latter compound provides another good example of the role of steric crowding. When the compact CO ligand is present in place of bulky triphenylphosphine, a dimeric compound, (<b>11</b>), with a long but definite Cr&#x0064;Cr bond is observed in the solid state and in solution. The formation of the Cr&#x0064;Cr bond in [Cr(Cp)(CO)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> raises the electron count on each metal to 18.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">22.3 <b>Electron counting and oxidation states</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">The dominance of 16- and 18-electron configurations in organometallic chemistry makes it imperative to be able to count the number of valence electrons on a central metal atom because knowing that number allows us to predict the stabilities of compounds and to suggest patterns of reactivity. Although the concept of &#x2018;oxidation state&#x2019; for organometallic compounds is regarded by many as tenuous at best, the vast majority of the research community uses it as a convenient shorthand for describing electron configurations. Oxidation states (and the corresponding oxidation number) help to systematize reactions such as oxidative addition (<a href="#sec_22.22">Section 22.22</a>), and also bring out analogies between the chemical properties of organometallic and coordination complexes. Fortunately, the business of counting electrons and assigning oxidation numbers can be combined.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Two models are routinely used to count electrons, the so-called <b>neutral<i>-</i>ligand method</b> (sometimes called the <i>covalent method</i>) and the <b>donor<i>-</i>pair method</b> (sometimes known as the <i>ionic method</i>). We introduce both briefly&#x2014;they give identical results for electron counting&#x2014;but in the remainder of the chapter we use the donor-pair method as it may also be used to assign oxidation numbers.</p>

<h4 class="av-h4">(a) Neutral-ligand method</h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> All ligands are treated as neutral and are categorized according to how many electrons they are considered to donate.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">For the sake of counting electrons, each metal atom and ligand is treated as neutral. We include in the count all valence electrons of the metal atom and all the electrons donated by the ligands. If the complex is charged, we simply add or subtract the appropriate number of electrons to the total. Ligands are defined as <b>L type</b> if they are neutral two-electron donors (like CO, PMe<sub>3</sub>) and <b>X type</b> if, when they are considered to be neutral, they are one-electron radical donors (like halogen atoms, H, CH<sub>3</sub>). For example, [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] acquires <a id="page_583" class="page">page 583, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>18 electrons from the 8 valence electrons on the Fe atom and the 10 electrons donated by the five CO ligands.

<p class="av-noindentt">The donor-pair method requires a calculation of the oxidation number. The rules for calculating the oxidation number of an element in an organometallic compound are the same as for conventional coordination compounds. Neutral ligands, such as CO and phosphine, are considered to be two-electron donors and are formally assigned an oxidation number of 0. Ligands such as halogens, H, and CH<sub>3</sub> are formally considered to take an electron from the metal atom, and are treated as halides (e.g. Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>CH</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>(and hence are assigned oxidation number &#x2212;1); in this anionic state they are considered to be two-electron donors.

<p class="av-noindent">According to the recommended convention, we use the same system of nomenclature for organometallic compounds as set out for coordination complexes in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.2">Section 7.2</a>. Thus, ligands are listed in alphabetical order followed by the name of the metal, all of which is written as one word. The name of the metal should be followed by its oxidation number in parentheses. The nomenclature used in research journals, however, does not always obey these rules, and it is common to find the name of the metal buried in the middle of the name of the compound and the oxidation number omitted. For example, (<b>12</b>) is sometimes referred to as benzenemolybdenum-tricarbonyl, rather than the preferred name benzene(tricarbonyl)molybdenum(0).</p>
<p class="av-indent">The IUPAC recommendation for the formula of an organometallic compound is to write it in the same form as for a coordination complex: the symbol for the metal is written first, followed by the ligands, listed in alphabetical order based on their chemical symbol. We shall follow these conventions unless a different order of ligands helps to clarify a particular point.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Often a ligand with carbon-donor atoms can exhibit multiple bonding modes&#x2014;for instance, the cyclopentadienyl group can commonly bond to a d-metal atom in three different ways&#x2014;so we need some additional nomenclature. Without going into the intimate details of the bonding of the various ligands (we do that later in this chapter), the extra information we need to describe a bonding mode is the number of points of attachment. This procedure gives rise to the notion of <b>hapticity</b>, the number of ligand atoms that are considered formally to be bonded to the metal atom. The hapticity is denoted &#x03B7;<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where <i>n</i> is the number of atoms (and &#x03B7; is eta). For example, a CH<sub>3</sub> group attached by a single M&#x0064;C bond is monohapto, &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>, and, if the two C atoms of an ethene ligand are both within bonding distance of the metal, the ligand is dihapto, &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>. Thus, three cyclopentadienyl complexes might be described as having &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup> (<b>13</b>), &#x03B7;<sup>3</sup> (<b>14</b>), or &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup> (<b>15</b>) cyclopentadienyl groups.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Some ligands (including the simplest of them all, the hydride ligand, H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) can bond to more than one metal atom in the same complex, and are then referred to as <b>bridging ligands</b>. We do not require any new concepts to understand bridging ligands other than those introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>. Recall from <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.2">Section 7.2</a> that the Greek letter &#x03BC; (mu) is used to indicate how many atoms the ligand bridges. Thus a &#x03BC;<sub>2</sub>-CO is a carbonyl group that bridges two metal atoms and a &#x03BC;<sub>3</sub>-CO bridges three.</p>

<p class="av-indent">A simple picture of the bonding of CO to a metal atom is to treat the lone pair on the carbon atom as a Lewis &#x03C3; base (an electron-pair donor) and the empty CO antibonding orbital as a Lewis &#x03C0; acid (an electron-pair acceptor), which accepts &#x03C0;-electron density from the filled d orbitals on the metal atom. In this picture, the bonding can be considered to be made up of two parts: a &#x03C3; bond from the ligand to the metal atom (<b>16</b>) and a &#x03C0; bond from the metal atom to the ligand (<b>17</b>). This type of &#x03C0; bonding is sometimes referred to as &#x03C0; <b>backbonding</b>.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Carbon monoxide is not appreciably nucleophilic, which suggests that &#x03C3; bonding to a d-metal atom is weak. As many d-metal carbonyl compounds are very stable, we can infer that &#x03C0; backbonding is strong and the stability of carbonyl complexes arises mainly from the &#x03C0;-acceptor properties of CO. Further evidence for this view comes from the observation that stable carbonyl complexes exist only for metals that have filled d orbitals of an energy suitable for donation to the CO antibonding orbital. For instance, elements in the s and p blocks do not form stable carbonyl complexes. However, the bonding of CO to a d-metal atom is best regarded as a synergistic (that is, mutually enhancing) outcome of both &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; bonding: the &#x03C0; backbonding from the metal to the CO increases the electron density on the CO, which in turn increases the ability of the CO to form a &#x03C3; bond to the metal atom.</p>
<p class="av-indent">A more formal description of the bonding can be derived from the molecular orbital scheme for CO (<a href="#fig_22.3">Fig. 22.3</a>), which shows that the HOMO has &#x03C3; symmetry and is essentially a lobe that projects away from the C atom. When CO acts as a ligand, this 3&#x03C3; orbital serves as a very weak donor to a metal atom, and forms a &#x03C3; bond with the central metal atom. The LUMOs of CO are the antibonding 2&#x03C0; orbitals. These two orbitals play a crucial role because they can overlap with metal d orbitals that have local &#x03C0; symmetry (such as the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals in an <i>O</i><sub>h</sub> complex). The &#x03C0; interaction leads to the delocalization of electrons from filled d orbitals on the metal atom into the empty &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals on the CO ligands, so the ligand also acts as a &#x03C0; acceptor.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="av-indent">One important consequence of this bonding scheme is the effect on the strength of the CO triple bond: the stronger the metal&#x2013;carbon bond becomes through pushing electron density from the metal atom into the 2&#x03C0; orbitals, the weaker the CO bond becomes, as this electron density enters a CO antibonding orbital. In the extreme case, when two electrons are fully donated by the metal atom, a formal metal&#x2013;carbon double bond is formed; because the two electrons occupy a CO antibonding orbital, this donation results in a decrease in the bond order of the CO to 2.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In practice, the bonding is somewhere between M&#x0064;C&#x2261;O, with no backbonding, and M&#x003D;aC&#x003D;aO, with complete backbonding. Infrared spectroscopy is a very convenient method of assessing the extent of &#x03C0; bonding; the CO stretch is clearly identifiable as it is both strong and (normally) clear of all other absorptions. In CO gas, the absorption for the triple bond is at 2143 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, whereas a typical metal carbonyl complex has a stretching mode in the range 2100&#x2013;1700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<a href="#tab_22.3">Table 22.3</a>). The number of IR absorptions that occur in a particular carbonyl compound is discussed in <a href="#sec_22.18">Section 22.18g</a>.</p>


<p class="av-indent">Carbonyl stretching frequencies are often used to determine the order of acceptor or donor strengths for the other ligands present in a complex. The basis of the approach is that the CO stretching frequency is decreased when it serves as a &#x03C0; acceptor. However, as other &#x03C0; acceptors in the same complex compete for the d electrons of the metal atom, they cause the CO frequency to increase. This behaviour is opposite to that observed with donor ligands, which cause the CO stretching frequency to decrease as they supply electrons to the metal atom and hence, indirectly, to the CO &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals. Thus, strong &#x03C3;-donor ligands attached to a metal carbonyl and a formal negative charge on a metal carbonyl anion both result in slightly greater CO bond lengths and significantly lower CO stretching frequencies.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Carbon monoxide is versatile as a ligand because, as well as the bonding mode we have described so far (often referred to as &#x2018;terminal&#x2019;), it can bridge two (<b>18</b>) or three (<b>19</b>) metal atoms. Although the description of the bonding is now more complicated, the concepts of &#x03C3;-donor and &#x03C0;-acceptor ligands remain useful. The CO stretching frequencies generally follow the order MCO&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;M<sub>2</sub>CO&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;M<sub>3</sub>CO, which suggests an increasing occupation of the &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbital as the CO molecule bonds to more metal atoms and more electron density from the metals enters the CO &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals. As a rule of thumb, carbonyls bridging two metal atoms typically have stretching bands in the range 1900&#x2013;1750 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and those that bridge three atoms have stretching bands in the range 1800&#x2013;1600 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<a href="#fig_22.4">Fig. 22.4</a>).

<p class="av-noindentt">Although phosphine complexes are not organometallic because the ligands do not bond to the metal atom through a carbon atom, they are best discussed here as their bonding has many similarities to that of carbon monoxide.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Phosphine, PH<sub>3</sub> (formally, phosphane), is a reactive, noxious, poisonous, and flammable gas (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.10">Section 15.10</a>). Like ammonia, phosphine can behave as a Lewis base and use its lone pair to donate electron density to a Lewis acid, and so act as a ligand. However, given the problems associated with handling phosphine, it is rarely used as a ligand. Substituted phosphines, on the other hand&#x2014;such as trialkylphosphines (for example, PMe<sub>3</sub>, PEt<sub>3</sub>), triarylphosphines (for example, PPh<sub>3</sub>), or trialkyl- or triarylphosphites (for example, P(OMe)<sub>3</sub>, P(OPh)<sub>3</sub>, <b>21</b>), and a whole host of bridged multidentate di- and triphosphines (for example, Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;dppe, <b>22</b>)&#x2014;are easy to handle (indeed some are air-stable, odourless solids with no appreciable toxicity) and are widely used as ligands; all are colloquially referred to as &#x2018;phosphines&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Phosphines have a lone pair on the P atom that is appreciably basic and nucleophilic, and can serve as a &#x03C3; donor. Phosphines also have empty orbitals on the P atom that can overlap with filled d orbitals on 3d-metal ions and behave as &#x03C0; acceptors (<b>23</b>). The bonding of phosphines to a d-metal atom, made up of a &#x03C3; bond from the ligand to the metal and a &#x03C0; bond from the metal back to the ligand, is completely analogous to the bonding of CO to a d-metal atom. Quite which orbitals on the P atom behave as &#x03C0; acceptors has been the subject of considerable debate in the past, with some groups claiming a role for unoccupied 3d orbitals on P and some claiming a role for the P&#x0064;R &#x03C3;&#x002A; orbitals; current consensus favours the &#x03C3;&#x002A; orbitals. In any case, each phosphine provides an additional two electrons to the valence electron count.</p>
<p class="av-indent">As we have remarked, a huge variety of phosphines are both possible and widely available, including chiral systems such as 2,2&#x2032;-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1&#x2032;-binaphthyl (BINAP, <b>24</b>), in which steric constraints result in compounds that can be resolved into diastereomers. Generally there are two properties of phosphine ligands that are considered important in discussions of the reactivity of their complexes: their steric bulk and their electron-donating (and -accepting) ability.</p>

The basicity of a phosphine is not simply related to the strength of the MeP bond in a complex; for instance, an electron-poor metal atom forms a stronger bond with an electron-rich (basic) phosphine, whereas an electron-rich metal atom will form a stronger bond with an electron-poor phosphine.</p>

<p class="av-indent">The vast range of phosphines that are commonly used in organometallic chemistry is a testament to their versatility as ligands: judicious choice allows control over both steric and electronic properties of the metal atom in a complex. Phosphorus-31 (which occurs in 100 per cent natural abundance) is easy to observe by NMR, and both the <sup>31</sup>P chemical shift and the coupling constant to the metal atom (where appropriate) give considerable insight into the bonding and reactivity of a complex.

<h3 class="av-h3">22.7 <b>Hydrides and dihydrogen complexes</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> The bonding of a hydrogen atom to a metal atom is a &#x03C3; interaction, whereas the bonding of a dihydrogen ligand involves &#x03C0; backbonding.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">A hydrogen atom directly bonded to a metal is commonly found in organometallic complexes and is referred to as a <b>hydride ligand</b>. The name &#x2018;hydride&#x2019; can be misleading as it implies a H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ligand. Although the formulation H<sup>&#x2212;</sup> might be appropriate for most hydrides, such as [CoH(PMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>], some hydrides are appreciably acidic and behave as though they contain H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>; for example, [CoH(CO)<sub>4</sub>] is an acid with p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;8.3 (in acetonitrile). The acidity of organometallic carbonyls is described in <a href="#sec_22.18">Section 22.18</a>. In the donor-pair method of electron counting, we consider the hydride ligand to contribute two electrons and to have a single negative charge (that is, to be H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">The bonding of a hydrogen atom to a metal atom is simple because the only orbital of appropriate energy for bonding on the hydrogen is H1s and the M&#x0064;H bond can be considered as a &#x03C3; interaction between the two atoms. Hydrides are readily identified by NMR spectroscopy as their chemical shift is rather unusual, typically occurring in the range &#x2212;50&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;<i>&#x03B4;</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;0. Infrared spectroscopy can also be useful in identifying metal hydrides as they normally have a stretching band in the range 2250&#x2013;1650 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. X-ray diffraction, normally so valuable for identifying the structure of crystalline materials, might not always identify hydrides, as the diffraction is related to electron density and the hydride ligand <a id="page_589" class="page">Page 589, d&#x2013;Metal organometallic chemistry</a>will have at most two electrons around it, compared with, for instance, 78 for a platinum. Neutron diffraction is of more use in locating hydride ligands, especially if the hydrogen atom is replaced by a deuterium atom, because deuterium has a large neutron scattering cross-section.</p>

 <p class="av-indent">An M&#x2013;H bond can sometimes be produced by protonation of an organometallic compound, such as neutral and anionic metal carbonyls (<a href="#sec_22.18">Section 22.18e</a>). For example, ferrocene can be protonated in strong acid to produce an Fe&#x2013;H bond:</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Bridging hydrides exist, where an H atom bridges either two or three metal atoms: here the bonding can be treated in exactly the same way we considered bridging hydrides in diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.11">Section 2.11</a>).</p>
 <p class="av-indent">Although the first organometallic metal hydride was reported in 1931, complexes of hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub>, were identified only in 1984. In such compounds, the dihydrogen molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, bonds side-on to the metal atom (in the older literature, such compounds were sometimes called <i>nonclassical hydrides</i>). The bonding of dihydrogen to the metal atom is considered to be made up of two components: a &#x03C3; donation of the two electrons in the H<sub>2</sub> bond to the metal atom (25) and a &#x03C0; backdonation from the metal to the &#x03C3;* antibonding orbital of H<sub>2</sub> (26). This picture of the bonding raises a number of interesting issues. In particular, as the &#x03C0; backbonding from the metal atom increases, the strength of the H&#x2013;H bond decreases and the structure tends to that of a dihydride:</p>
<figure class="av-images" style="margin-left:1em;text-align:left;width:70%;">
 <img src="../images/589-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">A dihydrogen molecule is treated as a neutral two-electron donor. Thus the transformation of the dihydrogen into two hydrides (each considered to have a single negative charge and to contribute two electrons) requires the formal charge on the metal atom to increase by two. That is, the metal is oxidized by two units and the dihydrogen is reduced. Although it might seem that this oxidation of the metal is just an anomaly thrown up by our method of counting electrons, two of the electrons on the metal atom have been used to backbond to the dihydrogen, and these two electrons are no longer available to the metal atom for further bonding. This transformation of the dihydrogen molecule to a dihydride is an example of <i>oxidative addition</i>, and is discussed more fully later in this chapter (<a href="#sec_22.22">Section 22.22</a>).</p>

<p class="av-indent">It is now recognized that complexes exist with structures at all points between these two extremes, and in some cases an equilibrium can be identified between the two. Work by G. Kubas on tungsten complexes used the H&#x2013;D coupling constant to show that it is possible to detect both the dihydrogen complex (27, <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>HD</sub>&#x003D; 34 Hz) and the dihydride (28, <sup>2</sup><i>J</i><sub>HD</sub>&#x003C; 2 Hz), and to follow the conversion from one to the other. Certain microbes contain enzymes known as <i>hydrogenases </i>that use Fe and Ni at their catalytic centres to catalyse the rapid oxidation of H<sub>2</sub> and reduction of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, via intermediate metal dihydrogen and hydride species (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.14">Section 26.14</a>).</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Alkyl groups are often found as ligands in d&#x2013;metal organometallic chemistry, and their bonding presents no new features: it is best considered a simple covalent &#x03C3; interaction between the metal atom and the carbon atom of the organic fragment.

<p class="av-indent">Alkenyl (29), alkynyl (30), and aryl (31) groups can bond to a metal atom in a similar fashion, binding to the metal atom through a single carbon atom, and hence are described as monohapto (&#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>). Although there is potential for each of these three groups to accept &#x03C0; electron density into antibonding orbitals, there is little evidence that this <a id="page_590" class="page">Page 590, d&#x2013;Metal organometallic chemistry</a>happens. For instance, even though an &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>&#x2013;alkynyl group might be considered analogous to a CO group, the stretching frequency of the triple bond in alkynyl complexes changes little on attachment to a metal.

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key point:</span> The bonding of an alkene oran alkyne to a metal atom is best described as a &#x03C3; interaction from the multiple bond to the metal atom, with a &#x03C0; backbonding interaction from the metal atom to the &#x03C0;* antibonding orbital on the alkene or alkyne.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Alkenes are routinely found bound to metal centres: the first organometallic compound isolated, Zeise<i>&#x0027;</i>s salt (<b>1</b>), was a complex of ethene. Alkenes normally bond side-on to a metal atom with both carbon atoms of the double bond equidistant from the metal with the other groups on the alkene approximately perpendicular to the plane of the metal atom and the two carbon atoms (<b>32</b>). In this arrangement, the electron density of the C&#x003D;C &#x03C0; bond can be donated to an empty orbital on the metal atom to form a &#x03C3; bond. In parallel with this interaction, a filled metal d orbital can donate electron density back to the empty &#x03C0;* orbital of the alkene to form a &#x03C0; bond. This description is called the <b>Dewar&#x2013;Chatt&#x2013;Duncanson model </b>(<a href="#fig_22.5">Fig. 22.5</a>) and &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2013;alkenes are considered to be two-electron neutral ligands.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Electron-donor and -acceptor character appear to be fairly evenly balanced in most ethene complexes of the d metals, but the degree of donation and backdonation can be altered by substituents on the metal atom and on the alkene. When the &#x03C0; backbonding from the metal atom increases, the strength of the C&#x003D;C bond decreases as the electron density is located in the C&#x003D;C antibonding orbital and the structure tends to that of a C&#x2013;C singly bonded structure, a metallocyclopropane:</p>
<figure class="av-image" style="margin-left:1em;text-align:left;">
 <img src="../images/590-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">Dihaptoalkenes with only a small degree of electron donation from the metal have their substituents bent slightly away from the metal atom, and the C&#x003D;C bond length is only slightly greater than in the free alkene (134 pm). When the degree of backdonation is greater, substituents on the alkene are bent away more from the metal atom and the C&#x003D;C bond length approaches that characteristic of a single bond. Steric constraints can also force the other groups on the alkene to bend away from the metal atom.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Alkynes have two &#x03C0; bonds and hence the potential to be four-electron donors. When side-on to a single metal atom, the &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2013;carbon-carbon triple bond is best considered as a two-electron donor, with the &#x03C0;* orbitals accepting electron density from a metal atom in the same way as for alkenes. When strongly electron-withdrawing groups are attached to an alkyne, the ligand can become an excellent &#x03C0; acceptor and displace other ligands such as phosphines; the compound commonly known as dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate, CH<sub>3</sub>OCOC&#x2261;CCO<sub>O</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, is a good example.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Substituted alkynes can form very stable polymetallic complexes in which the alkyne can be regarded as a four-electron donor. An example is &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-diphenylethyne-(hexacarbonyl) dicobalt(O), in which we can view one &#x03C0; bond as donating to one of the Co atoms and the second &#x03C0; bond as overlapping with the other Co atom (<b>33</b>). In this example, the alkyl or aryl groups present on the alkyne impart stability by lowering the tendency towards secondary reactions of the coordinated ethyne, such as loss of the slightly acidic ethynic H atom to the metal atom.</p>

It is simplest to consider them as linked alkenes, and hence they present no new bonding concepts. As with the chelate effect in coordination complexes (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.14">Section 7.14</a>), the resulting polyene complexes are usually more stable than the equivalent complex with individual ligands because the entropy of dissociation of the complex is much smaller than when the liberated ligands can move independently.

Cyclooctatetraene bonds in a number of different ways; the most common mode in d&#x2013;metal chemistry is as an &#x03B7;<sup>4</sup> donor, analogous to butadiene.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The temptation with both butadiene and cyclobutadiene is to treat them like two isolated double bonds. However, a proper molecular orbital approach is necessary to understand the bonding fully because the ligand-metal atom interactions are different in the two cases.</p>
  <p class="av-indent"><a href="#fig_22.6">Figure 22.6</a> shows the molecular orbitals for the &#x03C0; system in butadiene. The two occupied lower energy MOs can behave as donors to the metal, the lowest a &#x03C3; donor and the next a &#x03C0; donor. The next-higher unoccupied MO, the LUMO, can act as a &#x03C0;acceptor from the metal atom. Thus, attachment of a butadiene molecule to a metal atom results in population of an MO that is bonding between the two central C atoms (which are already nominally singly bonded) and antibonding between the nominally doubly bonded C atoms. The resulting modification of electron density results in a shortening of the central C&#x2013;C bond and a lengthening of the double C&#x2013;C bonds; in some complexes the central C&#x2013;C bond is found to be even shorter than the other two C&#x2013;C bonds. In theory, a &#x03B4;&#x2013;bonding interaction is possible between the d<sub>xy</sub> orbital of the metal atom and the most antibonding of the butadiene MOs, but there is no definitive evidence that it occurs. Butadiene is therefore considered to be a four-electron neutral ligand in electron-counting schemes.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Cyclobutadiene is rectangular (<i>D</i><sub>2h</sub>) and unstable as a free molecule, as a result of bond angle constraints and its four-electron anti-aromatic configuration.

If the cyclobutadiene formally accepts two electrons from the metal atom, it will have six &#x03C0; electrons with three MOs occupied and no incentive to distort from square; two of the MOs are degenerate in this configuration. All cyclobutadiene-metal complexes are found to be square, suggesting that a six-electron aromatic configuration more accurately describes the bonding within the carbon ring than a four-electron configuration does. This view of the bonding has led some to regard cyclobutadiene complexes as complexes of the R<sub>4</sub>C<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2013;</sup> dianion (a six-electron donor), although for convenience most treat cyclobutadiene as a four-electron neutral ligand.

bond to a metal atom in an octahapto arrangement, in which it is planar and all C&#x2014;C

<p class="av-noindentt">The allyl ligand, CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;, can bind to a metal atom in either of two configurations.
As an &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-ligand (44) it should be considered just like an &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-alkyl group (that is, as a
two-electron donor with a single negative charge). However, the allyl ligand can also use
its double bond as an additional two-electron donor and act as an &#x03B7;<sup>3</sup>-ligand (45); in this

it becomes apparent why a symmetrical arrangement is the correct description of the

<p class="av-noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">Cyclopentadiene, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is a mildly acidic hydrocarbon that can be deprotonated to form
the cyclopentadienyl anion, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2212;. The stability of the cyclopentadienyl anion can be
understood when it is realized that the six electrons in its &#x03C0; system make it aromatic. The
delocalization of these six electrons results in a ring structure with five equal bond lengths.
As a ligand, the cyclopentadienyl group has played a major role in the development of
organometallic chemistry and continues to be the archetype of cyclic polyene ligands. We
have already alluded to the role ferrocene (4) had in the development of organometallic
chemistry. A huge number of metal cyclopentadienyl and substituted cyclopentadienyl
compounds are known. Some compounds have C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2212; as a monohapto ligand (13), in
which case it is treated like an &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-alkyl group; others contain C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2212; as a trihapto ligand
(14), in which case it is treated like an &#x03B7;<sup>3</sup>-allyl group. Usually, though, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2212; is present as a
pentahapto ligand (15), bound through all five carbons of its ring. Examples of complexes
containing &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>&#x2212; and and &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-cyclopentadienyl groups include (50); (51) is an example of a
complex containing &#x03B7;<sup>3</sup>&#x2212; and &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-cyclopentadienyl groups.</p>
<p class="av-indent">We treat the &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>&#x2013;C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2013;group as a six&#x2013;electron donor. Formally, the electron donation to
the metal now comes from the filled 1&#x03C0; (&#x03C3; bonding) and 2&#x03C0; (&#x03C0; bonding) MOs(<a href="#fig_22.10">Fig. 22.10</a>)

(<a href="#sec_22.19">Section 22.19</a>), coordinated Cp ligands behave as though they maintain their six&#x2013;electron
aromatic structure.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The electronic and steric properties of cyclopentadiene can easily be tuned: electron
withdrawing and donating groups can be attached to the five-membered ring, and steric
bulk can be enhanced by additional substitution. The pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group
(Cp*) is commonly used to provide greater electron density on, and greater steric protection
of, a metal atom. Chiral groups are often added to Cp groups so that complexes
can be used in stereoselective reactions: the neo-menthyl group (52) is commonly used.
The synthesis, properties, and reactivities of compounds containing the cyclopentadienyl
ligand are discussed in more detail in (<a href="#sec_22.19">Section 22.19</a>).</p>

bond; N-heterocyclic carbenes are considered to have a metal&#x2013;carbon single bond, together with &#x03C0;
backbonding.</b></p>
<p class="av-banoindent">Carbene, CH<sub>2</sub> , has only six electrons around its C atom and is consequently highly reactive.
Other substituted carbenes exist and are substantially less reactive and can behave as
ligands towards metals.</p>
<p class="av-indent">In principle, carbenes can exist in one of two electronic configurations: with a linear
arrangement of the two groups bound to the carbon atom and the two remaining electrons
unpaired in two p orbitals (57), or with the two groups bent, the two remaining electrons
paired, and an empty p orbital (58). Carbenes with a linear arrangement of groups are
referred to as &#x2018;triplet carbenes&#x2019; (because the two electrons are unpaired and S = 1) and are
favoured when sterically very bulky groups are attached to the carbene carbon. Carbenes
with the bent arrangement are known as &#x2018;singlet carbenes&#x2019; (the two electrons are paired
and S = 0) and are the normal form for carbenes. The electron pair on the carbon atom
of a singlet carbene is suitable to bond to a metal atom, resulting in a ligand-to-metal
bond. The empty p orbital on the C atom can then accept electron density from the metal
atom, thus stabilizing the electron-poor carbon atom (59). For historical reasons, carbenes
bonded to metal atoms in this fashion are known as Fischer carbenes and are represented
by a metal&#x2013;carbon double bond. Fischer carbenes are electron-deficient at the C atom
and consequently are easily attacked by nucleophiles. When the backbonding to the C
atom is very strong, the carbene can become electron-rich and is thus prone to attack by
electrophiles. Carbenes of this type are known as Schrock carbenes, after their discoverer.
The term alkylidene technically refers only to carbenes with alkyl substituents (CR<sub>2</sub>), but
is sometimes used to mean both Fischer and Schrock carbenes.</p>
<p class="av-indent">More recently, a large number of derivatives of what are known as N-heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs) have been used as ligands. In most NHCs, two nitrogen atoms are adjacent
to the carbene carbon atom, and if the lone pair on the nitrogen is considered to be largely
p-orbital based, then strong &#x03C0;-donor interactions from the two nitrogen atoms can help to
stabilize the carbene (60). Tying the carbene C atom and the two N atoms into a ring helps
to stabilize the carbene, and five-membered rings are common (61). Additional stability
can be achieved by a double bond in the ring, which provides an additional two electrons
that may be considered part of a six-electron aromatic resonance structure (62). NHC
ligands are considered to be two-electron &#x03C3; donors and initial descriptions of the bonding
suggested only minimal &#x03C0; backbonding from the metal atom. However, the current view is
that there is actually significant &#x03C0; backbonding from the metal atom to the NHC.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Highly reactive metal intermediates can be generated by photolysis and, in the absence of
any other ligands, alkanes and noble gases have been observed to coordinate to the metal
atom. Such species were first identified in the 1970s in solid methane and noble-gas matrices,
and were initially regarded as mere curiosities. However, both species have recently
been fully characterized in solution and are now accepted as important intermediates in
some reactions.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Alkanes are considered to donate electron density from a C&#x2013;H &#x03C3; bond to the metal

&#x03C3;<sup>*</sup> orbital (64), just like dihydrogen (<a href="#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>). Although most alkane complexes are
short-lived, with the alkane being readily displaced, in 1998 the cyclopentane complex
(65) became the first alkane complex to be unambiguously identified in solution by NMR;
in 2009 a complex of the simplest hydrocarbon, methane, was characterized by NMR
(66), and in 2012 a crystal structure of an alkane complex was reported.</p>

are thought to have additional stability because of the chelate effect (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.14">Section 7.14</a>). Many
examples of compounds with agostic interactions are now known; an example is (67).
Though weakly bonding, each C&#x2013;H to metal-atom interaction, whether it be agostic or
not, is considered formally to donate two electrons to the metal.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Unlikely as it might seem, noble gas atoms can behave as ligands towards metal centres,
and a number of complexes of Kr and Xe have been identified by IR spectroscopy, with the
relatively long-lived Xe complex (68) characterized in solution by NMR in 2005. These
complexes are stable only in the absence of better ligands (such as alkanes). The noble gas

<h3 class="av-h3">22.17 Dinitrogen and nitrogen monoxide</h3>
<p class="av-figcap"><span class="av-red"><b>Key points:</b></span> <b>The bonding of dinitrogen to a metal atom is weak but contains both a &#x03C3;-donating and a &#x03C0;-accepting component; nitrogen monoxide can bind to a metal in two different ways, either bent or straight.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Neither dinitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, nor nitrogen monoxide, NO, is strictly an organometallic ligand,
although they are sometimes found in organometallic compounds. Dinitrogen is a muchsought-
after ligand, as complexes can potentially take part in a catalytic reduction of
nitrogen to more useful species. Dinitrogen can bind to metals in a number of different
ways. The majority of complexes have a terminal monohapto link, &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-N<sub>2</sub>, in which the
bonding can be considered to be like that of the isoelectronic CO ligand (69). Dinitrogen
is both a weaker &#x03C3; donor and a weaker &#x03C0; acceptor than CO, and hence is bound less
strongly; in fact only good &#x03C0;-donor metal atoms bind N<sub>2</sub> . Like CO, the N<sub>2</sub> ligand has a
distinctive IR stretching band lying in the range 2150&#x2013;1900 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> .</p>
<p class="av-indent">A dinitrogen molecule can participate in two bonding interactions and bridge two metal
atoms (70). If the backdonation to the nitrogen is extensive in this kind of complex, it can
formally be considered to have been reduced to a hydrazine (71). Occasionally, dinitrogen
ligands are found bound in a dihapto (&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>) side-on fashion (72). In these complexes the
ligand is best considered analogous to an &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-alkyne. The side-on bonding mode seems to
be particularly common in complexes of the f metals (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide) is a radical with 11 valence electrons. When bound,
NO is referred to as the nitrosyl ligand and can bond in one of two modes to d-metal
atoms, in either a bent or a linear fashion. In the linear arrangement (73), the ligand is
considered to be the NO + cation. The NO + cation is isoelectronic with CO, and the bonding
can be considered in a similar fashion (a two-electron &#x03C3; donor, with strong &#x03C0;-acceptor
ability). In the bent arrangement (74), NO is considered to behave as NO&#x2212; , again donating
two electrons. In many complexes, NO can change its coordination mode; in effect, moving
from the linear to the bent mode reduces the number of electrons on the metal by two.</p>

<p class="av-indent">A <b>homoleptic complex</b> is a complex with only one kind of ligand. Simple homoleptic metal carbonyls can be prepared for most of the d metals, but those of Pd and Pt are so unstable that they exist only at low temperatures. No simple neutral metal carbonyls are known for Cu, Ag, or Au, or for the members of Group 12. The metal carbonyls are useful synthetic precursors for other organometallic compounds and are used in organic syntheses and as industrial catalysts.</p>

</figure>
<p class="av-indent">The 18-electron rule helps to systematize the formulas of metal carbonyls. As shown in <a href="#tab_22.5">Table 22.5</a> , the carbonyls of the Period 4 elements of Groups 6 to 10 have alternately one and two metal atoms and a decreasing number of CO ligands. The binuclear carbonyls are formed by elements of the odd-numbered groups, which have an odd number of <a id="page_600" class="page">page600, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>valence electrons and therefore dimerize by forming metal&#x2013;metal (M&#x0064;M) bonds (each M&#x0064;M bond effectively increases the electron count on the metal by 1). The decrease in the number of CO ligands from left to right across a period matches the need for fewer CO ligands to achieve 18 valence electrons. The simple vanadium carbonyl [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>] is an exception as it only has 17 valence electrons and is too sterically crowded to dimerize; it is, however, readily reduced to the 18-electron [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anion.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Simple metal carbonyl molecules often have well-defined, simple, symmetrical shapes that correspond to the CO ligands taking up the most distant locations, like regions of enhanced electron density in the VSEPR model. Thus, the Group 6 hexacarbonyls are octahedral, pentacarbonyliron(0) is trigonal bipyramidal, tetracarbonylnickel(0) is tetrahedral, and decacarbonyldimanganese(0) consists of two square-pyramidal Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> groups joined by a metal&#x2013;metal bond. Bridging carbonyls are also found; for example, one isomer of octacarbonyldicobalt(0) has its metal&#x2013;metal bond bridged by two CO ligands.</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">Ludwig Mond, Carl Langer, and Friederich Quinke discovered [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] in the course of studying the corrosion of nickel valves in process gas containing CO in 1890. They were not able to fully characterize the new compound (calling it &#x2018;nickel-carbon-oxide&#x2019;), commenting, &#x2018;We have at present no suggestion to offer as to the constitution of this remarkable compound&#x2019;. They were, however, able to assign the formula &#x2018;Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>&#x2019; to their new compound and were quick to apply their discovery to develop a new industrial process (The Mond process) for the purification of nickel. This process was such a success that it brought nickel all the way from Canada to Mond&#x2019;s factory in Wales.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">The Mond process relies on the ease of synthesis of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>]: at a pressure of a single atmosphere of carbon monoxide, nickel metal will react at around 50&#x00B0;C to give [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>]:</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">At this temperature, [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] is a gas (b.p. 34&#x00B0;C) and is easily separated from the residues of the impure nickel. Nickel tetracarbonyl decomposes to give pure nickel at about 220&#x00B0;C, liberating carbon monoxide, which can then be reused. Typically the impure nickel is generated from the reduction of nickel oxide ores with a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">Mond, Langer, and Quinke also attempted the synthesis of analogous compounds with other metals, but were unable to isolate anything new. They did, however, succeed in extracting nickel contaminants from samples of cobalt, suggesting a way to purify cobalt too.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">(c) Properties of homoleptic carbonyls</h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>All the mononuclear carbonyls are volatile; all the mononuclear and many of the polynuclear carbonyls are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents; polynuclear carbonyls are coloured.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindente">Iron and nickel carbonyls are liquids at room temperature and pressure but all other common carbonyls are solids. All the mononuclear carbonyls are volatile; their vapour pressures at room temperature range from approximately 50 kPa for tetracarbonylnickel(0) to approximately 10 Pa for hexacarbonyltungsten(0). The high volatility of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>], coupled with its extremely high toxicity, means that unusual care is required in its handling. Although the other carbonyls appear to be less toxic, they too must not be inhaled or allowed to touch the skin.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Because they are nonpolar, all the mononuclear and many of the polynuclear carbonyls are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. The most striking exception among the common carbonyls is nonacarbonyldiiron(0), [Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>], which has a very low vapour pressure and is insoluble in solvents with which it does not react.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Most of the mononuclear carbonyls are colourless or lightly coloured. Polynuclear carbonyls are coloured, the intensity of the colour increasing with the number of metal atoms. For example, pentacarbonyliron(0) is a light straw-coloured liquid, nonacarbonyldiiron(0) forms golden-yellow flakes, and dodecacarbonyltriiron(0) is a deep green compound that looks black in the solid state. The colours of polynuclear carbonyls arise from electronic transitions between orbitals that are largely localized on the metal framework.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The principal reactions of the metal centre of simple metal carbonyls are substitution (<a href="#sec_22.21">Section 22.21</a>), oxidation, reduction, and condensation into clusters (<a href="#sec_22.20">Section 22.20</a>). In certain cases, the CO ligand itself is also subject to attack by nucleophiles or electrophiles.</p>

<p class="av-noindente">Most neutral metal carbonyl complexes can be reduced to an anionic form known as a <b>metal carbonylate</b>. In monometallic carbonyls, two-electron reduction is generally accompanied by loss of the two-electron donor CO ligand, thus preserving the electron count at 18:</p>

<p class="av-noindente">The metal carbonylate contains Fe with oxidation number &#x2212;2, and it is rapidly oxidized by air. That much of the negative charge is delocalized over the CO ligands is confirmed by the observation of a low CO stretching band in the IR spectrum at about 1785 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Polynuclear carbonyls, which obey the 18-electron rule through the formation of M&#x0064;M bonds, are generally cleaved by strong reducing agents. The 18-electron rule is obeyed in the product and a mononegative mononuclear carbonylate results:</p>

<p class="av-noindente">Some metal carbonyls disproportionate in the presence of a strongly basic ligand, producing the ligated cation and a carbonylate. Much of the driving force for this reaction is the stability of the metal cation when it is surrounded by strongly basic ligands. Octacarbonyldicobalt(0) is highly susceptible to this type of reaction when exposed to a good Lewis base such as pyridine (py):</p>

<p class="av-noindente">It is also possible for the CO ligand to be oxidized in the presence of the strongly basic ligand OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, the net outcome being the reduction of a metal centre:</p>
<figure class="av-image">
 <img src="../images/ch7.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="av-noindente">Carbonyl compounds that have only 17 electrons are particularly prone to reduction to give 18-electron carbonylates.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Metal carbonyls are susceptible to oxidation by air. Although uncontrolled oxidation produces the metal oxide and CO or CO<sub>2</sub>, of more interest in organometallic chemistry are the controlled reactions that give rise to organometallic halides. One of the simplest of these is the oxidative cleavage of an M&#x0064;M bond:</p>

<p class="av-indent">The affinity of metal carbonylates for the proton varies widely (<a href="#tab_22.6">Table 22.6</a>). It is observed that, the greater the electron density on the metal centre of the anion, the higher its Br&#x00F8;nsted basicity and hence the lower the acidity of its conjugate acid (the metal carbonyl hydride).</p>
<p class="av-indent">As we noted in <a href="#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>, d-block M&#x0064;H complexes are commonly referred to as &#x2018;hydrides&#x2019;, which reflects the assignment of oxidation number &#x2013;1 to an H atom attached to a metal atom. Nevertheless, most of the carbonyl hydrides of metals to the right of the d block are Br&#x00F8;nsted acids. The Br&#x00F8;nsted acidity of a metal carbonyl hydride is a reflection of the &#x03C0;-acceptor strength of a CO ligand, which stabilizes the conjugate base. Thus, [CoH(CO)<sub>4</sub>] is acidic whereas [CoH(PMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] is strongly hydridic. In striking contrast to p-block hydrogen compounds, the Br&#x00F8;nsted acidity of d-block M&#x0064;H compounds decreases on descending a group.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Neutral metal carbonyls (such as pentacarbonyliron, [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>]) can be protonated in air-free concentrated acid; the Br&#x00F8;nsted basicity of a metal atom with oxidation number zero is associated with the presence of nonbonding d electrons. Compounds having metal&#x2013;metal bonds, such as clusters (<a href="#sec_22.20">Section 22.20</a>), are even more easily protonated; here the Br&#x00F8;nsted basicity is associated with the ready protonation of M&#x0064;M bonds to produce a formal 3<i>c</i>,2<i>e</i> bond like that in diborane:</p>

<p class="av-noindente">The C atom of CO is susceptible to attack by nucleophiles if it is attached to a metal atom that is not electron-rich. Thus, terminal carbonyls with high CO stretching frequencies are liable to attack by nucleophiles. The d electrons in these neutral or cationic metal carbonyls are not extensively delocalized on to the carbonyl C atom and so that atom can be attacked by electron-rich reagents. For example, strong nucleophiles (such as methyllithium; <a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.17">Section 11.17</a>) attack the CO in many neutral metal carbonyl compounds:</p>

<p class="av-noindente">In electron-rich metal carbonyls, considerable electron density is delocalized on the CO ligand. As a result, in some cases the O atom of a CO ligand is susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Once again, IR data provide an indication of when this type of reaction should be expected, as a low CO stretching frequency indicates significant backdonation to the CO ligand and hence appreciable electron density on the O atom.

<h3 class="av-h3">(g) Spectroscopic properties of carbonyl compounds</h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>The CO stretching frequency is decreased when it serves as a &#x03C0; acceptor; donor ligands cause the CO stretching frequency to decrease as they supply electrons to the metal;</b> <sup><b>13</b></sup><b>C-NMR is of less use as many carbonyl compounds are fluxional on the NMR timescale.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindente">Infrared and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy are widely used to determine the arrangement of atoms in metal carbonyl compounds, as separate signals are observed for inequivalent CO ligands. NMR spectra generally contain more detailed structural information than IR spectra, provided the molecule is not fluxional (the timescales of the NMR and IR transition are different, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">Sections 8.5</a>, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">8.6</a>). However, IR spectra are often simpler to obtain, and are particularly useful for following reactions. Most CO stretching bands occur in the range 2100&#x2013;1700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, a region that is generally free of bands arising from organic groups. Both the range of CO stretching frequencies (see <a href="#fig_22.4">Fig. 22.4</a>) and the number of CO bands (<a href="#tab_22.7">Table 22.7</a>) are important for making structural in6ferences.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Group theory allows us to predict the number of active CO stretches in both the IR and Raman spectra (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Section 6.5</a>). If the CO ligands are not related by a centre of inversion or a three-fold or higher axis of symmetry, a molecule with <i>N</i> CO ligands will have <i>N</i> CO stretching absorption bands. Thus a bent OC&#x0064;M&#x0064;CO group (with only a two-fold symmetry axis) will have two infrared absorptions because both the symmetric (<b>75</b>) and antisymmetric (<b>76</b>) stretches cause the electric dipole moment to change and are IR active. Highly symmetrical molecules have fewer bands than CO ligands. Thus, in a linear OC&#x0064;M&#x0064;CO group, only one IR band (corresponding to the out-of-phase stretching of the two CO ligands) is observed in the CO stretching region because the symmetrical stretch leaves the overall electric dipole moment unchanged. As shown in <a href="#fig_22.12">Fig. 22.12</a>, the positions of the CO ligands in a metal carbonyl may be more symmetrical than the point group of the whole compound suggests, and then fewer bands will be observed than are predicted on the basis of the overall point group. Raman spectroscopy can be very useful in assigning structures because the selection rules complement those of IR (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Sections 6.5</a> and <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">8.5</a>). Thus, for a linear OC&#x0064;M&#x0064;CO group, the symmetric stretching of the two CO ligands is observed in the Raman spectrum.</p>

<p class="av-indent">A motionally averaged NMR signal is observed when a molecule undergoes changes in structure more rapidly than the technique can resolve (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>).

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Deprotonation of cyclopentadiene gives a convenient precursor to many metal cyclopentadienyl compounds; bound cyclopentadienyl rings behave as aromatic compounds and will undergo Friedel&#x2013;Crafts electrophilic reactions.</b></p>

<p class="av-noindente">Sodium cyclopentadienide can then be used to react with d-metal halides to produce metallocenes. Cyclopentadiene itself is acidic enough that potassium hydroxide will deprotonate it in solution and, for example, ferrocene can be prepared with a minimum of fuss:</p>

<p class="av-noindente">Because of their great stability, the 18-electron Group 8 compounds ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene maintain their ligand&#x2013;metal bonds under rather harsh conditions, and it is possible to carry out a variety of transformations on the cyclopentadienyl ligands. For <a id="page_607" class="page">Page 607, d&#x2013;Metal organometallic chemistry</a>example,they undergo reactions similar to those of simple aromatic hydrocarbons, such as Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation:</p>

We have already noted how, in the gas phase, the eclipsed conformation of ferrocene is slightly more stable than the staggered one; this difference arises from the improved overlap of the metal d orbitals with those of the Cp rings in the eclipsed conformation. However, the steric bulk of substituents on the metallocene rings can destabilize the eclipsed conformation and can make the sterically less congested staggered form the preferred conformation. The rings of metallocenes are often drawn in a staggered conformation simply because there is then a little more space to illustrate substitutions.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Of greater interest is the stereochemical nonrigidity that is often seen when a conjugated cyclic polyene is attached to a metal atom through some, but not all, of its C atoms. In such complexes the metal&#x2013;ligand bonding may hop around the ring; in the informal jargon of organometallic chemists this internal rotation is called &#x2018;ring whizzing&#x2019;. A simple example is found in [Ge(&#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-Cp)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], in which the single site of attachment of the Ge atom to the cyclopentadiene ring hops around the ring in a series of <b>1,2-shifts</b>, a motion in which a C&#x2014;M bond is replaced by a C&#x2014;M bond to the next C atom around the ring; this motion is known as a 1,2-shift because the bond starts on atom 1 and ends up on the adjacent atom 2. The great majority of fluxional conjugated polyene complexes that have been investigated migrate by 1,2-shifts, but it is not known whether these shifts are controlled by a principle of least motion or by some aspect of orbital symmetry.</p>

The compound [Ru(&#x03B7;<sup>4</sup>-C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>] (77) provides a good illustration of the approach. At room temperature, its <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum consists of a single, sharp line that could be interpreted as arising from a symmetrical &#x03B7;<sup>8</sup>-C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub> ligand. However, X-ray diffraction studies of single crystals show unambiguously that the ligand is tetrahapto. This conflict is resolved by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra at lower temperatures because <a id="page_610" class="page">Page 610, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>as the sample is cooled the signal broadens and then separates into four peaks.

The interpretation is that at room temperature the ring is &#x2018;whizzing&#x2019; around the metal atom rapidly compared with the timescale of the NMR experiment (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>), so an averaged signal is observed. At lower temperatures the motion of the ring is slower, and the distinct conformations exist long enough to be resolved. A detailed analysis of the line shape of the NMR spectra can be used to measure the activation energy of the migration.</p>

By contrast, one of the distinctive characteristics of inorganic chemistry is the large number of closed polyhedral molecules, such as the tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub> molecule (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.1">Section 15.1</a>), the octahedral halide-bridged early d-block clusters (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml#box19.2">Box 19.2</a>), the polyhedral carboranes (<a href="Chapter13.xhtml#sec_13.12">Section 13.12</a>), and the organometallic cluster compounds that we discuss here. The structures of clusters often resemble the close-packed structures of the metal itself, and this similarity provides the main rationale for studying them&#x2014;the idea that the chemical properties of the ligands of a cluster reflect the behaviour on a metal surface. In recent years clusters have inspired research for different reasons: materials such as quantum dots and nanoparticles (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.22">Section 24.22</a>) have electronic properties that depend on how large the cluster is.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">A rigorous definition of metal clusters restricts them to molecular complexes with metal&#x2013;metal bonds that form triangular or larger cyclic structures. This definition excludes linear M&#x2014;M compounds and cage compounds, in which several metal atoms are held together exclusively by ligand bridges. However, this rigorous definition is normally relaxed, and we shall consider any M&#x2014;M bonded system as a cluster. The distinction between cage and cluster compounds can seem arbitrary, as the presence of bridging ligands in a cluster such as (82) raises the possibility that the atoms are held together by M&#x2014;L&#x2014;M interactions rather than M&#x2014;M bonds. Bond lengths are of some help in resolving this issue. If the M&#x2014;M distance is much greater than twice the metallic radius, then it is reasonable to conclude that the M&#x2014;M bond is either very weak or absent. However, if the metal atoms are within a reasonable bonding distance, the proportion of the bonding that is attributable to direct M&#x2014;M interaction is ambiguous. For example, following the isolation of [Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>] (83) in 1938, there was much debate about the extent of Fe&#x2014;Fe bonding. Initial suggestions of no Fe&#x2014;Fe interaction were superseded by the general acceptance of a M&#x2014;M bond some 20 years later, though some current bonding theories can account for the structure without invoking any M&#x2014;M bonding (see Tutorial Problem <a href="#t22.12">22.12</a>).</p>

<p class="av-indent">Metal&#x2013;metal bond strengths in metal complexes cannot be determined with great precision, but a variety of pieces of evidence&#x2014;such as the stability of compounds and M&#x2014;M force constants&#x2014;indicate that there is an increase in M&#x2014;M bond strengths down a group in the d block. This trend contrasts with that in the p block, where element&#x2013;element bonds are usually weaker for the heavier members of a group. As a consequence of this trend, metal&#x2013;metal bonded systems are most numerous for the 4d- and 5d-series metals.</p>

with fewer than six metal atoms; the Wade&#x2013;Mingos&#x2013;Lauher rules identify a correlation between the valence electron count and the structures of larger organometallic complexes.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Organometallic cluster compounds are rare for the early d metals and unknown for the f metals, but a large number of metal carbonyl clusters exist for the elements of Groups 6 to 10. The bonding in the smaller clusters can be readily explained in terms of local M&#x2014;M and M&#x2014;L electron-pair bonding and the 18-electron rule.</p>
<p class="av-indent">If we take [Mn<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>] (84) and [Os<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>] (85) as examples we can arrive at a simple, yet illuminating, picture. In [Mn<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>] each Mn atom is coordinated by five terminal carbonyls and is considered to have 17 electrons (7 from Mn and 10 from the five CO ligands) before we take into account the Mn&#x2014;Mn bond. This Mn&#x2014;Mn bond consists of two electrons shared between the two metal atoms, and hence raises the electron count of each by 1, resulting in two 18-electron metal atoms, but with a total electron count of only 34, not 36. In [Os<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>], each Os atom is coordinated by four carbonyls and, as an [Os(CO)<sub>4</sub>] fragment, has 16 electrons (eight from the metal and eight from four carbonyls) before metal&#x2013;metal bonding is taken into consideration. Each metal is bonded to two others to give a triangular arrangement of metals (three M&#x0064;M bonds in the cluster) with the two bonds to each metal increasing the number of electrons around the metals to 18; but with the total electron count of only 48, not 54, electrons. The bonding electrons we are dealing with are referred to as the <b>cluster valence electrons</b> (CVEs), and it quickly becomes apparent that a cluster of <i>x</i> metal atoms with <i>y</i> metal&#x2013;metal bonds needs 18<i>x</i>&#x2212;2<i>y</i> electrons. Octahedral M<sub>6</sub> and larger clusters do not conform to this pattern, and the polyhedral skeletal electron-pair rules, known as Wade&#x2019;s rules (Section 13.11), have been refined by D.M.P. Mingos and J. Lauher to apply to metal clusters. These <b>Wade</b>&#x2013;<b>Mingos</b>&#x2013;<b>Lauher rules</b> are summarized in they apply most reliably to metal clusters in Groups 6 to 9. In general, and as in the boron hydrides where similar considerations apply, more open structures (which have fewer metal&#x2013;metal bonds) occur when there is a higher CVE count.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Isolobal analogies provide a good way to picture the incorporation of hetero atoms into a metal cluster.

A minor complication in this comparison is the occurrence of Co(CO)<sub>2</sub> groups together with bridging CO ligands in [Co<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>], because bridging and terminal ligands often have similar energies. Further inspection of the isolobal fragments given in shows that a P atom is isolobal with CH; accordingly, a cluster similar to [Co<sub>3</sub>(CH)(CO)<sub>9</sub>] (86) is known, but with a capping P atom. Similarly, the ligands CR<sub>2</sub> and Fe(CO)<sub>4</sub> are both capable of bonding to two metal atoms in a cluster; CH<sub>3</sub> and Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> can bond to one metal atom.</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>The substitution of ligands in organometallic complexes is very similar to the substitution
of ligands in coordination complexes, with the additional constraint that the valence electron count at

<p class="av-noindentt">Extensive studies of CO substitution reactions of simple carbonyl complexes have revealed systematic trends in mechanisms and rates, and much that has been established for these compounds is applicable to all organometallic complexes. The simple replacement of one ligand by another in organometallic complexes is very similar to that observed with coordination compounds, where reactions sometimes go by an associative, a dissociative, or an interchange pathway, with the reaction being either associatively or dissociatively activated (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#sec_21.2">Section 21.2</a>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">The simplest examples of substitution reactions involve the replacement of CO by another electron-pair donor, such as a phosphine.

<p class="av-indent">A dissociatively activated substitution reaction would be expected with metal carbonyl complexes as associative activation would require reaction intermediates with more than 18 valence electrons, formation of which corresponds to populating high-energy antibonding MOs.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Whereas the loss of the first CO group from [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] occurs easily, and substitution is fast at room temperature, the CO ligands are much more tightly bound in the Group 6 carbonyls, and loss of CO often needs to be promoted thermally or photochemically. For example, the substitution of CO by CH<sub>3</sub>CN is carried out in refluxing acetonitrile, using a stream of nitrogen to sweep away the carbon monoxide and hence drive the reaction to completion. To achieve photolysis, mononuclear carbonyls (which do not absorb strongly in the visible region) are exposed to near-UV radiation in an apparatus like that shown in . As with the thermal process, there is strong evidence that the photoassisted substitution reaction leads to the formation of a labile intermediate complex with the solvent, which is then displaced by the entering group. Solvated intermediates in the photolysis of metal carbonyls have been detected, not only in polar solvents such as THF but also in every solvent that has been tried, even in alkanes and noble gases.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The rates of substitution of ligands in 16-electron complexes are sensitive to the identity and concentration of the entering group, which indicates associative activation. For example, the reactions of [Ir(CO)Cl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] with triethylphosphine are associatively activated:</p>

</figure>

<p class="av-indent">Sixteen-electron organometallic compounds appear to undergo associatively activated substitution reactions because the 18-electron activated complex is energetically more favourable than the 14-electron activated complex that would occur in dissociative activation.</p>
<p class="av-indent">As in the reactions of coordination complexes, we can expect steric crowding between ligands to accelerate dissociative processes and to decrease the rates of associative processes (Section 21.6). The extent to which various ligands crowd each other is approximated by the Tolman cone angle (Table 21.7) and we can see how it influences the equilibrium constant for ligand binding by examining the dissociation constants of [Ni(PR<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] complexes. These complexes are slightly dissociated in solution if the phosphine ligands are compact, such as PMe<sub>3</sub>, with a cone angle of 118&#x00B0;. However, a complex such as [Ni(P<sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>], where the cone angle is huge (182&#x00B0;), is highly dissociated.</p>

<p class="av-indent">The rate of CO substitution in six-coordinate metal carbonyls often decreases as more strongly basic ligands replace CO, and two or three alkylphosphine ligands often represent the limit of substitution. With bulky phosphine ligands, further substitution may be thermodynamically unfavourable on account of ligand crowding, but increased electron density on the metal centre, which arises when a &#x03C0;&#x2013;acceptor ligand is replaced by a net donor ligand, appears to bind the remaining CO ligands more tightly and therefore reduce the rate of CO dissociative substitution. The explanation of the influence of &#x03C3;&#x2013;donor ligands on CO bonding is that the increased electron density contributed by the phosphine leads to stronger &#x03C0; backbonding to the remaining CO ligands and therefore strengthens the M&#x2014;CO bonds. This stronger M&#x2014;C bond decreases the tendency of CO to leave the metal atom and therefore decreases the rate of dissociative substitution. It is also observed that the second carbonyl that is replaced is normally <i>cis</i> to the site of the first and that replacement of a third carbonyl results in a <i>fac</i> complex. The reason for this regiochemistry is that CO ligands have very high <i>trans</i> effects (Section 21.4).</p>

In these cases it is common to find evidence of associatively activated substitution even for 18-electron complexes.

<p class="av-indent">The substitution of ligands at a cluster is often not a straightforward process because fragmentation is common. Fragmentation occurs because the M&#x2014;M bonds in a cluster are generally comparable in strength to the M&#x2014;L bonds, and so the breaking of the M&#x2014;M bonds provides a reaction pathway with a low activation energy.

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Oxidative addition occurs when a molecule X&#x2014;Y adds to a metal atom to form new M&#x2014;X and M&#x2014;Y bonds with cleavage of the X&#x2014;Y bond; oxidative addition results in an increase in the coordination number of the metal atom by 2 and an increase in the oxidation number by 2; reductive elimination
is the reverse of oxidative addition.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">When we discussed the bonding of dihydrogen to a metal atom in <a href="#sec_22.7">Section 22.7</a>, we noted that the oxidation number on the metal atom increased by 2 when the dihydrogen reacted to give a dihydride:</p>
<figure class="av-image" style="margin-left:1em;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/page617-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="av-noindentt">The increase in oxidation number of the metal by 2 arises because dihydrogen is treated as a neutral ligand, whereas the hydride ligands are treated as H<sup>&#x2212;</sup>: thus the formation of two M&#x2014;H bonds from a H<sub>2</sub> molecule corresponds to a formal increase in the charge on the metal by 2. While it might seem that this oxidation of the metal is just an anomaly thrown up by our method of counting electrons, two of the electrons on the metal atom have been used to backbond to the dihydrogen, and these two electrons are no longer available to the metal for further bonding. This type of reaction is quite general and is known as oxidative addition. A large number of molecules add oxidatively to a metal atom, including the alkyl and aryl halides, dihydrogen, and simple hydrocarbons. In general, the addition of any molecule X&#x2014;Y to a metal atom to give M(X)(Y) can be classed as oxidative addition. Thus the reaction of a metal complex, [ML<sub><i>n</i></sub>], with an acid such as HCl to give [ML<sub><i>n</i></sub>(H)(Cl)] is an oxidative addition reaction. Oxidative addition reactions are not restricted to d-block metals: the reaction of magnesium to form Grignard reagents (<a href="Chapter12.xhtml#sec_12.13">Section 12.13</a>) is an oxidative addition reaction.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Oxidative addition reactions result in two more ligands bound to the metal with an increase in the total electron count at the metal of 2. Thus oxidative addition reactions normally require a coordinatively unsaturated metal centre, and are particularly common for 16&#x2013;electron square&#x2013;planar metal complexes:</p>

</figure>
<p class="av-noindent">The oxidative addition of hydrogen is a concerted reaction: dihydrogen coordinates to form a &#x03C3;&#x2013;bonded H<sub>2</sub> ligand, and then backbonding from the metal results in cleavage of the H&#x2014;H bond and the formation of <i>cis</i> dihydrides: <a id="page_618" class="page">Page 618, d&#x2013;Metal organometallic chemistry</a>Other molecules, such as alkanes and aryl halides, are known to react in a concerted fashion, and in all these cases the two incoming ligands end up <i>cis</i>to each other.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Some oxidative addition reactions are not concerted and either go through radical intermediates or are best thought of as S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement reactions. Radical oxidative addition reactions are rare and will not be discussed further here. In an S<sub>N</sub>2 oxidative addition reaction, a lone pair on the metal attacks the X&#x2013;Y molecule, displacing Y<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, which subsequently bonds to the metal:</p>

</figure>
<p class="av-noindentt">There are two stereochemical consequences of this reaction. First, the two incoming ligands need not end up <i>cis</i> to each other and, second, unlike the concerted reaction, any chirality at the X group is inverted. An S<sub>N</sub>2-type oxidative addition is common for polar molecules such as alkyl halides.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The opposite of oxidative addition, where two ligands couple and eliminate from a metal centre, is known as <b>reductive elimination:</b></p>

<p class="av-noindentt">The reaction is called a &#x2018;1,1-reaction&#x2019; because the X group that was one bond away from the metal atom ends up on an atom that is one bond away from the metal atom. Typically the X group is an alkyl or aryl species and then the product contains an acyl group. In principle, the reaction could proceed by a migration of the X group, or an insertion of the CO into the M&#x2013;X bond. An uncertainty about the actual mechanism has led to the apparently contradictory name <b>migratory insertion</b>. Colloquially, however, the terms &#x2018;migratory insertion&#x2019;, &#x2018;migration&#x2019;, and &#x2018;insertion&#x2019; are used interchangeably. The overall reaction results in a decrease in the number of electrons on the metal atom by 2, with no change in the oxidation state. It is therefore possible to induce 1,1-migratory insertion reactions by the addition of another species that can act as a ligand:</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">the product has only one labelled CO, and that group is <i>cis</i> to the newly formed acyl group. This stereochemistry demonstrates that the incoming CO group does not insert into the Mn&#x2013;Me bond, and that either the methyl group migrates to an adjacent CO ligand, or <a id="page_620" class="page">Page 620, d&#x2013;Metal organometallic chemistry</a>a CO ligand adjacent to the methyl group inserts into the Mn&#x2013;Me bond.

The scheme below summarizes the potential reaction pathways. In one-quarter of the instances, the ligand lost will be the labelled CO and there will be no significant information gained. In half the instances, a nonlabelled CO will be lost, leaving a vacant site <i>cis</i> to both the labelled CO ligand and the acyl group. In this case, either (a) migration of the methyl group back to the metal atom or (b) extrusion of CO will lead to the methyl group and the <sup>13</sup>CO ligand being <i>cis</i> to each other, and no information is gained. However, in the remaining one-quarter of the instances, the CO that is <i>trans</i> to the labelled CO ligand will be lost, and in this case it is possible to distinguish (c) CO ligand extrusion from (d) methyl group migration. If the methyl group migrates, it ends up <i>trans</i> to the labelled CO, whereas if the CO is extruded, the methyl group ends up <i>cis</i> to the labelled CO.</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">Because the product with Me and <sup>13</sup>CO <i>trans</i> to each other constitutes about 25 per cent of the product, we can conclude that the Me group does indeed migrate.

<p class="av-boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> If we consider the reaction between [Mn(Me(CO)<sub>5</sub>] and PPh<sub>3</sub> we can see that it is unlikely to be
the simple replacement of a carbonyl ligand by the phosphine, as this reaction would require a strongly
bound carbonyl ligand to dissociate. A more likely reaction would be the migration of the methyl group on to an adjacent CO ligand to give an acyl group, with the phosphine filling the vacated coordination site. This reaction has a low activation barrier, and the product would therefore be expected to be cis - [Mn(MeCO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)(CO)<sub>4</sub>].</p>

This spectrum shows two singlets, indicating that the Cp* rings are in two different environments. At somewhat above room temperature these rings become equivalent on the NMR timescale and 15N-NMR indicates that N2 exchange between the terminal ligands and dissolved N2 is correlated with the process that interconverts the Cp* ligand sites. Propose a way in which this equilibration could interconvert the sites of the Cp* ligands. (For further details see J.M. Manriquez, D.R. McAlister, E. Rosenberg, H.M. Shiller, K.L. Willamson, S.I.
