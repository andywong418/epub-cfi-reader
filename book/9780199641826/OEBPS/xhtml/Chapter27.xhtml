<p class="la-noindentd"><b>Medicine exploits some elements that are not normally used by biology and commonly considered to be poisons. These elements range across almost the entire periodic table, from lithium to bismuth. Taking a new drug to market is a lengthy and expensive process. Drug discovery is often serendipitous, a classic example being the seemingly unrelated experiments that led to cisplatin and (thereafter) other Pt complexes as cures for many types of cancer. Drugs interfere with biological targets, causing them to be suppressed or destroyed, so a key factor is to ensure that this action is directed selectively to diseased tissue. Metal-containing drugs may undergo numerous chemical changes en route to their molecular targets, making it very difficult to establish how they work. Inorganic complexes may show stereochemical diversity at a single site that is not possible with carbon, leading to important opportunities for drug design. Aside from drugs themselves, inorganic compounds are being used for diagnosing illness and in routine <i>in vivo</i> analysis of essential substances, particularly glucose.</b></p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch27.1a">
<h3 class="la-h3a"><b>The chemistry of elements in medicine</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">Serendipity has played an important role in drug discovery, with many effective treatments arising from chance discoveries. There appears to be a special role for compounds containing metals that are not otherwise used by biological systems&#x2014;for example Li, Pt, Au, Ag, Ru, As, and Bi. Many treatments involve killing invader cells, be they bacteria, parasites, or cancers, and it should come as no surprise that an element that is foreign to a living cell will, if it is able to penetrate the cell, be very effective in displaying <i>cytotoxity</i>&#x2014;the property of being lethal to that cell. Penetrating the cell membrane is rarely a specific stage of the attack process, and &#x2018;close relatives&#x2019; of an element or molecule often enter the target cell with little difficulty. Then, like the Trojan Horse, the more specific characteristics of an element are brought into play for the &#x2018;killing&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="la-indent">A major challenge in pharmacology is to determine the mechanism of action at the molecular level, bearing in mind that the drug that is administered might not be the molecule that ultimately reacts at the target site, as a result of it undergoing modification in the body fluids. This is particularly true for metal complexes, which are usually more susceptible to hydrolysis than organic molecules. In general, a plausible mechanism of action is proposed based upon an extrapolation of <i>in vitro</i> studies, which includes using the analytical strategy of <i>metallomics</i>, as explained in <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.2">Section 26.2</a>. Orally administered drugs are highly desirable because they avoid the trauma and potential hazards of injection; however, they may not pass through the gut wall or survive hydrolytic enzyme action.</p>

<p class="la-noindent"> <a id="page_821" class="page">Page 821, Chapter 27: Inorganic chemistry in medicine</a>Inorganic compounds are also used in the diagnosis of disease or damage, a particularly interesting example being the use of radioactive technetium in imaging. Water solubility and O<sub>2</sub> stability are important issues, yet organometallic compounds, usually associated with anaerobic organic solvents, are finding increasing applications as drugs. The potency of a particular drug is gauged by its IC<sub>50</sub> number, which is the concentration required to effect a 50 per cent inhibition of a certain biological activity. A drug is often administered as part of a package (a regimen) that includes other agents.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Drug development is a lengthy, costly venture and a typical timeline is shown in <a href="#fig_27.1">Fig. 27.1</a>. The first stage is discovery, which begins with identifying a <i>target</i> compound and then synthesizing and testing this compound along with closely related analogues. The next stage is development, which investigates whether the compound is safe and in what form or amount it is likely to be administered to a patient. The third stage is clinical trials, of which there are three scientific phases: in Phase I the new drug is administered to humans, usually healthy volunteers, to determine how it is tolerated and whether it behaves as expected from earlier experiments; in Phase II, the new compound is tested on a small number of patients having the illness, whom the drug is intended to benefit; in Phase III, any encouraging compounds are compared, within a much larger patient group, with other medicines that are already being used to treat the condition and a dummy substance known as a &#x2018;placebo&#x2019;. If at the end of Phase III a compound has proved successful, a licence application is made and the drug proceeds to Phase IV, the marketing and sales through which the pharmaceutical company capitalizes on its investment. This chapter describes compounds that are currently in widespread use in several countries, as well as others that illustrate important principles despite not yet having progressed to clinical use.</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> The great success of cis-[PtCl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>(NH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b>)</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>] (cisplatin) in treating many cancers is due to its ability to bind to DNA, preventing its replication and halting uncontrolled cell division and proliferation. Other Pt complexes having fewer serious side effects have followed. There is great interest in developing drugs that will destroy only cancerous cells, and some ingenious chemistry is involved.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">&#x2018;Cancer&#x2019; is a term that covers a large number of different types of the disease, all characterized by the uncontrolled replication of transformed cells that overwhelm the normal operation of the body. The principle of treatment is to apply drugs that destroy malignant cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The remarkable action of the complex <i>cis</i>-[PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1</b>, known as cisplatin) was discovered in 1964 in the course of an examination of the effect of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. The behaviour of a colony of bacteria suspended in solution between two platinum electrodes was observed, and it was noted that the cells continued to grow in size by forming long filaments, but stopped replicating. The effect was traced to a complex that was formed electrochemically by dissolution of Pt into the electrolyte, which contained NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Since then, cisplatin has been highly successful in treating many forms of cancer, particularly testicular cancer, for which the success rate approaches 100 per cent. The other geometric isomer, <i>trans</i>-[PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], is inactive.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-left:0em;"><b>1</b> Cisplatin</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="la-indent">The ultimate molecular basis of the chemotherapeutic action of cisplatin and related drugs is the formation of a complex between Pt(II) and DNA. Cisplatin is administered into the bloodstream of the patient, where, because the plasma contains high concentrations of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, it tends to remain as the neutral dichlorido species. The electrical neutrality of the dichlorido complex facilitates its passage through the cell membrane (<a href="#fig_27.2">Fig. 27.2</a>). Once subjected to the lower Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> concentrations inside the cell, the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ligands are replaced by H<sub>2</sub>O: the resulting cationic species (with charges &#x002B;1 or &#x002B;2) are attracted electrostatically to DNA and ultimately form inner-sphere complexes in which the &#x2013;Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> fragment is coordinated by N atoms of the nucleotide bases. Some classic studies have shown that the preferred target is a pair of N atoms on consecutive guanine bases in the same strand. Complexes of the &#x2013;Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> fragment with oligonucleotides have been studied by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectrometry (<a href="#fig_27.3">Fig. 27.3</a>). Complexation with Pt causes the helix to kink and partially unwind, rendering the DNA incapable of replication or repair. The distortion also makes the DNA recognizable by &#x2018;high mobility group&#x2019; proteins that bind to bent DNA, thus initiating cell death. Altering the DNA of a cancer cell to render it incapable of replication is now widely accepted as an important mode of action of anticancer drugs. <a id="page_822" class="page">Page 822, Chapter 27: Inorganic chemistry in medicine</a></p>

<p class="la-indent">Despite its efficacy, cisplatin has highly undesirable side effects; in particular, it causes serious damage to the kidneys before it is eventually excreted. Great efforts have been made to find Pt complexes that have fewer side effects. Examples in clinical use are carboplatin (<b>2</b>) and oxaliplatin (<b>3</b>). Effective drugs may also include trinuclear Pt(II) (<b>4</b>) as well as Pt(IV) complexes such as satraplatin (<b>5</b>), which can be administered orally. The <a id="page_823" class="page">Page 823, Chapter 27: Inorganic chemistry in medicine</a>six-coordinate Pt(IV) complex is an example of a <i>prodrug</i>&#x2014;a compound that, by intention, has no activity until activated by entering the target environment. Cancerous tumours are usually hypoxic, meaning that their O<sub>2</sub> level is below 3 mm Hg (0.004 atm or 400 Pa), much lower than that of normal tissue, which lies in the range 20&#x2013;80 mm Hg (0.026&#x2013;0.11 atm or 2.6&#x2013;10.5 kPa). Hypoxia arises from restricted blood supply as well as the higher metabolic activity of cancer cells. Having penetrated the cell membrane, the Pt(IV) complex is easily reduced, losing both axial ligands to give the active, square-planar Pt(II) form.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Other metals are under intense investigation, expanding the armoury of anticancer drugs by offering alternative modes of cell targeting and different mechanisms of DNA binding or other cytotoxic action. The Ru(III) complex (<b>6</b>) known as NAMI-A (<b>n</b>ew <b>a</b>ntitumour <b>m</b>etastasis <b>i</b>nhibitor) is particularly effective in killing secondary cancer cells that have spread from the primary tumour, an invasive process known as metastasis. Another Ru(III) complex&#x2014;(<b>7</b>), referred to simply as KP1019&#x2014;is more active against primary tumours. Both of these Ru(III) complexes become active upon reduction after entering the target cell, leading researchers to investigate how Ru(II) complexes may operate. The half-sandwich Ru(II) arene complex (<b>8</b>) coordinates to guanine-N in a similar way to Pt complexes, but the interaction with DNA is supplemented by intercalation of the biphenyl group within the hydrophobic DNA core as well as hydrogen bonding between guanine and the &#x2013;NH<sub>2</sub> groups of the ethylenediamine ligand. Other metal complexes may bind by intercalation within the DNA interior and offer improved efficacy over Pt drugs. Metallo-supramolecular &#x2018;cylinders&#x2019; formed by placing a metal cation at either end of a special ligand, as in (<b>9</b>), have much larger dimensions that mimic those of Zn fingers (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.5">Section 26.5</a>). The cylinders bind in the major groove of DNA, causing it to form small coils.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Cancer cells may also be selectively targeted by exploiting their affinity for particular biological substances, which may be &#x2018;packaged&#x2019; along with the metal complex and released once inside the cell.

The complex enters breast or ovarian cancer <a id="page_824" class="page">Page 824, Chapter 27: Inorganic chemistry in medicine</a>cells and, upon reduction, forms the active Pt(II) complex and releases two molecules of the estrogen derivative, which induces the formation of a protein that inhibits repair of platinated DNA. Ferrocifen (<b>11</b>), a ferrocene derivative of tamoxifen (blue), is a drug for breast cancer; it is active against a wider range of malignant cells, yet appears to have fewer side effects than tamoxifen itself.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Killing cancer cells using radiation is known as <b>radiotherapy</b>, and an important challenge is ensuring that only cancerous tissue is destroyed. Such targeting is achieved by designing a selective delivery pathway for a suitable radionuclide, a particular example being an extensive range of complexes (<b>12</b>) formed between semithiocarbazone ligands and radioactive <sup>64</sup>Cu which decays (half-life &#x003D; 12.7 h) by several routes: &#x03B2;-decay, positron emission, electron capture, and gamma radiation. The isotope is usually produced from <sup>63</sup>Cu by neutron capture in a reactor, then used immediately. Radiotherapy makes use of the emitted &#x03B2; particles which have a mean path length of only about 1 mm, ensuring highly selective killing of cells that have taken up <sup>64</sup>Cu. Selective delivery is based on the principle that Cu(II)&#x2013;semithiocarbazone complexes are neutral and diffuse into the cancer cell where the hypoxic environment causes reduction to the charged Cu(I) form: the lethal nuclide is thereby trapped. Many variations are possible depending on the nature of the substituents R.</p>

Like Fe(III), Ga(III) is a hard Lewis acid, and the two metal ions have similar radii; however, Ga(III) is not reduced to Ga(II), and any redox or O<sub>2</sub> binding proteins that have incorporated Ga in place of Fe will be inactive. It is thought that Ga(III) enters cells using the same transport systems as Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. The target for Ga<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is the Fe-containing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, which is essential for producing the bases used in DNA.

Certainly Au(I) is much more likely to survive in biological environments than Au(III), which is highly oxidizing. Side effects of Au drugs include skin allergies as well as kidney and gastrointestinal problems. Many Au drugs, including myochrisin and solganol, are water-soluble polymers that are injected into the muscle: they cannot be administered orally because they undergo acid hydrolysis in the stomach. Auranofin is a monomer because of its single phosphine ligand: it can be given orally, but is reported to be less effective than the injected compounds.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The mechanisms by which gold drugs act have long been controversial, and many different protein targets are implicated. As a soft metal ion, Au(I) forms stable complexes with S-donor ligands provided by cysteine or methionine side chains in proteins; indeed the main candidates for Au(I) binding and inhibition include several enzymes in which the active site is a cysteine.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The notorious bacterium <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is responsible for gastric and duodenal ulcers and it is the main cause of stomach cancer. Fortunately, an effective treatment for <i>H. pylori</i> infections is provided by Bi(III) compounds, the most notable being bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), marketed as Pepto-Bismol<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), which are administered orally along with a cocktail of antibiotics. The aqueous chemistry of Bi(III) is dominated by polynuclear insoluble or colloidal Bi&#x2013;O or Bi&#x2013;carboxylate species (<a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>), and this property is important in retaining Bi(III) in the stomach where the environment is highly acidic (pH &#x223C; 3) and rich in organic acids.

<p class="la-noindent">The lithium aqua ion, administered as its chloride or carbonate salts, is the simplest of drugs and a very effective agent in the treatment of bipolar disorders, commonly referred to as &#x2018;manic depression&#x2019; and characterized by severe mood swings.

One way of overcoming resistance is to modify quinine&#x2019;s structure by attaching it to a metal.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Malaria, a major killer affecting half a billion people worldwide and causing over a million deaths per year, is caused by infections of <i>Plasmodium</i>, a parasite that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Once in the bloodstream of its victim, the parasite attacks red blood cells (erythrocytes) to obtain the iron that it needs for survival, a process that requires the degradation of haemoglobin via an Fe(III)&#x2013;porphyrin intermediate, aquaferriprotoporphyrin IX, commonly known as haematin (<b>21</b>). It is important for <i>Plasmodium</i> to avoid accumulating haematin, which is highly toxic because it catalyses the generation of reactive oxygen species, particularly peroxides, that oxidize lipids, resulting in membrane damage. <i>Plasmodium</i> survives by converting haematin into a highly insoluble microcrystalline substance called haemozoin (<a href="#fig_27.5">Fig. 27.5</a>). Antimalarial drugs, the most important of which are based on the quinoline family (&#x2018;quinine&#x2019;), interfere with the production and stability of haemozoin, thereby exposing <i>Plasmodium</i> to self-inflicted Fe overload. Many strains of <i>Plasmodium</i> have become resistant to quinolines, and ingenious ways are being devised to <a id="page_827" class="page">Page 827, Chapter 27: Inorganic chemistry in medicine</a>find derivatives that can overcome the parasite&#x2019;s immune defences. An important strategy here is to attach a metal complex to the quinoline group, thereby allowing the agent to deceive the organism&#x2019;s resistance pathways. Ferroquine (<b>22</b>) an analogue of chloroquine with a ferrocene group attached, is now a leader in the fight against malaria.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Derivatives of cyclams, macrocyclic ligands forming strong complexes with d-block metal ions, are under investigation as anti-HIV therapeutics. The virus known as HIV invades cells and uses them to replicate. Entry of HIV into a cell is initiated by an interaction between a glycoprotein on the virus and a receptor protein known as CD4 that is present on the target-cell membrane. The resulting reaction sets off a chain of events that includes other receptor proteins. Cyclams interrupt these events, although it is unclear how they do so. One hypothesis is that cyclams bind low levels of free Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> M), and the resulting macrocyclic complexes form termolecular adducts with cysteine thiolate (RS<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) functionalities present on special protein receptors known as CXCR4.

<p class="la-noindent"><i>Iron overload</i> is the name given to several serious conditions that affect a large proportion of the world&#x2019;s population. Here we recall that, despite its great importance, Fe is potentially a highly toxic element, particularly in its ability to produce harmful radicals by reaction with O<sub>2</sub>, and its levels are normally strictly controlled by regulatory systems. In many groups of people, a genetic disorder results in breakdown of this regulation, the chief culprit being <i>thalassemia</i>, which is endemic in certain parts of the world. One kind of iron overload is caused by a patient&#x2019;s inability to produce sufficient porphyrin. Other problems are caused by faults in the regulation of Fe levels through ferritin or transferrin production (<a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.6">Sections 26.6</a> and <a href="Chapter26.xhtml#sec_26.15">26.15</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Iron overload is treated by <b>chelation therapy</b>, the administration of a ligand to sequester Fe and allow it to be excreted.

It is a very successful agent for iron overload, apart from the trauma of its introduction into the body, which involves connection to an intravenous supply. The latter concern has led to the development of orally administered drugs such as deferasirox (<b>26</b>) and deferiprone (<b>27</b>).

<p class="la-boxpara">Diabetes is an increasing health problem, particularly in the western world. Patients suffering from Type 1 diabetes have to administer, by injection, a hormone known as insulin in order to control their blood-sugar levels. Portable sensors that can provide a patient with a rapid and accurate measure of their current glucose level are important for managing the disease and enabling them to lead an active life. A highly successful glucose sensor invented by H.A.O. Hill and colleagues at Oxford University exploits ferrocene as a versatile electron-transfer agent and an enzyme, glucose oxidase, that catalyses the oxidation of glucose by O<sub>2</sub>. Glucose oxidase contains an organic cofactor known as flavin. The pocket-sized electrochemical sensor consists of a carbon electrode upon which glucose oxidase is immobilized in a coating containing a ferrocene that has been functionalized to optimize reduction potential, solubility, stability, and charge (<a href="#fig_B27.1">Fig. B27.1</a>). A small sample of blood produced by a pinprick is placed on the surface of the sensor. Electrons produced by the oxidation of glucose are diverted to ferrocene (a better electron acceptor than O<sub>2</sub>), which interacts with the electrode to produce an electrical current (<a href="#fig_B27.2">Fig. B27.2</a>). The current (read out from a digital display) is directly related to the concentration of glucose in the sample (<a href="#fig_B27.3">Fig. B27.3</a>).</p>

<h3 class="la-h3">27.10 Outlook</h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Future medicine will benefit greatly from the work of scientists with expertise in inorganic chemistry.</b></p>

<p class="la-noindent">The topics outlined in this chapter probably represent only the &#x2018;tip of the iceberg&#x2019; in terms of the opportunities existing for inorganic chemistry to play an important role in medicine. Many other examples are still at early stages of investigation: they range from fluorescent imaging agents for Zn released during a seizure to metal complexes used in electrochemical sensors. There is scope for extended solid-state compounds in medicine, and inorganic layered hydroxide materials are under investigation as drug-delivery vehicles. In the wider world of cosmetic and preventative healthcare, even Ag nanoparticles find a use, as antimicrobial agents commonly incorporated into clothing. As stressed in this chapter, a major challenge is establishing the detailed mechanisms of action of these compounds, the active forms of which may differ greatly from the form in which they are administered.</p>
