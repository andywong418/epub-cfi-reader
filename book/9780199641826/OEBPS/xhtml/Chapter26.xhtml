The long hydrocarbon chains of lipids make the membrane interior very hydrophobic and impermeable to ions, which must instead travel through specific channels, pumps, and other receptors provided by special membrane proteins. The structure of a cell also depends on osmotic pressure, which is maintained by high concentrations of solutes, including ions, imported during active transport by pumps.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Prokaryotic cells consist of an enclosed aqueous phase, the <b>cytoplasm</b>, which contains the DNA and most of the materials used and transformed in the biochemical reactions. Bacteria are classified according to whether they are enclosed by a single membrane or have an additional intermediate aqueous space, the <b>periplasm</b>, between the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane, and are known as &#x2018;Gram-positive&#x2019; or &#x2018;Gram-negative&#x2019;, respectively, depending on their response to a staining test with the dye crystal violet. The much more extensive cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells contains subcompartments (also enclosed within lipid bilayers) known as <b>organelles</b>, which have highly specialized functions.

<h3 class="la-h3"><b>26.2 The inorganic composition of living organisms</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> The major biological elements are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. The trace elements include many d metals, as well as selenium, iodine, silicon, and boron. The pool of metal-containing species and nonmetal trace elements in living organisms is known as the metallome.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">The term <b>metallomics</b> refers to the systematic study of the <i>metallome</i>&#x2014;the pool of metal-containing species and some nonmetal trace elements in living organisms. A variety of analytical techniques are used to determine the organization, speciation, distribution, storage, regulation, dynamic properties, and pathogenicity of metal ions. A flow chart is shown in <a href="#fig_26.2">Figure 26.2</a>. The principle goal of metallomics research is to identify <i>where</i> a particular metal ion or other trace element binds, i.e. which cells, which organelles, which molecules, and which group of ligands. A further aim is to establish the dynamics (mobility) of each metal ion. An investigation in metallomics begins with organ/tissue sampling, cell disruption, and separation of different components. Instrumental techniques are then applied, such as mass spectrometry and ultrasensitive absorption and emission spectroscopic methods, high-resolution imaging, and protein and nucleic acid sequencing. These experimental procedures are complemented with computational methods. Information derived from metallomics plays an important role in drug development, as we will mention in <a href="Chapter27.xhtml#ch27">Chapter 27</a>.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><a href="#tab26.1">Table 26.1</a> lists many of the elements known to be used in living systems, although not necessarily by higher life forms (concentrations in mol dm-3, often abbreviated M-1 (molar)). All the second- and third-period elements except Be, Al, and the noble gases are used, as are most of the 3d elements, whereas Cd, Br, I, Mo, and W are the only heavier elements so far confirmed to have a biological function. Several others, such as Li, Ga, Tc, Ru, Gd, Pt, and Au, have important and increasingly well-understood applications in medicine (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#ch27">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">The biologically essential elements can be classified as either &#x2018;major&#x2019; or &#x2018;trace&#x2019;, although the levels vary considerably among organisms and different components of organisms. For example, Ca has little role in microorganisms but is abundant in higher life forms, whereas the use of Co by higher organisms depends upon it being incorporated into a special cofactor (cobalamin) by microorganisms. There is probably a universal requirement for K, Mg, Fe, and Mo. Vanadium is used by lower animals and plants as well as some bacteria. Nickel is essential for most microorganisms, including pathogens such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.3">Section 27.3</a>), and is used by plants, but there is no evidence for any direct role in animals. Nature&#x2019;s use of different elements is largely based on their availability. For example, Zn has widespread use (and, together with Fe, ranks among the most abundant biological trace elements) whereas Co (a comparatively rare element) is essentially restricted to cobalamin. The early atmosphere (over 2.3 Ga ago),<sup><a id="ich26fn1"></a><a href="#ch26fn1">1</a></sup> being highly reducing, enabled Fe to be freely available as soluble Fe(II) salts, whereas Cu was trapped as insoluble sulfides (as was Zn). Indeed, Cu is not found in the archaea (which are believed to have evolved in pre-oxygenic times), including the hyperthermophiles, organisms that are able to survive at temperatures in excess of 100&#x00B0;C. These organisms are found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and terrestrial hot springs and are good sources of enzymes that contain W, the heaviest element known to be essential to life. The finding that W, Co, and for the most part Ni are used only by more primitive life forms probably reflects their special role in the early stages of evolution.</p>
<p class="la-footnote"><sup><a id="ch26fn1"></a><a href="#ich26fn1">1</a></sup> Current geological and geochemical evidence date the advent of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> at between 2.2 and 2.4 Ga ago (1 Ga &#8211; 10<sup>9</sup> a). It is likely that this gas arose by the earliest catalytic actions of the photosynthetic Mn cluster described in <a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>. <a id="page_765" class="page">Page 765, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a></p>

The finding that W, Co, and for the most part Ni are used only by more primitive life forms probably reflects their special role in the early stages of evolution.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(a) Compartmentalization</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Different elements are strongly segregated inside and outside a cell and among different internal compartments.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent"><b>Compartmentalization</b> is the distribution of elements inside and outside a cell and between different internal compartments. The maintenance of constant ion levels in different biological zones is an example of <i>homeostasis</i> and it is achieved as a result of membranes being barriers to passive ion flow. An example is the large difference in concentration of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions across cell membranes. In the cytoplasm, the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentration may be as high as 0.3 M, whereas outside it is usually less than 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> M. By contrast, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is abundant outside a cell but scarce inside; indeed, the low intracellular concentration of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which has characteristically weak binding to ligands, means that it has few specific roles in biochemistry. Another important example is Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, which is almost absent from the cytoplasm (its concentration is below 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup> M) yet is a common cation in the extracellular environment and is concentrated in certain organelles, such as mitochondria. That pH may also vary greatly between different compartments has particularly important implications because sustaining a transmembrane proton gradient is a key feature in photosynthesis and respiration.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The distributions of Cu and Fe provide another example: Cu enzymes are often <b>extracellular</b>; that is, they are synthesized in the cell and then secreted outside the cell, where they catalyse reactions involving O<sub>2</sub>. By contrast, Fe enzymes are contained inside the cell. This difference can be rationalized on the basis that the inactive trapped states of these elements are Fe(III) and Cu(I) (or even metallic Cu) and organisms have evolved to ensure that Fe is kept in a relatively reducing environment and Cu in a relatively oxidizing environment.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The selective uptake of metal ions has industrial applications, for many organisms and organs are known to concentrate particular elements. Thus, liver cells are a good source of cobalamin<sup><a id="ich26fn2"></a><a href="#ch26fn2">2</a></sup> (Co), and milk is rich in Ca. Certain bacteria accumulate Au and thus provide an unusual way for procuring this precious metal. Compartmentalization is an important factor in the design of metal complexes that are used in medicine (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#ch27">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">The very small size of bacteria and organelles raises an interesting point about scale, as species present at very low concentrations in tiny volumes may be represented by only a few individual atoms or molecules. For example, the cytoplasm in a bacterial cell of volume 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> at pH &#8211; 6 will contain less than 1000 &#x2018;free&#x2019; H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions. Indeed, any element nominally present at less than 1 nmol dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> may be completely absent in individual cases. The word &#x2018;free&#x2019; is significant, particularly for metal ions such as Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> that are high in the Irving&#x2013;Williams series (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>); even a eukaryotic cell with a total Zn concentration of 0.1 mmol dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> may contain very few uncomplexed Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Two important issues arise in the context of compartmentalization. First, the process requires energy because ions must be pumped against an adverse gradient of chemical potential. However, once a concentration difference has been established, there is a difference in electrical potential across the membrane dividing the two regions. For instance, if the concentrations of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions on either side of a membrane are [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>out</sub>, then the contribution to the potential difference across the membrane is</p>

<p class="la-noindent">This difference in electrical potential is a way of storing energy, which is released when the ions flood back to their natural concentrations. Second, the selective transport of ions must occur through ion channels built from membrane-spanning proteins, some of which release ions upon receipt of an electrical or chemical signal whereas others, the <b>transporters</b> and <b>pumps</b>, transfer ions against the concentration gradient by using energy provided <a id="page_767" class="page">Page 767, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis.

<p class="la-indent">An important factor influencing metal-ion coordination in proteins is the energy required to locate an electrical charge inside a medium of low permittivity. To a first approximation, protein molecules may be regarded as oil drops in which the interior has a much lower relative permittivity (about 4) than water (about 78). This difference leads to a strong tendency to preserve electrical neutrality at the metal site, and hence influence the redox chemistry and Br&#x00F8;nsted acidity of its ligands.</p>
<p class="la-indent">All amino acid residues can use their peptide carbonyl (or amide-N) as a donor group, but it is the side chain that usually provides more selective coordination. By referring to <a href="#tab26.2">Table 26.2</a> and from the discussion in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.9">Section 4.9</a>, we can recognize donor groups that are either chemically hard or soft and that therefore confer a particular affinity for specific metal ions. Aspartate and glutamate each provide a hard carboxylate group, and may use one or both O atoms as donors (<b>3</b>). The ability of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to have a high coordination number and its preference for hard donors are such that certain Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-binding proteins also contain the unusual amino acids &#x03B3;-carboxyglutamate and hydroxyaspartate (generated by post-translational modification), which provide additional functionalities to enhance binding. Histidine, which has an imidazole group with two coordination sites, the &#x03B5;-N atom (more common) and the &#x03B4;-N atom, is an important ligand for Fe, Cu, and Zn (<b>4</b>). Cysteine has a thiol S atom that is expected to be unprotonated (thiolate) when involved in metal coordination. It is a good ligand for Fe, Cu, and Zn (<b>5</b>), as well as for toxic metals such as Cd and Hg. Methionine contains a soft thioether S donor that stabilizes Fe(II) and Cu(I) (<b>6</b>). Tyrosine can be deprotonated to provide a phenolate O donor atom that is a good ligand for Fe(III) (<b>7</b>). Selenocysteine (a specially coded amino acid in which Se replaces S) has also been identified as a ligand; for example, it is found as a ligand to Ni in some hydrogenases (<a href="#sec_26.14">Section 26.14</a>). A modified form of lysine, in which the side-chain &#x2013;NH<sub>2</sub> has reacted with CO<sub>2</sub> to form a carbamate, is found as a ligand to Mg in the crucial photosynthetic enzyme known as rubisco (<a href="#sec_26.9">Section 26.9</a>) and in other enzymes such as urease, where it is a ligand for Ni(II).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Proteins can enforce unusual metal coordination geometries and activities that are rarely encountered in small complexes. The two convenient representations of peptide structure shown in <a href="#fig_26.3">Fig. 26.3</a> do not tell the full story because they ignore the side chains that make up the bulk of the protein; indeed, once the various side chains are included it usually becomes very difficult to &#x2018;see&#x2019; the metal atom even if it is just below the protein surface. The protein provides very specific steric hindrance in the metal coordination sphere that is difficult to mimic with organic ligands; accordingly, chemists attempting to model the active sites of metalloenzymes make extensive use of bulky ligands in order to protect a coordinatively unsaturated site. Protein-induced strain is another important possibility; for example, the protein may impose a coordination geometry on the metal ion that resembles the transition state for the particular process being executed. Many <a id="page_771" class="page">Page 771, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>of the structures of active sites shown in this chapter are direct representations based on X-ray diffraction data and constructed using commercially available software known as Pymol<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>. Instead of the aesthetically pleasing structures that are familiar to chemists working with small complexes, we will frequently see severe distortions&#x2014;twisted angles and unusual bond lengths&#x2014;that are imposed by the surrounding protein.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The porphyrin group (<b>8</b>) was first identified in haemoglobin (Fe) and a similar macrocycle is found in chlorophyll (Mg). There are several classes of this hydrophobic macrocycle, each differing in the nature of the side chains. The corrin ligand (<b>9</b>) has a slightly smaller ring size and coordinates Co in cobalamin (<a href="#sec_26.11">Section 26.11</a>). Rather than show these macrocycles in full, we shall use shorthand symbols such as (<b>10</b>) to show the complexes they form with metals. Almost all Mo and W enzymes have the metal coordinated by a special ligand known as molybdopterin (<b>11</b>). The donors to the metal are a pair of S atoms from a dithiolene group that is covalently attached to a pterin. The phosphate group is often joined to a nucleoside base X, such as guanosine 5&#x2032;-phosphate (GMP), resulting in the formation of a diphosphate bond. Why Mo and W are coordinated by this complex ligand is unknown, but the pterin group could provide a good electron conduit and facilitate redox reactions.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(d) The structures of metal-coordination sites</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> The likelihood that a protein will coordinate a particular kind of metal centre can be inferred from the amino acid sequence and ultimately from the gene itself.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">The structures of metal-coordination sites have been determined mainly by X-ray diffraction (now mostly by using a synchrotron, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>) and sometimes by NMR spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>).<sup><a id="ich26fn3"></a><a href="#ch26fn3">3</a></sup> The basic structure of the protein can be determined even if the resolution is too low to reveal details of the coordination at the metal site. The packing of amino acids in a protein is far denser than is commonly conveyed by simple representations, as may be seen by comparing the representations of the structure of the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel in <a href="#fig_26.4">Fig. 26.4</a>. Thus, even the substitution of an amino acid that is far from a metal centre may result in significant structural changes to its coordination shell and properties. Of special interest are tunnels or clefts that allow a substrate selective access to the active site, pathways for long-range electron transfer (metal centres positioned less than 1.5 nm apart), pathways for long-range proton transfer (comprising chains of Br&#x00F8;nsted acid-base groups, such as carboxylates and water molecules, in close proximity, usually less than 0.3 nm apart), and channels for small gaseous molecules (which can be revealed by placing the crystal under Xe, an electron-rich gas).</p>

<p class="la-indent" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Other physical methods described in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> provide less information on the overall structure but are useful for identifying ligands. Thus, EPR spectroscopy is very important for studying d-block metals, especially those engaged in redox chemistry, because at least one oxidation state usually has an unpaired electron. The use of NMR is usually restricted to proteins smaller than 20&#x2013;30 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> because tumbling rates for larger proteins are too slow and <sup>1</sup>H resonances are too broad to observe unless shifted away from the normal region (<i>&#x03B4;</i> &#x2248; 1&#x2013;10) by a paramagnetic metal centre. Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS; <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.10">Section 8.10</a>) can provide structural information on metal sites in amorphous solid samples, including frozen solutions. Vibrational spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.5">Section 8.5</a>) is increasingly being used: IR spectroscopy is particularly useful for ligands such as CO and CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and resonance Raman spectroscopy is very helpful when the metal centre has strong electronic transitions, such as occur with Fe&#x2013;porphyrins. M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.8">Section 8.8</a>) plays a special role in studies of Fe sites. Perhaps the greatest challenge is presented by Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, which has a d<sup>10</sup> configuration that provides no useful magnetic or electronic signatures (see <a href="#ch26.1j">Tutorial problems</a> at the end of this chapter).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Metal-ion binding sites can often be predicted from a gene sequence. <b>Bioinformatics</b>, the development and use of software to analyse and compare DNA sequences, is a powerful tool because many proteins that bind metal ions or have a metal-containing cofactor occur at cellular levels below that normally detectable directly by analysis and isolation. A particularly common sequence of the human genome encodes the so-called <b>Zn finger domain</b>, thereby identifying proteins that are involved in DNA binding (<a href="#sec_26.5">Section 26.5</a>). Likewise, it can be predicted whether the protein that is encoded is likely to bind Cu, Ca, an Fe&#x2013;porphyrin, or different types of Fe&#x2014;S clusters. The gene can be cloned and the protein for which it encodes can be produced in sufficiently large quantities by &#x2018;overexpression&#x2019; in suitable hosts, such as the common gut bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> or yeast, to enable it to be characterized. Furthermore, the use of genetic engineering to alter the amino acids in a protein, the technique of <b>site-directed mutagenesis</b>, is a powerful principle in biological inorganic chemistry. This technique often permits identification of the ligands to particular metal ions and the participation of other residues essential to functions such as substrate binding or proton transfer.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Although structural and spectroscopic studies give a good idea of the basic coordination environment of a metal centre, it is by no means certain that the same structure is retained in key stages of a catalytic cycle, in which unstable states are formed as intermediates. The most stable state of an enzyme, in which form it is usually isolated, is called the &#x2018;resting state&#x2019;. Many enzymes are catalytically inactive upon isolation and must be subjected to an activation procedure that may involve reinsertion of a metal ion or other cofactor or removal of an inhibitory ligand.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Intense efforts have been made to model the active sites of metalloproteins by synthesizing analogues. The models may be divided into two classes: those designed to mimic the structure and spectroscopic properties of the real site, and those synthesized with the intention of mimicking a functional activity, most obviously catalysis. Synthetic models <a id="page_773" class="page">Page 773, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>not only illuminate the chemical principles underlying biological activity but also generate new directions for coordination chemistry. As we shall see throughout this chapter, the difficulty is that an enzyme not only imposes some strain on the coordination sphere of a metal atom (even a porphyrin ring is puckered in most cases) but also provides, at fixed distances, functional groups that provide additional Coulombic and hydrogen-bonding interactions essential for binding and activating substrates. The active site of a metalloenzyme is the ultimate example of supramolecular chemistry.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">In <a href="Chapter11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a> we saw that differentiating between Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, two ions that are very similar except for their radii (102 pm and 138 pm, respectively) is achieved through their selective complexation by special ligands, such as crown ethers and cryptands, with dimensions appropriate for coordination to one particular kind of ion. Organisms use this principle in the molecules known as <b>ionophores</b>, which have hydrophobic exteriors that make them soluble in lipids. The antibiotic valinomycin (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.16">Section 11.16</a>) is an ionophore that has a high selectivity for K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which is coordinated by six carbonyl groups. It enables K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to pass through a bacterial cell membrane and thereby dissipate the electrical potential difference, so causing the bacterium&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p class="la-indent">At the higher end of the complexity scale are the ion channels, which are large membrane-spanning proteins that allow selective transport of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (as well as Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and are responsible for electrical conduction in nervous systems as well as in coupled transport of solutes.<sup><a id="ich26fn4"></a><a href="#ch26fn4">4</a></sup> <a href="#fig_26.5">Figure 26.5</a> shows the important structural aspects of the potential-gated K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel.

</aside>
<p class="la-noindent">Above the central cavity the tunnel contracts into a <b>selectivity filter</b> consisting of helical ladders of closely spaced peptide carbonyl-O donors that form a sequence of four cubic eight-fold coordination sites. During operation of the channel these sites are occupied, at any one time, by a queue of two K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions and two H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in alternate fashion, as in <sup>&#x2026;</sup>K<sup>&#x002B;&#x2026;</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>&#x2026;</sup>K<sup>&#x002B;&#x2026;</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>&#x2026;</sup>. The rate of passage of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions through the selectivity filter is close to the limit for diffusion control. A plausible mechanism for selective K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> transport (<a href="#fig_26.6">Fig. 26.6</a>) involves concerted displacement of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions between adjacent cubic carbonyl-O sites through intermediate, unstable octahedral states in which the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions are coordinated equatorially by four carbonyl&#x2013;O donors and axially by the two intervening H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. This mechanism is not effective for Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> because the cavity is too large, which accounts for the 10<sup>4</sup>-fold selectivity of the channel for K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> over Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The binding is weak and fast because it is important to convey but not to trap K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Overall, the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel acts by the mechanism illustrated in <a href="#fig_26.7">Fig. 26.7</a>. Charged groups on the molecule move in response to a change in the membrane potential and cause the intracellular pore to open, so allowing entry of hydrated K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions. Selective binding of dehydrated K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions occurs in the filter region, a potential drop across the membrane is sensed, and the cavity closes. At this point the filter opens up to the external surface, where the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentration is low and the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions are hydrated and released. This release causes the protein to switch back to the original conformation, and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions again enter the filter.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3">26.4 Calcium-signalling proteins</h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Calcium ions are suitable for signalling because they exhibit fast ligand exchange and a large, flexible coordination geometry.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Calcium ions play a crucial role in higher organisms as an intracellular messenger, providing a remarkable demonstration of how organisms have exploited the otherwise rather dull chemistry of this element. Fluxes of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> trigger enzyme action in cells in response to receiving a hormonal or electrical signal from elsewhere in the organism. Calcium is specially suited for signalling because it has fast ligand-exchange rates, intermediate binding constants, and a large, flexible coordination sphere.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Calcium-signalling proteins are small proteins that change their conformation depending upon the binding of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> at one or more sites; they are thus examples of metal-ion-activated proteins mentioned earlier. Every muscle movement we make is stimulated by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> binding to a protein known as troponin C. The best studied Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-regulatory protein is calmodulin (17 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; <a href="#fig_26.9">Fig. 26.9</a>): its roles include activating protein kinases that catalyse phosphorylation of proteins and activating NO-synthase, a Fe-containing enzyme responsible for generating the intercellular signalling molecule nitric oxide. Calmodulin has four Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-binding sites (one is shown as <b>12</b>) with dissociation constants lying close to 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>.<sup><a id="ich26fn5"></a><a href="#ch26fn5">5</a></sup> The binding of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to the four sites alters the protein conformation and it is then recognized by a target enzyme.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Calcium signalling requires special Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> pumps, which are large, membrane-spanning enzymes that pump Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> out of the cytoplasm, either out of the cell altogether or into Ca-storing organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the mitochondria. As with Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-ATPases, the energy for Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> pumping comes from ATP hydrolysis. Hormones or electrical stimuli open specific channels (analogous to K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channels) that release Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> into the cell. Because the level in the cytoplasm before the pulse is low, the influx easily raises the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> concentration above that needed for Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-binding proteins such as calmodulin (or troponin C in muscle). The action is short-lived, as after a pulse of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> the cell is quickly evacuated by the calcium pump.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Although Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is invisible to most spectroscopic methods, some Ca proteins, such as calmodulin or troponin C, are small enough to be studied by NMR. Because of their preference for large, multicarboxylate ligands, the lanthanoid ions (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>) have been used as probes for Ca binding, exploiting their properties of paramagnetism (as chemical shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy) and fluorescence. Intracellular concentrations of Ca are monitored by using special fluorescent polycarboxylate ligands (<b>13</b>) that are introduced to the cell as their esters, which are hydrophobic and able to cross the membrane lipid barrier. Once in the cell, enzymes known as esterases hydrolyse the esters and release the ligands, which respond to changes in Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> concentration in the range 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> M.</p>
<p class="la-footnote"><sup><a id="ch26fn5"></a><a href="#ich26fn5">5</a></sup> The occupation of a binding site is 50 per cent when the concentration (in mol dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) of species is equal to the dissociation constant (the reciprocal of the association constant). <a id="page_776" class="page">Page 776, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a></p>

<p class="la-noindent">The roles of Zn are either catalytic, which we will deal with later, or structural and regulatory. Unlike Ca and Mg, Zn forms more stable complexes with softer donors, so it is not surprising that it is usually found coordinated in proteins through histidine and cysteine residues. Typical catalytic sites (<b>14</b>) commonly have three permanent protein ligands and an exchangeable ligand (H<sub>2</sub>O), whereas structural Zn sites (<b>15</b>) are coordinated by four &#x2018;permanent&#x2019; protein ligands.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Transcription factors</b> are proteins that recognize certain regions of DNA and control how the genetic code is interpreted as RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins contain repeating domains that are folded in place by the binding of Zn and form characteristic folds known as &#x2018;zinc fingers&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_26.10">Fig. 26.10</a>). In a typical case, one side of the finger provides two cysteine-S donors and the other side provides two histidine-N donors and folds as an &#x03B1; helix. Each &#x2018;finger&#x2019; makes recognitory contacts with specific DNA bases. As shown in <a href="#fig_26.11">Fig. 26.11</a>, the zinc fingers wrap around sequences of DNA that they are able to recognize by acting collectively. The high fidelity of transcription factors is the result of a number of such contacts being made along the DNA chain at the beginning of the sequence that is transcribed.</p>

The lack of good spectroscopic probes for Zn, however, has meant that even though it is tightly bound in a protein, it has been difficult to confirm its binding or deduce its coordination geometry in the absence of direct structural information from X-ray diffraction or NMR.

<h3 class="la-h3">26.6 Selective transport and storage of iron</h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> The uptake of Fe into organisms involves special ligands known as siderophores; transport in the circulating fluids of higher organisms requires a protein called transferrin; Fe is stored as ferritin.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Iron is essential for almost all life forms; however, Fe is also difficult to obtain, yet any excess presents a serious toxic risk. Nature has at least two problems in dealing with this element. The first is the insolubility of Fe(III), which is the stable oxidation state found in most minerals. As the pH increases, hydrolysis, polymerization, and precipitation of hydrated forms of the oxide occur. Polymeric oxide-bridged Fe(III) is the thermodynamic sink of aerobic Fe chemistry (as seen in a Pourbaix diagram; <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.14">Section 5.14</a>). The insolubility of rust renders the straightforward uptake by a cell very difficult. The second problem is the toxicity of &#x2018;free-Fe&#x2019; species, particularly through the generation of OH radicals. To prevent Fe from reacting with oxygen species in an uncontrolled manner, a protective coordination environment is required. Nature has evolved sophisticated chemical systems to execute and regulate all aspects, from the primary acquisition of Fe to its subsequent transport, storage, and utilization in tissue. The &#x2018;Fe cycle&#x2019; as it affects a human is summarized in <a href="#fig_26.12">Fig. 26.12</a>.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(a) Siderophores</h4>
<p class="la-noindent"><b>Siderophores</b> are small, polydentate ligands that have a very high affinity for Fe(III). They are secreted from many bacterial cells into the external medium, where they sequester Fe to give a soluble complex that re-enters the organism at a specific receptor. Once inside the cell, the Fe is released.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Aside from citrate (the Fe(III) citrate complex is the simplest Fe-transport species in biology), there are two main types of siderophore. The first type is based on phenolate or <a id="page_778" class="page">Page 778, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>catecholate ligands, and is exemplified by enterobactin (<b>17</b>), for which the value of the association constant for Fe(III) is 10<sup>50</sup>, an affinity so great that enterobactin enables bacteria to erode steel bridges! The second type of siderophore is based on hydroxamate ligands, and is exemplified by ferrichrome (<b>18</b>), a cyclic hexapeptide consisting of three glycine and three <i>N</i>-hydroxyl-l-ornithines.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
<img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_15.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p class="la-indent">All Fe(III) siderophore complexes are octahedral and high-spin. Because the donor atoms are hard O or N atoms and negatively charged, they have a relatively low affinity for Fe(II). Synthetic siderophores are proving to be very useful agents for the control of &#x2018;iron overload&#x2019;, a serious condition affecting large populations of the world, particularly South Asia (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.8">Section 27.8</a>).</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(b) Iron-transport proteins in higher organisms</h4>
<p class="la-noindent">There are several important, structurally similar Fe-transport proteins known collectively as <b>transferrins</b>. The best characterized examples are serum transferrin (in blood plasma), ovotransferrin (in egg-white), and lactoferrin (in milk). The apoproteins are potent antibacterial agents as they deprive microbes of their iron. Transferrins are also present in tears, serving to cleanse eyes after irritation. All these transferrins are glycoproteins (protein molecules modified by covalently bound carbohydrate) with molar masses of about 80 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and containing two separated and equivalent binding sites for Fe. Complexation of Fe(III) at each site involves simultaneous binding of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> and release of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>:</p>

<p class="la-noindent">where TF denotes transferrin. For each site, the association constant under physiological conditions (pH &#8211; 7) is in the range 10<sup>22</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>26</sup>. However, its value depends strongly on the pH and this dependence is the main factor controlling Fe uptake and release.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Transferrin consists of two very similar parts, termed the <b>N-lobe</b> and the <b>C-lobe</b> (<a href="#fig_26.13">Fig. 26.13</a>). The protein is a product of gene duplication, because the structure of the first half of the molecule can almost be overlaid on the second half. Each half consists of two domains, 1 and 2, which together form a cleft with a binding site for Fe(III). There is a considerable proportion of &#x03B1; helix, resulting in flexibility. Complexation with Fe(III) causes a conformational change consisting of a hinge motion involving domains 1 and 2 at each lobe. Binding of Fe(III) causes the domains to come together.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In each active site (<b>19</b>), a single Fe atom is coordinated by widely dispersed amino acid side chains from both domains and the connecting region, hence the change in conformation that occurs. The <a id="page_779" class="page">Page 779, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>protein ligands are carboxylate-O (Asp), two phenolate-O (Tyr), and an imidazole-N (His). Only one of the aspartate carboxylate-O atoms is coordinated. The protein ligands form part of a distorted octahedral coordination sphere. The coordination is completed by bidentate binding to an exogenous carbonate, although in certain cases phosphate is bound instead. As expected from the predominantly anionic ligand set, Fe(III) binds much more tightly than Fe(II). However, ions similar to Fe(III), particularly Ga(III) and Al(III), also bind tightly, enabling them to use the same transport system to gain access to tissues.</p>

<h4 class="la-h4">(c) Release of iron from transferrin</h4>
<p class="la-noindent">Cells in need of Fe produce large amounts of a protein called the <b>transferrin receptor</b> (180 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), which is incorporated within their plasma membrane. This protein binds Fe-loaded transferrin. The favoured mechanism for Fe uptake involves the Fe-loaded transferrin receptor complex entering the cell by a process known as <i>endocytosis</i>. In endocytosis, a section of the cell membrane is engulfed by the wall along with its component membrane-bound proteins, to form a vesicle. The pH within this vesicle is then lowered by a membrane-bound H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-pumping enzyme that is also swallowed by the cell. The subsequent release of Fe(III) is probably linked to the coordination of carbonate, which is <b>synergistic</b> in the sense that it is necessary for the binding of Fe but is unstable at low pH. Indeed, from <i>in vitro</i> studies it is known that Fe is released by lowering the pH to about 5 for serum transferrin and to 2&#x2013;3 for lactoferrin. The vesicle then splits and the TF-receptor complex is returned to the plasma membrane by <b>exocytosis</b>, and Fe(III), probably now complexed by citrate, is released to the cytoplasm.</p>

<h4 class="la-h4">(d) Ferritin, the cellular Fe store</h4>
<p class="la-noindent">Ferritin is the principal store of non-haem Fe in animals (most Fe is occupied in haemoglobin and myoglobin) and, when fully loaded, contains 20 per cent Fe by mass! It occurs in all types of organisms, from mammals to prokaryotes. In mammals, it is found particularly in the spleen and in blood. Ferritins have two components, a &#x2018;mineral&#x2019; core that contains up to 4500 Fe atoms (mammalian ferritin) and a protein shell. Apoferritin (the protein shell devoid of Fe) can be prepared by treatment of ferritin with reducing agents and an Fe(II) chelating ligand (such as 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridyl). Dialysis then yields the intact shell.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Apoferritins have average molar masses in the range 460 to 550 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The protein shell (<a href="#fig_26.14">Fig. 26.14</a>) consists of 24 subunits that link together to form a hollow sphere with two-fold, three-fold (as shown in the illustration), and four-fold symmetry axes. Each subunit consists of a bundle of four long and one short &#x03B1; helices, with a loop that forms a section of &#x03B2; sheet with a neighbouring subunit. The mineral core is composed of hydrated Fe(III) oxide with varying amounts of phosphate, which helps anchor it to the internal surface. The structure as revealed by X-ray or electron diffraction resembles that of the mineral ferrihydrite, 5Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x22C5;9H<sub>2</sub>O, which is based on an hcp array of O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions, with Fe(III) layered in both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">The three-fold and four-fold symmetry axes of apoferritin are, respectively, hydrophilic and hydrophobic pores. The three-fold-axis pores are suited for the passage of ions. However, the ferrihydrite core is insoluble and Fe must be mobilized. The most feasible <a id="page_780" class="page">Page 780, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>mechanism so far proposed for the reversible incorporation of Fe in ferritin involves its transport in and out as Fe(II), perhaps as the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion, which is soluble at neutral pH, but more likely as some type of &#x2018;chaperone&#x2019; complex. Oxidation to Fe(III) is thought to occur at specific di-iron binding sites known as <b>ferroxidase centres</b>, present in each of the subunits.

<p class="la-noindent">Dioxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, is a special molecule that has not always been available to biology; in fact, to many life forms it is highly toxic. As the waste product of oxygenic photosynthesis that began with cyanobacteria more than 2 Ga ago, O<sub>2</sub> is a biogenic substance (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#sec_16.4">Section 16.4</a>), owing its existence to solar-energy capture by living organisms. As we shall see in <a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>, the great thermodynamic advantage of having such a powerful oxidant available undoubtedly led to the evolution of higher organisms that now dominate Earth. Indeed, the requirement for O<sub>2</sub> became so important as to necessitate special systems for transporting and storing it. Apart from the difficulty in supplying O<sub>2</sub> to buried tissue, there is the problem of achieving a sufficiently high concentration in aqueous environments. This problem is overcome by special metalloproteins known as <b>O<sub>2</sub> carriers</b>. In mammals and most other animals and plants, these special proteins (myoglobin and haemoglobin) contain an Fe&#x2013;porphyrin cofactor. Animals such as molluscs and arthropods use a Cu protein called haemocyanin, and some lower invertebrates use an alternative type of Fe protein, hemerythrin, which contains a dinuclear Fe site.</p>

<h4 class="la-h4">(b) Haemoglobin</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> <b>Haemoglobin consists of a tetramer of myoglobin-like subunits, with four Fe sites that bind O</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> <b>cooperatively</b>.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Haemoglobin (Hb, 68 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; <a href="#fig_26.18">Fig. 26.18</a>) is the O<sub>2</sub>-transport protein found in special cells known as <i>erythrocytes</i> (red blood cells): a litre of human blood contains about 150 g of Hb. Simplistically, Hb can be thought of as a tetramer of myoglobin-like units with a cavity in the middle. There are in fact two types of Mb-like subunits, which differ slightly in their structures, and Hb is referred to as an <b>&#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> tetramer</b>.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The O<sub>2</sub> binding curves for Mb and Hb are compared in <a href="#fig_26.19">Fig. 26.19</a>: the sigmoidal curve for Hb indicates that uptake and release of successive O<sub>2</sub> molecules is cooperative. At low O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and greater acidity (as in venous blood and muscle tissue following aggressive exercise), Hb has a low affinity, which enables it to transfer its O<sub>2</sub> to Mb. As the pressure increases, so does the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> and as a result Hb can pick up O<sub>2</sub> in the lungs. This change in affinity is attributed to there being two conformations. The <b>tensed state</b> (T) has a low affinity and the <b>relaxed state</b> (R) has a high affinity. Deoxy-Hb is T and fully loaded oxy-Hb is R.</p>
<p class="la-indent">A model for the molecular basis of cooperativity arises by considering that binding of the first O<sub>2</sub> molecule to the T-state molecule is weak, but the resulting decrease in the size of the Fe allows it to move into the plane of the porphyrin ring (<a href="#fig_26.16">Fig. 26.16</a>). This motion is particularly important for Hb because it pulls on the proximal histidine ligand and helix F moves. This movement is transmitted to the other O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites, the effect being to push the other Fe atoms closer to their respective ring planes and thereby convert the protein into the R state. The way is thereby opened for them to bind O<sub>2</sub>, which they now do with greater ease, although the statistical probability decreases as saturation is approached.</p>

Rapid and reversible coordination of O<sub>2</sub> occurs between the two Cu atoms in a bridging dihapto manner (&#x03BC;-&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>,&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>) and the low vibrational wavenumber of the coordinated O<sub>2</sub> molecule (750 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) shows it has been reduced to peroxide <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> with an accompanying lowering of the bond order from 2 to 1.

<p class="la-indent">Haemerythrin is an example of a special class of dinuclear Fe centres that are found in a number of proteins with diverse functions, such as methane monooxygenase and some ribonucleotide reductases and acid phosphatases. The two Fe atoms in the active site of haemerythrin (<b>21</b>) are each coordinated by amino acid side chains but are also linked by two bridging carboxylate groups and a small ligand. In the reduced (Fe(II)) form, which binds O<sub>2</sub> reversibly, this small ligand is an OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion. Coordination of O<sub>2</sub> occurs at only one of the Fe atoms, and the distal O atom forms a hydrogen bond to the H atom of the bridging hydroxide.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Much effort has been spent on synthesizing simple complexes that coordinate O<sub>2</sub> reversibly and could be used as blood substitutes in special circumstances, such as emergency surgery. The problem is that although O<sub>2</sub> reacts with d-block metal ions to form complexes in which the O&#x2014;O bond is retained (as in superoxo and peroxo species) these products tend to undergo irreversible decomposition involving rapid O&#x2014;O bond cleavage and formation of water or oxides. Overcoming this problem requires complexes designed to protect the coordinated O&#x2014;O ligand, preventing it from reacting further. Sterically hindered Fe(II) complexes such as the &#x2018;basket&#x2019; porphyrin (<b>22</b>) achieve this protection by preventing a second Fe(II) complex from attacking the distal O atom of the superoxo species to form a bridged peroxo intermediate. As we shall see in <a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>, peroxo complexes of Fe(III) tend to undergo rapid O&#x2014;O bond proteolysis, resulting in formation of H<sub>2</sub>O and Fe(IV)&#8211;aO.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Simple Cu complexes that can coordinate O<sub>2</sub> reversibly are also rare, but studies have revealed interesting chemistry that is particularly relevant for developing catalysts for oxygenation reactions. Analogues of the dinuclear Cu(I) centre of haemocyanin react with O<sub>2</sub> but have a strong tendency to undergo further reactions that involve cleavage of the O&#x2013;O bond, an example being the rapid equilibrium between &#x03BC;-&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>,&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup> peroxo-dicopper(II) and bis(&#x03BC;-oxo)copper(III) complexes shown in <a href="#fig_26.21">Fig. 26.21</a>.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">In all but a few interesting cases, the energy for life stems ultimately from the Sun, either directly in photosynthesis or indirectly by the acquisition of energy-rich compounds (fuel) from photosynthesizing organisms. Energy can be acquired as a flow of electrons from fuel to oxidant. Important fuels include fats, sugars, and H<sub>2</sub>, and important biological oxidants include O<sub>2</sub>, nitrate, and even H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. As seen from <a href="#fig_26.22">Fig. 26.22</a>, oxidation of sugars by O<sub>2</sub> provides a lot of energy (up to 6 eV for the four-electron reaction), and is the reason for the success of aerobic organisms over the anaerobic ones that once dominated the Earth.</p>

These enzymes are generally bound in a membrane, across which the energy from ET is used to sustain a transmembrane proton gradient: this is the basis of the <b>chemiosmotic theory</b>. The counterflow of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, through a rotating enzyme known as ATP synthase, drives the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Many membrane-bound redox enzymes are <b>electrogenic proton pumps</b>, which means they directly couple long-range ET to proton transfer through specific internal channels.</p>
<p class="la-indent">We shall examine the properties of the three main types of ET centre. The same rules concerning outer-sphere electron transfer that were discussed in <a href="Chapter21.xhtml#sec_21.12">Section 21.12</a> apply to metal centres in proteins, and we should note that organisms have optimized the structures and properties of these centres to achieve efficient long-range electron transfer.</p>

<p class="la-indent">In the following discussion it will be useful to keep in mind that reduction potentials depend on several factors (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). Besides ionization energy and ligand environment (strong donors stabilize high oxidation states and lower the reduction potential; weak donors, &#x03C0; acceptors, and protons stabilize low oxidation states and raise the reduction potential), an active site in a protein is also influenced by the relative permittivity (which stabilizes centres with low overall charge), the presence of neighbouring charges, including those provided by other bound metal ions, and the availability of hydrogen-bonding interactions that will also stabilize reduced states.</p>
<p class="la-indent">When we consider the kinetics of electron transfer, it will similarly be useful to keep in mind that &#x2018;efficiency&#x2019; means that electron transfer is fast even when the reaction Gibbs energy is low and therefore that the reorganization energy <i>&#x03BB;</i> of Marcus theory (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#sec_21.12">Section 21.12</a>) is low. This requirement is met by providing a ligand environment that does not alter significantly when an electron is added and by burying the site so that water molecules are excluded. Intersite distances are generally less than 1.4 nm in order to facilitate electron tunneling, although it is still debated whether electron transfer in proteins depends mainly on distance alone or whether the protein can provide special pathways.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="la-noindent">Cytochromes were identified many years ago as cell pigments (hence the name). They contain an Fe&#x2013;porphyrin group, and the term &#x2018;cytochrome&#x2019; can refer to both an individual protein and a subunit of a larger enzyme that contains the cofactor. Cytochromes use the Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>/Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> couple and are generally six-coordinate (<b>23, 24</b>), with two stable axial bonds to amino acid donors, and the Fe is usually low-spin in both oxidation states. This contrasts with ligand-binding Fe&#x2013;porphyrin proteins such as haemoglobin, for which the sixth coordination site is either empty or occupied by an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule.</p>
<p class="la-indent">A good way to consider the capability of cytochromes for fast electron transfer is to treat the d orbitals of Fe(III) and Fe(II) in terms of an octahedral ligand field and to consider the overlap between the electron-rich but nearly nonbonding t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals (the configurations are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>5</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>t</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>6</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> in Fe(III) and Fe(II), respectively) and the orbitals of the porphyrin. The electron enters or leaves an orbital having &#x03C0; overlap with the &#x03C0;&#x002A; antibonding molecular orbital on the ring system. This arrangement provides enhanced electron transfer because the d orbitals of the Fe atom are effectively extended out to the edge of the porphyrin ring, so decreasing the distance over which an electron must transfer between redox partners (<a href="#fig_26.24">Fig. 26.24</a>).</p>

The fifth and sixth ligands to Fe in cytochrome <i>c</i> are histidine (imidazole-N) and methionine (thioether-S, <b>23</b>). Methionine is not a common ligand in metalloproteins but because it is a neutral, soft donor it is expected to stabilize Fe(II) rather than Fe(III).

Examples are known in which one or more of the Fe atoms is coordinated by non-thiolate amino acid ligands, such as carboxylate, imidazole, or alkoxyl (serine), or by an exogenous ligand such as H<sub>2</sub>O or OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and the coordination number about the Fe subsite may be increased to 6. The cubane [4Fe-4S] (<b>26</b>) and cuboidal [3Fe-4S] (<b>27</b>) clusters are obviously closely related, and may even interconvert within a protein by the addition or removal of Fe from one subsite. Larger clusters also occur, such as the &#x2018;super clusters&#x2019; [8Fe-7S] and [Mo7Fe-9S,C] found in nitrogenase (<a href="#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Iron&#x2013;sulfur clusters are excellent examples of mixed-valence systems. The redox state of a cluster is represented by summing the charges due to Fe (3&#x002B; or 2 &#x002B; , respectively) and S atoms (2&#x2212;), and the resultant overall charge, which is referred to as the <b>oxidation level</b>, is written as a superscript. Despite the presence of more than one Fe atom, FeS clusters are generally restricted to single-electron transfers.</p>

<p class="la-indent">The half-reactions have been written to include the spin states of FeS clusters: individual Fe atoms are high-spin, as expected for tetrahedral coordination by S<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, and different magnetic states arise from ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>).

<p class="la-indent">Most FeS centres have negative reduction potentials (usually more negative than 0 V) so the reduced forms are good reducing agents: exceptions are [4Fe-4S] clusters that operate instead between the &#x002B;3 and &#x002B;2 oxidation states (these are called &#x2018;HiPIP&#x2019; centres because they were originally discovered in a protein called <i>high-potential iron protein</i> for which the reduction potential is 0.35 V) and so-called <b>Rieske centres</b>, which are [2Fe-2S] clusters having one Fe subsite coordinated by two neutral imidazole ligands rather than by cysteine (<b>28</b>).</p>

<p class="la-boxpara">An interesting type of Fe&#x2014;S cluster that has recently been discovered has an unusual [4Fe-3S] core that is coordinated by six cysteines rather than four. The sulfur atom of one of the extra cysteines bridges two Fe atoms, replacing one of the &#x03BC;<sub>3</sub> sulfido atoms that would normally be present. The resulting cluster is more pliable and, in addition to the normal redox couple, a second, fully reversible electron transfer occurs at a slightly higher potential. The &#x2018;superoxidized&#x2019; form of the cluster (<b>29</b>) contains a localized Fe(III) that is <a id="page_787" class="page">Page 787, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>coordinated by an adjacent peptide N that has become deprotonated during the oxidation process.

<p class="la-boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> We need to consider the severe Coulombic restriction that is placed on a redox-active centre inside a protein molecule. Whereas altering the charge by one unit can be accommodated, altering the charge by two units within such a low dielectric medium is prohibitive. The [4Fe&#x2013;3S] cluster circumvents this problem because removal of the second electron is electrostatically compensated by removal of a proton from the same locality. The deprotonated peptide-N atom is an excellent donor ligand that stabilizes Fe(III).</p>

This process has been studied mostly in prokaryotes, from which it is known that specific proteins are involved in the supply and transport of Fe and S atoms, their assembly into clusters, and their transfer to target proteins. Free sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S, HS<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, or S<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) in a cell is highly poisonous, so it is produced only when required by an enzyme called cysteine desulfurase, which breaks down cysteine to yield S<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions and alanine.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The so-called &#x2018;blue&#x2019; Cu centre is the active site of a number of small electron-transfer proteins as well as larger enzymes (the blue Cu oxidases) that also contain other Cu sites. Blue Cu centres have reduction potentials for the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple that lie in the range 0.15&#x2013;0.7 V and so they are generally more oxidizing than cytochromes. The name stems from the intense blue colour of pure samples in the oxidized state, which arises from ligand(thiolate)-to-metal charge transfer. In all cases, the Cu is shielded from solvent water and coordinated by a minimum of two imidazole-N and one cysteine-S in a nearly trigonal planar manner, with one or two longer bonds to axial ligands. The most studied examples are plastocyanin (<a href="#fig_26.28">Fig. 26.28</a>), a small electron carrier protein in chloroplasts, and azurin, a bacterial electron carrier. These small proteins have a &#x2018;&#x03B2;-barrel&#x2019; structure, in which a barrel of &#x03B2;-sheet holds the Cu coordination sphere in a rigid geometry. Indeed, the crystal structures of oxidized, reduced (<b>30</b>), and apo forms reveal that the ligands remain in essentially the same position in all cases. As a result, the blue Cu centre is well suited to undergo fast and efficient electron transfer because the reorganization energy is small.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3a">Catalytic processes</h3>
<p class="la-noindent">The classic role of enzymes is as highly selective catalysts for the myriad chemical reactions that take place in organisms and sustain the activities of life. In this section we view some of the most important examples in terms of the suitability of certain elements for their roles.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_26.9">
<h3 class="la-h3">26.9 Acid&#8211;base catalysis</h3>
<p class="la-noindent">Biological systems rarely have the extreme pH conditions under which catalysis by free H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> can occur; indeed, the result would be indiscriminate because all hydrolysable bonds would be targets. One way that organisms have solved this problem has been to harness properties of certain metal ions and build them into protein structures designed to accomplish specific (Br&#x00F8;nsted) acid&#x2013;base reactions (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.1">Section 4.1</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Organisms make extensive use of Zn for achieving acid&#x2013;base catalysis, but not to the exclusion of other metals. For example, in addition to the numerous enzymes that feature Fe(II) and Fe(III), Mg(II) serves as the catalyst in pyruvate kinase (phosphate ester hydrolysis) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation into organic molecules), Mn is the catalyst in arginase (for the hydrolysis of arginine, yielding urea and <small>L</small>-ornithine), and Ni(II) is the active metal in urease (for the hydrolysis of urea, yielding ammonia and, ultimately, carbon dioxide), an enzyme that is crucial for the virulence of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, a notorious human pathogen (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.3">Section 27.3</a>). Because of their importance to industry and medicine, many of these enzymes have been studied in great detail, and model systems have been synthesized in efforts to reproduce catalytic properties and understand the mode of action of inhibitors. Many of these sites (including arginase-[Mn,Mn] and urease-[Ni,Ni]) contain two or more metal ions in an arrangement unique to the protein and difficult to model with simple ligands.</p>
<h4 class="la-h4">(a) Zinc enzymes</h4>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Zinc is well suited for catalysing acid&#x2013;base reactions as it is abundant, redox-inactive, forms strong bonds to donor groups of amino acid residues, and exogenous ligands such as H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O are exchanged rapidly.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">A Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion has high rates of ligand exchange and its polarizing power means that the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of a coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is quite low. Combined with strong binding to protein ligands, rapid ligand exchange (coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O or substrate molecules), a reasonably high electron affinity, flexibility of coordination geometry, and no complicating redox chemistry, Zn is well suited to its role in catalysing specific acid&#x2013;base reactions. The large family of Zn enzymes include carbonic anhydrase, carboxypeptidases, alkaline <a id="page_789" class="page">Page 789, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>phosphatase, &#x03B2;-lactamase (responsible for penicillin resistance in bacteria), and alcohol dehydrogenase. Typically, the Zn is coordinated by three amino acid ligands (in contrast to zinc fingers, which have four) and one exchangeable H<sub>2</sub>O molecule (<b>14</b>).</p>

<p class="la-indent">The mechanisms of Zn enzymes are normally discussed in terms of two limiting cases. In the <b>Zn&#x2013;hydroxide mechanism</b>, the Zn functions by promoting deprotonation of a bound water molecule, so creating an optimally positioned OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> nucleophile that can go on to attack the carbonyl C atom:</p>

<p class="la-noindent" style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_1549.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="la-noindent">In the <b>Zn&#x2013;carbonyl mechanism</b>, the Zn ion acts directly as a Lewis acid to accept an electron pair from the carbonyl O atom, and its role is therefore analogous to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in acid catalysis:</p>

<p class="la-noindent" style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="../images/he_9780199641826_graphic_1550.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="la-noindent">Similar reactions occur with other X=aO groups, particularly the P=aO of phosphate esters. There is an obvious advantage to achieving such catalysis at Zn or some other acid species that is anchored in a stereoselective environment.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The formation and transport of CO<sub>2</sub> is a fundamental process in biology. The solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in water depends upon its hydration and deprotonation to form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> However, the uncatalysed reaction at pH &#8211; 7 is very slow, the forward process occurring with a rate constant of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Because turnover of CO<sub>2</sub> by biological systems is very high, such a rate is far too slow to sustain vigorous aerobic life in a complex organism. In photosynthesis, only CO<sub>2</sub> can be used by the enzyme known as <i>rubisco</i> (<a href="#sec_26.9">Section 26.9b</a>), so rapid dehydration of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> is essential and is one of the first steps in the production of biomass.

<p class="la-indent">Carbonic anhydrase (CA, or carbon dioxide dehydratase) catalyses this reaction with a rate enhancement well above 10<sup>6</sup>. There are several forms of CA, all of which are monomers with molar mass close to 30 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> containing one Zn atom. The best-studied enzyme is CA II from red blood cells, which has a turnover frequency for CO<sub>2</sub> hydration of about 10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, making it one of the most active of all enzymes. The crystal structure of human CA II shows that the Zn atom is located in a conical cavity about 1.6 nm deep, which is lined with several histidine residues. The Zn is coordinated by three His-N ligands and one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule in a tetrahedral arrangement (<a href="#fig_26.29">Fig. 26.29</a>). The neutral N-ligands lower the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the bound H<sub>2</sub>O by about 3 units (compared to the aqua ion), thus creating an extremely high local concentration of OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> as attacking nucleophile. Other groups in the active site pocket, including noncoordinating histidines and ordered water molecules, are important for mediating proton transfer (the rate-limiting factor) and for binding the CO<sub>2</sub> substrate (which does not coordinate to Zn). Carbonic anhydrases show some variation in their Zn coordination environment, with some CAs from higher plants having two cysteines and one histidine.</p>

</aside>
<p class="la-indent">The mechanism of action of CA (<a href="#fig_26.30">Fig. 26.30</a>) is best described in terms of a Zn&#x2013;hydroxide mechanism. Rapid proton transfers are aided by a hydrogen bonding network that extends from the protein surface to the active site. The key feature is the acidity of the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule coordinated to Zn, as the coordinated HO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion that is produced after deprotonation is sufficiently nucleophilic to attack a nearby CO<sub>2</sub> molecule bound noncovalently. This attack results in a coordinated <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> ion, which is then released. Small analogues of CA that have been studied, such as (<b>32</b>), reproduce the substrate binding and acid&#x2013;base properties of the enzyme, but their catalytic activity is orders of magnitude lower.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Carboxypeptidase (CPD, 34.6 kg mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) is an exopeptidase, an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of C-terminal amino acids containing an aromatic or bulky aliphatic side chain. There are two types of Zn-containing enzyme, and both are synthesized as inactive precursors in the pancreas for secretion into the digestive tract. The better studied is CPD A, which acts upon terminal aromatic residues, whereas CPD B acts upon basic residues. The X-ray structure of CPD shows that the Zn is located to one side of a groove in which the substrate is bound. It is coordinated by two histidine-N ligands, one <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>glutamate-CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> (bidentate), and one weakly bound H<sub>2</sub>O molecule (<a href="#fig_26.31">Fig. 26.31</a>). Structures of the enzyme <a id="page_790" class="page">Page 790, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>obtained in the presence of glycyl inhibitors show that the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule has moved away from the Zn atom, which has become coordinated instead to the carbonyl-O of the glycine, suggesting a Zn&#x2013;carbonyl mechanism. The guanidinium group of a nearby arginine binds the terminal carboxyl group, while the tyrosine provides aromatic/hydrophobic recognition.</p>

<p class="la-indent">An important example of an Mg enzyme in which Mg acts separately from ATP is rubisco (1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase). This enzyme, the most abundant in the biosphere, is responsible for the production of biomass by oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (to the extent globally, of over 10<sup>11</sup> t of CO<sub>2</sub> per year). Rubisco is an enzyme of the <b>Calvin cycle</b>, the stages of photosynthesis that can occur in the dark, in which it catalyses the incorporation of CO<sub>2</sub> into a molecule of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (<a href="#fig_26.32">Fig. 26.32</a>).</p>

<p class="la-indent">The Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion is octahedrally coordinated by carboxylate groups from glutamate and aspartate residues, three coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, and a carbamate derived from a lysine residue. The carbamate is formed by a reaction between CO<sub>2</sub> and the terminal &#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>, in an activation process that is necessary in order for Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to bind. In the catalytic cycle, the binding of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate displaces two H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, and proton abstraction assisted by the carbamate results in a coordinated enolate. This intermediate reacts with CO<sub>2</sub>, forming a new C&#x2014;C bond, then the product is cleaved to yield two new three-carbon species and the cycle continues. The reactive enolate will also react with O<sub>2</sub>, in which case the result is an oxidative degradation of substrate: for this reason the enzyme is often called ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase. We note the contrast with Zn, which would favour ligation by softer ligands and a lower coordination number.

<p class="la-noindent">Acid phosphatases, sometimes known as &#x2018;purple&#x2019; acid phosphatases (PAPs) on account of their intense colour, occur in various mammalian organs, particularly the bovine spleen and porcine uterus. Acid phosphatases catalyse hydrolysis of phosphate esters, with optimal activity under mild acid conditions. They are involved in bone maintenance and hydrolysis of phosphorylated proteins (therefore they are important in signalling). They may also have other functions such as Fe transport. The pink or purple colours of acid phosphatases are due to a tyrosinate &#x2192; Fe(III) charge-transfer transition at 510&#x2013;550 nm (<i>&#x03B5;</i> &#8211; 4000 dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The active site contains two Fe atoms linked by ligands, similar to haemerythrin (<b>21</b>). Acid phosphatases are inactive in the oxidized &#123;Fe(III)Fe(III)&#125; state in which they are often isolated. In the active state, one Fe is reduced to Fe(II). Both Fe atoms are high-spin and remain so throughout the various stages of reactions.</p>

The FeZn centre is also found in an important enzyme called <i>calcineurin</i>, which catalyses the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on certain protein surfaces, in particular a transcription factor involved in controlling the immune response. Calcineurin is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> binding, both directly and through calmodulin.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Aconitase is an essential enzyme of the <b>tricarboxylic acid cycle</b> (also known as the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle), the main source of energy production in higher organisms, where it catalyses the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate in a reaction that formally involves dehydration and rehydration, and proceeds through an intermediate, aconitate, which is released in small amounts: The active form of the enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which degrades to [3Fe-4S] when the enzyme is exposed to air.

<p class="la-noindent">The intense chemical interest in these enzymes lies in the fact that they are the best examples of Fe(IV) complexes. Iron(IV) is an important catalytic intermediate in numerous biological processes involving oxygen. Catalase, which catalyses the thermodynamically favourable disproportionation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and is one of the most active enzymes known, is also a peroxidase. The active site of yeast cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase shown in <a href="#fig_26.34">Fig. 26.34</a> indicates how the substrate is manipulated during the catalytic cycle. The proximal ligand is the imidazole side chain of a histidine and the distal pocket, like myoglobin, also contains an imidazole side chain, but there is also a guanidinium group from arginine.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The catalytic cycle shown in <a href="#fig_26.35">Fig. 26.35</a> starts from the Fe(III) form. A molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> coordinates to Fe(III) and the distal histidine mediates proton transfer so that both H atoms are placed on the remote O atom. The simultaneous bond polarization by the guanidinium <a id="page_794" class="page">Page 794, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>side chain results in heterolytic cleavage of the O&#8211;O bond: one half leaves as H<sub>2</sub>O and the other remains bound to the Fe atom to produce a highly oxidizing intermediate. Although it is instructive to regard this system as a trapped O atom (or an O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion bound to Fe(V)), detailed measurements by EPR and M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectroscopy show this highly oxidizing intermediate (known historically as &#x2018;Compound I&#x2019;) to be an Fe(IV)&#8211;aO (ferryl) entity with an organic cation radical. In HRP the radical is located on the porphyrin ring whereas in CcP it is located on nearby peptide residue tryptophan-191. Descriptions of the Fe&#8211;O bonding range from Fe(IV)&#8211;aO, having a multiple bond, to Fe(IV)&#8211;O<sup>&#x2026;</sup>H, in which the O atom is either protonated or linked by a hydrogen bond to a donor group.

<p class="la-noindent">The Fe enzymes are divided into two main classes, haem and non-haem. We discuss the haem enzymes first, the most important type being cytochrome P450.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Cytochrome P450 (or just &#x2018;P450&#x2019;) refers to an important and widely distributed group of haem-containing monooxygenases. In eukaryotes, they are localized particularly in mitochondria, <a id="page_797" class="page">Page 797, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>and in higher animals they are concentrated in liver tissue. They play an essential role in biosynthesis (for example, steroid transformations) such as the production of progesterone. The designation &#x2018;P450&#x2019; arises from the intense absorption band that appears at 450 nm when solutions containing the enzyme or even crude tissue extracts are treated with a reducing agent and carbon monoxide, which produces the Fe(II)&#8211;CO complex. Most P450s are complex membrane-bound enzymes that are difficult to isolate. Much of what we know about them stems from studies carried out with an enzyme, P450cam, which is isolated from the bacterium <i>Psuedomonas putida</i>. This organism uses camphor as its sole source of carbon, and the first stage is exo oxygenation of the 5-position:</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The catalytic cycle has been studied using a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic methods (<a href="#fig_26.38">Fig. 26.38</a>). Starting from the resting enzyme, which is Fe(III), the binding of the substrate in the active site pocket (1) induces release of the coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. This step is detected as a change in spin state from low-spin <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy='false'>(</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'> <mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle> <mo stretchy='false'>)</mo></mrow></math> to high-spin <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy='false'>(</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'> <mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle> <mo stretchy='false'>)</mo></mrow></math> and the reduction potential increases, causing an electron to be transferred (2) from a small [2Fe-2S]-containing protein known as putidaredoxin. The five-coordinate Fe(II) that is formed resembles deoxymyoglobin and binds O<sub>2</sub> (3). Unlike in myoglobin, addition of a second electron is both thermodynamically and kinetically favourable. The subsequent reactions (4&#x2013;6) are very fast, but it is thought that an Fe(III) peroxide intermediate is formed that undergoes rapid heterolytic O&#8211;O cleavage to produce a ferryl species similar to Compound I of peroxidases. In what is known as the <b>oxygen rebound mechanism</b>, the Fe(IV)&#8211;aO group abstracts an H atom from the substrate and then inserts it back as an OH radical. This process is remarkable, as it amounts to the &#x2018;taming&#x2019; of an O atom or OH radical by its attachment to Fe.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Other P450s are thought to operate by similar mechanisms but differ in the architecture of the active site pocket. The P450 active site, unlike that in peroxidases, is predominantly hydrophobic, with specific polar groups present to orient the organic substrate so the correct R&#x2013;H bond is brought close to the Fe=aO entity.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Non-haem oxygenases are widely distributed and are usually dioxygenases. Most contain a single Fe atom at the active site and are classified according to whether the active species in the protein is Fe(III) or Fe(II). In the Fe(III) enzymes, which are also (historically) known as <b>intradiol oxygenases</b>, the Fe atom functions as a Lewis acid catalyst and activates the organic substrate towards attack by noncoordinating O<sub>2</sub>: <a id="page_798" class="page">Page 798, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a></p>

</figure>
<p class="la-noindent">The Fe(III) enzymes are exemplified by protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase: the Fe is high-spin and tightly coordinated by a set of protein ligands that includes two His-N and two Tyr-O, the latter hard donors being particularly suitable for stabilizing Fe(III) relative to Fe(II). The Fe(III) enzymes are deep red in colour, due to an intense tyrosinate-to-Fe(III) charge-transfer transition. The Fe(II) enzymes are exemplified by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in which high-spin Fe(II) is coordinated within the protein by a set of ligands that includes two His-N and one carboxylate group. The Fe is quite labile, reflecting the low position of Fe(II) in the Irving&#x2013;Williams series (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>). The weak binding, together with the difficulty of observing useful spectroscopic features (such as EPR spectra), makes the Fe(II) enzymes much more difficult to study than the Fe(III) enzymes.</p>

</figure>
<p class="la-noindent">The principle of <b>oxo-glutarate-dependent oxygenases</b> is that the transfer of one O atom of O<sub>2</sub> to 2-oxoglutarate (also known as &#x03B1;-ketoglutarate) results in its irreversible decarboxylation, thus driving insertion of the other O atom into the primary substrate. Examples include enzymes that serve in cell signalling by modifying an amino acid in certain transcription factors (<a href="#sec_26.15">Section 26.15</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Oxygenases play a crucial role in the metabolism of methane, a greenhouse gas. Of all hydrocarbons, methane contains the strongest C&#8211;H bonds and is the most difficult to activate. Methane-metabolizing bacteria produce two types of enzyme that catalyse the conversion of methane to methanol (a more useful chemical and fuel) and thus attract much industrial interest. One is a membrane-bound enzyme that contains Cu atoms. This enzyme, known as &#x2018;particulate&#x2019; methane monooxygenase (p-mmo), is expressed when high levels of Cu are available. The other enzyme, soluble methane monooxygenase (s-mmo), contains a dinuclear Fe active site (<b>41</b>) that is related to haemerythrin (<b>21</b>) and acid phosphatase (<b>34</b>). The mechanisms are not established but <a href="#fig_26.39">Fig. 26.39</a> shows a plausible catalytic cycle for s-mmo. The intermediate Fe(IV) species that is proposed differs from those we have encountered up to now, as the O<sub>2</sub>-derived oxido ligands are bridging rather than terminal.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Despite the importance of Fe(IV) as an enzyme intermediate, small Fe(IV) complexes that could provide important models for understanding the enzymes have been elusive.

<p class="la-noindent"><b>Photosynthesis</b> is the production of organic molecules using solar energy. It is conveniently divided into the <b>light reactions</b> (the processes by which electromagnetic energy is trapped) and the <b>dark reactions</b> (in which the energy acquired in the light reactions is used to convert CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O into carbohydrates). We have already mentioned the most important of the dark reactions, the incorporation of CO<sub>2</sub> into organic molecules, which is catalysed by rubisco. In this section, we describe some of the roles that metals play in the light reactions.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The basic principle of photochemical energy capture, applied in a technology to produce H<sub>2</sub> from water, was described in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a> (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box_10.3">Box 10.3</a>). We can view photosynthesis in an analogous way in that H<sub>2</sub> is &#x2018;stored&#x2019; by reaction with CO<sub>2</sub>. In biology, photons from the Sun excite pigments present in giant membrane-bound proteins known as <b>photosystems</b>. The most important pigment, the familiar green-coloured chlorophyll, is a Mg complex that is very similar to a porphyrin (<b>8</b>). Most chlorophyll is located in giant proteins known as <b>light-harvesting antennae</b>, the name perfectly describing their function, which is to collect photons and funnel their energy to enzymes that convert it into electrochemical energy. This energy conversion uses further chlorophyll complexes that become powerful reducing agents when excited by light. Each electron released by excited chlorophyll travels rapidly down a sequence of protein-bound acceptors, including FeS clusters, and (through the agency of ferredoxin and other redox enzymes) is eventually used to reduce H&#x002B; (from H2O) and CO2 to carbohydrate. Immediately after releasing an electron, the chlorophyll cation, a powerful oxidant, must be rapidly reduced by using an electron from another site to avoid wasting the energy by recombination (simple reversal of electron flow). In &#x2018;oxygenic&#x2019; photosynthesis, which occurs in green algae, in cyanobacteria, and most importantly in green plants, each such &#x2018;restoring&#x2019; electron is provided from a water molecule resulting in production of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="la-indent">In green plants, photosynthesis occurs in special organelles known as <i>chloroplasts</i>. Plant chloroplasts have two photosystems, I and II, operating in series, that allow low-energy light (approximately 680&#x2013;700 nm, &#x003E;1 eV) to span the large potential range (&#x003E;1 V) within which water is stable. The arrangement of proteins is depicted in <a href="#fig_26.40">Fig. 26.40</a>. Some of the energy of the photosynthetic electron-transfer chain is used to generate a transmembrane <a id="page_801" class="page">Page 801, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>proton gradient which in turn drives the synthesis of ATP, as in mitochondria. Photosystem I lies at the low-potential end, its electron donor the blue Cu protein plastocyanin that has been reduced using the electrons generated by photosystem II; in turn, the electron donor to photosystem II is H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus green plants dispose of the oxidizing power by converting H<sub>2</sub>O into O<sub>2</sub>. This four-electron reaction is remarkable because no intermediates are released. The catalyst, called the &#x2018;oxygen-evolving centre&#x2019; (OEC) also has a special significance because its action, commencing over 2 Ga ago, has provided essentially all the O<sub>2</sub> we have in the atmosphere. The OEC is the only enzyme active site known to produce an O&#8211;O bond from two H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, and there is much interest in producing functional models of this catalyst for photochemical water-splitting (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#box16.1">Box 16.1</a>)</p>

<p class="la-indent">The OEC is a metal-oxide cluster, containing four Mn atoms and one Ca atom that is located in subunit D1 of photosystem II. Subunit D1 has long attracted interest because the cell replaces it at frequent intervals as it quickly becomes worn out by oxidative damage. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data show that the metal atoms are arranged as a [3MnCa-4O] cubane linked to a fourth Mn to give a [4MnCa-5O] &#x2018;chair-like&#x2019; cluster (<a href="#fig_26.41">Fig. 26.41</a>). There has been considerable controversy concerning the likelihood that the structure is altered by X-ray damage because the Mn atoms are in high oxidation states and easily reducible by photoelectrons, so short X-ray exposure times have been crucial. The OEC exploits the oxidizing abilities of Mn(IV) and Mn(V), coupled with that of a nearby tyrosine residue, to oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. Successive photons received by photosystem II result in the OEC being progressively oxidized (the acceptor, an oxidized chlorophyll known as P680<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, has a reduction potential of approximately 1.3 V at pH = 7) through a series of states designated S0 to S4, as shown in <a href="#fig_26.42">Fig. 26.42</a>. Apart from S4, which rapidly releases O<sub>2</sub> and has not been isolated, these states are identifiable in kinetic studies by their characteristic spectroscopic properties; for example, S2 shows a complex multiline EPR spectrum. Note that the Mn ligands are hard O-atom donors and Mn(III) (d<sup>4</sup>), Mn(IV) (d<sup>3</sup>), and Mn(V) (d<sup>2</sup>) are hard metal ions.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Based on the available structural evidence, different models have been proposed for the mechanism of O<sub>2</sub> evolution from two H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. The overriding barrier to O<sub>2</sub> formation is probably formation of the weak peroxidic O&#8211;O bond, following which the formation of O&#8211;aO is energetically easy (<a href="Chapter16.xhtml#sec_16.5">Section 16.5</a> and <i>Resource section 3</i>). First, as the Mn sites are progressively oxidized, coordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecules become increasingly acidic and lose protons, progressing from H<sub>2</sub>O through OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>. Second, computational studies suggest that &#x2018;Mn(V)&#8211;aO&#x2019; is best regarded as Mn(IV)&#8211;O, in which the electron-deficient oxido ligand has appreciable radical character. One proposal is that the Mn atom located on the back of the &#x2018;chair&#x2019; and coordinated by two water molecules is oxidized up to Mn(IV)&#8211;O, which then reacts with the adjacent bridging O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> (linked to the Ca) to produce a transient Mn(III)-peroxide; the latter is easily converted to O<sub>2</sub> using the reservoir of oxidizing power that has accumulated on the cluster. The presence of the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is essential, and the only metal ion that can be substituted is Sr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. A possible role for the Ca is that it provides a site that will remain permanently in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state and provide a rapid and stable binding site for incoming H<sub>2</sub>O, whereas if this subsite were occupied by a fifth Mn atom, the latter would certainly become oxidized and the advantage would be lost.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Cobalt macrocycle complexes are cofactors in enzymes that catalyse methyl transfer reactions, and they are also important for dehalogenation and radical-based rearrangements (for example, isomerizations). The macrocycle is a corrin ring (<b>9</b>), which is similar to porphyrin (<b>8</b>), except there is less conjugation and it has a smaller ring (15-membered instead of 16-membered). The five-coordinate complex known as <b>cobalamin</b> includes a fifth nitrogen donor in one of the axial positions: usually this ligand is a dimethylbenzimidazole that is covalently linked to the corrin ring through a nucleotide, but a histidine residue is also commonly encountered. The more elaborate structure known as <b>coenzyme B<sub>12</sub></b> (<b>45</b>) is an important enzyme cofactor for radical rearrangements: the sixth ligand, R, is 5&#x2032;-deoxyadenosine, which is bonded to the Co atom through the &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013; group, making coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> a rare example of a naturally occurring organometallic compound.<sup><a id="ich26fn8"></a><a href="#ch26fn8">8</a></sup> The sixth ligand is exchangeable and the complex is ingested in the form of species such as aquacobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, or cyanocobalamin, known generally as vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.

Like Fe&#x2013;porphyrins, the Co corrins are enzyme cofactors and exert their activities when bound within a protein.</p>

<p class="la-indent">Methyl-transfer reactions of cobalamins exploit the high nucleophility of square-planar Co(I). A particularly important example is methionine synthase, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of methionine. Methionine is produced by transferring a CH<sub>3</sub> group, derived from the methyl carrier methyl hydrofolate, to homocysteine. Not only is methionine an essential amino acid, but also accumulation of homocysteine (which occurs if activity is impaired) is associated with serious medical problems. The mechanism involves a &#x2018;base-on/base-off&#x2019; cycle in which Co(I) abstracts an electrophilic &#8211;CH<sub>3</sub> group (effectively <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>CH</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>) from a quaternary N atom on <i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-tetrahydrofolate to produce methylcobalamin, which then transfers &#8211;CH<sub>3</sub> to homocysteine (<a href="#fig_26.43">Fig. 26.43</a>). Methylcobalamin is the methyl-transferring cofactor for a wide variety of biosynthetic pathways, including the production of antibiotics. In anaerobic microbes, methylcobalamin is involved in the synthesis of acetyl coenzyme A, an essential metabolite, and in production of methane by methanogens.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Molybdenum and tungsten are the only heavier elements known so far to have specific functions in biology. Molybdenum is widespread across all life forms, and this section deals with its presence in enzymes other than nitrogenase (<a href="#sec_26.13">Section 26.13</a>). By contrast, W has so far only been found in prokaryotes. Molybdenum enzymes catalyse the oxidation and reduction of small molecules, particularly inorganic species. Reactions include oxidation of sulfite, arsenite, xanthine, aldehydes, and carbon monoxide, and reduction of nitrate and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Both Mo and W are found in combination with an unusual class of cofactors (<b>11</b>), at which the metal is coordinated by a dithiolene group. In higher organisms, Mo is coordinated by one pterin dithiolene along with other ligands that often include cysteine. This is illustrated by the active site of sulfite oxidase, where we see also how the pterin ligand is twisted (<b>49</b>). In prokaryotes, Mo enzymes have two pterin cofactors coordinated to the metal atom and although the role of such an elaborate ligand is not entirely clear, it is potentially redox-active and may mediate long-range electron transfer. Coordination of the Mo is usually completed by ligands derived from H<sub>2</sub>O, specifically H<sub>2</sub>O itself, OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Molybdenum is suited for its role because it provides a series of three stable oxidation states: Mo(IV), Mo(V), and Mo(VI), related by one-electron transfers that are coupled to proton transfer. Typically, Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) differ in the number of oxo groups they contain, and Mo enzymes are commonly considered to couple one-electron transfer reactions with O-atom transfer. In humans and other mammals, an inability to synthesize molybdenum cofactor has serious consequences. Sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare, inherited defect (sulfite ions are very toxic) and it is often fatal. <a id="page_806" class="page">Page 806, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a></p>

</figure>
</aside>

<p class="la-indent">This kind of oxygenation reaction can be distinguished from that of the Fe and Cu enzymes described previously because, with Mo enzymes, the oxo group that is transferred is not derived from molecular O<sub>2</sub> but from water. The Mo(VI)&#8211;aO unit can transfer an O atom, either directly (inner sphere) or indirectly to reducing (oxophilic) substrates, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>SO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>AsO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> but cannot oxygenate C&#8211;H bonds. <a href="#fig_26.47">Figure 26.47</a> shows the reaction enthalpies for O-atom transfer: we see that the highly oxidizing Fe species formed by reaction with O<sub>2</sub> are able to oxygenate all substrates, whereas Mo(VI) oxo species are limited to more reducing substrates and Mo(IV) is able to extract an O atom from nitrate.</p>
<p class="la-indent">As expected from its position below Mo in Group 6, the lower oxidation states of W are less stable than those of Mo, so W(IV) species are usually potent reducing agents. This potency is illustrated by the W-containing formate dehydrogenases present in certain primitive organisms, which catalyse the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to formate, the first stage in nonphotosynthetic carbon assimilation. This reaction does not involve O-atom insertion but rather the formation of a C&#8211;H bond. One mechanism that has been proposed, offering the equivalent of a hydride transfer, is</p>

<p class="la-boxpara">Contrary to what is expected from its well-known toxicity, carbon monoxide is one of Nature&#x2019;s most essential small molecules. Even at atmospheric levels (0.05&#x2013;0.35 ppm), CO is scavenged by a diverse range of microbial organisms for which it provides a source of carbon for growth and a &#x2018;fuel&#x2019; for energy (CO is a stronger reducing agent than H<sub>2</sub>). Two unusual enzymes, known as carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, catalyse the rapid oxidation of CO to CO<sub>2</sub>. Aerobes use an enzyme containing an unusual Mo-pterin group (<a href="#fig_B26.3">Fig. B26.3</a>). A sulfido ligand on the Mo atom is shared with a Cu atom <a id="page_807" class="page">Page 807, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>that is coordinated to one other ligand, a cysteine-S, completing the linear arrangement that is so common for Cu(I). A possible mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub> formation involves one of the oxo-groups of Mo(VI) attacking the C-atom of a CO that is coordinated to Cu(I). In contrast, certain anaerobes with the unique ability to live on CO as sole energy and carbon source use an enzyme that contains an unusual [Ni4Fe-4S] cluster. X-ray diffraction studies on crystals of the Ni enzyme incubated in the presence of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>HCO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> at different potentials have revealed the structure of a possible intermediate showing CO<sub>2</sub> coordinated by Ni and Fe (<a href="#fig_B26.4">Fig. B26.4</a>).

Free CO is produced by the action of heme oxygenase, a P450-type enzyme that catalyses the first step in haem degradation. In addition to releasing Fe and CO, the breakdown of haem produces biliverdin and bilirubin, the familiar green and yellow pigments responsible for the appearance of a bruise. Like NO, CO appears to be a cell-signalling agent, and in low amounts it has important therapeutic effects, including suppression of hypertension (high blood pressure) and protection against tissue rejection following an organ transplant. There is therefore considerable interest in developing pharmaceutical agents, such as the water-soluble complex [Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>Cl(glycinate)], to release CO slowly and supplement the action of haem oxygenase (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.7">Section 27.7</a>).</p>

<p class="la-noindent">&#x2018;Fixed&#x2019; nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids, so it is central to agricultural production. Industrial production of ammonia by the Haber process involves reaction of N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> at high pressures and high temperatures; by contrast, nitrogenase produces NH<sub>3</sub> under normal conditions, and it is small wonder that it has attracted so much attention. Indeed, the mechanism of activation of the N<sub>2</sub> molecule by nitrogenase has inspired coordination chemists for several decades. The process is very costly in terms of energy for a reaction that is not very unfavourable thermodynamically. However, as we saw in <a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.6">Section 15.6</a>, N<sub>2</sub> is an unreactive molecule and energy is required to overcome the high activation barrier for its reduction.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Nitrogenase is a complex enzyme that consists of two types of protein: the larger of the two is called the &#x2018;MoFe-protein&#x2019; and the smaller is the &#x2018;Fe-protein&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_26.49">Fig. 26.49</a>). The Fe-protein contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster that is coordinated by two cysteine residues from two subunits. The role of the Fe-protein is to transfer electrons to the MoFe-protein in a reaction that is far from understood: in particular, it is unclear why each electron transfer is accompanied by the hydrolysis of two ATP molecules, which are bound to the Fe-protein.</p>

It was nearly 10 years after the determination of the crystal structure of the enzyme that this small central atom was first detected, following improvements in resolution. A further decade elapsed before the central atom was finally identified as C, from its X-ray emission spectrum and detailed modelling of the X-ray interference characteristics. One role of the central carbon may be to stabilize the 6Fe cage which would otherwise tend to collapse inwards.</p>

<p class="la-indent">The mechanism of N<sub>2</sub> reduction is still unresolved, the major questions being whether N<sub>2</sub> is bound and reduced at the Mo atom or at one or more of the unusual Fe sites, and the role of reactive metal hydrido species that may be generated as intermediates. Here it is significant that nitrogenases are known in which the Mo atom is replaced by a V or Fe atom, arguing against a specific role for Mo. Carbon monoxide, long known to be an inhibitor of nitrogenase, has recently been found to be a substrate, being converted slowly to hydrocarbons in a manner that may resemble that of the Fischer&#x2013;Tropsch reaction (<a href="Chapter25.xhtml#sec_25.15">Section 25.15</a>).</p>

The other enzymes in the nitrogen cycle contain either haem or Cu as their active sites. There are two distinct classes of nitrite reductase. One is a multi-haem enzyme that can reduce nitrite all the way to NH<sub>3</sub>. The other class contains Cu and carries out one-electron transfer, producing NO: it is a trimer of identical subunits, each of which contains one &#x2018;blue&#x2019; Cu (mediating long-range electron transfer to the electron donor, usually a small &#x2018;blue&#x2019; Cu protein) and a Cu centre with more conventional tetragonal geometry that is thought to be the site of nitrite binding.</p>

<p class="la-indent">The nitrogen cycle is notable for using some of the most unusual redox centres yet encountered as well as some of the strangest reactions. Another intriguing cofactor is a [4Cu-2S] cluster, named Cu<sub>Z</sub>, that is found in N<sub>2</sub>O reductase. It is quite a challenge to bind and activate N<sub>2</sub>O, which is a poor ligand, so it is interesting that a crystal structure of the enzyme obtained under 15 bar N<sub>2</sub>O reveals a N<sub>2</sub>O molecule occupying a noncoordinating site just over 3&#x00C5; from Cu<sub>Z</sub> (<b>52</b>). The four Cu atoms of the [4Cu-2S] cluster are coordinated to the protein by imidazole ligands and linked together by two inorganic sulfide ions. Long-range electron transfer in N<sub>2</sub>O reductase is carried out by a Cu<sub>A</sub> centre (<b>31</b>), the same as found in cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Of particular importance for humans are two enzymes that manipulate NO. One of these, NO synthase, is a haem enzyme responsible for producing NO, by oxidation of L-arginine, upon receipt of a signal. Its activity is controlled by calmodulin (<a href="#sec_26.4">Section 26.4</a>). The other enzyme is guanylyl cyclase, which catalyses the formation of the important regulator cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate. Nitric oxide binds to the haem Fe of guanylyl cyclase, displacing a histidine ligand and activating the enzyme. Another interesting NO-binding protein is nitrophorin, which is found in some bloodsucking parasites, notably &#x2018;kissing bugs&#x2019; (predacious bugs of the family <i>Reduviidae</i>). Nitrophorin binds NO tightly until it is injected into a victim, where a change in pH causes its release. The free NO causes dilation of the surrounding blood vessels, rendering the victim a more effective blood donor.</p>

Even if these species are almost entirely microbes, the fact remains that almost all bacteria and archaea possess extremely active metalloenzymes, known as hydrogenases, that catalyse the interconversion of H<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (as water). The elusive molecule H<sub>2</sub> is produced by some organisms (it is a waste product) and used by others as a fuel, helping to explain why so little H<sub>2</sub> is in fact detected in the atmosphere (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box_10.1">Box 10.1</a>). Human breath contains measurable amounts of H<sub>2</sub> due to the action of bacteria in the gut. Hydrogenases are very active enzymes, with turnover frequencies (molecules of substrate transformed per second per molecule of enzyme) exceeding 10 000 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. They are therefore attracting much attention for the insight they can provide regarding clean production of H<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.4">Section 10.4</a>, <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box_10.3">Box 10.3</a>) and oxidation of H<sub>2</sub> in fuel cells&#x2014;technology that currently depends greatly on Pt (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#box_5.1">Box 5.1</a>).</p>

<p class="la-indent">There are three classes of hydrogenase, based on the structure of the active site: all contain Fe and some also contain Ni. The two best-characterized active sites are known as [NiFe] (<b>53</b>) and [FeFe] (<b>54</b>), and they all contain at least one CO ligand, with further ligation being provided by CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and cysteine (and sometimes selenocysteine) ligands. The active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenases (the site is historically known as the &#x2018;H-cluster&#x2019;) contains an unusual bidentate ligand assigned as azadithiolate (adt, (SCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH) that forms a bridge between the Fe atoms, and a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is linked to one Fe by a bridging cysteine thiolate ligand. These fragile active sites are buried deeply within the enzyme, thus necessitating special pores and pathways to convey H<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and a relay of FeS clusters for long-range electron transfer (as shown in <a href="#fig_26.27">Fig. 26.27</a>).</p>

<p class="la-indent">A plausible mechanism of catalysis for the [FeFe]-hydrogenases involves the participation of lower oxidation states of Fe and Fe&#x0064;H (hydrido) species, as shown in <a href="#fig_26.50">Fig. 26.50</a>. Viewed in the direction of oxidation, H<sub>2</sub> first binds to the &#x2018;distal&#x2019; Fe (the one furthest from the [4Fe-4S] cluster) in an analogous manner to the dihydrogen complexes (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.6">Sections 10.6</a> and <a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.7">22.7</a>); this attack is expected because the distal Fe is formally low-spin Fe(II) with a vacant coordination site and 16-valence electrons. Heterolytic cleavage then occurs, the H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> being abstracted by the optimally positioned &#x2018;bridgehead&#x2019; N atom on the azadithiolate <a id="page_811" class="page">Page 811, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>ligand, leaving a Fe(II)-hydrido complex that is then oxidized in two sequential electron transfers. Intermediates may include Fe(I) and involve electron delocalization out to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Similar principles may apply for [NiFe]-enzymes.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">A number of metalloproteins are used to detect and quantify the presence of small molecules, particularly O<sub>2</sub>, NO, and CO. These proteins therefore act as sensors, alerting an organism to an excess or deficit of particular species, and triggering some kind of remedial action. Special proteins are also used to sense the levels of metals such as Cu and Zn that are otherwise always strongly complexed in a cell.</p>

<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key point:</span> Organisms use sophisticated regulatory systems based on Fe-containing proteins to adapt quickly to changes in cellular concentrations of Fe and O<sub><b>2</b></sub>.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindente">We have already seen how FeS clusters are used in electron transfer and many types of catalysis. The coordination of an FeS cluster ties together different parts of a protein and thus controls its tertiary structure. The sensitivity of the cluster to O<sub>2</sub>, electrochemical potential, or Fe and S concentrations makes it able to be an important sensory device. In the presence of O<sub>2</sub> or other potent oxidizing agents, [4Fe-4S] clusters have a tendency (controlled by the protein) to degrade, producing [3Fe-4S] and [2Fe-2S] species. The cluster may be removed completely under some conditions (<a href="#fig_26.51">Fig. 26.51</a>). The principle behind an organism&#x2019;s exploitation of FeS clusters as sensors is that the presence or absence of a particular cluster (the structure of which is very sensitive to Fe or oxygen) alters the conformation of the protein and determines its ability to bind to nucleic acids.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In higher organisms, the protein responsible for regulating Fe uptake (transferrin) and storage (ferritin) is an FeS protein known as the <b>iron regulatory protein</b> (IRP), which is closely related to aconitase (<a href="#sec_26.9">Section 26.9</a>) but is found in the cytoplasm rather than in mitochondria. It acts by binding to specific regions of messenger RNA (mRNA) that carry the genetic command (transcribed from DNA) to synthesize transferrin receptor or ferritin. A specific interaction region on the RNA is known as the <b>iron-responsive element</b> (IRE). The principle is outlined in <a href="#fig_26.52">Fig. 26.52</a>. When Fe levels are high, a [4Fe-4S] cluster is present, and the protein does not bind to the IRE that controls translation of ferritin. In this case binding would be a &#x2018;stop&#x2019; command, and the cell responds by synthesizing ferritin.</p>

The [4Fe-4S] cluster cannot support a state in which all Fe are Fe(III); thus severe oxidizing conditions, including exposure to O<sub>2</sub>, causes their breakdown to [3Fe-4S] or [2Fe-2S] and eventually complete destruction. Degradation to [3Fe-4S] (a) requires only removal of an Fe subsite, whereas degradation to [2Fe-2S] (b) may require rearrangement of the ligands (cysteine) and produce a significant protein conformational change. These processes link cluster status to availability of Fe as well as O<sub>2</sub> and other oxidants, and provide the basis for sensors and feedback control.</figcaption>

<p class="la-noindent">The common gut bacterium <i>E. coli</i> derives energy either by aerobic respiration (using a terminal oxidase related to cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase; <a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>) or by anaerobic respiration with an oxidant such as fumaric acid, or nitrate, using the Mo enzyme nitrate reductase (<a href="#sec_26.12">Sections 26.12</a> and <a href="#sec_26.13">26.13</a>). The problem the organism faces is how to sense whether O<sub>2</sub> is present at a sufficiently low level to warrant inactivating the genes functioning in aerobic respiration and activate instead the genes producing enzymes necessary for the less efficient anaerobic respiration. This detection is achieved by an FeS protein called fumarate nitrate regulator (FNR). The principle is outlined in <a href="#fig_26.53">Fig. 26.53</a>. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, FNR is a dimeric protein with one [4Fe-4S] cluster per subunit. In this form it binds to specific regions of DNA, repressing transcription of the aerobic enzymes and activating transcription of enzymes such as nitrate reductase. When O<sub>2</sub> is present, the [4Fe-4S] cluster is degraded to a [2Fe-2S] cluster and the dimer breaks up so that it cannot bind to DNA. The genes encoding aerobic respiratory enzymes are thus able to be transcribed, whereas those for anaerobic respiration are repressed.</p>

<p class="la-indent">In higher animals, the system that regulates the ability of cells to cope with O<sub>2</sub> shortage involves an Fe oxygenase. In <a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a> we mentioned prolyl hydroxylases, which catalyse the hydroxylation of specific proline residues in proteins, thus altering their properties. In higher animals, one such target protein is a transcription factor called hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which mediates the expression of genes responsible for adapting cells to low-O<sub>2</sub> conditions (hypoxia). We should bear in mind here that the internal environment of cells and cell compartments is usually quite reducing, equivalent to an electrode potential below &#x2212;0.2 V, and even though we regard O<sub>2</sub> as essential for higher organisms, its actual levels may be fairly low. When O<sub>2</sub> levels are above a safe threshold, prolyl hydroxylases catalyse oxygenation of two conserved proline residues of part of the transcription factor (HIFa), causing it to be recognized by a protein that induces its degradation by proteases. Hence genes such as those ultimately responsible for producing more red blood cells (which will help an individual to cope better when O<sub>2</sub> supply is a problem) are not activated. The principle is outlined in <a href="#fig_26.54">Fig. 26.54</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="la-indent">Although essential for higher organisms, O<sub>2</sub> requires stringent control of its four-electron reduction, and increasing amounts of research are being carried out to prevent and cure malfunctions of normal O<sub>2</sub> consumption. The term &#x2018;oxidative stress&#x2019; is used to describe conditions in which the normal function of an organism is threatened by a build-up of partially reduced O<sub>2</sub> intermediates, such as superoxides, peroxides, and hydroxyl radicals known collectively as <b>reactive oxygen species</b> (ROS). Prolonged exposure to ROS may cause premature ageing and certain cancers. To avoid or minimize oxidative stress, cells must first sense ROS and then produce agents to destroy them. Both sensory and attack agents are proteins with active groups such as metal ions (particularly Fe, Cu) and exposed, redox-active cysteine thiols.</p>
<p class="la-indent">An underlying principle of haem sensors is that the small molecules being sensed are &#x03C0; acceptors that can bind strongly to the Fe and displace an indigenous ligand. This binding results in a change in conformation that alters catalytic activity or the ability of the protein to bind to DNA. Of the indigenous ligands, two classic examples are NO and CO; although we have long thought of these molecules as toxic to higher life forms, they are becoming well established as hormones (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.7">Section 27.7</a>). Indeed, there is evidence that the sensing of trace levels of CO is important for controlling circadian rhythms in mammals.</p>
<p class="la-indent">The enzyme guanylyl cyclase senses NO, a molecule that is now well established as a hormone that delivers messages between cells. Guanyl cyclase catalyses the conversion of guanidine monophosphate (GMP) to cyclic GMP (cGMP), which is important for activating many cellular processes. The catalytic activity of guanyl cyclase increases greatly (by a factor of 200) when NO binds to the haem, but (as is obviously important) by a factor of only 4 when CO is bound.</p>
<p class="la-indent">An excellent, atomically defined example of CO sensing is provided by a transcription factor known as CooA. This haem-containing protein is found in some bacteria that are able to grow on CO as their sole energy source under anaerobic conditions. Whether growth on CO takes place depends on the ambient CO level, as an organism will not waste its resources synthesizing the necessary enzymes when the essential substrate is not present. CooA is a dimer, each subunit of which contains a single <i>b</i>-type cytochrome (the <a id="page_813" class="page">Page 813, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>sensor) and a &#x2018;helix&#x2013;turn&#x2013;helix&#x2019; protein fold that binds to DNA (<a href="#fig_26.55">Fig. 26.55</a>). In the absence of CO, each Fe(II) is six-coordinate and both its axial ligands are amino acids of the protein, a histidine imidazole and, unusually, the main-chain &#x0064;NH<sub>2</sub> group of a proline that is also the N-terminal residue of the other subunit. In this form, CooA cannot bind to the specific DNA sequence to transcribe the genes for synthesizing the CO-oxidizing enzymes necessary for existing on CO. When CO is present it binds to the Fe, displacing the distal proline residue and causing CooA to adopt a conformation that will bind to the DNA. The likelihood of NO binding in place of CO to cause a false transcriptional response is prevented because NO not only displaces proline but also results in dissociation of the proximal histidine; the NO complex is thus not recognized.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">The levels of Cu in cells are so strictly controlled that almost no uncomplexed Cu is present. An imbalance in Cu levels is associated with serious health problems such as Menkes disease (Cu deficiency) and Wilson&#x2019;s disease (Cu accumulation). Most of what we know about how Cu levels are sensed and converted to cell signals stems from studies on the <i>E. coli</i> system, which involves a transcription factor called CueR (<a href="#fig_26.56">Fig. 26.56</a>). This protein binds Cu(I) with high selectivity, although it also binds Ag(I) and Au(I). Metal coordination causes a conformational change that enables CueR to bind to DNA at a receptor site that controls transcription of an enzyme known as CopA, which is an ATP-driven Cu pump. CopA is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and exports Cu into the periplasm. In CueR, the Cu(I) is coordinated by two cysteine-S atoms arranged in a linear coordination geometry. Titrations using CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> as a buffer show that Cu<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is bound with a dissociation constant of approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;21</sup>! As may be understood by reference to <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.3">Section 7.3</a>, this ligand environment leads to remarkably selective binding for d<sup>10</sup> ions, and measurements with Ag and Au show that these ions are taken up with similar affinities.</p>
<p class="la-indent">Most of our current insight about Zn sensing, as for Cu, is provided by studies of bacterial systems. The major difference with respect to Cu is that, although Zn is also coordinated (mainly) by cysteine thiolates, the geometry is tetrahedral rather than linear. <i>E. coli</i> contains a Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-sensing transcription factor known as ZntR that is closely related to CueR. The factor ZntR contains two Zn-binding domains, each of which coordinates a pair of Zn using cysteine and histidine ligands. The surrounding protein fold is shown in <a href="#fig_26.56">Fig. 26.56</a>, for comparison with CueR. The extent to which these dynamic Zn-binding sites can be identified with zinc fingers remains unclear.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3a">Biominerals</h3>
<p class="la-noindent">In addition to the complexes formed between metal ions and organic molecules, biology uses different elements to make <b>biominerals</b>: solid-state materials and nanoparticles that often contain little or no organic material. Biominerals provide mechanical support, and they are exploited to make ingenious devices for sensing and defence. Produced inside or outside <a id="page_814" class="page">Page 814, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>a living cell, in highly specialised shapes and patterns, biomineral structures persist long after an organism has died, and give rise to fossils.</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Biominerals can be either infinite covalent networks or ionic. The former include the silicates, which occur extensively in the plant world. Leaves, even whole plants, are often covered with silica hairs or spines that offer protection against predatory herbivores. Ionic biominerals are mainly based on calcium salts, and exploit the high lattice energy and low solubilities of these compounds. Calcium carbonate (calcite or aragonite; <a href="Chapter12.xhtml#box_12.4">Box 12.4</a>) is the material present in seashells and eggshells. These minerals persist long after the organism has died; indeed chalk is a biogenic mineral, a result of the process of <b>calciferation</b> of prehistoric organisms. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite; <a href="Chapter15.xhtml#sec_15.15">Section 15.15</a>) is the mineral component of bones and teeth, which are particularly good examples of how organisms fabricate &#x2018;living&#x2019; composite materials. Indeed, the different properties of bone found among species (such as stiffness) are produced by varying the amount of organic component, mostly the fibrous protein collagen, with which hydroxyapatite is associated. High hydroxyapatite/collagen ratios are found for large marine animals, whereas low ratios are found for animals requiring agility and elasticity.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Biomineralization</b> is crystallization under biological control. There are some striking examples that have no counterparts in the laboratory. Perhaps the most familiar example is the exoskeleton of the sea urchin, which comprises large sponge-like plates containing continuous macropores 15 &#x00B5;m in diameter: each of these plates is a single crystal of Mg-rich calcite. Large single crystals support other organisms, such as diatoms and radiolarians, with their skeletons of silica cages (<a href="#fig_26.57">Fig. 26.57</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Biominerals produce some intriguing gadgetry. <a href="#fig_26.58">Figure 26.58</a> shows crystals of calcite that are part of the gravity-sensor device in the inner ear. These crystals are located on a membrane above sensory cells, and any acceleration or change of posture that causes them to move results in an electrical signal to the brain. The crystals are uniform in size and spindle-shaped so that they move evenly without becoming hooked together. The same property is seen for crystals of magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) that are found in a variety of magnetotactic bacteria (<a href="#fig_26.59">Fig. 26.59</a>). There are considerable variations in size and shape across different species, but within any one species, the crystals, formed in magnetosome vesicles, are uniform. Magnetotactic bacteria live in fluid sediment suspensions in marine and freshwater environments, and it is thought that their microcompasses allow them to swim always in a downwards direction to maintain their chemical environment during turbulent conditions.</p>
<p class="la-indent">There is great interest in how biomaterials are formed, not least because of the inspiration they provide for nanotechnology (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>). The formation of biominerals involves the following hierarchy of control mechanisms:</p>
<p class="la-indenthanging">1. Chemical control (solubility, supersaturation, nucleation).</p>
<p class="la-indenthanging">2. Spatial control (confinement of crystal growth by boundaries such as cells, subcompartments, and even proteins in the case of ferritin; <a href="#sec_26.6">Section 26.6</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indenthanging">3. Structural control (nucleation favoured on a specific crystal face).</p>
<p class="la-indenthanging">4.  Morphological control (growth of the crystal limited by boundaries imposed by organic material that grows with time).</p>
<p class="la-indenthanging">5. Constructional control (interweaving of inorganic and organic materials to form a higher-order structure, such as bone).</p>

<p class="la-noindent">Bone is continually being dissolved and reformed; indeed it functions not only as a structural support but also as the central Ca store. Thus, during pregnancy, bones tend to be raided for their Ca in a process called <b>demineralization</b>, which occurs in special cells called <i>osteoclasts</i>. Depleted or damaged bones are restored by mineralization, which occurs in cells called <i>osteoblasts</i>.

<h3 class="la-h3a"><b>Perspectives</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindent">In this final section, we stand back from the material in the chapter and review it from a variety of perspectives, from the point of view of individual elements and from the point of view of the contribution of bioinorganic chemistry to urgent social problems.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_26.18">
<h3 class="la-h3"><b>26.18 The contributions of individual elements</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> Elements are selected for their inherent useful properties and their availability.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">In this section we summarize the major roles of each element and correlate what we have discussed, with emphasis on the element rather than the type of reaction that is involved.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Na, K, and Li</b> The ions of these elements are characterized by weak binding to hard ligands and their specificity is based on size and hydrophobicity that arises from a lower charge density. Compared to Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is more likely to be found coordinated within a protein and is more easily dehydrated. Both Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> are important agents in controlling cell structure through osmotic pressure, but whereas Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is ejected from cells, K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is accumulated, contributing to a sizeable potential difference across the cell membrane. This differential is maintained by ion pumps, in particular the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-ATPase, also known as the Na-pump. The electrical energy is released by specific gated ion channels, of which the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel (<a href="#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a>) has been studied the most.</p>
<p class="la-indent">An important related issue is the widespread use of simple Li compounds (particularly Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) as psychotherapeutic agents in the treatment of mental disorders, notably bipolar disorder (manic depression); see <a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.4">Section 27.4</a>.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Mg</b> Magnesium ions are the dominant 2&#x002B; ion in cytoplasm and the only ones to occur above millimolar levels in the free, uncomplexed state. The energy currency for enzyme catalysis, ATP, is always present as its Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> complex. Magnesium has a special role in the light-harvesting molecule chlorophyll, because it is a small 2&#x002B; cation that is able to adopt octahedral geometry and can stabilize a structure without promoting energy loss by fluorescence. The Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion is a weak acid catalyst and is the active metal ion in rubisco, the highly abundant enzyme responsible for removing some 100 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> per year from the atmosphere. Rubisco is activated by weak binding of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to two carboxylates and a special carbamate ligand, leaving three exchangeable water molecules.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Ca</b> Calcium ions are important only in eukaryotes. The bulk of biological Ca is used for structural support and devices such as teeth. The selection of Ca for this function is due to the insolubility of Ca carbonate and phosphate salts. However, a tiny amount of Ca is used as the basis of a sophisticated intracellular signalling system. The principle of this process is that Ca is suited for rapid coordination to hard-acid ligands, especially carboxylates from protein side chains, and has no preference for any particular coordination geometry.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Mn</b> Manganese has several oxidation states, most of which are very oxidizing. It is well suited as a redox catalyst for reactions involving positive reduction potentials. One reaction in particular, in which H<sub>2</sub>O is used as the electron donor in photosynthesis, is responsible for producing the O<sub>2</sub> in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. This reaction involves a special [4MnCa-5O] cluster. Compounds of Mn(II) are also used as a weak acid&#x2013;base catalysts in some enzymes. Spectroscopic detectability varies depending on oxidation state: EPR has been useful for Mn(II) and for particular states of the [4MnCa-5O] cluster.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Fe</b> Versatile Fe is essential to almost all organisms and was certainly a very early element in biology. Three oxidation states are important, namely Fe(II), Fe(III), and Fe(IV). Active sites based on Fe catalyse a great variety of redox reactions, ranging from electron transfer to oxygenation, as well as acid&#x2013;base reactions that include reversible O<sub>2</sub> binding, dehydration/hydration, and ester hydrolysis. Iron-containing active sites contain ligands ranging from soft donors such as sulfide (as in FeS clusters) to hard donors such as carboxylate. The porphyrin macrocycle is particularly important as a ligand. Iron(II) in various coordination environments is used to bind O<sub>2</sub>, either reversibly or as a prerequisite for activation. Iron(III) is a good Lewis acid, whereas the Fe(IV)&#x003D;aO (ferryl) group may be considered as Nature&#x2019;s way of managing a reactive O atom for insertion into C&#x0064;H bonds. Cells contain little uncomplexed Fe(II) and extremely low levels of Fe(III). These ions are toxic, particularly in terms of their reaction with peroxides, which generates the hydroxyl radical. Primary uptake into organisms from minerals poses problems because <a id="page_816" class="page">Page 816, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>Fe is found predominantly as Fe(III), salts of which are insoluble at neutral pH (see Fig. 5.11). Iron uptake, delivery, and storage are controlled by sophisticated transport systems, including a special storage protein known as ferritin. Iron porphyrins (as found in cytochromes) show intense UV&#x2013;visible absorption bands, and most active sites with unpaired electrons give rise to characteristic EPR spectra.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Co</b> Cobalt and nickel are among the most ancient biocatalysts. Cobalt is processed only by microorganisms, and higher organisms must ingest it as &#x2018;vitamin B<sub>12</sub>&#x2019; in which Co is complexed by a special macrocycle called corrin. Complexes in which the fifth ligand is a benzimidazole that is covalently linked to the corrin ring are known as cobalamins. Cobalamins are cofactors in enzymes that catalyse alkyl-transfer reactions and many radical-based rearrangements. Alkyl-transfer reactions exploit the high nucleophilicity of Co(I). In the special cofactor known as coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>, the sixth ligand to Co(III) is a carbanion donor atom from deoxyadenosine. Radical-based rearrangements involve the ability of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> to undergo facile homolytic cleavage of the Co&#x2500;C bond, producing stable low-spin Co(II) and a carbon radical that can abstract a hydrogen atom from substrates. Cobalamin-containing enzymes show strong UV&#x2013;visible absorption bands; EPR spectra are observed for Co(II). Rare examples of Co proteins that do not contain the corrin macrocycle include an enzyme known as nitrile dehydratase.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Ni</b> Nickel is important in bacterial enzymes, notably hydrogenases, where it also uses the &#x002B;3 and &#x002B;1 oxidation states, which are rare in conventional chemistry. A particularly remarkable enzyme, coenzyme A synthase, uses Ni to produce CO and then react it with CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013; (provided by a cobalamin enzyme) to produce a C&#x2500;C bond in the form of an acetyl ester. Nickel is also found in plants as the active site of urease. Urease was the first enzyme to be crystallized (in 1926), yet it was not until 1976 that it was discovered to contain Ni.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Cu</b> Unlike Fe, copper probably became important only after O<sub>2</sub> had become established in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere and it became available as soluble Cu(II) salts rather than insoluble sulfides (Cu<sub>2</sub>S). The main role of Cu is in electron-transfer reactions at the higher end of the potential scale and catalysis of redox reactions involving O<sub>2</sub>. It is also used for reversible O<sub>2</sub> binding. Both Cu(II) and Cu(I) are strongly bound to biological ligands, particularly soft bases. Free Cu ions are highly toxic and almost absent from cells.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Zn</b> Zinc is an excellent Lewis acid, forming stable complexes with ligands such as N and S donors and catalysing reactions such as ester and peptide hydrolysis. The biological importance of Zn stems largely from its lack of redox chemistry, although its common adoption of di-, tri-, and tetrathiolate ligation provides a link to the redox chemistry of cysteine/cystine interconversions. Zinc is used as a structure former in enzymes and proteins that bind to DNA. A major problem has been the lack of good spectroscopic methods for studying this d<sup>10</sup> ion. In some cases, Zn enzymes have been studied by EPR, after substituting the Zn by Co(II). In the cell, Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> concentrations are buffered by cysteine-rich proteins known as metallothioneins. It is now becoming clear that mobile Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions, ejected from cells following stimuli or stress, are involved in cell-to-cell communication in various tissue, including the brain (see <a href="#ch26.1j">Tutorial problems</a>).</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Mo and W</b> Molybdenum is an abundant element that is probably used by all organisms as a redox catalyst for the transfer of O atoms derived from H<sub>2</sub>O. In these oxo-transfer enzymes the Mo is always part of a larger pterin-containing cofactor, in which it is coordinated by a special dithiolene ligand. Interconversion between Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) usually results in a change in the number of terminal oxo ligands, and recovery of the starting material occurs by single-electron transfer reactions with Mo(V) as an intermediate. Aside from oxo-transfer and related reactions, Mo has another intriguing role, that of nitrogen fixation, in which it is part of a special FeS cluster. Use of W is confined to prokaryotes, where it is also used as a redox catalyst, but in reactions where a stronger reducing agent is required.</p>
<p class="la-indent"><b>Si</b> Silicon is often neglected among biological elements, yet its turnover in some organisms is comparable to that of carbon. Silica is an important material for the fabrication of the exoskeleton and of prickly defensive armour in plants.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3"><b>26.19 Future directions</b></h3>
<p class="la-noindente"><b><span class="la-red">Key points:</span> Biological metals and metalloproteins have important futures in medicine, energy production, green synthesis, and nanotechnology.</b></p>
<p class="la-noindent">The pioneering studies of the structures and mechanism of ion channels mentioned in <a href="#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a> are providing important new leads in neurophysiology, including the rational <a id="page_817" class="page">Page 817, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a>design of drugs that can block or modify their action in some way. New functions for Ca are continually emerging, and one intriguing aspect is its role in determining the left-right asymmetry of higher organisms, a prime example being the specific placements of heart and liver in the body cavity. The so-called <b>Notch signalling pathway</b> in embryonic cells depends on transient extracellular bursts of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> that are dependent in some way on the activity of an H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-ATPase. There is also a growing awareness of the role of Zn and Zn-transport proteins in control of cellular activity, and also of neural transmission. Indeed, the term <b>metalloneurochemistry</b> has been coined to describe the study of metal-ion function in the brain and nervous system at the molecular level. An important challenge is to map out the distribution and flow of Zn in tissue such as brain, and advances are being made in the design of fluorescent ligands that will bind Zn selectively at cellular levels and report on its transport across different zones&#x2014;for example, the synaptic junctions. Metal ions are involved in protein folding, and it is believed that Cu, in particular, may have an important role in fatal neurodegenerative disorders. These roles include controlling the behaviour of prions involved in transmittable diseases such as spongiform encephalopathy (Creuzfeldt&#x2013;Jakob disease, the human form of &#x2018;mad cow&#x2019; disease) as well as amyloid peptides that are implicated in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In many regions of the world, rice is the staple food but this commodity is low in Fe. Thus transgenic techniques are being used to improve Fe content. The object is to produce better plant siderophores and improve Fe storage (by enhanced expression of the ferritin gene).</p>
<p class="la-indent">Enzymes tend to show much higher catalytic rates and far higher selectivity than synthetic catalysts, leading naturally to greater efficiency and lower energy costs. The principal disadvantages of using enzymes as industrial catalysts are their lower thermal stability, limitations on solvent and pH conditions, and a large mass per active unit. There is much interest in achieving enzyme-like catalytic performance with small synthetic molecules, a concept that is known as &#x2018;bioinspired catalysis&#x2019;. The idea is to reproduce, using all the tools of synthetic chemistry, the properties of an enzyme trimmed down to its smallest fully functional component. Examples of bioinspired catalysts have already been described: areas of particular interest for industrial production are the conversion of methane to methanol (<a href="#sec_26.10">Section 26.10</a>), activation of N<sub>2</sub> to produce cheap fertilizers, and production of hydrogen.</p>
<p class="la-indent">In the not-so-distant future, when fossil fuels have been depleted, H<sub>2</sub> will become an important energy carrier, used either directly or indirectly (after conversion into fuels such as alcohol) to power vehicles of all kinds. One of the scientific challenges is how to obtain efficient electrolytic or photolytic production of H<sub>2</sub> from water, given that sunlight is an infinite resource and electricity will be widely available from a variety of sources. This process requires demanding conditions of temperature and overpotential (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sec_10.4">Section 10.4</a>), or catalysts that are currently based on Pt and other precious metals. However, Nature has already shown us that rapid hydrogen cycling is possible under mild conditions by using just the common metals Fe and Ni. A related challenge is the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts that can convert water to O<sub>2</sub> without requiring a large overpotential, not because there is a need for O<sub>2</sub> itself, but because it is an essential by-product of electrolytic or photolytic H<sub>2</sub> production (see Box 10.3). Once again, we can turn to the biosphere for inspiration, because by elucidating the mechanism of the Mn catalyst, we might synthesize new catalysts that are both cheap and durable (Box 16.2).</p>
<p class="la-indent">We have seen the exquisite structures of materials that are produced by organisms. This understanding is now leading to new directions in nanotechnology (Chapter 24). For example, sponge-like single crystals of calcite, having intricate morphological features, have been produced on polymer membranes formed by templating the skeletal plates of the sea urchin. Another recent development is the production of Pd nanoclusters by hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, the action of hydrogenases making available controlled electron flow to effect the electroplating of Pd onto microscopic sites.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3b"><b><span class="la-green">EXERCISES</span></b></h3>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.1</b></span> With reference to details that have been discussed in <a href="#sec_26.3">Section 26.3</a> for the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel, predict the properties of Na&#x002B;, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, and Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>-binding sites that would be important for providing selectivity in their respective transmembrane ion transporters.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.2</b></span> Calcium-binding proteins can be studied by using lanthanoid ions (Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>). Compare and contrast the coordination preferences of the two types of metal ion and suggest techniques in which lanthanoid ions would be useful.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.3</b></span> In zinc enzymes, &#x2018;spectroscopically silent&#x2019; Zn(II) can often be replaced by Co(II) with high retention of activity. Explain the principles by which this substitution can be exploited to obtain structural and mechanistic information.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.4</b></span> Compare and contrast the acid&#x2013;base catalytic activities of Zn(II), Fe(III), and Mg(II).</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.5</b></span> Propose physical methods that would allow you to determine whether a reactive intermediate isolated by rapid freeze quenching contains Fe(V).</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.6</b></span> <a href="#fig_26.60">Figure 26.60</a> shows M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectra of a sample of ferredoxin from chloroplasts at 77 K. With reference to <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.8">Section 8.8</a>, interpret the data with regard to the oxidation states and spin states of the two Fe atoms and comment on the electron delocalization at this temperature.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.7</b></span> The structure of the P-cluster in nitrogenase differs significantly between oxidized and reduced states. Comment on this observation in the light of proposals that it participates in long-range electron transfer.</p>

<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.8</b></span> Microorganisms can synthesize the acetyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>CO&#x0064;) by direct combination of methyl groups with CO. Make some predictions about the metals that are involved.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.9</b></span> Comment on the implications of discovering, by microwave detection, substantial levels of O<sub>2</sub> on a planet in another solar system. <a id="page_819" class="page">Page 819, Chapter 26: Biological inorganic chemistry</a></p>





<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.10</b></span> Apart from direct O-atom transfer (<a href="#fig_26.45">Fig. 26.45</a>), another mechanism proposed for Mo enzymes is indirect O-atom transfer, also known as <i>coupled electron&#x2013;proton transfer</i>. In this mechanism, as shown in <a href="#fig_26.61">Fig. 26.61</a> for sulfite oxidase, the O atom that is transferred originates instead from an uncoordinated H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. Propose a way to distinguish between direct and indirect O-atom transfer mechanisms.</p>

<h3 class="la-h3b"><span class="la-green"><b>TUTORIAL PROBLEMS</b></span></h3>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.1</b></span> In an article on the detection of Zn(II) that is released from neuronal tissue (brain, nerves) following trauma, E. Tomat and S.J. Lippard describe the development of special ligands that are highly selective for Zn and allow it to be imaged by a technique called confocal microscopy (<i>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol.</i>, 2010, <b>14</b>, 225). Using your knowledge of the coordination chemistry of Zn, explain the principles underlying this research.</p>
<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.2</b></span> In justifying research into small-molecule catalysts for producing NH<sub>3</sub> from N<sub>2</sub>, it is sometimes stated that nitrogenase is an &#x2018;efficient&#x2019; enzyme: how true is this statement? Comment critically on the argument that &#x2018;knowing the 3D structure of nitrogenase has not enlightened us as to its mechanism of action&#x2019; and discuss how this view might be valid more generally for enzymes for which a structure is known.</p>

<p class="la-noindentex"><span class="la-green"><b>26.3</b></span> &#x2018;In Mo enzymes, the bond between a terminal oxo anion and Mo(VI) is usually written as a double bond, whereas it is more correctly assigned as a triple bond.&#x2019; Discuss this statement. Suggest how a terminal oxido ligand influences the reactivity of other coordination sites on the Mo atom and explain how a terminal sulfido ligand (as occurs in xanthine oxidase) would alter the properties of the active site.</p>
