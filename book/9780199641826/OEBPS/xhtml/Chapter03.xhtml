<p class="noindentd"><b>An understanding of the chemistry of compounds in the solid state is central to the study of many important inorganic materials, such as alloys, simple metal salts, graphene, inorganic pigments, nanomaterials, zeolites, and high-temperature superconductors. This chapter surveys the structures adopted by atoms and ions in simple solids and explores why one arrangement may be preferred to another. We begin with the simplest model, in which atoms are represented by hard spheres and the structure of the solid is the outcome of stacking these spheres densely together. This &#x2018;close-packed&#x2019; arrangement provides a good description of many metals and alloys and is a useful starting point for the discussion of numerous ionic solids. These simple solid structures can then be considered as the building blocks for the construction of more complex inorganic materials. Introduction of partial covalent character into the bonding influences the choice of structure and thus trends in the adopted structural type correlate with the electronegativities of the constituent atoms. The chapter also describes some of the energy considerations that can be used to rationalize the trends in structure and reactivity. These arguments also systematize the discussion of the thermal stabilities and solubilities of ionic solids formed by the elements of Groups 1 and 2. Finally the electronic structures of materials are discussed through the extension of molecular orbital theory to the almost infinite arrays of atoms found in solids with the introduction of band theory. Band theory, which describes the energy levels that electrons may take in solids, permits the classification of inorganic solids as conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The majority of elements and inorganic compounds exist as solids and comprise ordered arrays of atoms, ions, or molecules. The structures of most metals can be described in terms of a regular, space-filling arrangement of the metal atoms. These metal centres interact through <b>metallic bonding,</b> where the electrons are delocalized throughout the solid; that is, the electrons are not associated with a particular atom or bond. This is equivalent to considering metals as enormous molecules with a multitude of atomic orbitals that overlap to produce molecular orbitals extending throughout the sample (<a href="#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>). Metallic bonding is characteristic of elements with low ionization energies, such as those on the left of the periodic table, through the d block and into part of the p block close to the d block. Most of the elements are metals, but metallic bonding also occurs in many other solids, especially compounds of the d metals such as their oxides and sulfides. Compounds such as the lustrous-red rhenium oxide ReO<sub>3</sub> and &#x2018;fool&#x2019;s gold&#x2019; (iron pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>), illustrate the occurrence of metallic bonding in compounds. The familiar properties of an elemental metal stem from the characteristics of its bonding and in particular the delocalization of electrons throughout the solid. Thus, metals are malleable (easily deformed by the application of pressure) and ductile (able to be drawn into a wire) because the electrons can adjust rapidly to relocation of the metal atom nuclei and there is no directionality in the bonding. They are lustrous because the electrons can respond almost freely to an incident wave of electromagnetic radiation and reflect it.</p>

<p class="indent">In <b>ionic bonding</b>, ions of different elements are held together in rigid, symmetrical arrays as a result of the attraction between their opposite charges. Ionic bonding also depends on electron loss and gain, so it is found typically in compounds of metals with electronegative elements. However, there are plenty of exceptions: not all compounds of metals are ionic and some compounds of nonmetals (such as ammonium nitrate) contain features of ionic bonding as well as covalent interactions. There are also materials that exhibit features of both ionic and metallic bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">Both ionic and metallic bonding are nondirectional, so structures where these types of bonding occur are most easily understood in terms of space-filling models that maximize, for example, the number and strength of the electrostatic interactions between the ions. The regular arrays of atoms, ions, or molecules in solids that produce these structures are best represented using a repeating unit that is produced as a result of the efficient methods of filling space, known as the unit cell.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch3.1a">
<h3 class="h3a"><b>The description of the structures of solids</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The arrangement of atoms or ions in simple solid structures can often be represented by different arrangements of hard spheres. The spheres used to describe metallic solids represent neutral atoms because each cation can still be considered as surrounded by its full complement of electrons. The spheres used to describe ionic solids represent the cations and anions because there has been a substantial transfer of electrons from one type of atom to the other.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:0em;"><span class="red"><b>Figure 3.1</b></span> A two-dimensional solid and two choices of a unit cell. The entire crystal is produced by translational displacements of either unit cell, but (b) is generally preferred to (a) because it is smaller.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">A crystal of an element or compound can be regarded as constructed from regularly repeating structural elements, which may be atoms, molecules, or ions. The &#x2018;crystal lattice&#x2019; is the geometric pattern formed by the points that represent the positions of these repeating structural elements.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Lattices and unit cells</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> The lattice defines a network of identical points that has the translational symmetry of a structure. A unit cell is a subdivision of a crystal that when stacked together following translations reproduces the crystal.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A <b>lattice</b> is a three-dimensional, infinite array of points, the <b>lattice points</b>, each of which is surrounded in an identical way by neighbouring points. The lattice defines the repeating nature of the crystal. The <b>crystal structure</b> itself is obtained by associating one or more identical structural units, such as atoms, ions, or molecules, with each lattice point. In many cases the structural unit may be centred on the lattice point, but that is not necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">A <b>unit cell</b> of a three-dimensional crystal is an imaginary parallel-sided region (a &#x2018;parallelepiped&#x2019;) from which the entire crystal can be built up by purely translational displacements;<sup><a id="ich3fn1"></a><a href="#ch3fn1">1</a></sup> unit cells so generated fit perfectly together with no space excluded. Unit cells may be chosen in a variety of ways but it is generally preferable to choose the smallest cell that exhibits the greatest symmetry. Thus, in the two-dimensional pattern in <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, a variety of unit cells (a parallelogram in two dimensions) may be chosen, each of which repeats the contents of the box under translational displacements. Two possible choices of repeating unit are shown, but (b) would be preferred to (a) because it is smaller. The relationship between the lattice parameters in three dimensions as a result of the symmetry of the structure gives rise to the seven <b>crystal systems</b> (<a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> and <a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>). All ordered structures adopted by compounds belong to one of these crystal systems; most of those described in this chapter, which deals with simple compositions and stoichiometries, belong to the higher symmetry cubic and hexagonal systems. The angles (<i>&#x03B1;</i>, <i>&#x03B2;</i>, <i>&#x03B3;</i>) and lengths (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) used to define the size and shape of a unit cell, relative to an origin, are the <b>unit cell parameters</b> (the &#x2018;lattice parameters&#x2019;); the angle between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is denoted</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch3fn1"></a><a href="#ich3fn1">1</a></sup> A translation exists where it is possible to move an original figure or motif in a defined direction by a certain distance to produce an exact image. In this case a unit cell reproduces itself exactly by translation parallel to a unit cell edge by a distance equal to the unit cell parameter.</p>

In this case, the displacements (0, &#x002B;&#x00BD;, &#x002B;&#x00BD;), (&#x002B;&#x00BD;, &#x002B;&#x00BD;, 0), and (&#x002B;&#x00BD;, 0, &#x002B;&#x00BD;), where &#x002B;&#x00BD; in the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, or <i>z</i> coordinate represents a translation along the appropriate cell direction by a distance of <i>a</i>/2, <i>b</i>/2, or <i>c</i>/2 respectively, have this effect.

<p class="noindentt">The position of an atom in a unit cell is normally described in terms of <b>fractional coordinates</b>, coordinates expressed as a fraction of the length of a side of the unit cell. Thus, the position of an atom, relative to an origin (0,0,0), located at <i>xa</i> parallel to <i>a</i>, <i>yb</i> parallel to <i>b</i>, and <i>zc</i> parallel to <i>c</i> is denoted (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>), with 0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> &#x2264; 1. Three-dimensional representations of complex structures are often difficult to draw and to interpret in two dimensions. A clearer method of representing three-dimensional structures on a two-dimensional surface is to draw the structure in projection by viewing the unit cell down one direction, typically one of the axes of the unit cell. The positions of the atoms relative to the projection plane are denoted by the fractional coordinate above the base plane and written next to the symbol defining the atom in the projection. If two atoms lie above each other, then both fractional coordinates are noted in parentheses.

<h3 class="h3">3.2 <b>The close packing of spheres</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The close packing of identical spheres can result in a variety of polytypes, of which hexagonal and cubic close-packed structures are the most common.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Many metallic and ionic solids can be regarded as constructed from atoms and ions represented as hard spheres. If there is no directional covalent bonding, these spheres are free to pack together as closely as geometry allows and hence adopt a <b>close-packed structure</b>, a structure in which there is least unfilled space.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider first a single layer of identical spheres (<a href="#fig_3.11">Figs 3.11</a> and <a href="#fig_3.12">3.12</a>a). The greatest number of immediate neighbours is six, and there is only one way of constructing this close-packed layer.<sup><a id="ich3fn2"></a><a href="#ch3fn2">2</a></sup> Note that the environment of each sphere in the layer is identical with six others placed around it in a hexagonal pattern. A second close-packed layer of spheres is formed by placing spheres in the dips between the spheres of the first layer so that each sphere in this second layer touches three spheres in the layer below (<a href="#fig_3.12">Fig. 3.12b</a>). (Note that only half the dips in the original layer are occupied, as there is insufficient space to place spheres into all the dips.) The arrangement of spheres in this second layer is identical to that in the first, each with six nearest neighbours; the pattern is just slightly displaced horizontally. The third close-packed layer can be laid in either of two ways (remember, only half the dips in the preceding layer can be occupied). This gives rise to either of two <b>polytypes</b>, or structures, that are the same in two dimensions (in this case, in the planes) but different in the third. Later we shall see that many different polytypes can be formed, but those described here are two very important special cases.</p>

(b) The second close-packed layer, B, lies in dips above A. (c) The third layer reproduces the first to give an ABA structure (hcp). (d) The third layer lies above the gaps in the first layer, giving an ABC structure (ccp). The different colours identify the different layers of identical spheres.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch3fn2"></a><a href="#ich3fn2">2</a></sup> A good way of showing this yourself is to get a number of identical coins and push them together on a flat surface; the most efficient arrangement for covering the area is with six coins around each coin. This simple modelling approach can be extended to three dimensions by using any collection of identical spherical objects such as balls, oranges, or marbles.</p>
<p class="indent">In one polytype, the spheres of the third layer lie directly above the spheres of the first and each sphere in the second layer gains three more neighbours in this layer above it. This ABAB &#x2026; pattern of layers, where A denotes layers that have spheres directly above each other and likewise for B, gives a structure with a hexagonal unit cell and hence is said to be <b>hexagonally close-packed</b> (hcp, <a href="#fig_3.12">Figs 3.12</a>c and <a href="#fig_3.13">3.13</a>). In the second polytype, the spheres of the third layer are placed above the dips that were not occupied in the first layer. The second layer fits into half the dips in the first layer and the third layer lies above the remaining dips. This arrangement results in an ABCABC&#x2026; pattern, where C denotes a layer that has spheres that are not directly above spheres of the A or the B layer positions (but will be directly above another C-type layer). This pattern corresponds to a structure with a cubic unit cell and hence it is termed <b>cubic close-packed</b> (ccp, <a href="#fig_3.12">Figs 3.12</a>d and <a href="#fig_3.14">3.14</a>). Because each ccp unit cell has a sphere at one corner and one at the centre of each face, a ccp unit cell is sometimes referred <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, The structures of simple solids</a>to as <b>face-centred cubic</b> (fcc). The <b>coordination number</b> (CN) of a sphere in a close-packed arrangement (the &#x2018;number of nearest neighbours&#x2019;) is 12, formed from 6 touching spheres in the original close-packed layer and 3 from each layer above and below it. This is the greatest number that geometry allows.<sup><a id="ich3fn3"></a><a href="#ch3fn3">3</a></sup> When directional bonding is important, the resulting structures are no longer close-packed and the coordination number is less than 12.</p>

<p class="indentt">The occupied space in a close-packed structure amounts to 74 per cent of the total volume (see <a href="#exam_3.3">Example 3.3</a>). However, the remaining unoccupied space, 26 per cent, is not empty in a real solid because electron density of an atom does not end as abruptly as the hard-sphere model suggests. The type and distribution of spaces between the spheres, known as holes, are important because many structures, including those of some alloys and many ionic compounds, can be regarded as formed from an expanded close-packed arrangement in which additional atoms or ions occupy all or some of the holes.</p>

<p class="indentt">The ccp and hcp arrangements are the most efficient simple ways of filling space with identical spheres. They differ only in the stacking sequence of the close-packed layers, and other, more complex, close-packed layer sequences may be formed by locating successive planes in different positions relative to their neighbours (<a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>). Any collection of identical atoms, such as those in the simple picture of an elemental metal, or of approximately spherical molecules, is likely to adopt one of these close-packed structures unless there are additional energetic reasons, such as covalent bonding interactions, for adopting an alternative arrangement. Indeed, many metals adopt such close-packed structures (<a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>), as do the solid forms of the noble gases (which are ccp). Almost-spherical molecules, such as fullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, in the solid state, also adopt the ccp arrangement (<a href="#fig_3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>), and so do many small molecules that rotate around their centres in the solid state and thus appear spherical, such as H<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and one form of solid oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The feature of a close-packed structure that enables us to extend the concept to describe structures more complicated than elemental metals is the existence of two types of <b>hole</b>, or unoccupied space between the spheres. An <b>octahedral hole</b> lies between two triangles of spheres on adjoining layers (<a href="#fig_3.17">Fig. 3.17a</a>). For a crystal consisting of <i>N</i> spheres in a close-packed structure, there are <i>N</i> octahedral holes. The distribution of these holes in an hcp unit cell is shown in <a href="#fig_3.18">Fig. 3.18</a>a and those in a ccp unit cell <a href="#fig_3.18">Fig. 3.18b</a>. This illustration also shows that the hole has local octahedral symmetry in the sense that it is surrounded by six nearest-neighbour spheres with their centres at the corners of an octahedron. If each hard sphere has radius <i>r</i>, and if the close-packed spheres are to remain in contact, then each octahedral hole can accommodate a hard sphere representing another type of atom with a radius no larger than 0.414<i>r</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">A <b>tetrahedral hole</b> (<a href="#fig_3.17">Fig. 3.17b</a>) is formed by a planar triangle of touching spheres capped by a single sphere lying in the dip between them. The tetrahedral holes in any close-packed solid can be divided into two sets: in one the apex of the tetrahedron is directed up (T) and in the other the apex points down (T&#x2032;). In an arrangement of <i>N</i> close-packed spheres there are <i>N</i> tetrahedral holes of each set and 2<i>N</i> tetrahedral holes in all. In a close-packed structure of spheres of radius <i>r</i>, a tetrahedral hole can accommodate another hard sphere of radius no greater than 0.225<i>r</i> (see <i>Self-test 3.4</i>). The location of tetrahedral holes, and the four nearest-neighbour spheres for one hole, is shown in <a href="#fig_3.20">Fig. 3.20</a>a for a hcp arrangement and in <a href="#fig_3.20">Fig. 3.20b</a> for a ccp arrangement. Individual tetrahedral holes in ccp and hcp structures are identical (because they are properties of two neighbouring close-packed layers) but in the hcp arrangement neighbouring T and T&#x2032; holes share a common tetrahedral face and are so close together that they are never occupied simultaneously.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b>The structures of metals and alloys</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">X-ray diffraction studies (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>) reveal that many metallic elements have close-packed structures, indicating that the bonds between the atoms have little directional covalent character (<a href="#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a>, <a href="#fig_3.21">Fig. 3.21</a>). One consequence of this close-packing is that metals often have high densities because the most mass is packed into the smallest volume. Indeed, the elements deep in the d block, near iridium and osmium, include the densest solids known under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. Osmium has the highest density of all the elements at 22.61&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, and the density of tungsten, 19.25&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, which is almost twice that of lead (11.3&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>), results in its use as weighting material in fishing equipment and as ballast in high-performance cars.</p>

<h3 class="h3">3.4 <b>Polytypism</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Polytypes involving complex stacking arrangements of close-packed layers occur for some metals.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Which of the common close-packed polytypes, hcp or ccp, a metal adopts depends on the details of the electronic structure of its atoms, the extent of interaction between second-nearest-neighbours, and the potential for some directional character in the bonding. It has been observed that softer, more malleable metals, such as copper and gold, adopt the ccp <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, The structures of simple solids</a>arrangement while metals with hcp, such as cobalt and magnesium, are harder and more brittle. This behaviour is related to how easily planes of atoms can slip past each other. In hcp only the neighbouring close-packed planes, A and B, can move easily relative to each other but consideration of the ccp structure, when drawn as in Figure 3.14, shows that the planes ABC can be chosen in different orthogonal directions, allowing the closed-packed layers of atoms to move easily in multiple directions.</p>
<p class="indent">A close-packed structure need not be either of the common ABAB &#x2026; or ABCABC &#x2026; polytypes. An infinite range of close-packed polytypes can in fact occur, as the layers may stack in a more complex repetition of A, B, and C layers or even in some permissible random sequence. The stacking cannot be a completely random choice of A, B, and C sequences, however, because adjacent layers cannot have exactly the same sphere positions; for instance, AA, BB, and CC cannot occur because spheres in one layer must occupy dips in the adjacent layer. Cobalt is an example of a metal that displays this more complex polytypism. Above 500&#x00B0;C, cobalt is ccp but it undergoes a transition when cooled. The structure that results is a nearly randomly stacked set (for instance, ABACBABABC &#x2026;) of close-packed layers of Co atoms. In some samples of cobalt the polytypism is not random, as the sequence of planes of atoms repeats after several hundred layers. The long-range repeat may be a consequence of a spiral growth of the crystal that requires several hundred turns before a stacking pattern is repeated.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Not all elemental metals have structure based on close-packing and some other packing patterns use space nearly as efficiently. Even metals that are close-packed may undergo a phase transition to a less closely packed structure when they are heated and their atoms undergo large-amplitude vibrations.</p>
<p class="indent">One commonly adopted arrangement has the translational symmetry of the body-centred cubic lattice and is known as the <b>body-centred cubic</b> structure (cubic-I or bcc), in which a sphere is at the centre of a cube with spheres at each corner (<a href="#fig_3.22">Fig. 3.22a</a>). Metals with this structure have a coordination number of 8 because the central atom is in contact with the atoms at the corners of the unit cell. Although a bcc structure is less closely packed than the ccp and hcp structures (for which the coordination number is 12), the difference is not very great because the central atom has six second-nearest neighbours, at the centres of the adjacent unit cells, only 15 per cent further away. This arrangement leaves 32 per cent of the space unfilled compared with 26 per cent in the close-packed structures (see <a href="#exam_3.3">Example 3.3</a>). A bcc structure is adopted by 15 of the elements under standard conditions, including all the alkali metals and the metals in Groups 5 and 6. Accordingly, this simple arrangement of atoms is sometimes referred to as the &#x2018;tungsten type&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="indent">The least common metallic structure is the <b>primitive cubic</b> (cubic-P) structure (<a href="#fig_3.23">Fig. 3.23</a>), in which spheres are located at the lattice points of a primitive cubic lattice, taken as the corners of the cube. The coordination number of a cubic-P structure is 6. One form of polonium (<i>&#x03B1;</i>-Po) is the only example of this structure among the elements under normal conditions, though bismuth also adopts this structure under pressure. Solid mercury (<i>&#x03B1;</i><i>-</i>Hg), however, has a closely related structure: it is obtained from the cubic-P arrangement by stretching the cube along one of its body diagonals (<a href="#fig_3.24">Fig. 3.24a</a>); a second form of solid mercury (<i>&#x03B2;</i>-Hg) has a structure based on the bcc arrangement but compressed along one cell direction (<a href="#fig_3.24">Fig. 3.24b</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Metals that have structures more complex than those described so far can sometimes be regarded, like solid mercury, as having slightly distorted versions of simple structures. Zinc and cadmium, for instance, have almost hcp structures, but the planes of close-packed atoms are separated by a slightly greater distance than in perfect hcp.</p>

<p><a id="page_75" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 75, The structures of simple solids</a></p>
<p class="indent">The lack of directionality in the interactions between metal atoms accounts for the wide occurrence of <b>polymorphism</b>, the ability to adopt different crystal forms under different conditions of pressure and temperature. It is often, but not universally, found that the most closely packed phases are thermodynamically favoured at low temperatures and the less closely packed structures are favoured at high temperatures. Similarly, the application of high pressure leads to structures with higher packing densities, such as ccp and hcp.</p>
<p class="indent">The polymorphs of metals are generally labelled <i>&#x03B1;</i>, <i>&#x03B2;</i>, <i>&#x03B3;</i>, &#x2026; with increasing temperature. Some metals revert to a low-temperature form at higher temperatures. Iron, for example, shows several solid&#x2013;solid phase transitions; <i>&#x03B1;</i>-Fe, which is bcc, occurs up to 906&#x00B0;C; <i>&#x03B3;</i>-Fe, which is ccp, occurs up to 1401&#x00B0;C; and then <i>&#x03B1;</i>-Fe occurs again up to the melting point at 1530&#x00B0;C. The hcp polymorph, <i>&#x03B2;</i>-Fe, is formed at high pressures and was believed to be the form that exists at the Earth&#x2019;s core, but recent studies indicate that a bcc polymorph is more likely (<a href="#box_3.1">Box 3.1</a>).</p>

The pressure at the centre of the Earth has been calculated to be around 370 GPa (about 3.7 million atm) at a temperature of 5000&#x2212;6500&#x00B0;C. The polymorph of iron that exists under these conditions has been much debated, with information from theoretical calculations and measurements using seismology. The current thinking is that the iron core consists of the body-centred cubic polymorph. It has been proposed that this exists either as a giant crystal or a large number of oriented crystals such that the long diagonal of the bcc unit cell aligns along the Earth&#x2019;s axis of rotation (<a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. B3.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indentt" style="margin-top:2em;">The bcc structure is common at high temperatures for metals that are close-packed at low temperatures because the increased amplitude of atomic vibrations in the hotter solid results in a less close-packed structure. For many metals (among them Ca, Ti, and Mn) the transition temperature is above room temperature; for others (among them Li and Na), the transition temperature is below room temperature. It is also found empirically that a bcc structure is favoured by metals with a small number of valence electrons per orbital.</p>

The same atom in structures with different coordination numbers may therefore appear to have different radii, and an atom of an element with coordination number 12 appears bigger than one with coordination number 8. In an extensive study of internuclear separations in a wide variety of polymorphic elements and alloys, V.

As remarked in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>, trends in atomic radii reveal the presence of the lanthanoid contraction in Period 6, with atomic radii of the elements that follow the lanthanoids found to be smaller than simple extrapolation from earlier periods would suggest.

<h3 class="h3">3.8 <b>Alloys and interstitials</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">An <b>alloy</b> is a blend of metallic elements prepared by mixing the molten components and then cooling the mixture to produce a metallic solid. Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions, in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other, or they may be compounds with a definite composition and internal structure. Alloys typically form from two electropositive metals, so they are likely to be located towards the bottom left-hand corner of a Ketelaar triangle (<a href="#fig_3.25">Fig. 3.25</a>). The majority of simple alloys can be classified as either &#x2018;substitutional&#x2019; or &#x2018;interstitial&#x2019;. A substitutional solid solution is a solution in which atoms of the solute metal replace some of the parent pure metal atoms (<a href="#fig_3.26">Fig. 3.26</a>). Some of the classic examples of alloys are brass (up to 38 atom per cent Zn in Cu), bronze (a metal other than Zn or Ni in Cu; casting bronze, for instance, is 10 atom per cent Sn and 5 atom per cent Pb), and stainless steel (over 12 atom per cent Cr in Fe). <b>Interstitial solid solutions</b> are often formed between metals and small atoms (such as boron, carbon, and nitrogen) that can occupy interstices, such as octahedral and tetrahedral holes, at low levels in a parent metal while maintaining its crystal structure. Examples include the carbon steels.</p>

<h4 class="h4">(a) Substitutional alloys</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> A substitutional solid solution or alloy involves the replacement of one type of metal atom in a structure by another.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Substitutional solid solutions are generally formed if three criteria are fulfilled:</p>
<p class="indentbulletlt" style="width:67%;">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The atomic radii of the elements are within about 15 per cent of each other.</p>
<p class="indentbulletl" style="width:67%;">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;The crystal structures of the two pure metals are the same; this similarity indicates that the directional forces between the two types of atom are compatible with each other.</p>
<p class="indentbulletl" style="width:67%;">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;The electropositive characters of the two components are similar; otherwise compound formation, where electrons are transferred between species, would be more likely.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Thus, although sodium and potassium are chemically similar and have bcc structures, the atomic radius of Na (191&#x2009;pm) is 19 per cent smaller than that of K (235&#x2009;pm), and the two metals do not form a solid solution. Copper and nickel, however, two neighbours late in the d block, have similar electropositive character, similar crystal structures (both ccp), and similar atomic radii (Ni 125&#x2009;pm, Cu 128&#x2009;pm, only 2.3 per cent different), and form a continuous series of solid solutions, ranging from pure nickel to pure copper. Zinc, copper&#x2019;s <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, The structures of simple solids</a>other neighbour in Period 4, has a similar atomic radius (137&#x2009;pm, 7 per cent larger), but it is hcp, not ccp. In this instance, zinc forms a solid solution with copper for low levels of zinc, forming phases known as &#x2018;<i>&#x03B1;</i>-brasses&#x2019; with the composition Cu<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Zn<sub><i>x</i></sub>, 0 &#x2264; <i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.38, and the same structural type as pure copper (ccp). Where alloys adopt a different crystal structure from that of the pure metal these materials are usually referred to as intermetallics (<a href="#sec_3.8">Section 3.8</a>c).</p>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Interstitial atoms in metals</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> In an interstitial solid solution, additional small atoms occupy holes within the lattice of the original metal structure.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Interstitial solid solutions are often formed between metals and small atoms (such as boron, carbon, or nitrogen) that can inhabit the interstices, normally the tetrahedral or tetrahedral holes, in the structure. The small atoms enter the host solid with preservation of the crystal structure of the original metal and without the transfer of electrons and formation of ionic species. There is either a simple whole-number ratio of metal and interstitial atoms (as in tungsten carbide, WC) or the small atoms are distributed randomly in the available spaces or holes in the structure between the packed atoms. The former substances are true compounds and the latter can be considered as interstitial solid solutions or, on account of the variation in the atomic ratio of the two elements, nonstoichiometric compounds (<a href="#sec_3.17">Section 3.17</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Considerations of size can help to decide where the formation of an interstitial solid solution is likely to occur. Thus, the largest solute atom that can enter a close-packed solid without distorting the structure appreciably is one that just fits an octahedral hole, which as we have seen has radius 0.414<i>r</i>. For small atoms such as B, C, or N the atomic radii of the possible host metal atom structures include those of the d metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni. One important class of materials of this type consists of carbon steels in which C atoms occupy some of the octahedral holes in the Fe bcc lattice. Carbon steels typically contain between 0.2 and 1.6 atom per cent C and with increasing carbon content they become harder and stronger but less malleable (<a href="#box_3.2">Box 3.2</a>).</p>
<div class="bggr" style="margin-top:2em;">
<div class="bggr1">
<p class="boxtitle"><a id="box_3.2"></a><b><span class="bgg">BOX 3.2</span> Steels</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">Steels are alloys of iron, carbon, and other elements. They are classified as mild, medium-carbon, or high-carbon steels according to the percentage of carbon they contain. Mild steels contain up to 0.25 atom per cent C, medium-carbon steels contain 0.25 to 0.45 atom per cent, and high-carbon steels contain 0.45 to 1.50 atom per cent. The addition of other metals to these carbon steels can have a major effect on the structure, properties, and therefore applications of the steel. Examples of metals added to carbon steels, so forming &#x2018;stainless steels&#x2019;, are listed in the table. Stainless steels are also classified by their crystalline structures, which are controlled by factors such as the rate of cooling following their formation in a furnace and the type of added metal. Thus pure iron adopts different polymorphs (<a href="#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>) depending on temperature, and some of these high-temperature structures can be stabilized at room temperature in steels or by quenching (cooling very rapidly).</p>
<p class="boxparai">Stainless steels with the <b>austenite</b> structure comprise over 70 per cent of total stainless steel production. Austenite is a solid solution of carbon and iron that exists in steel above 723&#x00B0;C and is ccp iron with about 2 per cent of the octahedral holes filled with carbon. As it cools, it breaks down into other materials, including ferrite and martensite, as the solubility of carbon in the iron drops to below 1 atom per cent. The rate of cooling determines the relative proportions of these materials and therefore the mechanical properties (for example, hardness and tensile strength) of the steel. The addition of certain other metals, such as Mn, Ni, and Cr, can allow the austenitic structure to survive cooling to room temperature. These steels contain a maximum of 0.15 atom per cent C and typically 10&#x2212;20 atom per cent Cr plus Ni or Mn as a substitutional solid solution; they can retain an austenitic structure at all temperatures from the cryogenic region to the melting point of the alloy. A typical composition of 18 atom per cent Cr and 8 atom per cent Ni in addition to iron is known as <i>18/8 stainless</i>.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Ferrite is <i>&#x03B1;</i>-Fe with only a very small level of carbon, less than 0.1 atom per cent, with a bcc iron crystal structure. Ferritic stainless steels are highly corrosion-resistant, but far less durable than austenitic grades. They contain between 10.5 and 27 atom per cent Cr and some Mo, Al, or W. Martensitic stainless steels are not as corrosion-resistant as the other two classes, but are strong and tough as well as highly machineable, and can be hardened by heat treatment. They contain 11.5 to 18 atom per cent Cr and 1&#x2212;2 atom per cent C which is trapped in the iron structure as a result of quenching compositions with the austenite structure type. The martensitic crystal structure is closely related to that of ferrite but the unit cell is tetragonal rather than cubic.</p>

<h4 class="h4">(c) Intermetallic compounds</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Intermetallic compounds are alloys in which the structure adopted is different from the structures of either component metal.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">When some liquid mixtures of metals are cooled, they form phases with definite structures that are often unrelated to the parent structure. These phases are called <b>intermetallic compounds</b>. Examples include &#x03B2;-brass (CuZn) and compounds of the compositions MgZn<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sub>3</sub>Au, NaTl, and Na<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>21</sub>. &#x03B2;-brass with the composition Cu<sub>0.52</sub>Zn<sub>0.48</sub> adopts a bcc structure type at high temperature and a hcp structure at lower temperatures.</p>
<p class="indent">Particular intermetallic alloy structures are found for specific values of the electron-per-atom ratio (e/a) and a series of rules, proposed in 1926 by Hume-Rothery, allow the prediction of the most stable structure (normally bcc, hcp, or fcc) for a chosen alloy composition. These rules, which require a detailed understanding of band structure (<a href="#sec_3.19">Section 3.19</a>), predict that a Cu:Zn alloy with e/a&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;1.4 (<i>&#x03B1;</i>-brass, Cu<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Zn<sub><i>x</i></sub> with 0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>x</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.38) should have a ccp lattice, and an alloy with e/a of 1.5 (CuZn, &#x03B2;-brass) a bcc lattice. These rules count pure copper (with the configuration 3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>1</sup>) as contributing one electron and zinc (3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>) as contributing two electrons, so the alloys between pure copper and pure zinc span e/a values from 1 to 2. On this basis the &#x03B2;-brass composition close to Cu<sub>0.5</sub>Zn<sub>0.5</sub> (e/a&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1.5) is predicted to have a bcc structure, which, as noted above, it does adopt at high temperatures.</p>
<p class="indent">Some alloys, including &#x03B3;-brass in the Cu/Zn system of the stoichiometry Cu<sub>0.39</sub>Zn<sub>0.61</sub>, form very complex structures due to the arrangements of copper and zinc atoms and some vacant sites; the unit cell of &#x03B3;-brass is 27 times the size of that of &#x03B2;-brass. Other alloys such as Al<sub>0.88</sub>Mn<sub>0.12</sub> form structures which include elements of five-fold symmetry and therefore do not repeat perfectly when translated as a unit cell. These materials are known as quasicrystals, and Shechtman was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on these alloys (<a href="#box_3.3">Box 3.3</a>).</p>
<div class="bggr">
<div class="bggr1">
<p class="boxtitle"><a id="box_3.3"></a><b><span class="bgg">BOX 3.3</span> Quasicrystals</b></p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">Most crystalline solids have structures with long-range periodic order that can be described using a unit cell that repeats at regular intervals (<a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>). For unit cells to pack and fill three-dimensional space fully there are restrictions on the symmetry of the unit cell: two-, three-, four-, and six-fold rotational symmetry is allowed, but five-, seven-, and all higher-fold symmetry axes are forbidden. (The essential symmetries for the seven different crystal systems are given in <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a>). The reasons for these symmetry restrictions can be readily visualized: tiling two-dimensional space, so that there is no space between tiles, is possible with square and hexagonal tiles (four- and six-fold rotational symmetry, respectively) but impossible with pentagonal tiles (five-fold symmetry).</p>
<p class="boxparai">Quasicrystals (quasiperiodic crystals) have a more complex long-range order. In a quasiperiodic structure, the atomic positions along each direction in the crystal are repeated at an irrational number of units (rather than integer values as in the repeat of unit cells of crystalline materials). This difference exempts quasicrystals from the crystallographic restrictions and they can exhibit rotational symmetries forbidden to crystals, including five-fold symmetry. Unlike with normal crystals, the pattern never repeats itself exactly; one example is shown in <a href="#figb3.2">Fig. B3.2</a>. Despite this, quasicrystals are well-ordered materials, often intermetallics, that produce sharp diffraction patterns (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>). The concept of quasicrystals was introduced in 1984 following the study of a rapidly quenched alloy of 86 per cent Al and 14 per cent Mn that showed icosahedral symmetry; Dan Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011 for this work. In the last 25 years well over 100 different quasicrystalline systems have been identified, including complex compositions and structures such as the decagonal Al<sub>70&#x00B7;5</sub>Mn<sub>16&#x00B7;5</sub>Pd<sub>13</sub>.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Quasicrystal materials tend to be hard but are relatively poor conductors of heat (as regular periodic arrays of atoms, such as occurs in diamond and graphene, produce the highest rates of thermal energy conduction) and electricity. These properties make them useful as coatings for frying pans and as insulating materials for electrical wires. They are also used in the most durable steels, in razor blades, and in ultrafine needles for eye surgery.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;">Intermetallic compounds are normally high-melting, hard, and more brittle than most metals and alloys.

<p class="boxpara">Intermetallics with the acronym &#x2018;<b>alnico</b>&#x2019; consist mainly of iron with Al, Ni, and Co and, sometimes, small levels of C and Ti. Alnico alloys are ferromagnets that have a very good resistance to loss of magnetism (a high coercivity), even at high temperatures, and as a result they have widespread applications as permanent magnets. Before the development of rare-earth magnets in the 1970s (<a href="Chapter23.xhtml#sec_23.3">Section 23.3</a>), they were the strongest available magnets. One such intermetallic, alnico-500, contains 50 per cent Fe with the remainder as 24 per cent cobalt, 14 per cent nickel, 8 per cent aluminium, 3 per cent copper, and 0.45 per cent niobium. The structures of these alnico alloys are essentially the simple bcc unit cell with a random distribution of the various metal atom components (<a href="#sec_3.5">Section 3.5</a>), but at the microscopic level the structure is more complex, with small portions of the crystals (domains) being richer in one component and poorer in another.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The so-called <b>A15 phases</b> are a series of intermetallic compounds of the composition A<sub>3</sub>B (where A is a transition metal and B can be a transition metal or a Group 13 or 14 element).

LaNi<sub>5</sub> absorbs up to six hydrogen atoms per formula unit under 1.5 atm of H<sub>2</sub>(g) at 300 K, making this phase of interest for hydrogen-storage applications. The hydrogen is released on heating to 350 K. The relatively low proportion of hydrogen in LaNi<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, 1.4 weight per cent, probably makes this material unsuitable for transport applications, but further alloying with magnesium improves this value.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Several intermetallic phases show the properties of a <b>shape-memory alloy (SMA)</b>, of which Cu-Al-Ni (Cu<sub>3</sub>Al with a small level of nickel) and <b>Nitinol</b> (<b>N</b>ickel <b>T</b>itanium <b>N</b>aval <b>O</b>rdnance <b>L</b>aboratory, NiTi) are perhaps the most important. Nitinol can undergo a phase change between two forms known as martensite (with a tetragonal unit cell) and austenite (face-centred cubic); see also <a href="#box_3.2">Box 3.2</a>. In the martensite form Nitinol can be bent into various shapes but when this form is heated it converts to a rigid austenite phase. On cooling the austenite phase, the SMA converts back to the martensite form but with a &#x2018;memory&#x2019; of the shape of the high-temperature austenite form. It will convert back to this martensite form if heated above a specific temperature, the transition temperature, M<sub>s</sub>. By varying the Ni:Ti ratio, M<sub>s</sub> can be adjusted between &#x2212;100&#x00B0;C and &#x002B;150&#x00B0;C. Thus if a straight wire of Nitinol, with M<sub>s</sub>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;50&#x00B0;C and previously heated to 500&#x00B0;C, is bent into a complex shape at room temperature it will retain that shape indefinitely under ambient conditions; however, on heating to over 50&#x00B0;C it will spring back to its original straight form. This cycle can be repeated millions of times. SMAs are used in some actuators, where a material that changes shape, stiffness, or position in response to temperature is needed. Applications have included variable-geometry parts in aircraft engines to reduce noise as their temperature increases, brackets and wires in dental surgery, resilient frames for glasses, and expandable coronary stents. A collapsible stent can be inserted into a vein and when heated it will return to its original expanded shape, thus improving the blood flow.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Ionic solids, such as NaCl and KNO<sub>3</sub>, are often recognized by their brittleness because the electrons made available by cation formation are localized on a neighbouring anion; striking the solid can cause ions of the same charge to shift to adjacent positions and the resultant repulsion causes it to fracture. Ionic solids also commonly have high melting points, because of the strong Coulombic forces between oppositely charged ions that have to be overcome in producing the molten state, and most are soluble in polar solvents, particularly water, where the ions become strongly solvated. However, there are exceptions: CaF<sub>2</sub>, for example, is a high-melting ionic solid but it is insoluble in water. Ammonium nitrate, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, is ionic in terms of the interactions between the ammonium and nitrate ions, but melts at 170&#x00B0;C. Binary ionic materials are typical of elements with large electronegativity differences, typically &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;3, and such compounds are therefore likely to be found at the top corner of a Ketelaar triangle (<a href="#fig_3.27">Fig. 3.27</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The classification of a solid as ionic is based on comparison of its properties with those of the <b>ionic model</b>, which treats the solid as an assembly of oppositely charged, hard spheres that interact primarily by nondirectional electrostatic forces (Coulombic forces). If the thermodynamic properties of the solid calculated using this model agree with experiment, then the solid may be ionic. However, it should be noted that many examples of coincidental agreement with the ionic model are known, so numerical agreement alone does not imply ionic bonding. The nondirectional nature of electrostatic interactions between ions in an ionic solid contrast with those present in a covalent solid, where the symmetries of the atomic orbitals play a strong role in determining the geometry of the structure. However, the assumption that ions can be treated as perfectly hard spheres (of fixed radius for a particular ion type) that have no directionality in their bonding is far from true for real ions. For example, with halide anions some directionality might be expected in their bonding as a result of the orientations of their p orbitals, and large ions such as Cs<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> are easily polarizable so do not behave as hard spheres. Even so, the ionic model is a useful starting point for describing many simple structures.</p>
<p class="indent">We start by describing some common ionic structures in terms of the packing of hard spheres of different sizes and opposite charges. After that, we see how to rationalize the structures in terms of the energetics of crystal formation. The structures described have been obtained by using X-ray diffraction (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>), and were among the first substances to be examined in this way.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.9">
<h3 class="h3">3.9 <b>Characteristic structures of ionic solids</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ionic structures described in this section are prototypes of a wide range of solids. For instance, although the rock-salt structure takes its name from a mineral form of NaCl, it is characteristic of numerous other solids (<a href="#tab3.4">Table 3.4</a>). Many of the structures can be regarded as derived from arrays in which the larger of the ions, usually the anions, stack together in ccp or hcp patterns and the smaller counter-ions (usually the cations) occupy the octahedral or tetrahedral holes in the lattice (<a href="#tab3.5">Table 3.5</a>). Throughout the following discussion, it will be helpful to refer back to <a href="#fig_3.18">Figs 3.18</a> and <a href="#fig_3.20">3.20</a> to see how the structure being described is related to the hole patterns shown there. The close-packed layers usually need to expand to accommodate the counter-ions but this expansion is often a minor perturbation of the anion arrangement, which will still be referred to as ccp and hcp. This expansion avoids some of the strong repulsion between the identically charged ions and also allows larger species to be inserted into the holes between larger ions. Overall, examining the opportunities for hole-filling in a close-packed array of the larger ion type provides an excellent starting point for the descriptions of many simple ionic structures.</p>

<p class="indentt" style="margin-top:2em;">The simplest ionic compounds contain just one type of cation (A) and one type of anion (X), present in various ratios covering compositions such as AX and AX<sub>2</sub>. Several different structures may exist for each of these compositions, depending on the relative sizes of the cations and anions, and which holes are filled and to what degree in the close-packed array (<a href="#tab3.5">Table 3.5</a>). We start by considering compositions AX with equal numbers of cations and anions and then consider AX<sub>2</sub>, the other commonly found stoichiometry.</p>
<p class="indent">The <b>rock-salt structure</b> is based on a ccp array of bulky anions with cations in all the octahedral holes (<a href="#fig_3.30">Fig. 3.30</a>). Alternatively, it can be viewed as a structure in which the anions occupy all the octahedral holes in a ccp array of cations. As the number of octahedral holes in a close-packed array is equal to the number of ions forming the array (the X ions), then filling them all with A ions yields the stoichiometry AX. Because each ion is surrounded by an octahedron of six counter-ions, the coordination number of each type of ion is 6 and the structure is said to have <b>6:6 coordination</b>. In this notation, the first number in parentheses is the coordination number of the cation and the second number is the coordination number of the anion. The rock-salt structure can still be described as having a face-centred cubic lattice after this hole-filling because the translational symmetry demanded by this lattice type is preserved when all the octahedral sites are occupied.</p>
<p class="indent">To visualize the local environment of an ion in the rock-salt structure, we should note that the six nearest neighbours of the central ion of the cell shown in <a href="#fig_3.30">Fig. 3.30</a> lie at the centres of the faces of the cell and form an octahedron around the central ion. All six neighbours have a charge opposite to that of the central ion. The 12 second-nearest neighbours of the central ion are at the centres of the edges of the cell, and all have the same charge as the central ion. The eight third-nearest neighbours are at the corners of the unit <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, The structures of simple solids</a>cell, and have a charge opposite to that of the central ion. We can use the rules described in <a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a> to determine the composition of the unit cell and the number of atoms or ions of each type present.</p>

<p class="indentt">The rock-salt arrangement is not just formed for simple monatomic species such as M<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> but also for many 1:1 compounds in which the ions are complex units, such as [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>][TlCl<sub>6</sub>]. The structure of this compound can be considered as an array of close-packed octahedral [TlCl<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> anions with [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cations in all the octahedral holes. Similarly, compounds such as CaC<sub>2</sub>, CsO<sub>2</sub>, KCN, and FeS<sub>2</sub> all adopt structures closely related to the rock-salt structure, with alternating cations and complex anions (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>C</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>, CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>, respectively), although the orientation of these linear diatomic species can lead to elongation of the unit cell and elimination of the cubic symmetry (<a href="#fig_3.31">Fig. 3.31</a>). Further compositional flexibility, but retaining a rock-salt type of structure, can come from having more than one cation or anion type while maintaining the overall 1:1 ratio between ions of opposite charge. Thus, filling half of the A sites in the rock-salt structure type as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and half as Ni<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> gives rise to the formula (Li<sub>&#x00BD;</sub>Ni<sub>&#x00BD;</sub>)O, which is normally written as LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, and the known compound of this stoichiometry adopts this structure type.</p>
<p class="indent">Much less common than the rock-salt structure for compounds of stoichiometry AX is the <b>caesium-chloride structure</b> (<a href="#fig_3.32">Fig. 3.32</a>), which is possessed by CsCl, CsBr, and CsI, as well as some other compounds formed of ions of similar radii to these, including TlI (see <a href="#tab3.4">Table 3.4</a>). The caesium-chloride structure has a primitive cubic unit cell, with each corner occupied by an anion, and a cation occupying the &#x2018;cubic hole&#x2019; at the cell centre (or vice versa); as a result, <i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1. An alternative view of this structure is as two interpenetrating primitive cubic cells, one of Cs<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and the other of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The coordination number of both types of ion is 8, so the structure is described as having 8:8 coordination. The radii are so similar that this energetically highly favourable coordination is feasible, with numerous counter-ions adjacent to a given ion. Note that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl also forms this structure despite the relatively small size of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mtext>N</mtext><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> ion because the cation can form hydrogen bonds with four of the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions at the corners of the cube (<a href="#fig_3.33">Fig. 3.33</a>).

<p class="indentt">The <b>wurtzite structure</b> (<a href="#fig_3.35">Fig. 3.35</a>) takes its name from another polymorph of zinc sulfide that occurs naturally as a mineral. It differs from the sphalerite structure in being derived from an expanded hcp anion array rather than a ccp array, but as in sphalerite the cations occupy half the tetrahedral holes; that is just one of the two types (either T or T&#x2032; as discussed in <a href="#sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>). This structure, which has 4:4 coordination, is adopted by ZnO, one form of AgI, and one polymorph of SiC, as well as several other compounds (<a href="#tab3.4">Table 3.4</a>). The local symmetries of the cations and anions are identical with respect to their nearest neighbours in wurtzite and sphalerite but differ at the second-nearest neighbours. There <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, The structures of simple solids</a>are many compounds which show polymorphism and crystallize with both sphalerite and wurtzite structure types depending on the conditions under which they were formed or the conditions, temperature and pressure, to which they are subjected.</p>

<p class="indent">The <b>nickel-arsenide structure</b> (NiAs, <a href="#fig_3.36">Fig. 3.36</a>) is also based on an expanded, distorted hcp anion array, but the Ni atoms now occupy the octahedral holes and each As atom lies at the centre of a trigonal prism of Ni atoms. This structure is adopted by NiS, FeS, and a number of other sulfides. The nickel-arsenide structure is typical of MX compounds that contain polarizable ions and are formed from elements with smaller electronegativity differences than elements that, as ions, adopt the rock-salt structure. Compounds that form this structure type lie in the &#x2018;polarized ionic salt area&#x2019; of a Ketelaar triangle (<a href="#fig_3.37">Fig. 3.37</a>). There is also potential for some degree of metal&#x2013;metal bonding between metal atoms in adjacent layers (see Figure 3.36c) and this structure type (or distorted forms of it) is also common for a large number of alloys based on d- and p-block elements.</p>
<p class="indent">A common AX<sub>2</sub> structural type is the <b>fluorite structure</b>, which takes its name from its exemplar, the naturally occurring mineral fluorite, CaF<sub>2</sub>. In fluorite, the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions lie in an expanded ccp array and the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions occupy all the tetrahedral holes (<a href="#fig_3.38">Fig. 3.38</a>). In this description it is the cations that are close-packed because the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> anions are small. The lattice has 8:4 coordination, which is consistent with there being twice as many anions as cations. The anions in their tetrahedral holes have four nearest neighbours and the cation site is surrounded by a cubic array of eight anions.</p>
<p class="indent">The <b>antifluorite</b> structure is the inverse of the fluorite structure in the sense that the locations of cations and anions are reversed; this reflects the fact that the structure is adopted in compounds with the smallest cations such as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (<i>r</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;59&#x2009;pm in four-fold coordination). The structure is shown by some alkali metal oxides, including Li<sub>2</sub>O. In it, the cations (which are twice as numerous as the anions) occupy all the tetrahedral holes of a ccp array of anions. The coordination is (4,8) rather than the (8,4) of fluorite itself.</p>

<p class="indentt" style="margin-top:2em;">Spinel itself is MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and oxide spinels, in general, have the formula AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

Spinel formulas are sometimes written A[B<sub>2</sub>]O<sub>4</sub>, the square brackets denoting the cation type (normally the smaller, higher-charged ion of A and B) that occupies the octahedral holes. So, for example, ZnAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can be written Zn[Al<sub>2</sub>]O<sub>4</sub> to show that all the Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cations occupy octahedral sites. Examples of compounds that have spinel structures include many ternary oxides with the stoichiometry AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> that contain a 3d-series metal, such as NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and some simple binary d-block oxides, such as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; note that in these structures A and B are the same element but in different oxidation states, as in Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>[Mn<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

<h3 class="h3">3.10 <b>The rationalization of structures</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The thermodynamic stabilities and structures of ionic solids can be treated very simply using the ionic model where ions are treated purely as hard, charged spheres. However, a model of a solid in terms of charged spheres interacting electrostatically is crude and we should expect significant departures from its predictions because many solids involve some covalent bonding. Even conventional &#x2018;good&#x2019; ionic solids, such as the alkali metal halides, have some covalent character. Nevertheless, the ionic model provides an attractively simple and effective scheme for correlating many properties.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Ionic radii</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The sizes of ions&#x2014;ionic radii&#x2014;generally increase down a group, decrease across a period, increase with coordination number, and decrease with increasing charge number.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A difficulty that confronts us at the outset is the meaning of the term &#x2018;ionic radius&#x2019;. As remarked in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>, it is necessary to apportion the single internuclear separation of nearest-neighbour ions between the two different species (for example, an Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion and a <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, The structures of simple solids</a>Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion in contact). The most direct way to solve the problem is to make an assumption about the radius of one ion, and then to use that value to compile a set of self-consistent values for all other ions. The O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion has the advantage of being found in combination with a wide range of elements. It is also reasonably unpolarizable, so its size does not vary much as the identity of the accompanying cation is changed. In a number of compilations, therefore, the values are based on <i>r</i>(O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;140&#x2009;pm. However, this value is by no means sacrosanct: a set of values compiled by Goldschmidt was based on <i>r</i>(O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;132&#x2009;pm, and other value sets use the F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion as the basis.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">For certain purposes (such as predicting the sizes of unit cells) ionic radii can be helpful, but they are reliable only if they are all based on the same fundamental choice (such as the value 140&#x2009;pm for O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>). If values of ionic radii are used from different sources, it is essential to verify that they are based on the same convention. An additional complication, first noted by Goldschmidt, is that, as we have already seen for metals, apparent ionic radii increase with coordination number (<a href="#fig_3.45">Fig. 3.45</a>). This is because, when fitting larger numbers of oppositely charged ions around a central ion, the repulsions between the former will push them further away from the central ion, increasing its apparent radius. Hence, when comparing ionic radii, we should compare like with like, and use values for a single coordination number (typically 6).</p>
<p class="indent">The problems of the early workers have been resolved only partly by developments in X-ray diffraction (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.1">Section 8.1</a>). It is now possible to measure the electron density between two neighbouring ions and identify the minimum as the boundary between them. However, as can be seen from <a href="#fig_3.46">Fig. 3.46</a>, the electron density passes through a very broad minimum, and its exact location may be very sensitive to experimental uncertainties and to the identities of the two neighbours. By analysing X-ray diffraction data on thousands of compounds, particularly oxides and fluorides, very extensive lists of self-consistent values have been compiled, and some are given in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#tab1.4">Table 1.4</a> and <i>Resource section 1</i>.</p>

<h4 class="h4">(b) The radius ratio</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The radius ratio indicates the likely coordination numbers of the ions in a binary compound.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A parameter that figures widely in the literature of inorganic chemistry, particularly in introductory texts, is the <b>radius ratio,</b> <i>&#x03B3;</i> (gamma), of the ions. This is the ratio of the radius of the smaller ion (<i>r</i><sub>small</sub>) to that of the larger (<i>r</i><sub>large</sub>):</p>
<p class="eqn">

<p class="noindentt">In most cases, <i>r</i><sub>small</sub> is the cation radius and <i>r</i><sub>large</sub> is the anion radius. The minimum radius ratio that can support a given coordination number is then calculated by considering the geometrical problem of packing together spheres of different sizes (<a href="#tab3.6">Table 3.6</a>). It is argued that, if the radius ratio falls below the minimum given, then ions of opposite charge will not be in contact and ions of like charge will touch. According to a simple electrostatic argument, a lower coordination number, in which the contact of oppositely charged ions is restored, then becomes favourable. Another way of looking at this argument is that, as the radius of the M<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion increases, more anions can pack around it, so giving a larger number <a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, The structures of simple solids</a>of favourable Coulombic interactions. Note that these simple electrostatic arguments only consider nearest-neighbour interactions, and a better model for predicting the packing ions requires more detailed calculations taking into account the whole ion array; these are undertaken in <a href="#sec_3.12">Section 3.12</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">We can use our previous calculations of hole size (<a href="#exam_3.4">Example 3.4</a>), to put these ideas on a firmer footing. A cation of radius 0.225<i>r</i> or below will fit into (and one below 0.225<i>r</i> will rattle around in) a tetrahedral hole. Note that 0.225<i>r</i> represents the size of the largest cation that will fit in a tetrahedral hole, and cations of radius between 0.225<i>r</i> and 0.414<i>r</i> will push the anions slightly apart. Therefore, a cation of radius between 0.225<i>r</i> and 0.414<i>r</i> will only occupy a tetrahedral hole in a slightly expanded close-packed array of anions of radius <i>r</i>, but this slight expansion of the anions remains the most energetically favourable arrangement. However, once the radius of a cation reaches 0.414<i>r</i>, the anions are forced so far apart that octahedral coordination becomes possible and more favourable. This will continue to be the most favourable arrangement until it becomes possible to fit eight anions around the cation when its radius reaches 0.732<i>r</i>. In summary, the coordination number will not increase to 6, with good contacts between cation and anions, until the radius goes above 0.414<i>r</i>, and 6-coordination will be the preferred arrangement for 0.414&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;<i>&#x03B3;</i>&#x2009;&#x003C;&#x2009;0.732. Similar arguments apply for the tetrahedral holes that can be filled by smaller ions with sizes between 0.225<i>r</i> and 0.414<i>r</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">These concepts of ion packing based on radius ratios can often be used to predict which structure is most likely for any particular choice of cation and anion (<a href="#tab3.6">Table 3.6</a>). In practice, the radius ratio is most reliable when the cation coordination number is 8, and less reliable with 6- and 4-coordination cations because directional covalent bonding becomes more important for these lower coordination numbers. Polarization effects are also important for larger ions. These factors, which depend upon electronegativity and polarizability of ions, are considered in more detail in <a href="#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>c.</p>

<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> For each compound we need to calculate the radius ratio, <i>&#x03B3;</i>&#x2009;, and then use <a href="#tab3.6">Table 3.6</a> to select the most likely structure type.

This value falls in the range 0.414&#x2013;0.732 so we would predict CNs 6:6 and the rock-salt structure (NiAs is a possibility on packing considerations but is normally only found where there is a degree of covalency in the bonding). Similar calculations for BeO and PbF<sub>2</sub> give <i>&#x03B3;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0.321 and 0.894, respectively. BeO would thus be predicted to have a structure with coordination numbers 4:4 (in practice it adopts the zinc-sulfide (wurtzite) structure with 4:4 coordination). PbF<sub>2</sub>, as an AB<sub>2</sub> compound, would be predicted to have the fluorite structure (8:8 CNs) and again experimentally one form of this compound is found to adopt this structure type.</p>

<p><a id="page_90" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 90, The structures of simple solids</a></p>
<p class="indent">The ionic radii used in these calculations are those obtained by consideration of structures under normal conditions. At high pressures, different structures may be preferred, especially those with higher coordination numbers and greater density. Thus many simple compounds transform between the simple 4:4-, 6:6-, and 8:8-coordination structures under pressure. Examples of this behaviour include most of the lighter alkali metal halides, which change from a 6:6-coordination rock-salt structure to an 8:8-coordination caesium-chloride structure at 5&#x2009;kbar (the rubidium halides) or 10&#x2013;20&#x2009;kbar (the sodium and potassium halides). The ability to predict the structures of compounds under pressure is important for understanding the behaviour of ionic compounds under such conditions, for example in geochemistry. Calcium oxide, for instance, is predicted to transform from the rock-salt to the caesium-chloride structure at around 600&#x2009;kbar, the pressure in the Earth&#x2019;s lower mantle.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar arguments involving the relative ionic radii of cations and anions and their preferred coordination numbers (that is, preferences for octahedral, tetrahedral, or cubic geometries) can be applied throughout structural solid-state chemistry and aid the prediction of which ions might be incorporated into a particular structure type. For more complex stoichiometries, such as the ternary compounds with perovskite and spinel structure types, the ability to predict which combinations of cations and anions will yield a specific structure type has proved very useful. One example is that, for the high-temperature superconducting cuprates (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.8">Section 24.8</a>), the design of a particular structure feature, such as Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in octahedral coordination to oxygen, can be achieved using ionic-radii considerations.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(c) Structure maps</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> A structure map is a representation of the variation in crystal structure with the character of the bonding.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The use of radius-ratio rules is not totally reliable (it only predicts the experimental structure for about 50 per cent of compounds). However, it is possible to rationalize the choice of structure of a compound further by collecting enough information empirically and looking for patterns. This approach has motivated the compilation of <b>structure maps</b>. An example of a structure map is an empirically compiled map that depicts the dependence of crystal structure on the electronegativity difference between the elements present and the average principal quantum number of the valence shells of the two atoms. As such, a structure map can be regarded as an extension of the ideas introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> in relation to the Ketelaar triangle. As we have seen, binary ionic salts are formed for large differences in electronegativity, &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i>, but as this difference is reduced, polarized ionic salts and more covalently bonded networks become preferred. Now we can focus on this region of the triangle and explore how small changes in electronegativity and polarizability affect the choice of ion arrangement in addition to ionic-radii considerations.</p>
<p class="indent">The ionic character of a bond increases with &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i>, so moving from left to right along the horizontal axis of a structure map correlates with an increase in ionic character in the bonding. The principal quantum number is an indication of the radius of an ion, so moving up the vertical axis corresponds to an increase in the average radius of the ions. Because atomic energy levels also become closer as the atom expands, the polarizability of the atom increases too (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>e). Consequently, the vertical axis of a structure map corresponds to increasing size and polarizability of the bonded atoms. <a href="#fig_3.47">Figure 3.47</a> is an example of a structure map for MX compounds. We see that the structures we have been discussing for MX compounds fall into distinct regions of the map. Elements with large &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i> have 6:6 coordination, such as is found in the rock-salt structure; elements with small &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i> (and hence where there is the expectation of covalence) have lower coordination numbers. In terms of a structure-map representation, GaN is in a more covalent region of <a href="#fig_3.47">Fig. 3.47</a> than ZnO because &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i> is appreciably smaller.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once the lattice enthalpy is known, it can be used to judge the character of the bonding in the solid. If the value calculated on the assumption that the lattice consists of ions interacting electrostatically is in good agreement with the measured value, then it may be appropriate to adopt a largely ionic model of the compound. A discrepancy indicates a degree of covalence. As mentioned earlier, it is important to remember that numerical coincidences can be misleading in this assessment.</p>

<p><a id="page_95" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 95, The structures of simple solids</a></p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, a large value of <i>d</i> results in a low lattice enthalpy, whereas high ionic charges result in a high lattice enthalpy. This dependence is seen in some of the values given in <a href="#tab3.7">Table 3.7</a>. For the alkali metal halides, the lattice enthalpies decrease from LiF to LiI and from LiF to CsF as the halide and alkali metal ion radii increase, respectively. We also note that the lattice enthalpy of MgO (|<i>z</i><sub>A</sub><i>z</i><sub>B</sub>|&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;4) is just over four times that of NaCl (|<i>z</i><sub>A</sub><i>z</i><sub>B</sub>|&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1), because of the increased charges on the ions for a similar value of <i>d</i>, noting that the Madelung constant is the same.</p>
<p class="indent">The Madelung constant typically increases with coordination number. For instance, <i>A</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1.748 for the 6:6-coordination rock-salt structure but 1.763 for the 8:8-coordination caesium-chloride structure and 1.638 for the 4:4-coordination sphalerite structure. This dependence reflects the fact that a large contribution comes from nearest neighbours, and such neighbours are more numerous when the coordination number is large. However, a high coordination number does not necessarily mean that the interactions are stronger in the caesium-chloride structure because the potential energy also depends on the scale of the lattice. Thus, <i>d</i> may be so large in lattices with ions big enough to adopt eight-fold coordination that the separation of the ions reverses the effect of the small increase in the Madelung constant and results in a smaller lattice enthalpy. One manifestation of the larger Madelung constant for higher coordination numbers is that such a high coordination number structure is often adopted when simple radius-ratio rules (<a href="#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>b) would predict the lower coordination number structure. Thus LiI, which has a radius ratio <i>&#x03B3;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0.34, predicting 4:4 coordination, is found from experiment to adopt the rock-salt structure with 6:6 coordination.</p>
<h4 class="h4">(b) Other contributions to lattice enthalpies</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> Nonelectrostatic contributions to the lattice enthalpy include van der Waals interactions, particularly the dispersion interaction.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Another contribution to the lattice enthalpy is the <b>van der Waals interaction</b> between the ions and molecules, the weak intermolecular interaction that is responsible for the formation of condensed phases of electrically neutral species. An important and sometimes dominant contribution of this kind is the <b>dispersion interaction</b> (the &#x2018;London interaction&#x2019;). The dispersion interaction arises from the transient fluctuations in electron density (and, consequently, instantaneous electric dipole moment) on one molecule driving a fluctuation in electron density (and dipole moment) on a neighbouring molecule, and the attractive interaction between these two instantaneous electric dipoles. The molar potential energy of this interaction, <i>V</i>, is expected to vary as</p>

<p class="indentt">The constant C depends on the substance. For ions of low polarizability, this contribution is only about one per cent of the electrostatic contribution and is ignored in elementary lattice enthalpy calculations of ionic solids. However, for highly polarizable ions such as Tl<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, such terms can make significant contributions of several per cent. Thus, the dispersion interaction for compounds such as LiF and CsBr is estimated to contribute 16&#x2009;kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 50&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively.</p>

The ionic model is reasonably valid if &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i> &#x003E; 2, but the bonding becomes increasingly covalent if &#x0394;<i>&#x03C7;</i> &#x003C; 2. However, it should be remembered that the electronegativity criterion ignores the role of polarizability of the <a id="page_96" class="page">Page 96, The structures of simple solids</a>ions. Thus, the alkali metal halides give fairly good agreement with the ionic model, the best with the least polarizable halide ions (F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) formed from the highly electronegative F atom, and the worst with the highly polarizable halide ions (I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) formed from the less electronegative I atom. This trend is also seen in the lattice enthalpy data for the silver halides in <a href="#tab3.9">Table 3.9</a>. The discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values is largest for the iodide, which indicates major deficiencies in the ionic model for this compound. Overall the agreement is much poorer with Ag than with Li, as the electronegativity of silver (<i>&#x03C7;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1.93) is much higher than that of lithium (<i>&#x03C7;</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0.98) and significant covalent character in the bonding would be expected.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not always clear whether it is the electronegativity of the atoms or the polarizability of the resultant ions that should be used as a criterion. The worst agreement with the ionic model is for polarizable-cation/polarizable-anion combinations that are substantially covalent. Here again, though, the difference between the electronegativities of the parent elements is small and it is not clear whether electronegativity or polarizability provides the better criterion.</p>

<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> The answer hinges on whether the enthalpy of formation of ArCl is significantly positive or negative: if it is significantly positive (endothermic), the compound is unlikely to be stable (there are, of course, exceptions). Consideration of a Born&#x2013;Haber cycle for the synthesis of ArCl would show two unknowns, the enthalpy of formation of ArCl and its lattice enthalpy. We can estimate the lattice enthalpy of a purely ionic ArCl by using the Born&#x2013;Mayer equation, assuming the radius of Ar<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to be midway between that of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. That is, the lattice enthalpy is somewhere between the values for NaCl and KCl at about 745&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. We need to produce 1 mol of Cl atoms so, taking half the enthalpy of dissociation of Cl<sub>2</sub>, 122&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the ionization enthalpy of Ar as 1524&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the electron affinity of Cl as 356&#x2009;kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> gives &#x0394;<sub>f</sub><i>H</i>(ArCl, s)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;1524 &#x2212; 745 &#x2212; 356 &#x002B; 122&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;&#x002B;545&#x2009;kJ&#x2009;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

<p class="noindentt">A.F. Kapustinskii observed that, if the Madelung constants for a number of structures are divided by the number of ions per formula unit, <i>N</i><sub>ion</sub>, then approximately the same value is obtained for them all. He also noted that the value so obtained increases with the coordination number. Therefore, because ionic radius also increases with coordination number, the variation in <i>A</i>/(<i>N</i><sub>ion</sub><i>d</i>) from one structure to another can be expected to be fairly small. This observation led Kapustinskii to propose that there exists a hypothetical rock-salt structure that is energetically equivalent to the true structure of any ionic solid and therefore that the lattice enthalpy can be calculated by using the rock-salt Madelung constant and the appropriate ionic radii for 6:6 coordination. The resulting expression is called the <b>Kapustinskii equation</b>:</p>

<p class="noindentt">Because &#x0394;<sub>decomp</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> is large and positive, the overall reaction enthalpy is positive (decomposition is endothermic), but it is less strongly positive if the lattice enthalpy of the oxide is markedly greater than that of the carbonate because then &#x0394;<sub>L</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> (MCO<sub>3</sub>, s) &#x2013; &#x0394;<sub>L</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup> (MO, s) is negative. It follows that the decomposition temperature will be low for oxides that have relatively high lattice enthalpies compared with their parent carbonates. The compounds for which this is true are composed of small, highly charged cations, such as Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Figure 3.50 illustrates why a small cation has a more significant influence on the change in the lattice enthalpy as the cation size is varied. The <i>change</i> in separation is relatively small when the parent compound has a large cation initially. As the illustration shows in an exaggerated way, when the cation is very big, the change in size of the anion barely affects the scale of the lattice. Therefore, with a given unstable polyatomic anion, the lattice enthalpy difference is more significant and favourable to decomposition when the cation is small than when it is large.</p>
<p class="indent">The difference in lattice enthalpy between MO<sub>n</sub> and M(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> is also magnified by a larger charge on the cation, as &#x0394;<sub>L</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x2296;</sup>&#x2009;&#x221D;&#x2009;|<i>z</i><sub>A</sub><i>z</i><sub>B</sub>|/<i>d</i>, so the thermal decomposition of a carbonate will occur at lower temperatures if it contains a higher-charged cation.

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The relative stabilities of different oxidation states in solids can often be predicted from consideration of lattice enthalpies.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A similar argument can be used to account for the general observation that high metal oxidation states are stabilized by small anions. In particular, F has a greater ability than the other halogens to stabilize the high oxidation states of metals. Thus, the only known halides of Ag(II), Co(III), and Mn(IV) are the fluorides. Another sign of the decrease in stability of the heavier halides of metals in high oxidation states is that the iodides of Cu(II) and Fe(III) decompose on standing at room temperature (to CuI and FeI<sub>2</sub>). Oxygen is also a very effective species for stabilizing the highest oxidation states of elements because of the high charge and small size of the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion.</p>
<p class="indent">To explain these observations consider the reaction</p>

<p class="noindent">where X is a halogen. The aim is to show why this reaction is most strongly spontaneous for X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;F. If we ignore entropy contributions, we must show that the reaction is most exothermic for fluorine. One contribution to the reaction enthalpy is the conversion of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mstyle scriptlevel='+1'><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> to X<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. Despite F having a lower electron affinity than Cl, this step is more exothermic for X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;F than for X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;Cl because the bond enthalpy of F<sub>2</sub> is lower than that of Cl<sub>2</sub>. The lattice enthalpies, however, play the major role. In the conversion of MX to MX<sub>2</sub>, the charge number of the cation increases from &#x002B;1 to &#x002B;2, so the lattice enthalpy increases. As the radius of the anion increases, however, this difference in the two lattice enthalpies diminishes, and the exothermic contribution to the overall reaction decreases too. Hence, both the lattice enthalpy and the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> formation enthalpy lead to a less exothermic reaction as the halogen changes from F to I. Provided entropy factors are similar, which is plausible, we expect an increase in thermodynamic stability of MX relative to MX<sub>2</sub> on going from X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;F to X&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;I down Group 17. Thus many iodides do not exist for metals in their higher oxidation states, and compounds such as Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>)<sub>2</sub>, Tl<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>)<sub>3</sub>, and VI<sub>5</sub> are unknown, whereas the corresponding fluorides CuF<sub>2</sub>, TlF<sub>3</sub>, and VF<sub>5</sub> are easily obtained. In effect, even if these iodides could be formed the thermodynamics shows that the high-oxidation-state metals would oxidize I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions to I<sub>2</sub>, leading to formation of a lower metal oxidation state, such as Cu(I), Tl(I), and V(III), in the iodides of these metals.</p>

<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The solubilities of salts in water can be rationalized by considering lattice and hydration enthalpies.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Lattice enthalpies play a role in solubilities, as the dissolution involves breaking up the lattice, but the trend is much more difficult to analyse than for decomposition reactions. One rule that is reasonably well obeyed is that <i>compounds that contain ions with widely different radii are soluble in water</i>. Conversely, the least water-soluble salts are those of ions with similar radii. That is, in general, <i>difference in size favours solubility in water</i>. It is found empirically that an ionic compound MX tends to be very soluble when the radius of M<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is smaller than that of X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> by about 80&#x2009;pm.</p>
<p class="indent">Two familiar series of compounds illustrate these trends. In gravimetric analysis, Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is used to precipitate <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>SO</mtext></mrow><mtext>4</mtext><mrow><mtext>2</mtext><mo>&#x2212;</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>, and the solubilities of the Group 2 sulfates decrease from MgSO<sub>4</sub> to BaSO<sub>4</sub>. In contrast, the solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides increases down the group: Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> is the sparingly soluble &#x2018;milk of magnesia&#x2019; but Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> can be used as a soluble hydroxide for preparation of solutions of OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The first case shows that a large anion requires a large cation for precipitation. The second case shows that a small anion requires a small cation for precipitation.</p>

<p class="noindentt">In this process, the interactions responsible for the lattice enthalpy of MX are replaced by hydration (and by solvation in general) of the ions. However, the exact balance of enthalpy and entropy effects is delicate and difficult to assess, particularly because the entropy change also depends on the degree of order of the solvent molecules that is brought about by the presence of the dissolved solute. The data in <a href="#fig_3.51">Fig. 3.51</a> suggest that enthalpy considerations are important in some cases at least, as the graph shows that there is a correlation between the enthalpy of solution of a salt and the difference in hydration enthalpies of the two ions. If the cation has a larger hydration enthalpy than its anion partner (reflecting the difference in their sizes) or vice versa, then the dissolution of the salt is exothermic (reflecting the favourable solubility equilibrium).</p>
<p class="indent">The variation in enthalpy can be explained using the ionic model. The lattice enthalpy is inversely proportional to the distance between the centres of the ions:</p>

<p class="noindentt">All solids contain <b>defects</b>, or imperfections of structure or composition. Defects are important because they influence properties such as mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and chemical reactivity. We need to consider both <b>intrinsic defects</b>, which are defects that occur in the pure substance, and <b>extrinsic defects</b>, which stem from the presence of impurities. It is also common to distinguish <b>point defects</b>, which occur at single sites, from <b>extended defects</b>, which are ordered in one, two, and three dimensions. Point defects are random errors in a periodic lattice, such as the absence of an atom at its usual site or the presence of an atom at a site that is not normally occupied. Extended defects involve various irregularities in the stacking of the planes of atoms.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.16">
<h3 class="h3">3.16 <b>The origins and types of defects</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Solids contain defects because they introduce disorder into an otherwise perfect structure and hence increase its entropy. The Gibbs energy, <i>G</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;<i>H</i>&#x2009;&#x2013;&#x2009;<i>TS</i>, of a solid with defects has contributions from the enthalpy and the entropy of the sample. The formation of defects is normally endothermic because the lattice is disrupted so the enthalpy of the solid increases. However, the term &#x2013;<i>TS</i> becomes more negative as defects are formed because they introduce disorder into the lattice and the entropy rises. Provided <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;0, therefore, the Gibbs energy will have a minimum at a nonzero concentration of defects and their formation will be spontaneous (<a href="#fig_3.52">Fig. 3.52</a>a). Moreover, as the temperature of the solid is raised, the minimum in <i>G</i> shifts to higher defect concentrations (<a href="#fig_3.52">Fig. 3.52</a>b), so solids have a greater number of defects as their melting points are approached.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindentt">The solid-state physicists W. Schottky and J. Frenkel identified two specific types of point defect. A <b>Schottky defect</b> (<a href="#fig_3.53">Fig. 3.53</a>) is a vacancy in an otherwise perfect arrangement of atoms or ions in a structure. That is, it is a point defect in which an atom or ion is missing from its normal site in the structure. The overall stoichiometry of a solid is not affected by the presence of Schottky defects because, to ensure charge balance, the defects occur in pairs in a compound of stoichiometry MX and there are equal numbers of vacancies at cation and anion sites. In solids of different composition, for example MX<sub>2</sub>, the defects must occur with balanced charges, so two anion vacancies must be created for each cation lost. Schottky defects occur at low concentrations in purely ionic solids, such as NaCl; they occur most commonly in structures with high coordination numbers, such as close-packed ions and metals, where the enthalpy penalty of reducing the average coordination number of the remaining atoms (from 12 to 11, for instance) is relatively low.</p>
<p class="indent">A <b>Frenkel defect</b> (<a href="#fig_3.54">Fig. 3.54</a>) is a point defect in which an atom or ion has been displaced onto an interstitial site. For example, in silver chloride, which has the rock-salt structure, a small number of Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions reside in tetrahedral sites (<b>1</b>), leaving vacancies elsewhere on octahedral sites normally occupied. The stoichiometry of the compound is unchanged when a Frenkel defect forms, and it is possible to have Frenkel defects involving either one (M or X displaced) or both (some M and some X interstitials) of the ion types in a binary compound, MX. Thus the Frenkel defects that occur in, for example, PbF<sub>2</sub> involve the <a id="page_103" class="page">Page 103, The structures of simple solids</a>displacement of a small number of F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions from their normal sites in the fluorite structure, on the tetrahedral holes in the close-packed Pb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion array, to sites that correspond to the octahedral holes. A useful generalization is that Frenkel defects are most often encountered in structures such as wurtzite and sphalerite in which coordination numbers are low (6 or less, 4:4 for these two structures) and the more open structure provides sites that can accommodate the interstitial atoms. This is not to say that Frenkel defects are exclusive to such structures; as we have seen, the 8:4-coordination fluorite structure can accommodate such interstitials although some local repositioning of adjacent anions is required to allow for the presence of the displaced anion.</p>

<p class="indent">The concentration of Schottky defects varies considerably from one type of compound to the next. The concentration of vacancies is very low in the alkali metal halides, being of the order of 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> at 130&#x00B0;C, corresponding to about one defect per 10<sup>14</sup> formula units. Conversely, some d<i>-</i>metal oxides, sulfides, and hydrides have very high concentrations of vacancies. An extreme example is the high-temperature form of TiO, which has vacancies on both the cation and anion sites at a concentration corresponding to about one defect per seven formula units.</p>
<p class="indent">Defects, when present in large numbers, may affect the density of a solid. Significant numbers of Schottky defects, as vacancies, will lead to a decrease in density. For example, TiO, with 14 per cent of both the anion and cation sites vacant, has a measured density of 4.96&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, much less than that expected for a perfect TiO structure, 5.81&#x2009;g&#x2009;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

<p class="noindentt"><b>Extrinsic defects</b>, those resulting from the presence of impurities, are inevitable because perfect purity is unattainable in practice in crystals of any significant size. Such behaviour is commonly seen in naturally occurring minerals. The incorporation of low levels of Cr into the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> structure produces the gemstone ruby, whereas replacement of some Al by Fe and Ti results in the blue gemstone sapphire (<a href="#box_3.6">Box 3.6</a>). The substituting species normally has a similar atomic or ionic radius to the species which it replaces; Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in ruby has a similar ionic radius to Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. Impurities can also be introduced intentionally by doping one material with another. A <b>dopant</b> is a small level, typically 0.1&#x2013;5 per cent, of an element that replaces another in a structure; an example is the introduction of As into Si to modify the latter&#x2019;s semiconducting properties. Synthetic equivalents of ruby and sapphire can also <a id="page_104" class="page">Page 104, The structures of simple solids</a>be synthesized easily in the laboratory by doping small levels of Cr, or Fe and Ti, into the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> structure, replacing aluminium.</p>

<p class="boxpara">Defects and dopant ions are responsible for the colours of many gemstones. Whereas aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>) in their pure forms are colourless, brightly coloured materials may be produced by substituting in small levels of dopant ions or producing vacant sites that trap electrons. The impurities and defects are often produced in naturally occurring minerals on account of the geological and environmental conditions under which they are formed. For example, d-metal ions were often present in the solutions from which the gemstones grew and the presence of ionizing radiation from radioactive species in the natural environment generates electrons that become trapped in their structure.</p>
<p class="boxparai">The most common origin of colour in a gemstone is a d-metal ion dopant (see <a href="#tabb3.1">Table B3.1</a>). Thus ruby is Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> containing around 0.2&#x2212;1 atom per cent Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions in place of the Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions, and its red colour results from the absorption of green light in the visible spectrum as a result of the excitation of Cr3d electrons (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.4">Section 20.4</a>). The same ion is responsible for the green of emeralds; the different colour reflects a different local coordination environment of the dopant. The host structure is beryl (beryllium aluminium silicate, Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>), and the Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is surrounded by six silicate ions, rather than the six O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions in ruby, producing absorption at a different energy. Other d-metal ions are responsible for the colours of other gemstones. Iron(II) produces the red of garnets and the yellow-green of peridots. Manganese(II) is responsible for the pink colour of some tourmalines.</p>
<p class="boxparai">In ruby and emerald the colour is caused by excitation of electrons on a single dopant d-metal ion, Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. When more than one dopant species, which may be of different type or oxidation state, is present it is possible to transfer an electron between them. One example of this behaviour is sapphire. Sapphire, like ruby, is alumina but in this gemstone some adjacent pairs of Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are replaced by Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> pairs. This material absorbs visible radiation of a wavelength corresponding to yellow light as an electron is transferred from Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>, so producing a brilliant blue colour (the complementary colour of yellow).</p>
<p class="boxparai">In other gemstones and minerals, colour is a result of doping a host structure with a species that has a different charge from the ion that it replaces or by the presence of a vacancy (Schottky-type defect). In both cases a colour-centre or F-centre (F from the German word <i>farbe</i> for colour) is formed. As the charge at an F-centre is different from that of a normally occupied site in the same structure, it can easily supply an electron to, or receive an electron from, another ion. This electron can then be excited by absorbing visible light, so producing colour. For instance, in purple fluorite, CaF<sub>2</sub>, an F-centre is formed from a vacancy on a normally occupied F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion site. This site then traps an electron, generated by exposure of the mineral to ionizing radiation in the natural environment. Excitation of the electron, which acts like a particle in a box, absorbs visible light in the wavelength range 530&#x2013;600&#x2009;nm, producing the violet/purple colours of this mineral.</p>
<p class="boxparai">In amethyst, the purple derivative of quartz, SiO<sub>2</sub>, some Si<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ions are substituted by Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions. This replacement leaves a hole (one missing electron) and excitation of this hole, by ionizing radiation for instance, traps it by forming Fe<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> or O<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in the quartz matrix. Further excitation of the electrons in this material now occurs by the absorption of visible light at 540&#x2009;nm, producing the observed purple colour. If an amethyst crystal is heated to 450&#x00B0;C the hole is freed from its trap. The colour of the crystal reverts to that typical of iron-doped silica and is a characteristic of the yellow semiprecious gemstone citrine. If citrine is irradiated the trapped-hole is regenerated and the original colour restored.</p>
<p class="boxparai">Colour centres can also be produced by nuclear transformations. An example of such a transformation is the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-decay of <sup>14</sup>C in diamond. This decay produces a <sup>14</sup>N atom, with an additional valence electron, embedded in the diamond structure. The electron energy levels associated with these N atoms allow absorption in the visible region of the spectrum and produce the colouration of blue and yellow diamonds.</p>

<p class="indent">When the dopant species is introduced into the host the latter&#x2019;s structure remains essentially unchanged. If attempts are made to introduce high levels of the dopant species, a new structure often forms or the dopant species is not incorporated. This behaviour usually limits the level of extrinsic point defects to low levels. The composition of ruby is typically (Al<sub>0.998</sub>Cr<sub>0.002</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with 0.2 per cent of metal sites as extrinsic Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> dopant ions. Some <a id="page_105" class="page">Page 105, The structures of simple solids</a>solids may tolerate much higher levels of defects (<a href="#sec_3.17">Section 3.17</a>a). Dopants often modify the electronic structure of the solid. Thus, when an As atom replaces an Si atom, the additional electron from each As atom can be thermally promoted into the conduction band, improving the overall conductivity of the semiconductor. In the more ionic substance ZrO<sub>2</sub>, the introduction of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> dopant ions in place of Zr<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ions is accompanied by the formation of an O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion vacancy to maintain charge neutrality (<a href="#fig_3.56">Fig. 3.56</a>). The induced vacancies allow oxide ions to migrate through the structure, increasing the ionic conductivity of the solid.</p>

<p class="indent">Another example of an extrinsic point defect is a <b>colour centre</b>, a generic term for defects responsible for modifications to the IR, visible, or UV absorption characteristics of solids that have been irradiated or exposed to chemical treatment. One type of colour centre is produced by heating an alkali metal halide crystal in the vapour of the alkali metal, and gives a material with a colour characteristic of the system: NaCl becomes orange, KCl violet, and KBr blue-green. The process results in the introduction of an alkali metal cation at a normal cation site and the associated electron from the metal atom occupies a halide ion vacancy. A colour centre consisting of an electron in a halide ion vacancy is called an <b>F-centre</b> (<a href="#fig_3.57">Fig. 3.57</a>). The colour results from the excitation of the electron in the localized environment of its surrounding ions. An alternative method of producing F-centres involves exposing a material to an X-ray beam that ionizes electrons into anion vacancies. F-centres and extrinsic defects are important in producing colour in gemstones (<a href="#box_3.6">Box 3.6</a>).</p>

<p class="noindentt">A <b>nonstoichiometric compound</b> is a substance that exhibits variable composition but retains the same structure type. For example, at 1000&#x00B0;C the composition of &#x2018;iron monoxide&#x2019;, which is sometimes referred to as w&#x00FC;stite, Fe<sub>1&#x2212;</sub><sub><i>x</i></sub>O, varies from Fe<sub>0.89</sub>O to Fe<sub>0.96</sub>O. Gradual changes in the size of the unit cell occur as the composition is varied, but all the features of the rock-salt structure are retained throughout this composition range. The fact that the lattice parameter of the compound varies smoothly with composition is a defining criterion of a nonstoichiometric compound because a discontinuity in the value of the lattice parameter indicates the formation of a new crystal phase. Moreover, the thermodynamic properties of nonstoichiometric compounds also vary continuously as the composition changes. For example, as the partial pressure of oxygen above a metal oxide is varied, both the lattice parameter and the equilibrium composition of the oxide change continuously (<a href="#fig_3.58">Figs 3.58</a> and <a href="#fig_3.59">3.59</a>). The gradual change in the lattice parameter of a solid as a function of its composition is known as <b>Vegard&#x2019;s rule</b>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#tab3.12">Table 3.12</a> lists some representative nonstoichiometric hydrides, oxides, and sulfides.

<h4 class="h4">(b) Solid solutions in compounds</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> A solid solution occurs where there is a continuous variation in compound stoichiometry without a change in structural type. This behaviour can occur in many ionic solids such as metal oxides.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">Because many substances adopt the same structural type, it is often energetically feasible to replace one type of atom or ion with another. Such behaviour is seen in many simple metal alloys such as those discussed in <a href="#sec_3.8">Section 3.8</a>. Thus zinc/copper brasses exist for the complete range of compositions Cu<sub>1&#x2212;</sub><sub><i>x</i></sub>Zn<sub><i>x</i></sub> with 0 &#x003C; <i>x</i> &#x003C; 0.38, where Cu atoms in the structure are gradually replaced by Zn atoms. This replacement occurs randomly throughout the solid, and individual unit cells contain an arbitrary number of Cu and Zn atoms (but such that the sum of their contents gives the overall brass stoichiometry).</p>
<p class="indent">Another good example is the perovskite structure adopted by many compounds of stoichiometry ABX<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>), composed of the ions A<sup>n&#x002B;</sup>, B<sup>m&#x002B;</sup>, and X<sup>x&#x2212;</sup>, in which the composition can be varied continuously by varying the ions that occupy some or all of the A, B, and X sites. For instance, both LaFe(III)O<sub>3</sub> and SrFe(IV)O<sub>3</sub> adopt the perovskite structure and we can consider a perovskite crystal that has, randomly distributed, half SrFeO<sub>3</sub> unit cells (with Sr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> on the A-type cation site) and half LaFeO<sub>3</sub> unit cells (with La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> on the A-site). The overall compound stoichiometry is LaFeO<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;SrFeO<sub>3</sub>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;LaSrFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which is better written (La<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>)FeO<sub>3</sub>, to reflect the normal ABO<sub>3</sub> perovskite stoichiometry. Other proportions of these unit cells are possible and the series of compounds La<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Sr<sub><i>x</i></sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> for 0 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 1 can be prepared. This system is called a <b>solid solution</b> because all the phases formed as <i>x</i> is varied have the same perovskite structure. In a solid solution all the sites in the structure remain fully occupied, the overall compound stoichiometry remains constant (albeit with different proportions of atom types on some sites), and there is a smooth variation in lattice parameter over its composition range.</p>
<p class="indent">Solid solutions occur most frequently for d-metal compounds because the change in one component might require a change in the oxidation state of another component to preserve the charge balance. Thus, as <i>x</i> increases in La<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Sr<sub><i>x</i></sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> and La(III) is replaced by Sr(II), the oxidation state of iron must change from Fe(III) to Fe(IV). This change can occur through a gradual replacement of one exact oxidation state, here Fe(III), by another, Fe(IV), on a proportion of the cation sites within the structure. Some other solid solutions include the high-temperature superconductors of composition La<sub>2&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Ba<sub><i>x</i></sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (0 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 0.4), which are superconducting for 0.12 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 0.25, and the spinels Mn<sub>1&#x2212;<i>x</i></sub>Fe<sub>2&#x002B;<i>x</i></sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0 &#x2264; <i>x</i> &#x2264; 1). <a id="page_107" class="page">Page 107, The structures of simple solids</a>It is also possible to combine solid-solution behaviour on a cation site with nonstoichiometry caused by defects on a different ion site.

<h3 class="h3a" style="margin-top:2em;"><b>The electronic structures of solids</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The previous sections have introduced concepts associated with the structures and energetics of ionic solids in which it was necessary to consider almost infinite arrays of ions and the interactions between them. Similarly, an understanding of the electronic structures of solids, and the derived properties such as electric conductivity, magnetism, and many optical effects, needs to consider the interactions of electrons with each other and extended arrays of atoms or ions. One simple approach is to regard a solid as a single huge molecule and to extend the ideas of molecular orbital theory introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> to very large numbers of orbitals. Similar concepts are used in later chapters to understand other key properties of large three-dimensional arrays of electronically interacting centres such as ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and the colours of solids.</p>

<h3 class="h3">3.18 <b>The conductivities of inorganic solids</b></h3>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key points:</span> A metallic conductor is a substance with an electric conductivity that decreases with increasing temperature; a semiconductor is a substance with an electric conductivity that increases with increasing temperature.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The molecular orbital theory of small molecules can be extended to account for the properties of solids, which are aggregations of an almost infinite number of atoms. This approach is strikingly successful for the description of metals; it can be used to explain their characteristic lustre, their good electrical and thermal conductivity, and their malleability. All these properties arise from the ability of the atoms to contribute electrons to a common &#x2018;sea&#x2019;. The lustre and electrical conductivity stem from the mobility of these electrons in response to either the oscillating electric field of an incident ray of light or to a potential difference. The high thermal conductivity is also a consequence of electron mobility because an electron can collide with a vibrating atom, pick up its energy, and transfer it to another atom elsewhere in the solid. The ease with which metals can be mechanically deformed is another aspect of electron mobility because the electron sea can quickly readjust to a deformation of the solid and continue to bind the atoms together.</p>
<p class="indent">Electronic conduction is also a characteristic of semiconductors. The criterion for distinguishing between a metallic conductor and a semiconductor is the temperature dependence of the electric conductivity (<a href="#fig_3.60">Fig. 3.60</a>):</p>

<p class="noindentt">It is also generally the case (but not the criterion for distinguishing them) that the conductivities of metals at room temperature are higher than those of semiconductors. Typical values are given in <a href="#fig_3.60">Fig. 3.60</a>. A solid <b>insulator</b> is a substance with a very low electrical conductivity. However, when that conductivity can be measured, it is found to increase with temperature, like that of a semiconductor. For some purposes, therefore, it is possible to disregard the classification &#x2018;insulator&#x2019; and to treat all solids as either metals or semiconductors. <b>Superconductors</b> are a special class of materials that have zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature.</p>

<h3 class="h3">3.19 <b>Bands formed from overlapping atomic orbitals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The central idea underlying the description of the electronic structure of solids is that the valence electrons supplied by the atoms spread through the entire structure. This concept is expressed more formally by making a simple extension of MO theory in which the solid <a id="page_108" class="page">Page 108, The structures of simple solids</a>is treated like an indefinitely large molecule. In solid-state physics, this approach is called the <b>tight-binding approximation</b>. The description in terms of delocalized electrons can also be used to describe nonmetallic solids. We therefore begin by showing how metals are described in terms of molecular orbitals. Then we go on to show that the same principles can be applied, but with a different outcome, to ionic and molecular solids.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:left;margin-left:0em;"><span class="red"><b>Figure 3.61</b></span> The electronic structure of a solid is characterized by a series of bands of orbitals separated by gaps at energies where orbitals do not occur.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<h4 class="h4">(a) Band formation by orbital overlap</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The overlap of atomic orbitals in solids gives rise to bands of energy levels separated by energy gaps.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The overlap of a large number of atomic orbitals in a solid leads to a large number of molecular orbitals that are closely spaced in energy and so form an almost continuous <b>band</b> of energy levels (<a href="#fig_3.61">Fig. 3.61</a>). Bands are separated by <b>band gaps</b>, which are values of the energy for which there is no molecular orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">The formation of bands can be understood by considering a line of atoms, and supposing that each atom has an s orbital that overlaps the s orbitals on its immediate neighbours (<a href="#fig_3.62">Fig. 3.62</a>). When the line consists of only two atoms, there is a bonding and an antibonding molecular orbital. When a third atom joins them, there are three molecular orbitals. The central orbital of the set is nonbonding and the outer two are at low energy and high energy, respectively. As more atoms are added, each one contributes an atomic orbital, and hence one more molecular orbital is formed. When there are <i>N</i> atoms in the line, there are <i>N</i> molecular orbitals. The orbital of lowest energy has no nodes between neighbouring atoms and the orbital of highest energy has a node between every pair of neighbours. The remaining orbitals have successively 1, 2, &#x2026; internuclear nodes and a corresponding range of energies between the two extremes.</p>
<p class="indent">The total width of the band, which remains finite even as <i>N</i> approaches infinity (as shown in <a href="#fig_3.63">Fig. 3.63</a>), depends on the strength of the interaction between neighbouring atoms. The greater the strength of interaction (in broad terms, the greater the degree of overlap between neighbours), the greater the energy separation of the non-node orbital and the all-node orbital. However, whatever the number of atomic orbitals used to form the molecular orbitals, there is only a finite spread of orbital energies (as depicted in <a href="#fig_3.63">Fig. 3.63</a>). It follows that the separation in energy between neighbouring orbitals must approach zero as <i>N</i> approaches infinity, otherwise the range of orbital energies could not be finite. That is, a band consists of a countable number but near-continuum of energy levels.</p>

If there are p orbitals available, a <b>p band</b> can be constructed from their overlap as shown in <a href="#fig_3.64">Fig. 3.64</a>. Because p orbitals lie higher in energy than s orbitals of the same valence shell, there is <a id="page_109" class="page">Page 109, The structures of simple solids</a>often an energy gap between the s band and the p band (<a href="#fig_3.65">Fig. 3.65</a>).

<p class="indent">The solid is in fact a <i>metallic</i> conductor. We have seen that the criterion for metallic conduction is the decrease of electrical conductivity with increasing temperature. This behaviour is the opposite of what we might expect if the conductivity were governed by thermal promotion of electrons above the Fermi level. The competing effect can be identified once we recognize that the ability of an electron to travel smoothly through the solid in a conduction band depends on the uniformity of the arrangement of the atoms. An atom vibrating vigorously at a site is equivalent to an impurity that disrupts the orderliness of the orbitals. This decrease in uniformity reduces the ability of the electron to travel from one edge of the solid to the other, so the conductivity of the solid is less than at <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0. If we think of the electron as moving through the solid, then we would say that it was &#x2018;scattered&#x2019; by the atomic vibration. This carrier scattering increases with increasing temperature as the lattice vibrations increase, and the increase accounts for the observed inverse temperature dependence of the conductivity of metals.</p>

<h4 class="h4">(c) Densities of states and width of bands</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> The density of states is not uniform across a band: in most cases, the states are densest close to the centre of the band.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">The number of energy levels in an energy range divided by the width of the range is called the <b>density of states</b>, <i>&#x03C1;</i> (<a href="#fig_3.68">Fig. 3.68</a>a). The density of states is not uniform across a band because the energy levels are packed together more closely at some energies than at others. In three dimensions, the variation of density of states is like that shown in <a href="#fig_3.69">Fig. 3.69</a>, with the greatest density of states near the centre of the band and the lowest density at the edges. The reason for this behaviour can be traced to the number of ways of producing a particular linear combination of atomic orbitals. There is only one way of forming a fully bonding molecular orbital (the lower edge of the band) and only one way of forming a fully antibonding orbital (the upper edge). However, there are many ways (in a three-dimensional array of atoms) of forming a molecular orbital with an energy corresponding to the interior of a band.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The number of orbitals contributing to a band determines the total number of states within it&#x2014;that is, the area enclosed by the density of states curve. Large numbers of contributing atomic orbitals which have strong overlap produce broad (in energy terms) bands with a high density of states. If only a relatively few atoms contribute to a band and these are well separated in the solid, as is the case for a dopant species, then the band associated with this dopant atom type is narrow and contains only a few states (Figure 3.68b).</p>
<p class="indent">The density of states is zero in the band gap itself&#x2014;there is no energy level in the gap. In certain special cases, however, a full band and an empty band might coincide in energy but with a zero density of states at their conjunction (<a href="#fig_3.70">Fig. 3.70</a>). Solids with this band structure are called <b>semimetals</b>. One important example is graphite, which is a semimetal in directions parallel to the sheets of carbon atoms.</p>
<div class="bggr2" style="width:67%;">
<p class="noindentf"><b><i>A note on good practice</i></b> This use of the term &#x2018;semimetal&#x2019; should be distinguished from its other use as a synonym for metalloid. In this text we avoid the latter usage.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4">(d) Insulators</h4>
<p class="noindente"><b><span class="red">Key point:</span> An insulator is a solid with a large band gap.</b></p>
<p class="noindentt">A solid is an insulator if enough electrons are present to fill a band completely and there is a considerable energy gap before an empty orbital and its associated band become available (<a href="#fig_3.71">Fig. 3.71</a>). In a sodium chloride crystal, for instance, the <i>N</i> Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions are nearly in contact and their 3s and three 3p valence orbitals overlap to form a narrow band consisting of 4<i>N</i> levels. The Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions are also nearly in contact and also form a band. The electronegativity of chlorine is so much greater than that of sodium that the chlorine band lies well below the sodium band, and the band gap is about 7&#x2009;eV. A total of 8<i>N</i> electrons are to be accommodated (seven from each Cl atom, one from each Na atom). These 8<i>N</i> electrons enter the lower chlorine band, fill it, and leave the sodium band empty. Because the energy of thermal motion available at room temperature is <i>kT</i>&#x2009;&#x2248;&#x2009;0.03&#x2009;eV (<i>k</i> is Boltzmann&#x2019;s constant), very few electrons have enough energy to occupy the orbitals of the sodium band.</p>

<p class="indent">In an insulator the band of highest energy that contains electrons (at <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0) is normally termed the <b>valence band.</b> The next-higher band (which is empty at <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0) is called the <b>conduction band</b>. In NaCl the band derived from the Cl orbitals is the valence band and the band derived from the Na orbitals is the conduction band.</p>
<p class="indent">We normally think of an ionic or molecular solid as consisting of discrete ions or molecules. According to the picture just described, however, they can be regarded as having a band structure. The two pictures can be reconciled because it is possible to show that a full band is equivalent to a sum of localized electron densities. In sodium chloride, for example, a full band built from Cl orbitals is equivalent to a collection of discrete Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions, and an empty band built from Na orbitals is equivalent to the array of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions.</p>

<p class="noindent">The characteristic physical property of a semiconductor is that its electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature. At room temperature, the conductivities of semiconductors are typically intermediate between those of metals and insulators. The dividing line between insulators and semiconductors is a matter of the size of the band gap (<a href="#tab3.13">Table 3.13</a>); the conductivity itself is an unreliable criterion because, as the temperature is increased, a given substance may have in succession a low, intermediate, and high conductivity.

<p class="indent">If arsenic atoms ([Ar]4s<sup>2</sup>4p<sup>3</sup>) are introduced into a silicon crystal ([Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup>), one additional electron will be available for each dopant atom that is substituted. Note that the doping is <i>substitutional</i> in the sense that the dopant atom takes the place of an Si atom in the silicon structure. If the donor atoms, the As atoms, are far apart from each other, their electrons will be localized and the donor band will be very narrow (<a href="#fig_3.73">Fig. 3.73</a>a). Moreover, the foreign atom levels will lie at higher energy than the valence electrons of the host structure and the filled dopant band is commonly near the empty conduction band. For <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003E;&#x2009;0, some of its electrons will be thermally promoted into the empty conduction band. In other words, thermal excitation will lead to the transfer of an electron from an As atom into the empty orbitals on a neighbouring Si atom. From there it will be able to migrate through the structure in the band formed by Si&#x2013;Si overlap. This process gives rise to <b>n-type semiconductivity</b>, the &#x2018;n&#x2019; indicating that the charge carriers are negatively charged (that is, electrons).</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An alternative substitutional procedure is to dope the silicon with atoms of an element with fewer valence electrons on each atom, such as gallium ([Ar]4s<sup>2</sup>4p<sup>1</sup>). A dopant atom of this kind effectively introduces holes into the solid. More formally, the dopant atoms form a very narrow, empty <b>acceptor band</b> that lies above the full Si band (<a href="#fig_3.73">Fig. 3.73</a>b). At <i>T</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0 the acceptor band is empty but at higher temperatures it can accept thermally excited electrons from the Si valence band. By doing so, it introduces holes into the latter and hence allows the remaining electrons in the band to be mobile. Because the charge carriers are now effectively positive holes in the lower band, this type of semiconductivity is called <b>p-type semiconductivity</b>. Semiconductor materials are essential components of all modern electronic circuits and some devices based on them are described in <a href="#box_3.7">Box 3.7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Several d-metal oxides, including ZnO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, are n-type semiconductors. In their case, the property is due to small variations in stoichiometry and a small deficit of O atoms. The electrons that should be in localized O atomic orbitals (giving a very narrow oxide band, essentially localized individual O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions) occupy a previously empty conduction band formed by the metal orbitals (<a href="#fig_3.74">Fig. 3.74</a>). The electrical conductivity decreases after the solids have been heated in oxygen and cooled slowly back to room temperature because the deficit of O atoms is partly replaced and, as the atoms are added, electrons are withdrawn from the conduction band to form oxide ions. However, when measured at high temperatures the conductivity of ZnO increases as further oxygen is lost from the structure, so increasing the number of electrons in the conduction band.</p>

<p class="indent">p-Type semiconduction is observed for some low oxidation number d-metal chalcogenides and halides, including Cu<sub>2</sub>O, FeO, FeS, and CuI. In these compounds, the loss of <a id="page_112" class="page">Page 112, The structures of simple solids</a>electrons can occur through a process equivalent to the oxidation of some of the metal atoms, with the result that holes appear in the predominantly metal band. The conductivity increases when these compounds are heated in oxygen (or sulfur and halogen sources for FeS and CuI, respectively) because more holes are formed in the metal band as oxidation progresses. n-Type semiconductivity, however, tends to occur for oxides of metals in higher oxidation states, as the metal can be reduced to a lower oxidation state by occupation of a conduction band formed from the metal orbitals. Thus typical n-type semiconductors include Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, and CuO.

</div>
<p class="boxpara">Semiconductors have many applications because their properties can be easily modified by the addition of impurities to produce, for example, n- and p-type semiconductors. Furthermore, their electrical conductivities can be controlled by application of an electric field, by exposure to light, by pressure, or by heat; as a result, they can be used in many sensor devices.</p>
<p class="boxpara1"><b>Diodes and photodiodes</b></p>
<p class="boxpara">When the junction of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor is under &#x2018;reverse bias&#x2019; (that is, with the p-side at a lower electric potential), the flow of current is very small, but it is high when the junction is under &#x2018;forward bias&#x2019; (with the p-side at a higher electric potential). The exposure of a semiconductor to light can generate electron&#x2013;hole pairs, which increases its conductivity through the increased number of free carriers (electrons or holes). Diodes that use this phenomenon are known as <b>photodiodes</b>. Compound semiconductor diodes can also be used to generate light, as in light-emitting diodes and laser diodes (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.28">Section 24.28</a>).</p>
<p class="boxpara1"><b>Transistors</b></p>
<p class="boxpara"><b>Bipolar junction transistors</b> (BJT) are formed from two p&#x2013;n junctions, in either an npn or a pnp configuration, with a narrow central region termed the <i>base</i>. The other regions, and their associated terminals, are known as the <i>emitter</i> and the <i>collector</i>. A small potential difference applied across the base and the emitter junction changes the properties of the base&#x2013;collector junction so that it can conduct current even though it is reverse-biased. Thus a transistor allows a current to be controlled by a small change in potential difference and is consequently used in amplifiers. Because the current flowing through a BJT is dependent on temperature, it can be used as a temperature sensor. Another type of transistor, the <b>field-effect transistor</b> (FET), operates on the principle that semiconductor conductivity can be increased or decreased by the presence of an electric field. The electric field increases the number of charge carriers, thereby changing its conductivity. These FETs are used in both digital and analogue circuits to amplify or switch electronic signals.</p>

</div>
<p class="boxpara">Which of the oxides WO<sub>3</sub>, MgO, and CdO are likely to show p- or n-type extrinsic semiconductivity?</p>
<p class="boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> The type of semiconductivity depends on the defect levels that are likely to be introduced, which is, in turn, determined by whether the metal present can easily be oxidized or reduced. If the metal can easily be oxidized (which may be the case if it has a low oxidation number), then p-type semiconductivity is expected. On the other hand, if the metal can easily be reduced (which may be the case if it has a high oxidation number), then n-type semiconductivity is expected. Thus, WO<sub>3</sub>, with tungsten present in the high oxidation state W(VI), is readily reduced and accepts electrons from the O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions, which escape as elemental oxygen. The excess electrons enter a band formed from the W d orbitals, resulting in n-type semiconductivity. Similarly, CdO, like ZnO, readily loses oxygen and is predicted to be an n-type semiconductor. In contrast, Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions are neither easily oxidized nor reduced, so MgO does not lose or gain even small quantities of oxygen and is an insulator.</p>

<p class="noindentex"><span class="blue"><b>3.1</b></span> The Kapustinskii equation shows that lattice enthalpies are inversely proportional to the interionic distances. Later work has shown that further simplification of the Kapustinskii equation allows lattice enthalpies to be estimated from the molecular (formula) unit volume (the unit cell volume divided by the number of formula units, <i>Z</i>, that it contains) or the mass density (see, for example, H.D.B. Jenkins and D. Tudela, <i>J. Chem. Educ</i>., 2003, <b>80,</b> 1482). How would you expect the lattice enthalpy to vary as a function of (a) the molecular unit volume and (b) the mass density?
