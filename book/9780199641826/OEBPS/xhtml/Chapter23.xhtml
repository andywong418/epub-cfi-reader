<p class="av-noindentd"><b>The f block is a fascinating area of the periodic table, comprising elements that collectively highlight many of the most important rules of atomic structure and bonding, yet individually demonstrate how these rules can be challenged and exploited. The characteristic uniformity of the 4f elements (the lanthanoids&#x2013;Ln) reflects the fact that the 4f orbitals that are being filled across the series are core-like and overlap little with orbitals on donor atoms. The lanthanoids are electropositive metals that behave in many respects like Group 2 elements, as ionization of the 6s<sup>2</sup> and 5d<sup>1</sup> electrons gives rise to a stable cation (Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) that interacts with other species in a predominantly ionic manner. Compounds of Ln(II) and Ln(IV) can be synthesized whenever the relatively favourable energy of a particular 4f<sup>n</sup>/5d<sup>1</sup> electron configuration presents an opportunity, and these atypical species are often highly reactive. The Ln(III) ions with partially filled f orbitals display electronic, optical, and magnetic properties that are widely exploited in technology. The 5f elements (the actinoids, An) are divided into two groups. The early elements (Th&#x2014;Am) are able to use both 6d and 5f orbitals for bonding and resemble many d metals in displaying a rich variety of redox and coordination chemistry The stable, colinear <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>AnO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> unit (<i>n</i> = 1,2) is an important feature in the chemistry of U, Np, Pu, and Am. The later actinoids more closely resemble the lanthanoids because the 5f orbitals have been drawn deeper into the core, but these elements have little nuclear stability and their chemistry is very difficult to study.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The two series of elements in the f block derive from the filling of the seven 4f and 5f orbitals, respectively. This occupation of f orbitals from f<sup>1</sup> to f<sup>14</sup> corresponds to the elements cerium (Ce) to lutetium (Lu) in Period 6 and thorium (Th) to lawrencium (Lr) in Period 7; however, given the similarity of their chemical properties, the elements lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac) are normally included in discussion of the f block, as they are here. The 4f elements are collectively called the lanthanoids (formerly and still commonly the &#x2018;lanthanides&#x2019;) and the 5f elements are called the actinoids (formerly the &#x2018;actinides&#x2019;). The lanthanoids are sometimes referred to as the &#x2018;rare earth elements&#x2019;; however, that name is inappropriate because they are not particularly rare, except for promethium, which has no stable isotope. A general lanthanoid is represented by the symbol Ln and an actinoid by An.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The chemical properties of the lanthanoids are quite different from those of the actinoids, and after some general introductions we discuss them separately. As we shall see, there is a striking uniformity in the properties of the lanthanoids, punctuated by interesting exceptions, whereas the actinoids display greater diversity, and many form compounds akin to those of the d block.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3a"><b>The elements</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">We begin our account of the f-block elements by considering their general properties and
methods for their extraction</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_23.1">
<h3 class="av-h3"><b>23.1 The valence orbitals</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> The 4f orbitals make very little contribution to bonding: their radial distribution functions lie within the 6s and 5d orbitals from which electrons are easily removed to form the 3&#x002B; ion. Lanthanoids thus display predominantly ionic bonding. The 5f orbitals are slightly more diffuse and the actinoids have a richer chemistry that includes covalent bonding and a variety of oxidation states for the earlier members of the series.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">To compare and contrast the properties of the lanthanoids and actinoids it is first necessary to consider how the 4f and 5f orbitals project out from the core and into their respective outer orbital regions that include s, p, and d orbitals. As we saw in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, the angular wavefunctions of f orbitals and hence the covalent bonds that result from their involvement should be highly directional. It is found, however, that, apart from the earlier actinoids (Th&#x0064;Pu), f orbitals make relatively little contribution to covalent bonding, and to understand this we need to consider their radial projections beyond the core. The f and d orbitals have been compared to flower petals, with the f orbital lobes likened to daisy petals while the d orbitals are like petals of the giant poppy! This analogy is explained in <a href="#fig_23.1">Fig. 23.1</a>, which shows the outer orbital radial distribution functions for a typical lanthanoid ion (Sm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) and its actinoid counterpart (Pu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>). In both cases the f orbitals are much more contracted than the d orbitals.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The 4f orbitals of the lanthanoids lack an inner maximum and are poorly shielded from the nuclear charge; they lie buried below the 5d and 6s orbitals and contract sharply and become core-like in response to even the smallest increase in nuclear charge. The 5f orbitals of the actinoid have an inner maximum so they are more penetrating and provide better shielding from the nuclear charge. The 5f orbitals are therefore more diffuse than the 4f orbitals and more likely to engage in effective overlap with ligand orbitals. The 6d orbitals extend further out than their 5d counterparts and, continuing the 3d&#x2013;5d trend we saw in <a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, we expect 6d orbitals to be even more effective in covalent bond formation. In fact we will see that the early actinoids resemble the d metals in exhibiting a rich variety of complexes and oxidation states. In contrast, the lanthanoids behave more like Group 2 metals and engage almost exclusively in nondirectional electrostatic bonding.</p>

</aside><p class="av-noindentt">Other than promethium (Pm), the lanthanoids are reasonably common in the Earth&#x2019;s crust; indeed, even the &#x2018;rarest&#x2019; lanthanoid, thulium, has a crustal abundance that is greater than that of silver (<a href="#tab23.1">Table 23.1</a>). The principal mineral source for the early lanthanoids is monazite, (Ln,Th)PO<sub>4</sub>, which contains mixtures of lanthanoids and thorium. Another phosphate mineral, xenotime (of similar composition, LnPO<sub>4</sub>), is the principal source of the heavier lanthanoids. Bastn&#x00E4;site, a carbonate fluoride mineral (LnCO<sub>3</sub>F), is another source of lighter lanthanoids, particularly Ce and La. <a href="#fig_23.2">Figure 23.2</a> shows simplified schemes for lanthanoid extraction. The dominance of the 3&#x002B; oxidation state for all the lanthanoids makes separation difficult, although cerium, which can be oxidized to Ce(IV), and europium, which can be reduced to Eu(II), are separable from the other lanthanoids by exploiting their redox chemistry. Isolation of the remaining lanthanoids, as their Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions, is accomplished on a large scale by multistep liquid&#x2013;liquid extraction in which the ions are distributed between an aqueous phase and an organic phase containing complexing agents. Ion-exchange chromatography is used to separate the individual lanthanoid ions when high purity is required. Pure and mixed lanthanoid metals are prepared by the electrolysis of molten lanthanoid halides.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Beyond lead (<i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;82) no element has a stable isotope, but two of the actinoids, thorium (Th, <i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;90) and uranium (U, <i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;92), have isotopes that are sufficiently long-lived that large quantities, comparable to those of Sn and I, have persisted from their formation in the supernova of the star that preceded the formation of the Sun (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#box1.1">Box 1.1</a>). The lighter transuranium elements are synthesized by neutron bombardment (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#box1.1">Box 1.1</a>), whereas tiny quantities of the heavier actinoids (often just a few atoms) are produced by light-atom (O,C) bombardment.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3"><b>23.3 Physical properties and applications</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>Lanthanoids are reactive metals that find small-scale uses in specialist applications; the primary uses of actinoids are restricted by their radioactivity.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The lanthanoids are soft, white metals having densities comparable to those of the 3d metals (6&#x2013;10 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>). For metals, they are relatively poor conductors of both heat and electricity, with thermal and electrical conductivities 25 and 50 times lower than that of copper, respectively. The metals react with steam and dilute acids but are somewhat passivated by an oxide coating. The majority of the metals adopt the hexagonal close-packed structure type, though cubic close-packed forms are also known for most of the elements, particularly under high pressure.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Mixtures of early lanthanoid metals, including cerium, are referred to commercially as <i>mischmetal</i> and used in steelmaking to remove impurities such as oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and arsenic, which reduce the mechanical strength and ductility of steel. The alloys SmCo<sub>5</sub> and Sm<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>17</sub> of samarium and cobalt have very high magnetic strengths, more than 10 times that of iron and some magnetic iron oxides (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). They also have excellent corrosion resistance and good stability at elevated temperatures. Neodymium iron boride, Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B, shows similar magnetic properties and is cheaper to produce, but because it is susceptible to corrosion the magnets are often coated with zinc or nickel or with epoxy resins. Applications of these high-strength magnetic materials include headphones, microphones, magnetic switches, components for the guidance of particle beams and devices providing energy conservation in electric cars (braking energy recuperation) and wind turbine dynamos.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Compounds of the lanthanoids find a wide range of applications, many of which depend on their magnetic and optical properties (<a href="#sec_23.5">Section 23.5</a>): europium oxide and <a id="page_628" class="page">page 628, The f-block elements</a>europium orthovanadate are used as red phosphors in displays and lighting, and neodymium (as Nd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>), samarium (as Sm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>), and holmium (as Ho<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) are used in solid-state lasers. Lanthanoid complexes with elaborate and often ingeniously designed organic ligands are being used in the medical sciences as tissue-selective magnetic resonance imaging agents or as luminescent reporters for bio&#x2013;analytical screening. Numerous exploitations of lanthanoid luminescence make use of the fact that emissive intensity is greatly increased and controlled if the ligand incorporates a functionality (an &#x2018;antenna&#x2019;) that is a strong absorber of light or can be excited electrochemically. Lanthanoid complexes are also finding important applications as catalysts for a range of organic reactions.</p>

Plutonium metal has at least six phases at atmospheric pressure, with density differences of more than 20 per cent. Many of the physical and chemical properties of the actinoids are unknown because only miniscule quantities have ever been isolated; in addition to being radioactive, many actinoids are known to be chemically toxic, and they are all treated as hazardous. Their primary peaceful use is in nuclear reactors, but trace amounts of actinoids have long been applied in various everyday technologies, examples being the use of uranium in certain glasses and americium in smoke alarms.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3a"><b>Lanthanoid chemistry</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindent">The lanthanoids are all electropositive metals with a remarkable uniformity of chemical properties. The significant difference between two lanthanoids is often only their size, and the ability to choose a lanthanoid of a particular size often allows the &#x2018;tuning&#x2019; of the properties of their compounds. For example, the magnetic and electronic properties of a material often depend on the exact separation of the atoms present and degree of overlap of various atomic orbitals. By choosing a lanthanoid of an appropriate size this separation can be controlled with consequences for its electrical conductivity or magnetic ordering temperature.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_23.4">
<h3 class="av-h3"><b>23.4 General trends</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>The lanthanoids are highly electropositive metals that most commonly occur in their compounds
as Ln(III); other oxidation states are stable only when an empty, half-fi lled, or full f subshell is
produced.</b></p>

<p class="av-noindentt"><a id="page_629" class="page">page 629, The f-block elements</a>Lanthanoids favour the oxidation state Ln(III) with a uniformity that is unprecedented in the periodic table, and in many other ways their chemistry resembles that of the Group II elements. All the metals evolve H<sub>2</sub> from dilute acid solutions. A Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is a hard Lewis acid, as indicated by its preference for F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or oxygen-containing ligands and its common occurrence with phosphate in minerals.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The prevalence of the 3&#x002B; oxidation state for lanthanoids regardless of atomic number can be traced to the core-like nature of the 4f orbitals, which are relatively deeply buried inside the atom and interact only weakly with the orbitals of neighbouring atoms. Upon crossing the row, increases in atomic number are largely just a matter of increasingly populating the 4f subshell, thus producing little change in chemical properties. Our starting point for understanding the chemistry of lanthanoids is a brief description of the free atom or ion, from which we will see that the subtle differences between each lanthanoid represent an interesting balance between the energies of ionization, atomization and bond formation, the latter being almost unaffected by ligand-field effects. We will now see how these properties arise.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(a) Electronic structures and ionization energies</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindent">Electron configurations of lanthanoid atoms and corresponding Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are given in <a href="#tab23.3">Table 23.3</a>. All Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions have the configuration [Xe]4f<sup><i>n</i></sup>6s<sup>2</sup> except Ce, Gd, and Lu, where a 5d orbital is singly occupied. As we saw in <a href="#fig_23.1">Fig. 23.1</a>, the 4f orbitals have no radial node, a consequence of which is that 4f electrons are poorly screened from the nuclear charge. Once the two valence 6s electrons and one further electron (from either the 4f or 5d orbital) have been removed, the remaining 4f electrons are held tightly by the nucleus and do not extend beyond the xenon-like core. <a href="#fig_23.3">Fig. 23.3</a> shows how ionization energies vary across the lanthanoids.</p>

<p class="av-indent">As a rough guide, <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> is approximately the same as the sum of the first three ionization energies (<i>I</i><sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>2</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>3</sub>), largely explaining the scarcity of compounds of Ln(IV). The increased nuclear attraction across the series leads to a gradual increase in ionization energies that is modulated by changes in electronic structure and total orbital angular momentum, <i>L</i> (we discuss ground-state terms later in this chapter). The trend in <i>I</i><sub>3</sub> is interrupted by three discontinuities, the largest of which occurs between Eu and Gd. Ionization of Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ([Xe]4f<sup>7</sup>) must overcome high levels of spin correlation energy (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.5">Section 1.5a</a>), whereas ionization of Gd<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ([Xe]4f<sup>7</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>) involves a less tightly bound d-electron. The two other discontinuities are less marked and occur between Pm and Nd (the quarter-shell effect) and between Ho and Er (the three-quarter-shell effect): these effects are due to changes (loss, no change, or <a id="page_630" class="page">page 630, The f-block elements</a>gain) in orbital angular momentum (<i>L</i>) which will be outlined later in <a href="#sec_23.5">Section 23.5</a>. The trend for <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> resembles <i>I</i><sub>3</sub> except for the shift to next atomic number.</p>

<p class="av-noindent">The variation of atomization enthalpies, &#x0394;<sub>a</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x02205;</sup>, across the lanthanoids is almost the mirror image of <i>I</i><sub>3</sub>. Metallic bonding barely involves the core-like 4f-electrons but varies with occupancy of the 5d orbitals that overlap to form a band containing delocalized (&#x2018;itinerant&#x2019;) electrons. When atoms condense to form the metallic state it is energetically favourable, in most cases, to promote a 4f-electron into the 5d orbital. Such promotion is not required for Gd ([Xe]4f<sup>7</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>) but incurs a greater energy cost for Eu ([Xe]4f<sup>7</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>)&#x2014;each atom containing a stable, half-filled 4f shell. As a consequence we see an increase in &#x0394;<sub>a</sub><i>H</i><sup>&#x02205;</sup> between Eu and Gd and similarly between Yb and Lu.</p>

</aside>
<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(c) Radii</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindent">The metallic radii (<a href="#fig_23.4">Fig. 23.4</a>) decrease smoothly from La to Lu apart from two exceptions, at Eu and Yb. These exceptions are due to those metals retaining their 4f<sup>7</sup> and 4f<sup>14</sup> electron configurations in preference to promoting an electron into the 5d orbital, which (as just mentioned) would achieve stronger metallic bonding and thus a smaller M&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;M distance. The metallic radii thus correspond to electron configurations [Xe]4f<sup>7</sup> and [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> (corresponding to Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>)<sub>2</sub>) for Eu and Yb, respectively, and [Xe]4f<sup><i>n</i></sup>5d<sup>1</sup> (Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>)<sub>3</sub>) for the other lanthanoids, where (e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> is the number of itinerant s and d electrons formally occupying the band.</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">All Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions have the electron configuration [Xe]4f<sup><i>n</i></sup>, and their radii (based on typical eight-fold coordination) contract steadily from 116 pm for La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> to 98 pm for Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. As mentioned earlier (<a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>), the lanthanoid contraction has important implications for the early 4d and 5d metals as it results in their radii and chemical being very similar despite an increase in principal quantum number; consequently, the pairs of elements Zr, Hf, and Nb, Ta, show almost identical properties. Such a smooth decrease in ionic radius is not observed elsewhere in the periodic table: it is attributed mainly to the increase in the effective atomic number, <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub>, as electrons are added to the poorly shielding 4f subshell (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>), although detailed calculations indicate that relativistic effects also make a substantial contractive contribution. Unlike the d-block elements, ligand-field effects have very little influence, as we discuss next.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(d) Ligand-field effects</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindent">A consequence of the f orbitals being buried is that a Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion has no frontier orbitals with directional preference; consequently, ligand-field effects are sufficiently small as to ensure thermal population of all states arising from the free-ion term (see <a href="#sec_23.5">Section 23.5</a>), and have little significant influence on the chemistry. <a href="#fig_23.5">Fig. 23.5</a> shows that the enthalpies <a id="page_631" class="page">page 631, The f-block elements</a>of hydration for Ln3&#x002B; ions increase gradually with some fluctuations, without the clearer &#x2018;double-hump&#x2019; plot displayed by the 3d M2&#x002B; ions (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.1">Section 20.1</a>). Size alone controls the coordination numbers for [Ln(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in aqueous solution: these start at 9 for the early lanthanoids, which adopt a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry (<b>1</b>), and decrease to 7&#x2013;8 for the later, smaller members of the series by successive loss of capping H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>2, 3</b>) or reorganization into a square antiprism (<b>4</b>). The aqua ions are highly labile (<a href="Chapter21.xhtml#fig_21.5">Fig. 21.5</a>), as expected for large cations lacking much ligand-field stabilization, and weakly acidic, with p<i>K</i> values ranging from 8.5 for La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq) to 7.6 for Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq).</p>

<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(e) Standard potentials and redox chemistry</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindent">The oxidation state Ln(III) prevails through the 4f row, a result that is mainly due to the comparative ease with which the cumulative ionization energies (<i>I</i><sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>2</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>3</sub>) to form Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<a href="#fig_23.3">Fig. 23.3</a>) are compensated by strong hydration or lattice energies. Consequently, Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is favoured over Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, whereas <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> usually presents an uncompensatable cost for forming Ln<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>. The 18 per cent decrease in ionic radius from La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> to Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> leads to an increase in the hydration enthalpy across the series, which counterbalances the increase in (<i>I</i><sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>2</sub>&#x2009;&#x002B;&#x2009;<i>I</i><sub>3</sub>) and mirrored trend in atomization energy. As a result, the standard potentials of the lanthanoids are all very similar and close to that of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/Mg (<a href="#tab23.4">Table 23.4</a>), with <i>E</i><sup>&#x02205;</sup>(La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>/La)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;&#x002B;2.38 V being almost identical to <i>E</i><sup>&#x02205;</sup>(Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>/Lu)&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;&#x002B;2.30 V at the other end of the series.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Oxidation states apart from Ln(III) pose important and interesting challenges in lanthanoid chemistry. These atypical oxidation states, IV and II, are most prevalent when the ion can attain the relatively more stable empty (f<sup>0</sup>) subshell or the half-filled (f<sup>7</sup>) and filled (f<sup>14</sup>) subshells that optimize spin correlation energy (<a href="#tab23.3">Table 23.3</a>). In terms of their aqueous chemistry the elements Ce and Eu exhibit by far the most important and useful redox properties. Thus, Ce<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (f<sup>1</sup>) can be oxidized to Ce<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> (f<sup>0</sup>), which is a strong and useful oxidizing agent, and aqueous solutions of the Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion are sufficiently stable that it is a convenient one-electron reducing agent. Metallic Eu and Yb react with liquid NH<sub>3</sub> to give blue solutions containing the solvated electron along with Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Yb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, analogous to the chemistry of Group II elements. The aqueous ions Sm<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Yb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> rapidly reduce water to hydrogen.</p>

Under very strongly oxidizing conditions Dy(IV) and Nd(IV) can also be obtained. The ease of forming Ln(IV) compounds is related to <i>I</i><sub>4</sub>. Many Ln(II) binary compounds, including the sulfides, are electronic conductors because a 5d electron is released into the conduction band.</p>

The spectra of their complexes generally show much narrower and more distinct absorption bands than those of d&#x2013;metal complexes. Both the narrowness of the spectral features and their insensitivity to the nature of coordinated ligands are a consequence of the 4f orbitals having a smaller radial extension than the filled 5s and 5p orbitals. In contrast to the pale colours of Ln(III) complexes, many complexes of Ln(II) and Ln(IV) are intensely coloured, the result of charge-transfer transitions in the visible region of the spectrum.</p>

<p class="av-boxtitle" id="ex23.1"><b><span class="av-ve">EXAMPLE 23.1</span> Deriving the ground-state term symbol of a lanthanoid ion</b></p>
</div>
<p class="av-boxpara">What is the ground-state term symbol of Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (f<sup>2</sup>)?</p>
<p class="av-boxpara"><b><i>Answer</i></b> The procedure for deriving the ground-state term symbols, which have the general form <sup>2<i>s</i>&#x002B;1</sup>&#x007B;<i>L</i>&#x007D;<sub>j</sub>, for d&#x2013;block elements was summarized in <a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.3">Section 20.3</a>, and we can proceed in a similar way. According to Hund<i>&#x0027;</i>s rules, the ground state will have the two electrons in different f orbitals, each with <i>l</i>&#x003D;3, so the maximum value of <i>M<sub>L</sub></i>&#x003D;<i>m</i><sub><i>l</i>1</sub>&#x002B;<i>m</i><sub><i>l</i>2</sub> will be <i>M<sub>L</sub></i>&#x003D;(&#x002B;3) &#x002B;(&#x002B;2)&#x003D; &#x002B;5, which must stem from a state with <i>L</i>&#x003D;5, an H term. The lower-spin arrangement of two electrons in different orbitals is a triplet with <i>S</i>&#x003D;1, so the term will be <sup>3</sup>H. According to the Clebsch&#x2013;Gordan series (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.3">Section 20.3</a>), the total angular momentum of a term with <i>L</i>&#x003D;5 and <i>S</i>&#x003D;1 will be <i>J</i>&#x003D; 6, 5, or 4. According to Hund<i>&#x0027;</i>s rules, for a less than half-full shell the level with the lowest value of <i>J</i> lies lowest (in this case, <i>J</i>&#x003D;4), so we expect its term symbol to be <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="av-boxpara"><b><i>Self&#x2013;test23.1 </i></b>Derive the ground state ofthe Tm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion.</p>
</div>
<p class="av-indentt">The large number of microstates for each electronic configuration means a correspondingly large number of terms and hence of possible transitions between them. As the terms are derived almost purely from f orbitals, and there is little d&#x2013;f orbital mixing or mixing with ligand orbitals, the transitions are Laporte forbidden (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.6">Section 20.6</a>). In addition, electrons in 4f orbitals interact only weakly with the ligands so there is little coupling of the electronic transitions with molecular vibrations, with the consequence that the bands are narrow and gain little intensity from vibronic coupling. Hence, in contrast to the d metals which normally show one or two broad bands of moderate intensity, the visible spectra of lanthanoids usually consist of a large number of sharp, low-intensity peaks that are barely affected by changing the coordination environment of the lanthanoid. Molar absorption coefficients (<i>&#x03B5;</i>) are typically 1&#x2013;10 dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> compared with octahedral d&#x2013;metal complexes that are enhanced by vibronic coupling (close to 100 dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p>
<p class="av-indent">Ground-state terms for all the Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are given in <a href="#tab23.5">Table 23.5</a>, and <a href="#fig_23.6">Fig. 23.6</a> shows a simplified diagram of the energy levels of excited states. Absorption bands arise as a result of excitation from the ground state into excited states, and <a href="#fig_23.7">Fig. 23.7</a> shows the experimental absorption spectrum of Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq) from the near infrared to the ultraviolet region. The absorptions (upward arrows in <a href="#fig_23.6">Fig. 23.6</a>) occur mainly between 450 and 500 nm (blue) and at 580 nm (yellow) so the residual light that reaches the eye after reflection from a Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> compound is mainly green and red, giving this ion its characteristic green colour. The ion Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is colourless, as expected from the large energy gap. The Nd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion has a sharp absorption at 580 nm due to the transition <sup>4</sup>I<sub>9/2</sub>&#x2009;&#x2190;&#x2009;<sup>4</sup>F<sub>3/2</sub>. This wavelength corresponds almost exactly to the main yellow emission from excited sodium atoms (<a href="Chapter11.xhtml#sec_11.1">Section 11.1</a>). As a result, neodymium is incorporated into goggles used by glassblowers, where it reduces the glare produced by hot sodium silicate glasses. In some cases transitions between 4f and 5d orbitals can occur, but they are generally in the higher-energy UV region of the spectrum; for example, in Er<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> the transition 4f<sup>10</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>&#x2009;&#x2190;&#x2009;4f<sup>11</sup> occurs at about 150 nm.</p>
<h4 class="av-h4"><b>(b) Luminescence</b></h4>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Lanthanoid ions show useful emission spectra with applications in phosphors, lasers, and imaging.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Some of the most important applications of the lanthanoids derive from their emission spectra produced after excitation (using energetic photons or electron beams) of the f electrons. The term &#x2018;luminescence&#x2019; is commonly used to describe two types of emission: <i>fluorescence</i> refers to a transition from a high-energy state to one of lower energy having the same multiplicity (&#x0394;S&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;0) whereas <i>phosphorescence</i> is a longer-lived transition from a high-energy state to one of lower energy having a different multiplicity (&#x0394;S&#x2009;&#x2260;&#x2009;0). Emission spectra show many features of the absorption spectra in that they consist of sharply defined frequencies characteristic of the lanthanoid cation and mainly independent of the ligand.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Natural emission is limited by the low probability of absorption, which means that excited states are not easily populated. Even so, all the lanthanoid ions except La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (f<sup>0</sup>) and Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> <a id="page_634" class="page">page 634, The f&#x2013;block elements</a>(f<sup>14</sup>) show inherent luminescence, and the strongest and most useful emissions are associated with Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<sup>7</sup>F<sub>0&#x2212;6</sub>&#x2009;&#x2190;&#x2009;<sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub>, giving red) and Tb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<sup>7</sup>F<sub>6&#x2212;0</sub>&#x2009;&#x2190;&#x2009;<sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub>, giving green) as indicated by the downward arrows in <a href="#fig_23.6">Fig. 23.6</a>. In part, the relatively strong luminescence of Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Tb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is due to the large number of excited states that exist, which increases the probability of intersystem crossing into excited states of different spin multiplicity from the ground state, thus giving rise to phosphorescence. More generally, the strength of the emission also stems from the excited electron interacting only weakly with its environment (because of the contracted nature of f orbitals) and thus having a long nonradiative lifetime (milliseconds to nanoseconds). Whereas natural emission is limited by the fact that the excitation by absorption is only weakly allowed, luminescence can be greatly enhanced by placing a light-absorbing group (an &#x2018;antenna&#x2019;) on the ligand in a complex or nearby in a solid material. The antenna is excited by allowed transitions and the energy is transferred either directly or indirectly (via intersystem crossing) into excited states of the lanthanoid. The processes are usually represented by a Jablonski diagram (<a href="#fig_23.8">Fig. 23.8</a>). In <i>electroluminescence, </i>lanthanoid compounds are excited electrochemically, using electrodes to inject electrons into the higher orbitals of suitable organic groups on the ligand and remove electrons from the occupied orbitals. Electroluminescence forms the basis for light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>

<p class="av-boxpara">Phosphors are fluorescent materials that normally convert high-energy photons, typically in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum, into lower-energy visible wavelengths. Whereas a number of fluorescent materials are based on d&#x2013;metal systems (for example Cu and Mn doped into zinc sulfide), for some emitted energies lanthanoid-containing materials offer the best performance. This is particularly so of the red phosphors needed in displays, such as plasma screens, and fluorescent lighting where the emission spectrum of Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> occurs in a series of lines between 580 nm (orange) and 700 nm (red). Terbium, as Tb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, is also widely used in similar phosphors, producing emissions between 480 and 580 nm (green). The phosphor compounds, such as Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> doped into YVO<sub>4</sub>, are coated on the interiors of fluorescent light tubes and convert the UV radiation generated from the mercury discharge into visible light. By using a combination of phosphors fluorescing in different regions of the visible spectrum, white light is emitted by the tube (<a href="#fig_b23-1">Fig. B23.1</a>).</p>

<p class="av-boxparai">Neodymium can be doped into the garnet structure of yttrium aluminium oxide, Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, at levels of 1 per cent Nd for Y, to produce the material that is used in Nd:YAG lasers. The Nd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are strongly absorbing at wavelengths between 730 and 760 nm and between 790 and 820 nm, such as the high-intensity light produced by krypton-containing flashlamps. The ions are excited from their ground <sup>4</sup>I<sub>9/2</sub> state to a number of excited states which then transfer into a relatively long-lived excited <sup>4</sup>F<sub>3/2</sub> state. Radiative decay of this state to <sup>4</sup>I<sub>11/2</sub> (which lies just above the ground state, <sup>4</sup>I<sub>9/2</sub>) is stimulated by a photon of the same frequency and results in laser radiation. Thus once a large number of ions exist in an excited state, they can all be stimulated to emit light simultaneously, so producing very intense radiation.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">A Nd:YAG laser typically emits at 1.064 &#x03BC;m, in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum in pulsed and continuous modes. There are weaker transitions near 0.940, 1.120, 1.320, and 1.440 &#x03BC;m. The high-intensity pulses may be frequency-doubled to generate laser light at 532 nm (in the visible region) or even higher harmonics at 355 and 266 nm. Applications of Nd:YAG lasers include removal of cataracts and unwanted hair, in rangefinders, and for marking plastics and glass. In the latter application, a white pigment that absorbs strongly in the infrared region, near the main Nd:YAG emission line of 1.064 &#x03BC;m, is added to a transparent plastic. When the laser is shone on the plastic the pigment absorbs the energy and heats up sufficiently to burn the plastic at the point exposed to the laser, which becomes indelibly marked.</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">There are several YAG gain media with other lanthanoid dopants; for example, Yb:YAG emits at either 1.030 &#x03BC;m (strongest line) or 1.050 &#x03BC;m and is often used where a thin disk of lasing material is needed; Er:YAG lasers emit at 2.94 &#x03BC;m and are used in dentistry and for skin resurfacing.</p>

<p class="av-indentt">The analysis in the <i>Brief illustration </i>assumes that only one <sup>2S&#x002B;1</sup>&#x007B;L&#x007D;<sub>J</sub> level is occupied at the temperature of the experiment, and this is a good assumption for most lanthanoid ions. For <a id="page_636" class="page">page 636, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>example, the first excited state of Ce<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<sup>2</sup>F<sub>7/2</sub>) is 1000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> above the ground state (<sup>2</sup>F<sub>5/2</sub>) and nearly unpopulated at room temperature when <i>kT </i>&#x02243; 200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Small contributions from the higher-energy terms result in minor deviations of observed values from those based on the population of a single term. For Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and to a lesser extent Sm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> the first excited state lies close to the ground state (for Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, <sup>7</sup>F<sub>1</sub> lies only 300 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> above the <sup>7</sup>F<sub>0</sub> ground state) and is partly populated even at room temperature. Although the value of <i>j </i>based on occupation of only the ground state is zero (because <i>J </i>&#x003D; 0), the experimentally observed value is nonzero and varies with temperature according to the Boltzmann population of the upper state.</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Long-range magnetic ordering effects, ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetism (<a href="Chapter20.xhtml#sec_20.8">Section 20.8</a>) are observed in many lanthanoid compounds, though in general the coupling between metal atoms is much weaker than in the d&#x2013;block compounds because of the contracted nature of the 4f orbitals that house the electrons. As a result of this weaker coupling the magnetic ordering temperatures for lanthanoid compounds are much lower. In BaTbO<sub>3</sub> the magnetic moments of the Tb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion become antiferromagnetically ordered below 36 K. Lanthanoid complexes lie at the centre of research into single-molecule magnets that offer important new possibilities for storing information at the molecular level, one particularly special example being the triangular Dy(III) complex mentioned in the Tutorial problem <a href="#t23.5">23.5</a> at the end of this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3"><b>23.6 Binary ionic compounds</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> The structuresofionic lanthanoid compoundsare determined bythe size ofthe lanthanoid ion; binary oxides, halides, hydrides, and nitrides are all known.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Lanthanoid(III) ions have radii that vary between 116 and 98 pm; by comparison, high-spin six-coordinate Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> has an ionic radius of 65 pm. Thus the volume occupied by a Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is typically four to five times that occupied by a typical 3d-metal ion. Unlike the 3d metals, which rarely exceed a coordination number of 6 (with 4 being common too), compounds of lanthanoids often have high coordination numbers, typically between 6 and 12, and a wide variety of coordination environments.</p>
<p class="av-noindente">All the lanthanoids react with O<sub>2</sub> at high temperatures to give oxides: in most cases these are the <i>sesquioxides, </i>Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but lanthanoids having reasonably low values of <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> form higher oxides, specifically the dioxide CeO<sub>2</sub> and nonstoichiometric oxides Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub> and Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. The latter react further with O<sub>2</sub> at high pressure to give PrO<sub>2</sub> and TbO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<p class="av-indentt">2Ln(s) &#x002B; 3 O<sub>2</sub>(g) &#x2192; Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s)</p>
<p class="av-indent">Ce(s) &#x002B; O<sub>2</sub>(g) &#x2192; CeO<sub>2</sub>(s)</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Cerium dioxide is widely used in industry as a catalyst and catalyst support: it also has promising applications in solar hydrogen production since it loses O<sub>2</sub> at very high temperature (as generated in a solar furnace) and reacts with water upon cooling, whereupon H<sub>2</sub> is produced and CeO<sub>2</sub> is regenerated (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#box_10.3">Box 10.3</a>). All the dioxides adopt the fluorite structure as expected from radius-ratio rules (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.10">Section 3.10</a>), whereas the sesquioxides have more complex structures in which the average coordination number of the Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions is typically 7. Three main structure types, termed A-, B-, C-Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, are known and many of the oxides are polymorphic, with transitions between the structures occurring as the temperature is changed. The coordination geometries are determined by the radius of the lanthanoid ion, with the average cation coordination number in the structures decreasing with decreasing ionic radius: for example, the La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion in Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has coordination number 7, whereas the Lu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion in Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has coordination number 6. Monoxides LnO having the rock-salt structure are formed for Nd, Sm, Eu, and Yb by reacting the respective Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> compound with the element; for example,</p>
<p class="av-indentt">Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s) &#x002B; Eu(s) &#x2192; 3 EuO(s)</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">Both NdO and SmO are electronic conductors because they can readily form a conduction band that is occupied by an itinerant 5d electron&#x2014;they are formulated as Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(O<sub>2&#x2013;</sub>)(e<sub>&#x2013;</sub>), whereas EuO and YbO are white, insulating solids.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Sulfides of stoichiometry LnS having the rock-salt structure may be obtained by direct reaction of the elements at 1000&#x00B0;C. Except for SmS, EuS, and TmS, the sulfides are <a id="page_637" class="page">page 637, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>electronically conducting and formulated as Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(S<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>)(e<sup>&#x2013;</sup>): similar compounds are formed with selenium and tellurium. Phases of composition Ln<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> can also be obtained by reaction of the lanthanoid trichloride with H<sub>2</sub>S; they have been studied as pigments to replace the toxic CdS and CdSe because of their intense red/orange/yellow colours. The lanthanoids generally react directly with halogens to form trihalides, LnX<sub>3</sub>, which have complex structural characteristics as a result of the high coordination numbers for these large ions. For example, in LaF<sub>3</sub> the La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is in an irregular 11-coordinate environment and in LaCl<sub>3</sub> it is in a 9-coordinate tricapped trigonal-prismatic environment (<a href="#fig_23.9">Fig. 23.9</a>). The trihalides of the smaller lanthanoids at the end of the series have different structure types, with distorted tricapped trigonal prisms for LnF<sub>3</sub> (5) and layer structures based on six-coordinate cubic close packing for LnCl<sub>3</sub>. Apart from oxygen, fluoride is the only element able to stabilize Ln(IV) compounds. Cerium reacts with F<sub>2</sub> at room temperature to give CeF<sub>4</sub>, which crystallizes with a structure formed from vertex-sharing CeF<sub>8</sub> polyhedra (<a href="#fig_23.10">Fig. 23.10</a>). In contrast, PrF<sub>4</sub> and TbF<sub>4</sub> are highly reactive and synthesized only under extreme conditions, by reacting Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub> or Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> with F<sub>2</sub> under UV irradiation in liquid HF for several days. The diiodides, LnI<sub>2</sub>, are useful starting materials for Ln(II) complexes, particularly SmI<sub>2</sub>, which is used as a reagent in organic synthesis (see later): they are generally formed by comproportionation of LnI<sub>3</sub> and Ln powder at high temperatures (600&#x00B0;C) under an inert atmosphere:</p>

<p class="av-noindentt">All the lanthanoid metals react with H<sub>2</sub> to give binary hydrides that vary in stoichiometry between LnH<sub>2</sub> and LnH<sup>3</sup>.

<h3 class="av-h3"><b>23.7 Ternary and complex oxides</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span> Lanthanoid ions are often found in perovskites and garnets, where the ability to change the size of the ion allows the properties of the materials to be modified.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The lanthanoids are a good source of large, stable tripositive cations having a reasonable range of ionic radii without demanding ligand-field preferences. As a result, they can occupy one or more of the cation positions in ternary and more complex oxides. For instance, perovskites of the type ABO<sub>3</sub> can readily be prepared with La on the A cation site; an example is LaFeO<sub>3</sub>. Indeed, some distorted structure types are named after lan-thanoids; an example is the structural type GdFeO<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig_23.11">Fig. 23.11</a>), which has vertex-linked FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra around the Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion (as in the parent perovskite structure, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.42">Fig. 3.42</a>) but with the octahedra tilted relative to each other. This tilting allows better coordination to the central Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion. The ability to change the size of the B<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion in a series of compounds LnBO<sub>3</sub> allows the physical properties of the complex oxide to be modified in a controlled manner. For example, in the series of compounds LnNiO<sub>3</sub> for Ln &#x003D; Pr to Eu, the insulating-metallic transition temperature, <i>TIM, </i>increases with decreasing lanthanoid ionic radius (<a href="#tab23.6">Table 23.6</a>).</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The perovskite unit cell is a structural building block often found in more complex oxide structures, and lanthanoids are frequently used in such materials. Well-known examples are the original high-temperature superconducting cuprate, La<sub>1.8</sub>Ba<sub>0.2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, and the family of <i>&#x0027;</i>123<i>&#x0027;</i> complex oxides, LnBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which become superconducting below 93 K. The best known of these high-temperature superconductors is the d&#x2013;block (yttrium) compound YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, but they are also found for all the lanthanoids (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.6">Section 24.6</a>). Other materials where the choice of lanthanoid is crucial in obtaining the required property include the complex manganites Ln<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Sr<sub><i>x</i></sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that exhibit resistance effects strongly dependent on the applied magnetic field and temperature; the optimized properties are found when Ln &#x003D; Pr.</p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The spinel structure (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.44">Fig. 3.44</a>) has only small tetrahedral and octahedral holes in the close-packed O<sub>2&#x2013;</sub> ion array and thus cannot accommodate bulky lanthanoid ions. However, the garnet structure adopted by materials of stoichiometry M<sub>3</sub>M<i>&#x0027;</i><sub>2</sub>(XO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where M and M<i>&#x0027;</i> are normally di- and tripositive cations and X includes Si, Al, Ga, and Ge, has eight-coordinate sites that can be occupied by lanthanoid ions. Aside from yttrium aluminium garnet, which is the host material for neodymium ions in the laser material Nd:YAG, the material known as yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is an important ferrimagnet used in microwave and optical communication devices (<a href="#fig_23.12">Fig. 23.12</a>).</p>

<h4 class="av-h4">(a) Complexes of Ln(III)</h4>
<p class="av-noindentt">Without the means for strong overlap of orbitals, the bonds formed between Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions and ligands are electrostatic, and stable complexes are only achieved with polydentate chelating ligands. The spatially buried f electrons have no significant stereochemical influence, and ligands therefore adopt positions that minimize interligand repulsions. Polydentate ligands must satisfy their own stereochemical constraints, much as for the s-block ions and Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> complexes. As with the aquo ions [Ln(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (1 &#x2013; 4) the coordination numbers and structures of complexes vary across the series. For example, the small ytterbium cation, Yb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, forms the seven-coordinate complex [Yb(acac)<sub>3</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)], and the larger La<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is eightcoordinate in [La(acac)<sub>3</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]. The structures of these two complexes are approximately a monocapped trigonal prism (6) and a square antiprism (7), respectively. A square antiprism imposes less ligand&#x2013;ligand repulsion than cubic geometry.</p>

<p class="av-indent">Many lanthanoid complexes are formed with crown ether and &#x03B2;-diketonate ligands. The partially fluorinated &#x03B2;-diketonate ligand [CF<sub>3</sub>COCHCOCF<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, nicknamed &#x2018;fod&#x2019;, produces complexes with Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> that are volatile and soluble in organic solvents. On account of their volatility, these complexes are used as precursors for the synthesis of lanthanoid-containing superconductors by vapour deposition (<a href="Chapter24.xhtml#sec_24.24">Section 24.24</a>).</p>
<p class="av-noindent">Charged ligands generally have the highest affinity for the smallest Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions, and the resulting increase in formation constants from large, lighter Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (on the left of the series) to small, heavier Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (on the right of the series) provides a convenient method for the chromatographic purification of these ions (<a href="#fig_23.13">Fig. 23.13</a>).In the early days of lanthanoid chemistry, before ion-exchange chromatography was developed, tedious repetitive crystallizations were used to separate the elements.</p>
<p class="av-indent">The coordination chemistry of lanthanoids is a flourishing field of research that owes a great deal to their applications in bio-imaging, as either optical or magnetic tracers. The trick here is to attach a target functionality, such as an antenna or bioreceptive group, to a polydentate/macrocyclic ligand that forms a strong, nonlabile complex with the lanthanoid. Many robust complexes are based upon a macrocyclic scaffold, an example being one in which fluorescein is attached to cyclen (8). Further examples will be mentioned in (<a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.9">Section 27.9</a>), where we deal with bio-imaging in more detail. Unlike aqua ions, which exchange water molecules on the ns timescale, many macrocyclic complexes have exchange half-lives that are measured in years.</p>

practical guide for predicting the stability of Ln(II) complexes. Europium is the only lanthanoid
showing an extensive aqueous chemistry in the 2+ oxidation state, a property that
originates in its relatively high <i>I</i><sub>3</sub> value (<a href="#fig_23.3">Fig. 23.3</a>), attributed to the relative stability of the
4f<sup>7</sup> configuration. Indeed, many Eu(II) complexes can be conveniently prepared in water,
by adding a polyanionic ligand to a solution of Eu <sub>2&#x002B;</sub> or by electrochemical reduction of the Eu(III) complex. Complexes of Eu(II) with EGTA (etheneglycol-bis(2-aminoethyl)-<i>N,N,N&#x0027;,N&#x0027;</i>-tetraacetate-(4-)) or DTPA (diethylenetriamine-<i>N,N,N&#x0027;,N&#x0027;&#x0027;</i> -pentaacetate(5-)) are powerful one-electron reducing agents for use in aqueous solution; they have much more
negative reduction potentials than Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (aq) because of the preference of the polyanionic
ligands for the 3+ oxidation state, yet they are slow to evolve H<sub>2</sub> and persist for long periods.</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>  The organometallic chemistry of the lanthanoids is dominated by Ln(III) compounds, with
bonding that is predominantly ionic or stabilized by strong donor ligands. The 18-electron rule does not
hold for lanthanoid organometallic compounds, which tend to resemble those of the early, most electropositive
d metals. Steric effects are far more important than electronic effects, and some cyclopentadienyl
Ln(III) compounds have important applications in stereoselective catalysis. Organometallic
compounds of Ln(II) are powerful reducing agents.</b></p>
<p class="av-indent">The organometallic chemistry of the lanthanoids is much less developed than for the
d-block elements. The majority of lanthanoid organometallic compounds formally contain
Ln(III), for which the lack of any orbitals that can engage in &#x03C0; backbonding to organic
fragments (the 5d orbitals are empty and the 4f orbitals are too buried) restricts the number
of covalent bonding modes that are available.</p>

</aside><p class="av-indent">The first &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-alkene complex of a lanthanoid, [(Cp<sup>&#x22C6;</sup>)<sub>2</sub>Yb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)Pt(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (12), was characterized
only in 1987, a century and a half after the first d-metal alkene complex, Zeise&#x2019;s
salt, was isolated. However, the alkene ligand in this complex is particularly electron-rich
as it is already bound to a &#x03C0;-donating Pt(0) centre, and backbonding from the Yb atom is
therefore unnecessary for stability. The strongly electropositive nature of the lanthanoids
means that they need good donor, not good acceptor, ligands. Consequently, whereas CO,
phosphine, and alkene ligands are rarely seen in lanthanoid chemistry, strong donors such
as N-heterocyclic carbenes (<a href="Chapter22.xhtml#sec_22.15">Section 22.15</a>) are found in a wide variety of complexes, one
example being the bis&#x2013;carbene, tris&#x2013;alkyl Er complex (1) with five metal&#x2013;carbon bonds.</p>
<p class="av-indent">Not surprisingly, the 18-electron rule is not applicable for organometallic lanthanoid
compounds. There are some similarities with compounds of the early d block, which is to
be expected because the elements of Groups 3 and 4 are also strongly electropositive and
have few d electrons available for &#x03C0; backdonation to ligands. In general, organometallic
lanthanoid compounds depend much more upon ionic bonding than the d-block organometallics,
and they are very sensitive to air and moisture. Instead of being controlled by
electron configuration, the chemistry is influenced by steric restraints that become more
demanding as the radii decrease across the series La&#x2013;Lu.</p>
<p class="av-indent">By far the largest number of organometallic compounds are formed with anionic cyclopentadienyl
ligands, and it is appropriate to consider these compounds as containing Cp&#x2212;
groups electrostatically bound to a central Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (or Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) cation. The larger lanthanoid
ions can easily accommodate three cyclopentadienyl ligands, and they even tend to oligomerize,
indicating that there is yet more space for additional ligands. Control over the
reactivity of the complexes is greatly improved by using the sterically demanding pentamethylcyclopentadienyl
(Cp<sup>&#x22C6;</sup>) ligand, although it was nearly 40 years after the original
[Ln(Cp)<sub>3</sub>] compounds were isolated that [Ln(Cp<sup>&#x22C6;</sup>)<sub>3</sub>] compounds were obtained, and even
then they exist in equilibrium between &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup> and &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup> forms:</p>

A number of arene complexes are also known, such as [(C<sub>6</sub>Me<sub>6</sub>)Sm(AlCl<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], (15), where it is thought that the bonding is largely the result of an electrostatically induced dipole between the Sm<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion and the electron-rich ring.</p>

molecules. As expected, the occurrence and reactivities of the Ln(II) metallocenes correlate
quite well with having low values for <i>I</i><sub>3</sub>, so the compounds of Eu(II), Yb(II), and Sm(II)
are most easily accessed and those of Tm(II) and Dy(II) less so; but even Er(II) and Ho(II)

<h3 class="av-h3a"><b>Actinoid chemistry</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentt">The chemical properties of the actinoids show much less uniformity across the series than those of the lanthanoids, and the early members (Ac&#x2013;Am) resemble the early d metals in exhibiting a wide range of oxidation states. However, the radioactivity associated with most of the actinoids has hindered their study. Because the later actinoids are available in such tiny amounts, little is known about their reactions, and most of the chemical properties of the transamericium elements (the elements following americium, Z = 95) have been established by experiments carried out on a microgram scale or even on just a few hundred atoms. For example, the actinoid ion complexes have been adsorbed on and eluted from a single bead of ion-exchange material of diameter 0.2 mm. For the heaviest and most unstable postactinoids, such as hassium (Hs, Z = 108), which should belong in the d block, the lifetimes are too short for chemical separation and the identification of the element is based exclusively on the properties of the radiation it emits. The early actinoids, particularly U and Pu, are of great importance in the generation of power through nuclear fission (<a href="#box23.2">Box 23.2</a>).</p>

<h3 class="av-h3">23.10 General trends</h3>
<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span>  The early actinoids (Th&#x2014;Pu) do not exhibit the chemical uniformity of the lanthanoids, but
behave more like d-block elements. A prevailing motif is the collinear O&#x2014;An&#x2014;O unit that is stabilized
by strong &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; donation into metal 6d and 5f orbitals. As the 5f block is traversed the 3+ oxidation
state becomes increasingly dominant, and the heavy transuranium elements resemble the lanthanoids.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindentt">The 15 elements from actinium (Ac, Z = 89) to lawrencium (Lr, Z = 103) involve the progressive
completion of the 5f subshell, and in this sense are analogues of the lanthanoids.
However, the actinoids do not exhibit the chemical uniformity of the lanthanoids. Many
actinoids occur as An(III), analogous to the lanthanoids; however, early actinoids also
occur in a rich variety of other oxidation states. The basis for this difference is found in
the differing penetration of the 4f and 5f orbitals. As we saw in (<a href="#fig_23.1">Fig. 23.1</a>), the 5f orbital
has an inner region that screens the outer orbitals from the nuclear charge: the 5f orbitals <a id="page_644" class="page">page 644, The f-block elements</a>are therefore much less core like than the 4f, at least until we reach Pu. The 6d orbitals are also more diffuse than the 5d orbitals.</p>

</div>
<p class="av-boxpara">The fission of heavy elements, such as <sup>235</sup>U, can be induced by bombardment
with neutrons. Thermal neutrons (neutrons with low velocities) bring
about the fission of <sup>235</sup>U to produce two nuclides of medium mass, and a
large amount of energy is released because the binding energy per nucleon
decreases steadily for atomic numbers beyond about 26(Fe). That unsymmetrical
fission of the uranium nucleus occurs is shown by the doublehumped
distribution of fission products (<a href="#fig_b23.2">Fig. B23.2</a>), with maxima close
to mass numbers 95 (isotopes of Mo) and 135 (isotopes of Ba). Almost all
the fi ssion products are unstable nuclides. The most troublesome are those
with half-lives in the range of years to centuries: these nuclides decay fast
enough to be highly radioactive but not sufficiently fast to disappear in a
convenient time</p>
<p class="av-boxparai">The first nuclear power plants relied on the fission of uranium to generate
heat. The heat was used to produce steam, which can drive turbines
in much the same way as conventional power plants use the burning of
fuels to produce heat. However, the energy produced by the fi ssion of a
heavy element is huge in comparison with the burning of conventional
fuels: for instance, the complete combustion of 1 kg of octane produces
approximately 50 MJ, whereas the energy liberated by the fi ssion of 1 kg
of <sup>235</sup>U is approximately 2 TJ (1 TJ = 10<sup>12</sup> J), 40 000 times as much. Later
designs of nuclear power plants used plutonium, normally mixed with uranium.
Although nuclear power offers the potential for enormous quantities
of energy at low cost, no satisfactory method of disposal of the radioactive
waste it produces has yet been found.</p>

much more versatile in regard to their oxidation states, but we see also that these features
are reserved for the early members. For americium (Am, Z = 95) and beyond, the properties
of the actinoids begin to converge with those of the lanthanoids. With increasing atomic

The actinoids have large atomic and ionic radii (the radius of an An<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is typically about 5 pm larger than its Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> congener) and high coordination numbers are expected.

<p class="av-noindentt">Because of their ready availability and low level of radioactivity, the chemical manipulation of Th and U can be carried out with ordinary laboratory techniques. As indicated in <a href="#fig_23.15">Fig. 23.15</a>, the most stable oxidation state of thorium in aqueous solution is Th(IV). This oxidation state also dominates the solid-state chemistry of the element. Eight-coordination is common in simple Th(IV) compounds. For example, ThO<sub>2</sub> has the fluorite structure (in which a Th atom is surrounded by a cubic array of O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions), and in ThCl<sub>4</sub> and ThF<sub>4</sub> the coordination numbers are also 8 with dodecahedral and square antiprism symmetry, respectively. The coordination number of Th in [Th(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(OPPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>18</b>) is 10, with the

The very unusual coordination number of 11 is exhibited by Th in its hydrated nitrate, Th(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>&#x22C5;5H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>19</b>), with the Th<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ion coordinated to four

<p class="av-indent">The chemical properties of U are more varied than those of Th because the element has access to oxidation states from U(III) to U(VI), with U(IV) and U(VI) the most common. As suggested from the Frost diagram, the U<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> aqua ion is powerfully reducing, whereas U(V) (as the

Uranium metal does not form a passivating oxide coating, so it becomes corroded upon prolonged exposure to air to give a complex mixture of oxides including UO<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and several polymorphs of the stoichiometry UO<sub>3</sub>.

<p class="av-indentt">The high volatility of UF<sub>6</sub> (it sublimes at 57&#x00B0;C), together with the occurrence of fluorine in a single isotopic form, account for the use of this compound in the separation of the uranium isotopes by gaseous diffusion or centrifugation. The tetrachloride UCl<sub>4</sub>, a useful starting material for synthesizing many U(IV) compounds, is made by reacting UO<sub>3</sub> with hexachloropropene. The U atom is nine-coordinate in solid UCl<sub>3</sub>, eight-coordinate in UCl<sub>4</sub>, and six-coordinate for the U(V) and U(VI) chlorides U<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>10</sub> and UCl<sub>6</sub>, both of which are molecular compounds (<a href="#fig_23.19">Fig. 23.19</a>).</p>

<p class="av-noindente"><b><span class="av-red">Key points:</span></b><b>Several different redox states of plutonium can coexist in aqueous solution. The electronic spectra of the early actinoids have contributions from ligand-to-metal charge transfer, 5f &#x2192; 6d, and 5f &#x2192; 5f transitions.</b></p>
<p class="av-noindent">The three elements Np, Pu, and Am form compounds containing similar species, though there are significant differences in the stabilities of the main oxidation states. The Frost diagrams in <a href="#fig_23.15">Fig. 23.15</a> summarize their behaviour. Neptunium dissolves in dilute acids to produce Np<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, which is readily oxidized by air to produce Np<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>. Increasing strong oxidizing agents produce

 (Np(VI)). The four common oxidation states of plutonium, Pu(III), Pu(IV), Pu(V), and Pu(VI), are separated from each other by less than 1 V, and solutions of Pu often contain a mixture of the species Pu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, Pu<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>, and

The Am<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is the most stable americium species in aqueous solution, reflecting the tendency for An(III) to dominate actinoid chemistry for the high atomic number elements. Under strong oxidizing conditions

<p class="av-indent">The An(IV) oxides NpO<sub>2</sub>, PuO<sub>2</sub>, and AmO<sub>2</sub>, which are formed by heating the elements or their salts in air, all adopt the fluorite structure. Lower oxides include Np<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, Pu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Am<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The trichlorides, AnCl<sub>3</sub>, can be obtained by direct reaction of the elements at 450&#x00B0;C and have structures analogous to that of LnCl<sub>3</sub>, with a nine-coordinate An atom. Tetrafluorides are known for all three actinoids, though only Np and Pu form <a id="page_650" class="page">page 650, d-Metal organometallic chemistry</a>tetrachlorides, further demonstrating the difficulty in raising americium to Am(IV). Both Np and Pu form hexafluorides which, like UF<sub>6</sub>, are volatile solids.</p>
<p class="av-indent">All three metals have chemical properties analogous to that of the uranyl ion, forming

The tetrahalides are Lewis acids and form adducts with electron-pair donors such as DMSO, as in AnCl<sub>4</sub>(Me<sub>2</sub>SO)<sub>7</sub>. Neptunium forms a number of organometallic compounds that are analogues of those of uranium, such as [Np(Cp)<sub>4</sub>].</p>
<p class="av-indent">Plutonium is a potentially dangerous environmental hazard in regions near to nuclear processing plants, where there is always the possibility that it may leach into groundwater sources and contaminate soils. There is therefore much interest in the nature and properties of the complexes formed by Pu in different oxidation states with ubiquitous ligands such as chloride, nitrate, carbonate, or phosphate. Carbonate stabilizes Pu(VI) through formation of the hexagonal-bipyramidal [PuO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4&#x2212;</sup> anion (<b>24</b>). As we will see in <a href="Chapter27.xhtml#sec_27.8">Section 27.8</a>, specific complexing agents are also available for sequestering plutonium that has found its way into the human body.</p>

<h3 class="av-h3b"><b>TUTORIAL PROBLEMS</b></h3>
<p class="av-noindentex" id="t23.1" style="text-align:left;width:70%;"><span class="av-blue"><b>23.1</b></span> Lanthanoid coordination compounds rarely exhibit isomerism in solution. Suggest two factors that might cause this phenomenon, explaining your reasoning. (See D. Parker, R.S. Dickins, H. Puschmann, C. Crossland, and J.A.K. Howard, <i>Chem. Rev.</i>, 2002, <b>102</b>, 1977.)</p>
<p class="av-noindentex" id="t23.2" style="text-align:left;width:70%;"><span class="av-blue"><b>23.2</b></span> Neither lanthanoid nor actinoid organometallic compounds obey the 18-electron rule. Discuss the reasons, using the structures of the tris(Cp) and tris(Cp&#x002A;) Ln and An complexes as examples. (See W.J. Evans and B.L. Davis, <i>Chem. Rev.</i>, 2002, <b>102</b>, 2119.)</p>
<p class="av-noindentex" id="t23.3" style="text-align:left;width:70%;"><span class="av-blue"><b>23.3</b></span> The catalytic activity of many organolanthanoids is controlled by the ionic radius of Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. In general [Ln(Cp&#x002A;)<sub>2</sub>X] complexes that are catalysts for olefin polymerization show decreasing reactivity as La is replaced by Lu. In contrast, some reactions proceed more rapidly as the catalyst is changed from La to Lu. Discuss the principles involved in tuning the catalytic activities of organolanthanoid catalysts in terms of rates and selectivity. (See C.J. Weiss and T.J. Marks, <i>Dalton Trans.</i>, 2010, <b>39</b>, 6576.)</p>
<p class="av-noindentex" id="t23.4" style="text-align:left;width:70%;"><span class="av-blue"><b>23.4</b></span> &#x2018;Quantum cutting&#x2019; is a process by which absorption of a single high-energy photon, corresponding to incident light in the UV spectral region, results in the emission of two photons of lower energy in the visible region. The process is highly efficient and has important applications for improving the spectral range of solar photovoltaic cells, as well as providing more efficient domestic lighting. With reference to articles by X. Huang, <i>et al.</i> (<i>Chem. Soc. Rev.</i>, 2013, <b>42</b>, 173) and C. Lorbeer, <i>et al.</i> (<i>Chem. Comm.</i>, 2010, <b>46</b>, 571), explain why Gd, in conjunction with other lanthanoids, is important for developing this technology.</p>
<p class="av-noindentex" id="t23.5" style="text-align:left;width:70%;"><span class="av-blue"><b>23.5</b></span> Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) offer intriguing new possibilities for storing and processing data: lanthanoids, because of their large number of unpaired electrons, are attracting a great deal of interest. The triangular complex [Dy<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(<i>o</i>-van)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>Cl]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (<b>25</b>) consists of three Dy<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, each coordinated by a molecule of vanillin and interlinked by hydroxide ions. With reference to the article by R. Sessoli and A.K. Powell (<i>Coord. Chem. Rev.</i>, 2009, <b>253</b>, 2328), explain why Dy(III) triangles are particularly interesting to those working in the SMM field.</p>

When the element after uranium, neptunium (<i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;93), was discovered in 1940, its properties did not correspond to those of rhenium (<i>Z</i>&#x2009;&#x003D;&#x2009;75), and this cast doubt on the original placement of uranium. (See G.T. Seaborg and W.D. Loveland, <i>The elements beyond uranium</i>. Wiley-Interscience (1990), pp. 9 ff.) Using standard potential data from <i>Resource section 2</i>, discuss the differences in oxidation state stability between Np and Re.</p>
