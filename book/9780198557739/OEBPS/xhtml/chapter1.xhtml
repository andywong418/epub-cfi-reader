<p class="noindent">Although traditionally biology, and hence life, has been regarded as organic, life is inorganic too. While you are reading this you are breathing, taking in dioxygen from the atmosphere and using it for the essential process of respiration through its interaction with the iron atoms present in haemoglobin and myoglobin. In order to read this you are continually sending messages throughout your nervous system by using the changes in electrical flux caused by the movement of sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes. It has been said that &#x2018;Life has evolved from inorganic materials (generating organic chemistry as it went) and in that evolution has incorporated every facet of inorganic chemistry that was profitable to it.&#x2019; Every facet of inorganic chemistry but not every element; at present we are aware of 13 metals which are essential for plants or animals. Four of these, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are present in large quantities and are known as the <i>bulk metals</i>; the remaining nine which are present in small quantities are the d-block elements vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc and are known as the <i>trace metals.</i> It is this latter group that we are concerned with in biocoordination chemistry.</p>

<p class="noindent">The nonmetallic elements provide, through water, the medium of life. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen provide the fundamental organic components of life by making up molecular building blocks such as amino acids, which themselves are the building blocks for proteins, sugars, fatty acids, purines, pyrimidines, and nucleotides (<a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). Phosphorus also plays</p>

It is also present in the double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a polymer of nucleotides, which incorporates the genetic blueprint of all organisms except for RNA viruses. The non-metals<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, &#x2018;Life is inorganic too&#x2019;</a>also provide counter-ions such as Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ; mineralized tissues such as bones and teeth are derived from calcium phosphates, and shells from calcium carbonate, together with a complicated organic matrix of polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent">The bulk metals form 1&#x2013;2% of human body-weight and a 75kg person has approximately 170g potassium, 100g sodium, 1100g calcium, and 25g magnesium present. In contrast the trace elements represent less than 0.01% of human body-weight and even of iron, the most widely used, we need only of the order of 4&#x2013;5 g.</p>
<p class="indent">Two major periods of activity in trace metal research have occurred during the twentieth century. Until 1956, serendipity aided the discovery of the importance of copper, zinc, cobalt, manganese, and molybdenum in animals; since 1956, work based on the experimental induction of trace element deficiencies, inspired by Klaus Schwarz, indicated that other metals such as chromium, tin, vanadium, nickel, cadmium, and lithium should perhaps be added to the list. One problem is that living organisms are adept at accumulating metals from media of extreme dilution, from airborne dust and by leaching from feeding vessels. Accumulation in itself does not establish that there is a physiological need for a metal. Marine organisms are known with high titanium, vanadium, chromium, niobium, and thallium content and mussels are currently used to monitor the purity of rivers and estuarine waters. There is still conjecture concerning the possible essentiality of cadmium and lithium, and the mammalian metabolism of cadmium may be as a detoxificant through the induction of <i>metallothionen.</i> The <i>phytochelatins</i> are the plant world&#x2019;s equivalent of metallothionen and bind strongly to cadmium and other heavy metals. (The biomolecules in italic face will be described later in the text.)</p>
<p class="indent">This is a living subject area and so it is interesting to speculate on whether, or not, further essential elements will be discovered.</p>

<p class="indent">Iron, copper, and zinc, the three most abundant trace elements, are universally essential. Iron and copper can readily change their oxidation states and so act in electron-transfer systems; these can produce oxidized substrates which participate in a variety of metabolic cycles. Examples include the Fe&#x2013;S proteins <i>rubredoxin</i> and <i>ferredoxin</i>, the haem protein <i>cytochrome</i> c, and the blue copper proteins <i>azurin</i> and <i>plastocyanin.</i> Iron and copper are also involved in dioxygen storage and carriage. The former is present in <i>haemoglobin</i>, <i>myoglobin</i>, and <i>haemerythrin</i> and the latter in <i>haemocyanin.</i> There are iron storage <i>(ferritin</i>) and carrier proteins (,<i>transferrin</i>, <i>lactoferrin</i>, and <i>siderophores</i>) and a copper-transfer protein (i<i>ceruloplasmin</i>). Zinc serves as a superacid centre in metalloenzymes<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, &#x2018;Life is inorganic too&#x2019;</a>promoting the hydrolysis or cleavage of a variety of chemical bonds; representative examples are <i>carboxypeptidase</i> (cleaves terminal carboxy groups from peptide chains), <i>carbonic anhydrase</i> (regulates the hydration of carbon dioxide), and <i>alcohol dehydrogenase</i> (converts alcohol to acetaldehyde). As well as being involved in functional roles, zinc can also act in a structural role in which it controls and stabilizes the enzyme structure by helping to position the enzyme for action at a distant site. This is exemplified in the bimetallic enzyme <i>superoxide dismutase</i> which breaks down toxic superoxide to give dioxygen and peroxide, the latter of which is converted into dioxygen and water by the iron-containing metalloenzyme <i>catalase.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase</i> (BESOD), <i>haemocyanin</i>, and <i>haemerythrin</i> may be used to introduce bimetallobiosites wherein there is a bimetallic centre in the biological molecule. BESOD has a heterobimetallic centre consisting of one zinc and one copper atom; haemocyanin and haemerythrin both have homobimetallic centres bearing two copper and two iron atoms respectively.</p>

<p class="noindent">Of the so-called ultratrace metals only five (Mn, Mo, Co, Ni, and V) have been identified as forming metalloenzymes. Manganese is involved in several important enzymes&#x2014;<i>mitochondrial superoxide dismutase</i>, <i>inorganic phosphatase</i>, <i>glycosyl transferase</i>, and in <i>photosynthesis system II.</i> Cobalt is present in <i>vitamin B<sub>I2</sub></i> and its coenzyme and provides a rare example of a naturally occurring organometallic compound. Nickel is now known to function in metalloenzymes such as <i>urease</i> and several <i>hydrogenases</i> and to act in the unusual nickel(III) oxidation state. Both molybdenum and vanadium are found in <i>nitrogenases</i>, where they are present in clusters containing also iron and sulphur; vanadium is also active in <i>haloperoxidases.</i> The remaining metal, chromium, has persistently been reported as being essential in glucose metabolism in higher mammals but there has not yet been any definite verification of this essentiality.</p>

<p class="noindent">A useful classification of metallobiomolecules is given in <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>. The potential roles of metal ions in biological systems can be described as <i>structural</i> and <i>functional.</i> In the former the metal ion helps to stabilize the protein structure and in the latter the metal ion is involved in the reactivity of the biosite. Proteins are polymers of amino acids joined by amide bonds. Members of this class of compound are also referred to as peptides or polypeptides. In this book proteins are regarded as naturally occurring polypeptides and peptides are considered as smaller molecules with defined degrees of association&#x2014;dipeptides (two amino acids), tripeptides (three amino acids) and so on. Enzymes act as catalysts enabling reactions to occur under physiological conditions which would otherwise be unacceptably slow. All enzymes are proteins but all proteins are not necessarily enzymes; metalloproteins and metalloenzymes contain at least one metal ion.<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, &#x2018;Life is inorganic too&#x2019;</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Having indicated the functions of the metallobiosites it is necessary to consider the molecular nature of the sites. Generally the bulk metals are located with &#x2018;hard&#x2019; donors such as -O-, -O<sup>-</sup>, with the alkali metals being relatively mobile, forming weak complexes, and with the alkaline earth metals being semi-mobile to static, using the same donors but forming stronger complexes. The transition metals generally form strong complexes and so are relatively static in nature. There is a variability of oxidation states for these metals and of the donor atom preference as the first row is crossed from manganese to zinc; manganese(II, III) prefers oxygen donors, iron(II, III), and cobalt(II, III) prefer nitrogen and oxygen donors, copper(I, II) prefers nitrogen and sulphur donors, and zinc(II) prefers sulphur donors.<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, &#x2018;Life is inorganic too&#x2019;</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.7</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Structurally defined sites</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is generally believed that the function of a biological system depends upon its structure. For several decades single crystal X-ray diffraction has served as the final arbiter for biological structure determination. The crystalline form, however, is not the one pertaining to physiological environments <i>in vivo</i> and so there is the question of whether the structures in solution and in the crystal are really the same. The possibility exists that the conformations are different, and so attempts to interpret crystal structures in detail and relate this information directly to the function of the biosite might be misleading. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques are now becoming available for the solution of structures in solution.</p>

<p class="noindent">Structural studies on metalloenzymes have shown that coordination geometries around the metal ions can be distorted. It has been proposed that this may be related to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and that the protein can fold to generate special stereochemistries which help the metal to adopt a geometry closer to that in the transition state of the reaction being catalysed than to a more normal regular state geometry. There is &#x2018;a presetting of the geometry such that there is a catalytically poised state intrinsic to the active site&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>). This has been termed the entatic state (<i>entasis</i> - Gk, stretched, under tension) and examples include the copper atoms in azurin and plastocyanin, and the zinc atoms at the active sites of carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not always possible to have such a precise awareness of the nature of the metallobiosite. Often it is necessary to build up a picture of the site based on a cumulation of spectroscopic evidence and this has led to the study of small molecule models for the biosites. Models have been classified as being of three types: <i>corroborative</i>, where the structure of the biosite is known and the model is built to study properties of the site <i>in vitro</i> and to determine if the properties of the metalloprotein are dominated by the first coordination sphere of the metal; <i>speculative</i>, where the structure is not known but is anticipated from cumulative spectroscopic studies and so the model is used to parallel these properties in order to produce a predictive comparison; and <i>functional</i>, where the actual functioning of the site is reproduced. This latter aspect is deemed to be the most difficult and it is still true to say that it has<a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, &#x2018;Life is inorganic too&#x2019;</a>not yet been achieved. This may be associated with the concept of the entatic state, namely that the active metal site of an enzyme is in a geometry approaching that of the transition state of the appropriate reaction and as such is uniquely fitted for catalytic action. The iron-sulphur clusters <b>(<a href="#fi_1.17">1.17</a>, <a href="#fi_1.17">1.18</a>)</b> synthesized to mimic the Fe&#x2013;S proteins <b>(<a href="#fi_1.9">1.9</a>, <a href="#fi_1.11">1.11</a>)</b> are examples of corroborative models. The dinuclear copper(II) complex <b>(<a href="#fi_1.17">1.19</a>)</b> is representative of the many speculative models which were advanced for the dinuclear copper(II) site in oxyhaemocyanin as predicted from cumulative spectroscopic studies <b>(<a href="#fi_1.17">1.20</a>).</b> It was, however, the peroxide binding mode in another speculative model complex (<b><a href="#fi_1.17">1.21</a></b>) that was found when the crystal structure of oxyhaemocyanin was solved (<b><a href="#fi_1.17">1.22</a></b>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fi_1.17">
 <img src="../images/f0009-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">One necessary statement concerning the use of models is that caution must be exercised. It is essential to remember that the model is a small molecule and so is not in any way constrained by the immediacy of a protein environment and the accompanying subtle roles that the folded protein chains may play in governing the nature of the biosite. Therefore while a model may accurately reproduce the physicochemical properties of a site, it may not be able to respond in a truly functional manner. Perhaps this is best summarized by the econometrician Thiel who commented that &#x2018;Models are to be <i>used</i>, not believed&#x2019;.</p>
