<p class="noindent">Enzymes are large proteins which catalyse biochemical reactions often increasing the rate of reaction by factors as high as 10<sup>12</sup> over the corresponding model reaction; like all proteins they are essentially polypeptides. They have very large molecular weights and the substrate for the enzymatic reaction is generally small and so can only interact with a small portion of the enzyme. This is termed the active site and is often in the form of a cleft, or pocket, in the enzyme structure. A metalloenzyme is an enzyme in which the metal ion serves as the active centre. Enzymes are named after the reaction that they perform&#x2014;ATP-ase hydrolyses ATP, a hydrolase carries out acid-catalysed hydrolysis, an oxidase is involved in redox reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">One requirement for life is the maintenance of molecules in a reduced state even though they are exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere. A further requirement is the production of energy which is accomplished by respiration in which dioxygen is reduced to water. This can be catalysed by cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase as discussed in the preceding chapter. Dioxygen can be reduced via a series of one-electron transfers (<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>). The superoxide and peroxide anions are powerful oxidizing agents and present a threat to life; therefore it is necessary to remove them. Two main methods are available for removing hydrogen peroxide: disproportionation,</p>

<p class="noindent">Superoxide dismutases exist either as mononuclear or dinuclear metallo-enzymes. The X-ray crystal structures of mononuclear iron (ex-<i>Pseudomonas ovalis</i>) and manganese (ex-<i>Bacillus thearothermophilus</i>) SOD and of the heterodinuclear copper&#x2013;zinc BESOD have been solved.</p>
<p class="indent">The structures of the coordination sites in the mononuclear compounds are similar and show the metal to be four-coordinated to three histidine residues and one tyrosine residue (<a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). The geometries can be described as distorted trigonal bipyramids with one apical site left empty (an entatic state&#x003F;). There are no available water molecules and in the iron enzyme the next nearest iron atom is 18A distant. In contrast in the Mn SOD isolated</p>

<p class="noindent">The structure of Cu&#x2013;Zn BESOD (<a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>) shows that the coordination at the copper(II) is distorted square pyramidal with three histidines, a water molecule and a bridging imidazolate residue from His-61 which is shared with the zinc. The zinc is tetrahedral, the coordination being completed by an additional two histidines and an aspartate residue. The copper(II)&#x2013;zinc separation is 5.4&#x00C5;. The copper ion is the catalytic centre and the zinc ion has an ancillary structural role. This can be shown by removing the metals to obtain the apoprotein and then reconstituting it with different metals. Every derivative which retains copper(II) in the native site retains almost full activity and no derivative in which this copper has been replaced is active.<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a></p>

<p class="indent">A proposed mechanism for the enzymatic activity of BESOD (<a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>) requires that the superoxide replaces the water molecule on the copper(II). The bound superoxide reduces the copper(II) to copper(I) with simultaneous cleavage of the bond between the copper and His-61. Dioxygen is released and a second superoxide now binds to the copper(I) positioning one O atbm to form a hydrogen bond with the protonated imidazole of His-61. Electron transfer from the copper(I) coupled with proton transfer from the His-61 gives copper-hydroperoxide which picks up a second hydrogen from the active site water to release hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p class="noindent">Horse radish peroxidase, (HRP), present in the roots of horse radish, is perhaps the best studied of these metalloenzymes. The active site is an iron(III) atom from protoporphyrin IX. The fifth coordination site is occupied by a nitrogen atom from histidine and the sixth site is either vacant or contains a water molecule. The iron(III) is high spin at low pH and low spin at high pH.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide the iron undergoes a two-electron oxidation to give green HRP-I which then is reduced in a one-electron step to the red HRP-II. It has been difficult to unravel the mechanism of HRP as collective spectroscopic evidence indicates that both HRP-I and HRP-II contain low-spin oxoiron(IV) species which are virtually unknown in any other chemistry of iron. It has also been found that HRP-I has present a porphyrin radical cation. A scheme for the raction of peroxidase is depicted in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>. In addition to the components ot the above scheme there is a third species HRP-III [P-Fe(II)O<sub>2</sub>] which is an analogue of oxymyoglobin produced when the peroxidase is treated with a large excess of hydrogen peroxide.<a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a></p>

<p class="indent">The crystal structure of yeast cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase (CCP) has been solved and shows that the axial sites are indeed occupied by histidine and water. CCP reacts with peroxides to cleave the O&#x2013;O bond and generate Compound 1 which is analogous to HRP-1. Compound 1 is then reduced in two successive steps by cytochrome <i>c.</i> As in HRP the intermediates involve iron(IV) but electron abstraction occurs from the amino acid side chain rather than the porphyrin of the heme. The structure of Compound 1 is also reported and in this the electron density pattern close to the iron confirms the suggestion from EXAFS data that there is a strong Fe(IV)&#x003D;O interaction (&#x007E;1.67 &#x00C5;)</p>
<p class="indent">Another type of haem-iron peroxidase is chloroperoxidase which catalyses the oxidation of chloride ions in the halogenation of a range of substrates again utilizing an oxoiron(IV) intermediate.</p>

<p class="indent">The crystal structure of beef liver catalase shows that the iron(III) atom is five-coordinate with a tyrosine residue occupying one axial position and the second axial position vacant. Despite the structural detail available the mechanism of action of catalase is unclear.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to conclude this section with reference to a recent lecture by Max Perutz in which he reminisces as follows: &#x2018;At about the time that Pauling delivered his discourse [at the Royal Institution in 1948] my mentor David Keilin asked me: &#x201C;Haemoglobin, peroxidase and catalase all contain the same haem. What gives them their very different properties&#x003F;&#x201D; Keilin&#x2019;s tone implied that as a structural chemist I ought to know the answer, but I was clueless. Had I more imagination, I ought to have replied that these different properties were likely to be due to the different electrostatic effects exercised on the haem by the different proteins.&#x2019; In all haem proteins the haem iron is attached to the protein by an amino acid residue&#x2014;histidine in haemoglobin and peroxidase, tyrosine in catalase, cysteine in cytochrome<a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a>P&#x2013;450 and so it is intriguing to think that the different properties are related to the different electron densities at the metal and to the different electrostatic effects induced by these different protein environments.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Vanadium bromoperoxidase</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Vanadium bromoperoxidases (V-BrPA) have been isolated from marine brown and red algae. They catalyse the oxidation of bromide by hydrogen peroxide and the concurrent formation of carbon&#x2013;halogen bonds, or, in the absence of an organic substrate, the generation of singlet dioxygen from the bromide-assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide. In contrast to the corresponding haem iron haloperoxidases, the production of dioxygen only occurs in the presence of bromide or iodide anions. The halide oxidation selectivity of V-BrPO was first thought to be restricted to bromide or iodide but it is now known that V-BrPO can catalyse the oxidation of chlorine by hydrogen peroxide leading to the chlorination of selected organic substrates.</p>
<p class="indent">EPR studies have shown that the metal is present as vanadium(V); when the metal is reduced to the vanadium(IV) state the enzyme loses its brominating activity. EXAFS studies suggest that it is in a distorted octahedral environment with two histidine nitrogen atoms and one oxo group bound to the metal; the remaining three sites are probably occupied by three oxygen atoms from undetermined amino acids. A scheme for the reaction carried out has been advanced (<a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>). However the precise nature of the &#x2018;intermediate&#x2019; is not established and the exact role of the metal is not yet</p>

<p class="noindent">Oxidases catalyse electron transfer to dioxygen which is reduced to superoxide, peroxide, or water. Oxygenases catalyse reactions in which the atoms of dioxygen are incorporated into organic substrates. In monooxygenases one oxygen atom is inserted, with the second being reduced to water, and in dioxygenases both oxygen atoms are inserted into the substrate. Dioxygen is kinetically inert and requires activation by binding to a low-valent metal centre, usually iron(II) or copper(I). Control over the transfer of electron density from the metal to dioxygen dictates the biological role of the metalloprotein or metalloenzyme, determining whether it will function as an oxygen carrier, an oxidase, or in oxygenase hydroxylation reactions.<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Oxidases</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The haem oxidase cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase and the blue copper oxidases laccase and ascorbate oxidase have been referred to in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>. All are involved in the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water and the copper enzymes concomitantly oxidize a substrate. Ascorbate oxidase oxidizes L-ascorbate to dehydroascorbate, and laccase is less specific and oxidizes a range of substrates but particularly <i>p</i>-phenols to quinones.</p>
<p class="indent">There are other non-blue copper oxidases. Amine oxidases catalyse the oxidative deamination of biological amines generating aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia.</p>
<p class="fig1">RCH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; O<sub>2</sub> &#x2192; RCHO &#x002B; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; NH<sub>3</sub></p>
<p class="indent">The copper site has been shown by EPR to contain at least two nitrogen atoms, probably from histidines, but it is not certain that the copper actually activates dioxygen. Galactose oxidase catalyses the oxidation of primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde with reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The copper site (<a href="#fig_5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>), as revealed by X-ray crystallography by Simon Phillips and his co-workers, is unusual and quite dissimilar from that found for the oxidative copper enzymes ascorbate oxidase and superoxide dismutase. The copper(II) atom (Type II) is coordinated by two equatorial histidines (at 2.11 and 2.15&#x00C5;), two tyrosines (one axial at 2.69&#x00C5; and one equatorial at 1.94&#x00C5;), and an acetate anion (at 2.27&#x00C5;) in a distorted square pyramidal environment. The acetate anion (which arises from use of an acetate buffer at pH 7.0) can be replaced by a water molecule at pH 7.0 which is the pH region at which the oxidase is active. This water molecule is <i>c.</i> 2.8&#x00C5; from the copper and so the very distorted geometry could induce an entatic situation leading to a facile redox shuttle between copper(II) and copper(I) after addition of the substrate. Furthermore D-galactose, the substrate, could replace the water and bind to the equatorial site.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Monooxygenases</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Monooxygenase activity can occur at mono- or dinuclear metal sites; these are represented here by cytchrome P-450, a mononuclear haem enzyme, tyrosinase, a dinuclear copper enzyme, and methane monooxygenase, a dinuclear iron non-haem enzyme.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Cytochromes P-450</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These are haem enzymes which act as mono-oxygenases and use dioxygen to catalyse aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation reactions and various other oxidation reactions. The name of the enzymes derives from the fact that their carbon monoxide adducts have absorption bands at 450nm. Their reaction requires a hydrogen donor such as NADH or a flavin, below denoted by AH<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Cytochrome P-450 consists of a haem group with the iron coordinated to the protein by a cysteine sulphur group. This has been shown through the crystal structure of the camphor bound form of cytochrome P-450 from<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a><i>Pseudomonas putida</i>. In the resting state the iron is low spin and there should be an additional ligand, probably water, in the sixth coordination site which is then lost to form the active five coordinate high-spin iron(III) compound which reacts with the substrate. The iron(III) is then reduced to iron(II) and once in this state it can bind dioxygen to give a diamagnetic oxycomplex similar to oxymyoglobin. Addition of a second electron to the super- oxocomplex is followed by heterolytic cleavage of the O&#x2013;O(peroxo) bond. One oxygen is lost as water and the other forms a perferryl intermediate which is involved in a two-electron oxidation of the substrate to give the product and regeneration of the iron(II) state of the enzyme (<a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The difficult area of this scheme is in the mechanism of cleavage of the O&#x2013;O bond. The first product of cleavage could be the perferryl complex shown in the scheme or it could be a porphyrin radical cation as in [Fe(IV)(O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>)P<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The difficulty of elucidating the mechanism is related to the paucity of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) chemistry in systems other than the haem proteins. Studies on the hydroxylation of alkanes by iodosylbenzene and model iron porphyrins has confirmed the plausibility of a perferryl intermediate; structural models have also been presented for the active iron (III) site (<a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>).</p>

The former behaviour is termed cresolase activity and the latter is catecholase activity. Chemical and spectroscopic evidence indicates that the tyrosinases have a Type III coupled dinuclear active site closely similar to that found in the haemocyanins.</p>
<p class="indent">A mechanism for the catalytic activity of tyrosinase has been advanced by Edward Solomon and his co-workers (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>) Deoxytyrosinase reacts with dioxygen to give oxytyrosinase; the phenolic substrate then coordinates axially to one of the copper atoms in the oxytyrosinase. There is then a rearangement through a five-coordinate intermediate accompanied by <i>ortho</i>-hydroxylation of the phenol, loss of water, and coordination of the diphenolic product. Intramolecular electron transfer leads to the <i>ortho</i>-benzoquinone product and regenerates deoxytyrosinase.<a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a></p>

<p class="indent">There are two kinds of MMO, a membrane-bound enzyme containing copper and a water soluble enzyme containing non-haem iron. EPR studies on the hydroxylase component of MMO from <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> (<i>Bath</i>) indicated that it contains a diiron centre which was at first thought to be of a similar type to those found in hemerythrins and ribonucleotide reductase B2. However a detailed study of the hydroxylase components, involving EXAFS, mass spectrometry, and magnetochemistry, indicated that there were striking differences between the diiron sites in these systems and that MMO did not contain a Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe bridge. A novel type of Fe&#x2013;Fe bridge was indicated containing an alkoxo-, hydroxo-, or monodentate carboxylato bridge, together with one, or two, bridging carboxylates.</p>
<p class="indent">The X-ray crystal structure of the MMO hydroxylase from <i>M. capsulatus</i> (<i>Bath</i>), solved by Stephen Lippard and his coworkers, revealed that the geometry of the diiron core has the two pseudo-octahedral iron atoms separated by 3.4&#x00C5; and linked by two non-protein bridging ligands (<a href="#fig_5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>).<a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a>One is a hydroxide anion and the second is an acetate anion.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Dioxygenases</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The metal-containing dioxygenases usually contain iron in a non-haem environment. An example of their activity is the oxidative cleavage of 1,2-catechols by an extra-diol (a) or intradiol (b) pathway. The pattern of the reaction can be monitored by <sup>18</sup>O-labelling experiments. Catechol-1,2-dioxygenase catalyses the intradiol cleavage of catechol by oxygen to give <i>cis,cis</i>-muconic acid, so incorporating both of the oxygen atoms. EXAFS studies have suggested that the iron(III) is six-coordinate having two histidine and two <i>cis</i>-tyrosine ligands together with a water molecule and a sixth ligand which could be easily dissociated. The catechol binds to the enzyme before oxidation and so is coordinated, probably monodentate, to the iron.</p>

<p class="indent">Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is an example of an extradiol dioxygenase; it is colourless and EPR-silent suggesting the presence of iron(II). The Mossbauer spectrum confirms this and is unaffected by substrate binding, thus raising the question of whether the substrate actually binds to the metal.</p>

<p class="indent">The crystal structure of protocatechate-3,4-dioxygenase, which catalyses the intradiol cleavage of protocatechuic acid to &#x03B2;-carboxy-<i>cis</i>,<i>cis</i>-muconic acid, has been solved and shows that the iron(III) is in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment. The iron is bonded by two tyrosines and two histidines with a solvent molecule in the fifth site. One tyrosine and one histidine occupy axial positions. A highly reactive functional model for catechol dioxygenase activity has been constructed by Lawrence Que and his co-workers, [Fe(III) (TPA)DBC]BPh<sub>4</sub>, [TPA &#x003D; <i>tris</i>-(2-pyridylmethyl)amine<a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a>and DBC &#x003D; 3,5-<i>t</i>-butylcatecholate] (<a href="#fig_5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>). The structure of this complex reveals a distorted octahedral iron(III) centre with long iron&#x2013;catechol oxygen bonds. Reaction of this complex with dioxygen facilitates oxidative cleavage of the catechol to give compounds (<b><a href="#fi_5.7">5.7</a></b>) and (<b><a href="#fi_5.7">5.8</a></b>).</p>
<p class="indent">The role of the enzyme indole-2,3-dioxygenase serves to illustrate the wider application of dioxygenases as this enzyme from the small intestine of the rabbit causes cleavage of the indole ring in the amino acid tryptophan and other related indoleamines.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Ribonucleotide reductase</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyses the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotide di- or triphosphates, the first step in DNA synthesis. <i>E.coli</i> RR contains two subunits, a and b, and the two dimeric forms a<sub>2</sub> and b<sub>2</sub> are known as B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> respectively. The a units contain the substrate binding sites but both B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> contribute to the active site of the enzyme. RRB2 contains a stable free radical&#x2014;it was the first example to be found in proteins&#x2014;and EPR was used to characterize this as a protein-derived tyrosyl radical located in the vicinity of a dinuclear iron centre (galactose oxidase also has a tyrosine radical close to the active site). The reaction catalysed by RR has been proposed to proceed via a free-radical mechanism involving the cyclic transfer of the pre-existing radical to the substrate and back. The diiron centre in RRB2 showed spectral properties closely similar to those found in Met-haemerythrin and this led to the proposal that, by analogy, the site was a similarly constructed bioctahedral site. The X-ray crystal structure of the oxidized form of <i>E.coli</i> RRB2 (<a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>) confirmed that the Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe bridge was present, as in Met-haemerythrin, and showed that there are two dinuclear iron(III) centres, separated by &#x007E;25&#x00C5;, in the dimeric molecule. The dinuclear centre has an oxygen-dominated first ligand sphere and the iron atoms, separated by 3.3&#x00C5;, are, in contrast to Met-haemerythrin, doubly bridged by a single glutamate carboxylate residue and the oxo-ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">The coordination geometries of the iron atoms are quite different from those in Met-haemerythrin and from each other. One iron atom is terminally coordinated by two monovalent glutamates, a histidine, and a water molecule in a regular octahedral geometry, whereas the second iron atom is coordinated further by a bidentate aspartate, a water molecule, and a histidine. The geometry has both octahedral and trigonal bipyramidal features because of the chelating aspartate which can be considered as occupying two<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Dioxygen management&#x2014;involvement in enzymes</a>donor sites and so giving a severely distorted octahedron,or as utilizing one equatorial site of a trigonal bipyramid. Three redox states are possible for the dinuclear iron centre. The diiron(II) and diiron(III) have been well characterized but it is only recently that the mixed-valence Fe(II)Fe(III) state has been detected.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the crystal structure of the reduced form of RRB2 has not yet been solved the crystal structure of Mn(II)-reconstituted RRB2 (<a href="#fig_5.15">Figure. 5.15</a>) shows that the metals are bridged by two bidentate carboxylates, Glu-115 and Glu-238, and that there is no oxo-bridge. The diiron(II) site in RRB2<sub>red</sub> is then proposed to be similar and a mechanism for the reduction of the diiron centre in RRB2<sub>OX</sub> has been presented (<a href="#fig_5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>). This involves protonation of the oxo-bridge and carboxylate shifts.</p>

<p class="indent">The relevance of the bis(&#x03BC;-carboxylato-O,O&#x2019;)diiron(II) centre as a structural motif was suggested by the crystal structure of Mn(II)-reconstituted RRB2. There are differences between the structures of the model and of RRB2. The bridging carboxylates are <i>syn</i>-<i>anti</i> in the model with an intermetallic separation of 4.3&#x00C5; but they are likely to be <i>syn</i>-<i>syn</i> in the protein, as they are in the manganese-reconstituted protein and as suggested by the shorter intermetallic separaton of 3.3&#x00C5;; the nitrogen and oxygen content of the donor atom sets are also different. Never the less, the model may be regarded as a reactivity model because it reacts with dioxygen to yield a mixed oxo-, carboxylato-bridge in the oxidized dimer (<b>3</b>) similar to that found in RRB2<sub>ox</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The structural relationship between MMO and RRB2 provides an interesting example of how Nature can use closely related structural features to catalyse very different chemical reactions.</p>
