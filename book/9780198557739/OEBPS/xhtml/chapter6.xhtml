<p class="indent">Two generalized mechanistic pathways have been suggested for the catalytic action of zinc enzymes (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). In the first the coordinated water molecule is deprotonated to leave a bound hydroxide which can then either attack the carbon atom of the carbonyl group in a substrate or act as a proton acceptor. Ionization of the activated water molecule (enhancement of the acidity of the coordinated water) promotes the nucleophilicity of the bound solvent molecule; this process can be assisted by polarization by a base form of a proximal amino acid. The p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of metal-free water is 15.7 and this can be reduced to around 10 in [Zn(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>; it can be further reduced to around 7 in the tridentate complex [(L)Zn(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (L is depicted as <b>6.1</b>). In the second mechanism the substrate attaches directly to the zinc through a carbonyl group which is then polarized inducing nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom of the carbonyl group.<a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, More metalloenzymes</a></p>

<p class="indent">Zinc has several chemical features which benefit its presence at the catalytic sites. The ready formation of low coordination number sites which have more acidity than high coordination number sites, the easy deformation of the coordination site geometry and the accessible change of coordination number from four to five to six, are all of assistance at a catalytic site where there must be flexibility throughout the catalytic cycle. Zinc can exchange its ligands readily but must not itself be lost from the protein. Zinc, as a <i>d</i><sup>10</sup> ion, has no reduction-oxidation chemistry and so it is likely that many zinc enzymes are used in situations where the presence of a redox active metal would promote reactions injurious to the host. Only two examples of zinc enzyme activity will be discussed here.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Carbonic anhydrase II</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA) was first recognized as a zinc enzyme in 1940. It is found predominantly in red blood cells where it catalyses, with a high turnover rate (10<sup>6</sup> sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at pH 9 and 25&#x00B0;C), the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form the bicarbonate anion and a proton via a tandem chemical process.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/f0061-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the absence of a catalyst, hydration of carbon dioxide occurs relatively slowly and HCA enhances the rate by a factor of 10<sup>7</sup>. HCA can also catalyse hydrolysis of esters and aldehydes.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of the metalloenzyme shows that the zinc atom lies near to the bottom of a cleft some 15 &#x00C5; deep. It is ligated to the imidazole nitrogen<a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, More metalloenzymes</a>atoms of three histidine residues and to a water molecule in a distorted tetrahedral array. A general mechanistic profile for the catalysis of CO<sub>2</sub> hydration is presented in <a href="#fig_6.3">Fig 6.3</a>.</p>

<p class="figurecaptionc"><b>Fig. 6.3.</b> A general mechanistic profile for the catalysis of CO<sub>2</sub> hydration.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The first sequence involves an outer sphere association of the substrate with the enzyme, via nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom of the CO<sub>2</sub>, followed by chemical conversion of the substrate to the coordinated product. After a conformational rearrangement of this product at the metal centre the second sequence involves product dissociation and regeneration of the catalytically active species by substitution with water and participation of the neighbouring His-64 as a proton acceptor. While certain structural features such as the function of the pentacoordinate zinc and the degree of CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;Zn<sup>2&#x002B; </sup>interaction in the enzyme&#x2013;substrate association have not yet been fully elucidated it is not believed that a precatalytic inner sphere O&#x003D;C&#x003D;O&#x2192;Zn<sup>2&#x002B; </sup>interaction is operating in HCA.</p>
<aside class="abcd" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-14.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Isomorphous replacement: as a <i>d</i><sup>10</sup> ion zinc is said to be spectroscopically silent with regard to techniques such as EPR, UV, and visible spectroscopies the technique of isomorphous replacement can be used to probe the nature of the site in an enzyme in the absence of X-ray crystallographic techniques. If the apo-enzyme, in this example HCA, is reconstituted with other metals, it is possible to use a range of spectroscopic techniques. On reconstitution with Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> HCA retains about 50% of its activity; Cd<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> have only slight activity and Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> have negligible activity. This is related to the geometry at the site and as, of the metals used here, Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is capable of adopting to the required tetrahedral geometry then it partly restores the enzymatic activity. A similar pattern emerges for carboxy peptidase.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A functional model for HCA activity has been derived from the highly substituted pyrazolylborate ligand HBL<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (L &#x003D; 3-<i>tert</i>-butyl-5-methyl-pyrazolyl; <a href="chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a>). This ligands caps one face of the tetrahedral zinc leaving an apical site available for further interaction. [(HBL<sub>3</sub>)Zn]OH is synthesized and reacts reversibly with CO<sub>2</sub> to give a bicarbonato complex. Hydrolysis of this complex regenerates the hydroxo-complex thus paralleling the facile displacement and regeneration of the hydroxozinc species that is critically involved in the proposed catalytic cycle for HCA.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Carboxypeptidase A</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Bovine carboxypeptidase A (CPA) is a metalloexopeptidase which hydrolyses C-terminal amino acids from peptide substrates and has a preference towards those substrates possessing large, hydrophobic C-terminal side chains as does phenylalanine. It was the first zinc enzyme to be characterized crystallographically. The zinc atom was shown to be ligated within a cleft by the imidazole nitrogen atoms of two histidine residues, a<a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, More metalloenzymes</a>bidentate glutamate residue and a water molecule leading to a distorted pentacoordination geometry.</p>
<p class="indent">The structures of enzyme&#x2013;pseudosubstrate complexes have provided a model for the precatalytic interaction and a mechanistic proposal for the action of CPA is outlined in <a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">A peptide substrate bearing a terminal phenylalanine residue bound to the active site of CPA with the terminal phenyl group residing in the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme is depicted in <a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4a</a>. The amino acids Arg-145 and Tyr-248 are hydrogen-bonded to the terminal carboxylate of the substrate and Tyr-248 is also hydrogen-bonded to the amide-NH of the penultimate peptide bond. This interaction might provide a specificity towards substrates having such bonds available. The scissile carbonyl group is polarized by Arg-127 thus encouraging nucleophilic attack by the water molecule promoted by the zinc and assisted by Glu-270. This pathway has been termed a promoted-water reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4b</a> the tetrahedral organic intermediate is stabilized by interaction of the <i>gem</i>-diol to provide a pentacoordinate zinc. The intermediate can collapse to the product complex <a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4c</a> via proton donation from Glu-270 prior to product release which may be facilitated by unfavourable steric interactions between Glu-270 and the product carboxylate.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been proposed that this mechanistic sequence may be general to many other zinc proteases. It is not, however, absolute and an inner sphere mechanism involving loss of water and direct substrate attachment to zinc has been considered in the catalytic action of thermolysin. The enzymes HCA and CPA share a simple catalytic function in the attack of hydroxide at the substrate C&#x003D;O bond. The fate of the species formed differentiates between the class of enzyme, as in HCA the nucleophilic adduct is the product, whereas in CPA the nucleophilic adduct is an intermediate.<a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, More metalloenzymes</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>The structural role of zinc</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Zinc can play a structural role in certain proteins. Alcohol dehydrogenase has two zinc atoms present one of which provides an active site for the reaction RCH<sub>2</sub>OH &#x002B; NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2192; RCHO &#x002B; NADH &#x002B; H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (NAD is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) with the second zinc atom being tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulphur atoms from cysteine ligands and so being inaccessible to water; the zinc atom in aspartate transcarbamylase is similarly coordinated. The zinc atoms control local protein-folding and conformation, and in so doing can cross-link the protein chain possibly taking the place of a disulphide bridge. The zinc present in insulin is coordinated by three nitrogen atoms from histidines and three water molecules in an irregular octahedral environment which is believed to have a structural function.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The motif was conveniently called a zinc finger and is a module that can be used either singly, or in tandem, as was originally discovered in the <i>Xenopus</i> transcription factor IIIA, to recognize DNA (or RNA) sequences of different lengths. A general amino acid sequence pattern for zinc fingers is Cys-X<sub>2&#x2212;4</sub>-Cys-X<sub>12</sub>-His-X<sub>3&#x2212;5</sub>-His (X is an amino acid) and this can fold about the zinc giving a tetrahedral coordination via the cysteine and histidine donor atoms. Computer searches for related sequences has revealed potential zinc finger domains in several classes of proteins involved in nucleic acid recognition (<a href="#fig_6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>). Two other zinc-containing motifs have been established by three-dimensional NMR studies; both may be regarded as dinuclear. The motif found in the glucocortinoid receptor (GR) has two zinc atoms with an interatomic distance of 13&#x00C5;, each of which is coordinated tetrahedrally by four cysteines; this motif has been called a zinc twist. That present in the yeast transcription factor GAL4 has the two zinc atoms separated by 3.5&#x00C5; and there are six cysteine groups, two of which are shared<a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, More metalloenzymes</a>along a common tetrahedral edge; this has led to this motif being termed a zinc cluster.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Trinuclear zinc constellations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There is now a growing awareness of the involvement of trinuclear constellations of metal atoms at the active sites of biomolecules as structural information concerning these sites has been made available. The term <i>constellation</i> has been introduced by protein crystallographers to describe a cluster of closely spaced metal ions present in a metalloprotein or metalloenzyme. It is an appropriate analogy when one considers the heavy metal atoms standing out against a light atom background and thinks of the sky at night. It is preferred here to &#x2018;cluster&#x2019;, as cluster has acquired a particular meaning in chemistry. A cluster is defined as a group of two or more metal atoms in which there are substantial and direct bonds between the metal atoms as in species such as [Re<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>]<sup>3&#x2212;</sup> and Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">The first zinc enzyme to be discovered in which there are three metal atoms (two zinc and one magnesium, or in the absence of magnesium, a third zinc) at the active site was alkaline phosphatase (AP), which is a dimeric metalloenzyme having phosphomonoesterase activity. The X-ray crystal structure of AP complexed with inorganic phosphate (the E&#x2022;P complex) was determined by Harold Wyckoff and shows that the three metal atoms are in close proximity (<a href="#fig_6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>). The intermetallic separations are d(Zn<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;Zn<sub>2</sub>) &#x003D; 3.94&#x00C5;, d(Zn<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;Mg) &#x003D; 4.88&#x00C5;, and d(Zn<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;Mg) &#x003D; 7.09&#x00C5; in one subunit and 4.18, 4.66, and 7.08&#x00C5; respectively in the second subunit.</p>

<p class="indent">The first zinc atom (Zn<sub>1</sub>) is pentacoordinated and the coordination polyhedron at the metal is best described as pseudotetrahedral with both oxygen atoms of the chelating Asp-327 occupying one apex; the second zinc<a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, More metalloenzymes</a>atom (Zn<sub>2</sub>) is tetrahedrally coordinated and the zinc atoms are bridged by the inorganic phosphate. The carboxyl group of Asp-51 forms a bridge between Zn<sub>2</sub> and the magnesium atom, and the phosphate is also associated with the magnesium atom via one of the water molecules coordinated to that atom. The magnesium atom has a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly all three types of carboxylate-to-metal coordination are found at the trinuclear site. The unidentate mode of bonding is exhibited, for example, by Asp-369 (to Zn<sub>2</sub>), the bidentate mode is found with Asp-327 binding Znj and the bridging mode is found with asp-51 bridging Mg and Zn<sub>2</sub>. This phenomenon has also been noted in the structure of the non-haem diiron metalloenzyme ribonucleotide reductase.</p>
<p class="noindent">Related homotrinuclear zinc constellations have been found in the enzyme phospholipase C (<a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>) and the PI nuclease from <i>P&#x00E9;nicillium citrinium</i></p>

<p class="noindent">&#x2014;this nuclease is an endonuclease which hydrolyses single stranded ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. The active sites are closely similar and the dinuclear centre differs from that in AP as it is doubly bridged by a bidentate aspartate residue and by a molecule of water or the hydroxyl group.</p>
<p class="indent">The sites in phospholipase C and PI nuclease are all typical zinc sites built up from nitrogen and oxygen donors, whereas in AP only two sites are of this form. The third site is an all-oxygen donor site and so this may explain its preference for magnesium. The aspartate group bridging pattern (Fig. <b>6</b>.<b>8</b>) is also different as it bridges two zinc atoms and so defines a dinuclear zinc site in phospholipase C and PI nuclease but bridges magnesium and zinc in AP in which the two non-bridged zincs are sufficiently close to provide a functional dinuclear pair bridged by the phosphate.<a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, More metalloenzymes</a></p>

<p class="indent">A mechanistic proposal for phosphomonoesterase activity has been presented which suggests that it functions through a phosphoseryl intermediate to produce free inorganic phosphate, or to transfer the phosphoryl group to other alcohols (<a href="#fig_6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>).The left-hand side of the scheme shows the formation of a phosphoseryl intermediate (E&#x2013;P) and the right-hand side shows the hydrolysis of it to release inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>).</p>

<p class="indent">The pathway shown in <a href="#fig_6.10">Fig. 6.10</a> has been advanced as plausible for reaction at the dinuclear centre of AP. The dianion of the phosphomonoester (R<sub>1</sub>OP) forms E-ROP with the ester oxygen coordinating to Zn<sub>1</sub> a second phosphate oxygen coordinates to Zn<sub>2</sub> and the remaining phosphate oxygens are hydrogen-bonded to the guanidinium group of Arg-166. Ser-102 then acts as a nucleophile and occupies a position opposite to the RO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> leaving group in a five-coordinate intermediate. Upon formation of E&#x2013;P a water molecule can coordinate to Zn<sub>1</sub> in the position vacated by RO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>; at alkaline pH this water loses a proton to give Zn&#x2013;OH which acts as a nucleophile for the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl ester. The E&#x00B7;P complex forms and this is followed by dissociation of the phosphate from this complex.</p>
<p class="indent">The two metal atoms therefore activate the oxygens of the water and Ser- 102, and also stabilize the appropriate leaving groups. Although the magnesium site does not appear to play any direct role in the catalysis steps it is known that its presence does enhance the catalytic ability of the enzyme. It may therefore be that the magnesium plays a structural role by moderating the necessary environment for catalytic activity through the hydrogen-bonded network associated with the magnesium-coordinated water molecules.<a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, More metalloenzymes</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The biomethylation of mercury</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The toxic effects of mercury have been long known. The Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> illustrates the nervous disorder produced by exposure to mercury salts in the curing of the pelts from which hats were made. Organomercurials such as methylmercury are more dangerous than mercury metal or inorganic mercury salts as they have longer half-lives to accumulation in the body&#x2014;70 days for methylmercury as compared with six days for inorganic mercury&#x2014;and so can reach 10 times the level of inorganic mercury after nine months. This means that even the most protected areas of the body such as the brain and, during pregnancy, the foetus become vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p class="indent">There have been major instances of mercury poisoning. In Minimata, Japan, in 1953, 52 people died after eating sea-food contaminated with mercury, and in 1971&#x2013;72 in Iraq, hundreds of people died and thousands more were seriously affected by eating bread made from a relief shipment of grain that had been dressed with an organomercurial fungicide. In Sweden, effects have been noted as a consequence of mercury-containing effluent from paper mills.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1964 Jack Halpern reported methyl transfer to mercury(II) species from pentacyanomethyl cobaltate and suggested that there was a similarity between this reaction and B<sub>12</sub> activity. In 1968 John Wood demonstrated enzymic transfer to mercury(II) from methylcobalamin and so the link had<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, More metalloenzymes</a>been made. Naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria in the sediments of the sea, rivers, and lakes can alkylate mercury which is then taken up by plankton and so enters into the food chain with progressive concentration.</p>

<p class="indent">The overall mechanism of the reaction is shown in <a href="#fig_6.14">Fig. 6.14</a> and, as a carbanion is most likely to react with a positively charged metal, CH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is the electrophilic transfer agent. It is possible that the reaction proceeds via a fast stage in which the apical base reacts with mercury and is displaced from the cobalt, followed by alkyl transfer and release of the organomercurial accompanied by generation of B<sub>12<i>a</i></sub>. It is now known that other metals such as tin, lead, thallium, and palladium can also be methylated by methylcobalamin.</p>
<p class="indent">Once mercury is in the body, methyl mercury chloride is synthesized in the gut; the relatively non-polar methyl mercury is lipid-soluble and so is easily transported across biomembranes into the blood stream. It then reaches the brain and central nervous system where it has a devastating effect. It has been speculated that this occurs because of the solubility of methyl mercury in phospholipids which enables lysis of certain cell membranes and hence cell breakdown. The proposal is enhanced by the observation from NMR studies on the interaction of methylmercury chloride with plasmalogens, phospholipids which contain an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ether linkage, which are important in membrane structure of cells of the central nervous system; exposure to the mercurial caused hydration and hydrolytic cleavage of the plasmalogen (<a href="#fig_6.15">Figure 6.15</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">It is amusing to think that while man labours to reduce dinitrogen to ammonia using an energetically expensive process requiring high temperature, pressure, and a promoted iron catalyst, nature, can fix two to three times as much dinitrogen each year. Nature uses a wide range of bacteria in nitrogen fixation, the best known of which is <i>Rhizobium</i>, found in nodules in the roots of legumes such as peas, beans, clover, and soya.</p>
<aside class="abcd" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-6.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The direct combination of N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> using a promoted iron catalyst is called the Haber process. It requires a high temperature (&#x007E;450&#x00B0;C) to overcome the kinetic inertness of N<sub>2</sub> and a high pressure (&#x007E;270 atm) to overcome the thermodynamic effect of an unfavourable equilibrium constant at 450&#x00B0;C. A promoted iron catalyst consists of iron with small amounts of oxides such as MgO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or SiO<sub>2</sub>. Two Nobel Prizes are associated with this process. In 1918 Fritz Haber received the award for Chemistry for his development of the process and in 1931 Carl Bosch was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for overcoming the chemical engineering problems associated with the use of large-scale high- pressure techniques.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Nitrogen fixation is one of nature&#x2019;s fundamental processes and is catalysed by nitrogenases. The Fe&#x2013;Mo nitrogenases are those that have been most studied and it has been traditionally believed, although the evidence was circumstantial, that reduction of dinitrogen took place at the molybdenum site. It is now known that there are Fe&#x2013;V and Fe&#x2013;Fe nitrogenases. The discovery of the former showed that the purported role of the molybdenum might also be carried out by other metals and the isolation of the latter clearly indicated that it was not actually necessary to have different metals present in the enzyme in order to effect fixation.</p>

The electrons are first transferred to the Fe protein, the reduced form of which forms a complex with monomagnesium<a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, More metalloenzymes</a>ATP and the FeMo protein. The reducing electron is then transferred to the FeMo protein thence to the dinitrogen and in a series of steps accompanied by proton transfer from water to the dinitrogen produces ammonia, monomagnesium ADP, and inorganic phosphate; the proteins are regenerated in their original states. Although it has been suggested that the energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP drives the reaction, the exact role of the magnesium ATP is not yet fully understood.</p>

<p class="indent">The architecture of the FeMo protein has posed a major chemical challenge. Extrusion experiments revealed that the FeS centres contain [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] clusters but the spectroscopic properties of these clusters were so different from those of known [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] clusters that the clusters were termed &#x2018;unusual P clusters&#x2019;. Numerous speculative small molecule models derived from iron-sulphur clusters in which an atom of iron had been replaced by a molybdenum, were constructed to mimic the anticipated structural features of the Fe&#x2013;Mo site but none of them have shown any reactivity towards dinitrogen (<a href="#fig_6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>). It is interesting at this point to note a recent comment that rich veins of metal-dinitrogen and metal-chalcogenide chemistry have been laid down by synthetic chemists in trying to obtain the answer to the structure of the nitrogenase cluster, and to remember that for many generations dinitrogen was regarded as chemically inert.</p>
<p class="indent">The solution of the X-ray crystal structure of the Fe&#x2013;Mo protein from <i>A. vinelandii</i>, by Douglas Rees and his group, shows that the two Fe&#x2013;Mo cofactors are located some 70 &#x00C5; apart with the &#x2018;P clusters&#x2019; 19&#x00C5; from them. The structures of the Fe&#x2013;Mo cofactor and the &#x2018;P cluster&#x2019; pair are shown in <a href="#fig_6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>. The Fe&#x2013;Mo cofactor consists of cuboidal [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub>] and [Fe<sub>3</sub>MoS<sub>3</sub>] fragments which are linked by two sulphide bridges and a third bridge which might derive from an O or N donor. The cluster is bound to the protein via a cysteine at Fe(l) and a histidine at the Mo. The coordination sphere of the six-coordinate molybdenum, which is probably in oxidation state &#x002B;IV, is completed by the homocitrate anion. The cluster differs from all of the small molecule models that have been proposed, particularly in the threefold linkage of the two cuboidal fragments. The &#x2018;P cluster&#x2019; pair contains [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] units linked by two bridging cysteine thiolate groups, together with a disulphide bridge formed between sulphur atoms from each [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] cubane cluster.</p>

<p class="indent">The oxotransfer molybdoenzymes also have present dissociable cofactors which are obligatory for enzyme action. These cofactors are small molecules containing molybdenum which can be released from one protein and then introduced into a second apo-protein structure to form an active enzyme. For example there is a nitrate reductase mutant, Nit-1, from the fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i> which contains all of the components shown in the above table but has no Mo and no Mo-cofactor. If the Mo-cofactor from another oxotransfer enzyme is introduced into Nit-1 then this produces the intact and active nitrate reductase. The cofactor has been shown to include a novel pterin, the properties of which depends on the nature of the side chain. The proposed structure for the molybdopterin (<b>6.5</b>) suggests that the molybdenum is bound to the chelating dithiolene function.</p>

It is also quite ironic that the first enzyme to be crystallized, by James B.

EXAFS studies are consistent with this assignment and the enzyme has been found to contain two nickel ions which have been postulated to act cooperatively. Each has a different role in the mechanism of reaction with one serving to polarize the urea and the second enhancing the nucleophilicity of water so that the hydroxide formed can attack the polarized carbonyl of the urea (<a href="#fig_6.23">Fig. 6.23</a>). The reaction is analogous to that of peptide hydrolysis using the zinc metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, More metalloenzymes</a>All known hydrogenases contain Fe&#x2013;S clusters and many, but not all, have now been found to contain nickel as well. EPR studies on <i>Desulphovibrio vulgaris</i> and methanogenic bacteria have given signals which are attributed to the unusual nickel(III) oxidation state (low spin, <i>d</i><sup>7</sup>); furthermore the ease of obtaining nickel(III) suggests that the coordination geometry might be octahedrally based. The type of ligand coordination which leads to this state is not yet fully established but X-ray absorption studies on the hydrogenase isolated from the bacterium <i>Thiocapsa roseopersoicina</i> suggest that the coordination sphere of the metal comprizes 3(&#x00B1;1) nitrogen or oxygen donors and 2(&#x00B1;1) sulphur donors. If the nickel is the catalytic site for the oxidation of dihydrogen then the Fe&#x2013;S clusters will serve as one-electron oxidants for the nickel.</p>

The Fe&#x2013;S clusters are derived from 4Fe&#x2013;4S&#x002A; clusters and are oxidized by carbon dioxide and reduced by carbon monoxide. It is quite possible that a heteronuclear cluster containing three iron atoms and one nickel atom may be present with the cluster being constructed from a voided 3Fe&#x2013;4S&#x002A; cube to which a nickel atom has added.<a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, More metalloenzymes</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Coenzyme F<sub>430</sub></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Coenzyme F<sub>430</sub> is the cofactor of methylcoenzyme M reductase, which is involved in a complex series of reactions in bacteria leading to the generation of methane gas. It has been identified, by Albert Eschenmoser and his coworkers, as a square planar nickel(II) complex of a tetrahydroderivative of a porphyrinoid related to corrin and hence described as a corphin (<a href="#fig_6.24">Fig. 6.24</a>). It is required to catalyse the reduction of the methyl group of methylcoenzyme M , 2-(methylthio)ethanesulphonate), to methane.</p>

<p class="noindent">The exact role of the metal is not yet defined but the accessibility of Ni(I) as shown by EPR experiments suggests that it might be involved in methyl-group transfer, electron-transfer reactions, or both.</p>
