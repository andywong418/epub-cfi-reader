<p class="noindent">After the uptake of a metal into an organism from the environment, the metal must be transported to the site where it is to be incorporated for use. Devices for storing excess metals until there is a requirement for use are also necessary. The storage and transport of iron is now quite well understood, but for other metals there is a paucity of detailed information.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Ferritin</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The storage of iron in a non-toxic form is a necessary feature of metabolism as iron is required for the production of functional molecules such as Fe&#x2013;S and haem proteins. Free, unbound iron is extremely toxic as it can catalyse free radical formation and so cause significant cellular damage. In man the iron storage system must be able to respond to &#x2018;supply and demand&#x2019; as the amount of iron in the diet is variable. If iron is in excess then it must be stored but if iron is lost from the body then the store must be mobilized and replenish this loss.</p>

<p class="indent">The storage reservoir for iron is ferritin which is widely distributed in various organs of mammals, particularly in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and is also present in plants and bacteria. Ferritin consists of a large hollow protein encasing a mineral core of hydrated iron(III) oxide, a &#x2018;particle of rust&#x2019;. A crude analogy is an iron tablet of the type prescribed for iron deficiency which is &#x2018;sugar coated&#x2019; to make it palatable and to allow slow release of the iron. The diameter of the core is some 80A and contains up to 4500 Fe(III) atoms. The composition of the microcrystalline core is (FeOOH)<sub>8</sub>(FeOH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and the X-ray diffraction of the core is similar to that of ferrihydrate, 5Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x0387;9H<sub>2</sub>O. An EXAFS study suggests that the structure is based on a close-packed array of oxide and hydroxide anions with iron atoms occupying octahedral interstices. The phosphate appears to act in a terminal role perhaps by covering the (FeOOH) particles and anchoring them to the protein shell (<a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>).<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Metal Management</a></p>
<div class="box" style="width:67%;">
<p class="noindentbox">Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy has proved to be a very useful complementary technique to X-ray crystallography for the elucidation of the structures of metallobiosites. This is because it does not require a crystalline sample. Synchrotron radiation is used to excite a core electron of the metal at the biosite to the ionization continuum. At the metal K absorption edge one observes a series of peaks, due to the transition of the 1s electron into molecular orbitals having mainly transition metal character, superimposed on a steeply rising absorption due to transition of the 1s electron into continuum levels. The shape of the edge and the positioning of the edge features can give information about the coordination environment of the metal. Mathematical analysis and comparisons with the spectra of complexes of known coordination environment yields information about the number and nature of the donor atoms at the site. The technique differentiates between first- and second-row donors but not between first-row donors, and it does not give angular information. The accuracy is less than that of X-ray crystallography&#x2014;bond lengths can be determined to &#x00B1; 0.02&#x00C5;.</p>

<p class="indent">The protein sheath of the core free apoferritin has been shown by Pauline Harrison and her research group, using X-ray crystallography, to consist of 24 subunits, each of which is a polypeptide chain coiled in a lozenge-like shape (<a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). There are two different polypeptide chains termed H- and L-; the former predominates in heart and brain ferritins, with liver and spleen ferritins being L-rich.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Biomineralization is the process by which substances such as shells, skeletons, and teeth are built. The fascination of ferritin is that the protein provides a framework within which the biomineralization process occurs as the iron is deposited giving a relatively inert material which provides a storage reservoir.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanisms by which the iron core is formed and the iron leaves ferritin are still not well understood. What is remarkable is that the core can only be formed from aqueous iron(II) and that oxidation to iron(III) follows incorporation. It has been proposed that the iron gets into the core through channels in the protein and then is transferred into the cavity to form first diiron-oxo dimers and then aggregates and clusters are formed via a progression of oligomers related to iron hydrolysates. An iron(III)- tyrosinate complex has been identified in ferritin by UV and resonance Raman spectroscopy and the proposal has been made that this may be a transient precursor to polynuclear cluster formation.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Haemosiderin</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Iron is also stored in a number of mammalian organs as haemosiderin which contains larger amounts of &#x2018;iron hydroxide&#x2019; than ferritin. Its constitution is variable and it is thought that haemosiderin may be a degradation product of ferritin. Haemosiderin with iron cores similar to the ferrihydrite cores of ferritin has been identified in haemosiderins isolated from alcoholic livers and from livers with naturally occurring, or induced, iron overloads.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Synthetic iron&#x2013;oxo aggregates</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">By controlling the extent of hydrolysis of iron(III) a variety of oxo- and hydroxobridged oligomers related to the polynuclear iron-oxo units found in biological systems have been prepared. Investigations by Stephen Lippard and his research group into the &#x2018;bioinorganic chemistry of rust&#x2019; have assisted in our attempts to understand the mechanisms of the assembly of high<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Metal Management</a>nuclearity iron&#x2013;oxo clusters. Using [Et<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>2</sub>[Fe<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>6</sub>] and [Et<sub>4</sub>N][FeCl<sub>4</sub>] as building blocks, tri- and tetranuclear aggregates were synthesized and a much higher aggregate, [Fe<sub>11</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CPh)<sub>15</sub>], was formed when an acetonitrile solution of [Et<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>2</sub>[Fe<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>6</sub>] and sodium benzoate was slowly crystallized. The elegant simplicity of this remarkable complex is explained in <a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. The eleven iron atoms, which are found at the vertices of a distorted, pentacapped trigonal prism with threefold symmetry, are stacked 1:3:3:3:1 along the three-fold axis. Six triply bridging oxygen atoms connect the iron atoms leading to eighteen short Fe-O bonds and six pyramidal triply bridging oxygen atoms further link the iron atoms in layers, giving rise to eighteen Fe-OH bonds. The structure is completed by fifteen bridging benzoate groups giving a further thirty Fe-O bonds and each of the eleven iron atoms has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The extent to which the synthetic core structures resemble that in ferritin is not yet established.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Iron transport</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Under physiological conditions the thermodynamically stable form of iron is iron(III). Hydrated and uncomplexed iron(III) ions are readily hydrolysed to form insoluble iron hydroxide aggregates and so nature has evolved sophisticated transport systems to complex iron and keep it soluble. To obtain the iron that they need to survive, microbial cells synthesize low molecular weight phenolate and hydroxamate compounds called siderophores; in higher animals the transferrins fulfil this function.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Transferrins</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Serum transferrin (the iron transport protein), lactoferrin (present in milk), and ovotransferrin, or conalbumin, (found in egg white) are monomeric glycoproteins having M<sub>r</sub> &#x007E; 80,000 which bind two iron atoms tightly, but reversibly, as iron(III) with binding constants in excess of 10<sup>20</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>. An interesting feature is that there is a requirement for anion binding to the metal with carbonate being the highest affinity anion and there is a charge transfer ascribable to phenolate ligands to iron which accounts for their salmon pink colour.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_2.4">
 <img src="../images/f0013-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="figurecaptionc"><b>Fig. 2.4.</b> (a) Schematic drawing of the iron and anion binding sites in human lactoferrin; (b) polypeptide chain folding in each lobe of human lactoferrin&#x2014;the possible hinge point is arrowed (reproduced with permission from <i>Pure and Applied Chemistry</i>).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The iron site in human lactoferrin has been defined by X-ray crystallography (Edward Baker and co-workers). It consists of an iron atom coordinated to four residues from the protein, two tyrosines, one aspartate, and one histidine. A bidentate carbonate anion occupies the remaining two sites of the distorted octahedral environment. The anion sits in a pocket between the iron atom and two positively charged protein groups, an arginine side chain, and a helix N-terminal (<a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4a</a>). The iron site in rabbit serum transferrin has been shown to be closely similar to the above. There is a preference for carbonate as the synergistic anion but other carboxylates can also bind at this site.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Metal Management</a><span class="space_p" style="margin-left:1em;">&#160;</span>The iron is buried in a deep cleft between two protein domains and there are two polypeptide strands running behind it. A flexing of these strands leading to an open conformation is envisaged as providing a mechanism for releasing the iron. It is thought that in order to incorporate the iron it binds first to the domain at which the carbonate is bound and then the second domain folds on top (<a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4b</a>). The role of the carbonate is a puzzle but it is possible that it helps in the organization of the cleft by binding there in advance of the iron.</p>
<p class="indent">When microbes invade living tissue, a battle ensues between host and invader for the available iron. If the host iron levels are higher than normal, this causes the host to have an exceptional susceptibility to bacteria and fungi and so the function of the transferrin is to protect the host by denying iron to the invaders. For example, lactoferrin is a potent antibacterial transferrin and acts to protect breast-fed infants against certain infectious disease. One physiological function of fever might be to suppress the synthesis of bacteriological siderophores as it has been observed that siderophore synthesis is sharply reduced at temperatures above 37&#x00B0;C.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Siderophores</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Aerobic bacteria use siderophores to make soluble and transport iron as iron(III). These are low molecular weight compounds with remarkably high affinities for the metal (<i>K</i><sub>F</sub> &#x007E; l0<sup>30&#x2013;50</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>)&#x00B7; They fall into two general categories, representative examples of which are depicted in <a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>, one having hydroxamate ligands (ferrichromes, ferrioxamines) (<b>2</b>.<b>1</b>) and the other having catecholate ligands (enterobactin) (<b>2</b>.<b>2</b>) and the iron atom is octahedrally bound in either linear or cyclic molecules. There are also variations on these binding themes with mixed ligand sites, for example mycobactin has two hydroxamate ligands and one phenolate ligand, and aerobactin contains hydroxamate and citrate sites. Each category can be seen to have a &#x2018;hard&#x2019; acid to &#x2018;hard&#x2019; base pairing.</p>
<p class="indent">Tris-chelated octahedral complexes can provide optical isomers and so the siderophores can be chiral. For example, molecular models of ferrioxamine B (R &#x003D; H, <i>n</i> &#x003D; 5, R&#x2019; &#x003D; CH<sub>3</sub>) show that there are five possible isomers for each of the absolute configurations &#x0394;- and &#x039B;- available to the complex. The A-form follows the movement of a left-handed propeller (counter-clockwise) when viewed along the <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> axis of the octahedron and for the A-form the movement is right-handed (clockwise). The isomers may be drawn according to the following convention that in each chelate ring if the C atom is below the N atom then it is called <i>C</i>, and rings 2 and 3 are called <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> depending upon which has the same or opposite orientation to the <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> axis as ring 1. The five A-isomers are shown in <a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The ferrichromes, ferrioxamines, and aerobactin are left-handed with &#x039B;<i>-cis</i> configurations; enterobactin and rhodotorulic acid are right-handed with &#x0394;<i>-cis</i> configurations. Iron(III) complexes, having the metal present in high-spin d<sup><b>5</b></sup> electronic configuration, have no crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) and so are kinetically labile to isomerization and ligand exchange in aqueous solution. By exchanging the iron for chromium(III) which has the same charge, is d<sup>3</sup>, and has a significant CFSE, kinetically inert<a id="page_15" class="page">Page15, Metal Management</a>analogues with well characterized d-d transitions can be obtained and studied spectroscopically. By comparing the optical (UV-visible) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of simple tris-hydroxamate and tris- catecholate chromium(III) complexes with those for the chromium- substituted siderophores the absolute configurations of the siderophores can be established.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The K<sub>F</sub> values cannot readily be compared as they have been measured at different pH values.

<p class="indent">Vanadium(IV) is slightly smaller than iron(III) and can replace the iron in the enterobactin. The reaction of VO(acetylacetonate<b>)</b><sub>2</sub> with protonated enterobactin (H<sub>6</sub>&#x2013;ent) in the presence of KOH leads to the displacement of the vanadyl oxygen atom and the formation of [V(ent)]<sup>2</sup>&#x2019;.The crystal structure (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>) shows the incorporation of vanadium(IV) and that the enterobactin has a A-conformation. The average bond lengths (V&#x2013;OIA, 1.946&#x00C5;, and V&#x2013;O2A, 1.939&#x00C5;) are essentially the same showing that the binding units are perfectly placed above the serine-derived ring to allow metal coordination. This feature, together with hydrogen bonding between the amidic protons on (N1A) and the catecholic oxygen atoms (O1A), is believed to play a key role in the metal-enterobactin binding and hence in the natural iron(III) complex.</p>

<p class="indent">Ligand exchange in the chromium(III) complexes is slow and so they can be used as probes for the mechanism of iron transport. Three different<a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Metal Management</a>types of mechanism have been proposed for siderophore activity (<a href="#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>). In the first, the &#x2018;European&#x2019; route, the siderophore (ferrichrome) transports the metal across the cell membrane to the cell interior where it is released by a non-destructive process and so the ligand is available for reuse. The second is the &#x2018;Taxi&#x2019;, where the siderophore (ferrioxamine) delivers the metal to the outer cell membrane surface where it is transferred to a secondary transport device which carries it to the cell interior where it is released. The third mechanism is called, somewhat with tongue in cheek, the &#x2018;American&#x2019; because, the metal is transported across the cell membrane by the sidero-phore (enterobactin) to the cell interior where the complex is broken up, by a hydrolase, so destroying the ligand and giving an example of &#x2018;built-in obsolescence&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="indent">Many synthetic analogues of particularly the catecholato-siderophores have been prepared (<a href="#fig_2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>), in particular by Kenneth Raymond and his coworkers. This research has been driven both by a need to understand the nature of the catecholate site and by the need to find a chelating device which specifically scavenges iron from the body in cases of iron overload. Iron overload is common in people suffering from the genetic blood disorder &#x03B2;- thalassaemia, also known as Cooley&#x2019;s anaemia, a type of anaemia that prevents the manufacture of haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying blood protein. It is treated by regular blood transfusions but this has severe side-effects including the accumulation of excess iron causing diabetes, tissue damage, and eventually death.</p>
<p class="indent">The siderophore desferrioxamine B (that is the metal-free siderophore) has been used effectively but it causes allergic responses in some patients and can only be used in injections as it is poorly absorbed in the gut.

<p class="noindent">Mammalian metallothioneins are small (&#x007E;61 amino acids) cysteine-rich (&#x007E;30%) proteins which can bind seven essential, copper(I) and zinc(II), or non-essential, toxic, cadmium(II) and mercury(II), metals per polypeptide. The biological role is not clear but it is likely that they are involved in metal metabolism&#x2014;metal storage and transfer, and the detoxification of toxic metals. The metallothionein from the fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i> appears to play a role in the copper metabolism of the fungus.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of NMR spectroscopy as a technique for determining protein structure has developed rapidly and has seen application in the study of the structures of metallothioneins. Two-dimensional [<sup>113</sup>Cd-<sup>1</sup>H] NMR studies of [Cd<sub>7</sub>]-metallothioneins in solution, by Kurt Wtithrich and his co-workers, have led to the determination of three-dimensional structures for the metallothioneins from rat liver, rabbit liver, and human liver. All three proteins adopt a similar conformation in solution, and there are two distinct metal clusters present. The seven Cd atoms are bound in clusters of three and four metal atoms held together by terminal and bridging cysteine residues.</p>
<p class="indent">The crystal structure of the [Cd<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>]-metallothionein from rat liver was solved by David Stout and his research collaborators and confirms the predictions from NMR showing the presence of a [Zn<sub>2</sub>Cd]-cluster and a [Cd<sub>4</sub>]-cluster (<a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>).

<p class="noindent">A class of tunicates, called ascidians (sea squirts), have cellular vanadium contents with concentrations of more than one-million-fold over that of the sea-water in which they live. In ascidians the vanadium is stored in the vacuoles of the blood cells, which are referred to as vanadocytes, as vanadium(III). The vanadium is captured from the sea-water as vanadate and is incorporated in the vacuoles through the phosphate channel taking advantage of the similarity between vanadate (V<b>O</b><sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and phosphate (P<b>O</b><sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>)&#x00B7; Inside the vacuole the vanadium is reduced to the cationic forms V<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and VO<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. It was thought for a long time that the vanadium was responsible for<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Metal Management</a>dioxygen carriage, hence the term haemovanadin, and that the pH of the blood was about 1 due to the presence of sulphuric acid. Both of these statements are now believed to be unfounded; the true function of the vanadium is as yet unknown but one possibility is that it could act as a sink for protons and electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">Vanadium is extracted from the soil and accumulated by the <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, or fly agaric, mushroom as a low molecular weight complex known as amavadin. It can be concentrated by up to 400ppm against background levels of less than O.lppm. Ernst Bayer identified the ligand involved as 2,2&#x2019;-(hydroxyimino)dipropionic acid [HIPDAH<sub>3</sub>] by use of degradative organic techniques and it was found to form a <b>2:1</b> complex with the metal. Bayer was later able to achieve the total synthesis of this compound. The vanadium was shown by EPR to be present as vanadium(IV) and it was initially assumed that this was as the vanadyl centre, V<sup>IV</sup>O. It was also postulated that amavanadin may be involved in electron transfer processes as it can be reversibly oxidised from vanadium(IV) to vanadium(V).</p>

<p class="indent">David Gamer and his colleagues have now synthesized and characterized [&#x0394;-V(<i>S</i>,<i>S</i>)-HIDPA)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and established via X-ray and spectroscopic techniques that the oxidized form of amavadin consists of an approximately equal mixture of the &#x0394;- and &#x039B;- forms of this anion. The crystal structure of the anion shows an octacoordinated vanadium(V) atom with each ligand providing two unidentate carboxylato groups and one unusual &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-N,O bridging interaction (<a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>). The structure persists in solution and is common to the V<sup>IV</sup>/V<sup>V</sup> reduction&#x2013;oxidation pair. This feature of the retention of structure throughout a one-electron change is also found at the metal centres in blue copper proteins, cytochromes, and iron&#x2013;sulphur proteins.</p>
