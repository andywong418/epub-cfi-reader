<p class="noindent">Electron-transfer reactions are central to many of the metabolic processes necessary for the survival of all organisms. Such reactions depend upon the approach of an electron donor and electron acceptor and are classified into two types:</p>

<p class="noindent2">Henry Taube was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1983 for his research into the mechanisms of electron-transfer reactions of metal complexes and Rudolph Marcus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1992 for his theoretical work on electron transfer between molecules.</p>

<ul><li class="listbulleted"><i>inner-sphere electron transfer</i> in which the coordination spheres of the reactants share a ligand transitorily and so form a bridged intermediate;</li>
<li class="listbulleted"><i>outer-sphere electron transfer</i> in which the coordination spheres of the reactants remain intact.</li></ul>
<p class="noindent">In biology it is the latter process which is most often used and biological electron transfers have been divided into two categories:</p>
<ul><li class="listbulleted"><i>intramolecular electron transfer</i>, which occurs at fixed sites within a single protein;</li>
<li class="listbulleted"><i>intermolecular electron transfer</i>, which occurs between sites on different proteins.</li></ul>
<p class="indent">The latter process leads to electron-transfer chains which function as a series of consecutive electron-transfer reactions between pairs of proteins. Typically electrons are transferred between metal sites that are arranged within a protein, or complex of proteins, such that the electron might need to traverse distances of up to 30 &#x00C5; via the intervening peptide units.</p>

<p class="noindent">The copper(II) atoms present at copper-containing biosites have been classified according to their spectroscopic properties: Type I, or blue, has an intense absorption in the visible region (&#x03B5; &#x003E; 3000M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 600nm) arising from S(cysteine) &#x2192; Cu(II) charge-transfer and an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum with an unusually narrow hyperfine splitting (A<sub>&#x007C;&#x007C;</sub> &#x003C; 0.95 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) due to an asymmetric environment at the metal; Type II, or normal, has limited absorption and an EPR spectrum typical of small<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Electron transfer</a>molecule copper(II) complexes(<i>A</i>&#x007C;&#x007C; &#x003E; 140 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>); Type III, which has a strong absorption in the near UV region (&#x03B3;<sub>max</sub> &#x003D; 330nm) and no EPR signal, is believed to consist of a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled copper(II) ions.</p>
<p class="indent">The blue copper proteins of which plastocyanin, found in higher plants and green algae, and azurin, found in denitrifying bacteria, serve as representative examples are involved in electron-transfer processes. Plastocyanin is involved in electron transfer between Photosystems I and II in the photosynthetic chain, and azurin in respiratory chains where the role is to transfer electrons between cytochrome c<sub>551</sub> and cytochrome oxidase.</p>

<p class="indent">Electron transfer proceeds via transition state structures which are intermediate between those of the reactant and product and, as indicated by the Franck-Condon principle, does not occur until the metal centre is vibrationally excited to a geometry appropriate for that of the product complex in the redox reaction. This can generally be accomplished by a simple adjustment in the bond lengths but for copper it can be more complicated as copper(I) and copper(II) have different preferred geometries&#x2014; tetrahedral and tetragonal respectively. Any interchange between these would be energetically demanding and so the availability of an intermediate geometry leading to a low reorganization energy is desirable.</p>
<p class="indent">Solution of the crystal structures of plastocyanin (Hans Freeman) and azurin in both oxidation states (Edward Baker) (<a href="#fig_4.1">Fig 4.1</a>) has revealed that minimal structural change occurs on reduction of copper(II) to copper(I) (<a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>) thus supporting the view that the protein structure is providing a copper site optimized for fast electron transfer. For example, in the azurin structures there is a slight expansion of the copper site on reduction which parallels the expected increase in copper atom radius; the principal copper ligands (S and N) are a compromise between those favoured by copper(I) and copper(II) and the trigonal coordination geometry, with weakly bound axial groups, is intermediate between geometries that might be favoured by copper(I) (trigonal planar) and copper(II) (trigonal bipyramidal). In plastocyanin a distorted tetrahedral geometry with an unusually long copper- methionine interaction is found for each oxidation state.</p>

These enzymes catalyse the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water with an accompanying one-electron oxidation of the reducing substrate. Cumulative spectroscopic and azide binding studies on laccase from the oriental lacquer tree, <i>Rhus vernicifera</i>, led Edward Solomon to propose that<a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Electron transfer</a>the Type II and Type III centres defined a trinuclear copper cluster (<a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>). The long absence of crystallographic information concerning this type of site was redressed with the solution of the structure of oxidized ascorbate oxidase, from green zucchini squash, by Albrecht Messerschmidt and coworkers, which confirmed the presence of all three types of copper binding site&#x2014;one Type I, one Type II, and a Type III pair.</p>

This pair together with the Type II copper atom form a triangular array of copper atoms (<a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). The role of the Type I copper is to receive electrons from ascorbate and to transfer them to the triangular array which is the site of dioxygen interaction. Dioxygen binding within the triangular site would allow close interaction and rapid electron transfer to occur from all three copper atoms. Any negative charge which developed at the dioxygen, or oxygen intermediates, would be balanced by the metal ions and the protein so protected from oxygen radicals.<a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Electron transfer</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Iron&#x2013;sulphur (Fe&#x2013;S) proteins are non-haem proteins which are found in all living organisms where they are involved in a wide range of electron-transfer processes. They are also involved in important oxidation-reduction processes such as nitrogen fixation and electron transfer in mitochondria. The iron in these proteins is uniquely bound by sulphur atoms, either from cysteinyl residues present in the protein or by inorganic sulphide. Crystallographic studies have shown that the Fe&#x2013;S proteins fall into a number of structural types depending upon the numbers of iron and inorganic sulphur atoms present and can be generally designated as [<i>n</i>Fe&#x2013;<i>m</i>S&#x002A;] where S&#x002A; represents sulphide.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The modelling of Fe&#x2013;S clusters, in particular by Richard Holm and his research group, opened up a new area of inorganic chemistry. Until the early 1970s the only such cluster that had been prepared, [&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-Cp]<sub>4</sub>Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-Cp is the pentahaptocyclopentadienyl anion), came from organometallic chemistry and was regarded as a laboratory curiosity. During the 1970s an elegant series of experiments established the synthetic technology required to prepare corroborative models for the Fe&#x2013;S clusters (<a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>). In the case of the<a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Electron transfer</a>2Fe&#x2013;2S&#x002A; clusters the structure for the biosite was anticipated from the structure of the synthetic analogue. In these models thiolate ligands mimic the cysteinyl residues and a range of clusters have now been reported in which glycylcysteinyl oligopeptides are the terminal ligands. Water-soluble clusters such as [Fe<sub>4</sub>S&#x002A;<sub>4</sub>(SCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>6&#x2212;</sup> are also known. At this point, however, there is no model for the 3Fe&#x2013;3S&#x002A; cluster. Electrochemical studies on the model systems have established the electron-transfer processes available and reinforce the studies on the natural systems. For example, in the 2Fe&#x2013;2S&#x002A; case the above sequence can be detected but nature chooses only to operate at the right-hand end of the series. The facile thiol exchange reactions at the labile tetrahedral iron centres, depicted in <a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a> with the conversion of [Fe<sub>2</sub>S&#x002A;<sub>2</sub>(S<sub>2</sub><b>-</b><i>o</i>-xyl)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>to [Fe<sub>2</sub>S&#x002A;<sub>2</sub>(SR)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, offers the possibility of both the reconstitution of apoproteins and of the extrusion of intact Fe&#x2013;S clusters from metalloproteins. In the latter case judicious choice of thiol can be made to introduce spectroscopic probes, for example, <i>p</i>-CF<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-SH as an <sup>19</sup>FNMR probe. The technique of core extrusion has proved to be a valuable tool in the study of Fe&#x2013;S and related clusters.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Cytochromes</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Cytochromes are haem proteins which act as one-electron carriers by shuttling between iron(II) and iron(III) at their active site. They are found in all forms of aerobic life and are present, for example, in plant chloroplasts where they participate in photosynthesis and in mitochondria where they take part in the reverse process of respiration.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-6.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In 1930 Keilin realized that the cytochromes consisted of three spectroscopically different components which he designated a, b, and c depending on the position of their absorption maxima. Cytochrome a absorbs at 580&#x2013;590nm (lowest energy); then cytochrome b at 550&#x2013;560nm and cytochrome cat 548&#x2013;552nm (highest energy).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">More than fifty cytochromes have been characterized. Their classification is complex because they differ from one organism to the next, and even from one type of cell to another in the same species. A cytochrome can be tailored to meet the needs of the electron-transfer scheme in which it is involved by variation in the ligands present and of the operating redox potential. Nevertheless four different groups of cytochromes have been defined:</p>
<ul><li class="listbulleted">cytochromes a, in which the haem has a formyl group present;</li>
<li class="listbulleted">cytochromes <i>b</i>, in which the protein is not covalently bonded to the haem;</li>
<li class="listbulleted">cytochromes c, which have covalent links between the haem and the protein;</li>
<li class="listbulleted">cytochromes <i>d</i>, which have the dihydroporphyrin group present.</li></ul>
<p class="indent">Cytochromes <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> generally have two strong field axial ligands and so are low spin. They are six-coordinate and so, unlike the haems used in oxygen transport and enzyme activity, have no position for further coordination and so only interact by an electron-transfer mechanism.</p>

The crystal structures of the iron(II) and iron(III) forms of tuna cytochrome <i>c</i> have been solved and are very similar suggesting that there is no conformational change during the redox process. The haem iron is further coordinated by a histidine residue and to the sulphur of a methionine. Electron transfer from the reductase and to the oxidase occurs over a fairly large distance; it may occur through the edge of the porphyrin as if there is a complex formed then the edge-to-edge distance would be about 16&#x00C5; and relatively rapid electron transfer can occur between metal centres separated by distances of over 10&#x00C5;.</p>
<p class="indent">Some cytochrome <i>a</i> types are five-coordinate in contrast to cytochrome <i>c</i>. They account for the unusual toxicity of the cyanide ion which can bind strongly to the sixth position at the iron(III) and stabilize it such that it is not reduced. This stops the electron shuttling along the chain. Cyanide can also bind to haemoglobin at the dioxygen site; inhibition of cytochrome <i>a</i> activity is, however, more serious than the inhibition of dioxygen binding.<a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Electron transfer</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The electron-transfer proteins present in electron-transfer chains are usually bound to cell membranes; the proteins present can either span the phospholipid bilayer component of the membrane or be embedded on one side only. Electrons enter the chain at a potential appropriate to the chemical reaction from which they derive and then run downhill thermodynamically to the reducible electron acceptor via a sequence of redox centres. These centres have small differences (&#x007E;80mV) in redox potential allowing chemical reversibility.</p>

At the same time they neutralize four protons and pump four protons across the membrane in which the enzyme sits (<a href="#fig_4.10">Fig. 4.10</a>). The way in which the enzyme reacts with dioxygen is not well understood and several theories have been advanced. It is probable that at some stage the dioxygen must coordinate to the sixth coordination site in cytochrome <i>a</i> and form a heterodimetallic complex with Cu<sub>B</sub>; a reaction sequence for the reaction starting from Cu<sub>B</sub>(I)Fe<sub>a3</sub>(II) is shown in <a href="#fig_4.11">Fig. 4.11</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Electron transfer in the respiratory and photosynthetic chains is linked by protons to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Components of the chain such as cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase act as proton pumps by setting up an electrochemical gradient in response to electron transfer whereby protons are returned across the membrane and down the gradient to drive the synthesis of ATP.

Green plants harvest light energy and convert it to electrical energy through the excitation of chlorophyll.
