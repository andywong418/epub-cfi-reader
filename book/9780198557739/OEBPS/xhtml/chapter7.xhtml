<p class="noindent">Coordination compounds have found application in medicine in the treatment, management, and diagnosis of disease. In this chapter attention is drawn to two ways in which this occurs&#x2014;the application of therapeutic chelating agents and the therapeutic use of preformed coordination compounds.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_7.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>7.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>The application of therapeutic chelating agents</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic chelating agents have been used to remove excess metals from the body. These might have arisen from metabolic disorders such as Wilson&#x2019;s disease, a hereditary genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize copper in the normal way and copper accumulations occur in the liver and then in the central nervous system, and &#x03B2;-thalassaemia which leads to iron overload and has been discussed in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>; or by the inadvertent uptake of toxic metals such as lead(II), cadmium, and mercury(II).</p>
<p class="indent">The development of chelation therapy is discussed here in terms of the principles used by Sir Rudolph Peters to develope an antidote for the poison gas Lewisite which is an organoarsenic compound that attacks the lungs and the skin. The procedure used followed the following steps, which can be generally used to find a useful chelating agent.</p>

<p class="indent">The ideal ligand would be specific for the toxic metal and be non-toxic itself (that is it must possess an LD<sub>50</sub> ideally greater or equal to 400mg/kg: <a href="#tab_7.1">Table 7.1</a>) and as its complexes. It should form highly stable complexes with the metal ion to be removed that are water-soluble and so readily excretable, and it should not be metabolized. The ligand selected for testing by Peters was 2,3-dimercapto-l -propanol, which subsequently became known as British Anti-Lewisite (BAL) because the chelation of arsenic by the &#x2013;SH<a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>groups with the formation of stable five-membered rings should help remove it from the body (<a href="#fig_7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). BAL proved effective and was also used for toxic metals such as mercury(II), cadmium(II), and lead(II) which also have an affinity for &#x2013;SH groups.</p>

<p class="indent">As BAL has a degree of toxicity and is difficult to administer a more water-soluble agent was sought. 2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic <sub>ac</sub>id has been shown to be an effective antidote for the same range of metals as BAL, as has sodium 2,3-dimercapto-l-propanesulfonate (unithiol). A further advantage of the latter complexes is that, unlike BAL, they do not facilitate<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>the entry of mercury (II) into the brain but concentrate it in the liver and kidneys, making it available for excretion. Cell membranes are constructed of protein and phospholipid, so factors which enhance the lipid solubility of a metal will increase the opportunity for it to cross membranes and enter cells. BAL forms a neutral, lipid-soluble complex with mercury(II) which can readily cross the phospholipid barrier. The mercury(II) complex with unithiol is charged and so remains water-soluble; this inhibits its passage across the membrane and allows for ready excretion.</p>
<p class="indent">Polyaminocarboxylic acids have been investigated as therapeutic agents because of their broad chelating ability. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H<sub>4</sub>EDTA) is used here as a representative example. In 1952 the calcium complex of EDTA was shown to protect chicks against lead(II) poisoning.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-7.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
<p class="noindent">Later in the same year it was used to treat lead(II) poisoning in humans; the calcium complex was used because H<sub>4</sub> EDTA itself can form stable complexes with essential as well as toxic metals and so can interact with and deplete serum calcium. The simple sodium salt is toxic and so the mixed complex Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA is now used as it prevents rapid calcium depletion. In the body, the lead(II) replaces the calcium in the chelating agent and the resulting complex is excreted via the urine. EDTA complexes can be used to remove mercury(II), iron, and other metals from the body but care must be taken that it does not cause depletion of essential elements such as zinc.</p>
<p class="indent">D-Penicillamine is a degradation product of penicillin that can utilize nitrogen, oxygen, or sulphur atoms as donors. It is an effective chelating agent for lead(II), mercury(II), and copper(II) and for many other metals. N- acetyl-D-penicillamine is less toxic than D-penicillamine and both reagents can be administered orally. D-Penicillamine has been used in the treatment of rheumatism and arthritis and is the preferred treatment for Wilson&#x2019;s disease.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/f0083-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>Both penicillamines have been used against mercury with the N-acetyl derivative being very effective at removing methylmercury(II) from brain tissue. Caution must be exercised with the use of both BAL and D- penicillamine with cadmium(II) as the complexes formed are more toxic than the metal.</p>
<p class="indent">The natural approach to chelation therapy has already been demonstrated with the use of desferrioxamine B and related siderophores and analogues in the relief of iron overload (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>). These systems have some problems, however, as hydroxamates are susceptible to the acid environment of the stomach and the catecholates form charged complexes which can trap the iron intracellularly and so prevent excretion. A new approach developed by Robert Hider is to look for simple ligands which will produce a neutral ligand and a neutral iron complex and which will avoid the problems above, and being small will be easily absorbed by the gut. The ligands chosen for this study were the hydroxypyridones. 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide, which can be considered as an aromatic hydroxamate, has a high affinity for iron and is acid stable and this led to consideration of 3-hydroxypyridine-4-one and 3-hydroxypyridin-2-ones. As a consequence many derivatives have been synthesized and, for example, l,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridine-4-one has been used in clinical trials; it is orally active and can remove iron from overloaded patients.</p>

<p class="indent">The copper complex of the simple dipeptide, (L&#x2014;His)<sub>2</sub>, which may be regarded as resembling the form in which copper is transported in human serum albumin, has been used successfully in the treatment of a second genetic disorder, Menke&#x2019;s disease. This disease is typified by rapidly progressive cerebral degeneration and spirally twisted (&#x2018;kinky&#x2019;) hair. It is intriguing to speculate on the possibility of drugs being based on the metal sites found in the metallothioneins and phytochelatins.<a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>The therapeutic use of preformed coordination compounds</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Although preformed metal complexes have been used in medicine&#x2014;gold complexes as antiarthritics, copper complexes in the treatment of rheumatism and as anti-inflammatories&#x2014;it is perhaps the application of platinum complexes in cancer therapy that is the best-known example of the use of coordination complexes in the treatment of disease. Metal binding has also been said to enhance the performance of organic drugs: for example, the zinc complex of ibuprofen is more effective as an anti-inflammatory than the ligand alone and the anticancer drug bleomycin is thought to cleave DNA as an iron(II) complex via oxygen activation.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Platinum and anticancer activity</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">During the course of experiments designed to determine the effects of electric fields on the growth of <i>E.coli</i> bacteria, Barnett Rosenberg and his collaborators observed the unusual phenomenon of filamentous growth of the bacterial cells. Normal cell division had been inhibited and the cells grew up to 300</p>
<p class="noindent">times their normal length.</p>
<p class="indent">After much study it was found that this process derived from the presence of platinum(II) and platinum(IV) ammine chloride complexes which had been generated <i>in situ</i> by electrolysis at the platinum electrodes used&#x2014;the solvent solution contained ammonium chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequent investigations revealed that one compound responsible for filamentation was <i>cis</i>-diammineplatinum(II) chloride (<i>cis</i>-platin), a classic coordination complex, the synthesis and structure of which were well known.</p>
<p class="indent">Animal tests revealed that <i>cis</i>-platin was a very effective antitumour agent causing regression of both fast- and slow-moving tumours and that it also was an inhibitor of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) synthesis. Interestingly, the corresponding <i>trans</i>-complex has no effect against tumour growth. <i>Cis</i>-platin is now used in humans; it is not active against all cancers but is effective against testicular cancers, and active against ovarian, lung, bladder, head, neck, and cervical cancers.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-12.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/f0085-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the anticancer activity of <i>cis</i>-platin is not fully understood, but certain features have emerged. Extracellular fluids have high chloride concentrations and so replacement of the chloride in <i>c is</i>-platin by water is suppressed. Inside the cell, the chloride concentration is much diminished and so exchange of chloride by water occurs to generate products such as [Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>and [Pt(<b>N</b>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]. These can interact with the nitrogen atoms (N-7) of the guanine bases and to a lesser extent with the nitrogen atoms of the adenine bases, to produce either inter- or intrastrand <i>cis</i>-Pt(NH<sub>3</sub><b>)</b><sub>2</sub> bridges (<a href="#fig_7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The way in which the bridges are formed between the N-7 atoms of adjacent guanines has been shown in the crystal structure of a platinum dinucleotide complex, [Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>{d(pGpG)}] (<a href="#fig_7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>). This type of intrastrand bridge cannot be formed by the <i>trans</i>-complex for steric reasons.</p>
<p class="indent">DNA consists of two strands which intertwine to give a double helix. Each strand is a condensation polymer of nucleotides containing 2&#x2019;-deoxyribose as<a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>the sugar. A nucleotide is a nucleoside in which the sugar is linked to a phosphate group and nucleosides are composed of a purine or pyrimidine base attached to the sugar ribose through the N-9 and N-l atoms respectively (<a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). In DNA the bases present are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine and the complementary strands of DNA are stabilized by hydrogenbonding between the base pairs.</p>

<p class="indent">When an organism grows, the cells divide and multiply, and the DNA doubles by a process called DNA replication. The hydrogen bonds linking the two strands of a DNA molecule break apart and each strand uses nucleotides present in the nucleus to synthesize a strand complementary to itself. The result is two daughter molecules each identical to the parent. The DNA acts as a template for the synthesis of messenger RNA in the process of transcription and this RNA carries the genetic code (<a href="chapter6.xhtml#sec_6.2">Section 6.2</a>). The interaction of <i>cis</i>-platin would interfere with these processes and it is this pertubation of the DNA structure which perhaps lies at the centre of its anticancer activity.<a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a></p>

<p class="indent">Second-generation platinum drugs have now been synthesized which are proving to produce less severe side-effects than <i>cis</i>-platin. Representative of these is diammine(l,l-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (carboplatin) which is more slowly aquated than cd-platin.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Gold and antiarthritic agents</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Gold has always fascinated mankind and was regarded by the early civilizations as a panacea for all diseases. Modern chrysotherapy, therapy deriving from gold, was pioneered by the French physician Forestier who, in 1929, first introduced gold(I) thiolates as therapeutic agents for rheumatoid arthritis. Today all the gold complexes used in medicine are derived from<a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>gold(I). Representative gold(I) antiarthritic drugs are myochrosin [sodium aurothiomalate] and solganol (aurothioglucose], which are injected intramuscularly, and auranofin [(<i>S</i>)&#x2014;2,3,4,5-tetraacetyl-l-D-thioglucose-(triethylphosphine)gold(I)], which is administered orally.</p>
<figure class="noindent">
 <img src="../images/f0088-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The 1:1 gold thiolates have not yet been crystallised but NMR, mass spectrometric, and X-ray scattering studies have revealed that they are not monomeric but are built up of ring and chain structures (<a href="#fig_7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>). They are administered in doses of <i>c</i>.25mg per week for several years and it can take several months before beneficial effects show. Consequently several grams of gold can be used in the treatment and can remain in the body long after the therapy is completed.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In contrast auranofin is a lipid-soluble, linear, two-coordinate complex. It may be hydrolysed during absorption into the intestine so that the species which then enters the blood stream is Au(I)(PEt<sub>3</sub>)(&#x03B2;-D-thioglucose).<a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Therapeutic uses of coordination compounds</a>The end products of the metabolism are likely to be the same as for the thiolates. The precise modes of action of these compounds are uncertain but it is thought that antienzyme and anti-inflammatory activities are involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Gold(III) is isoelectronic with Pt(II) and has isostructural complexes; it is therefore appropriate to ask why Au(III) is not used as an anticancer agent. The simple answer is that <i>cis</i>-diamminedihalogold(III) analogues of <i>cis</i>-platin have not yet been characterized; reaction of [Au(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>X]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and [AU(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> with halide anions (X<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) give only the <i>trans-</i>product. Furthermore ligand substitutions occur much more readily in Au(III) complexes, which are also stronger oxidants than Pt(II) complexes. Aqua complexes of Au(III) such as [AUC1<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)] are highly acidic, and simple anions such as [AUC1<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> can oxidise, for example, methionine to the sulphoxide and cystine disulphides to sulphonates and so cannot be used as drugs.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Endpiece</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Biocoordination chemistry is a living subject and so, like life itself, is full of surprises. This has been demonstrated in the text by the many unusual, and often unexpected, coordination environments found at metallobiosites. Reinforcement of this expression came during the proof stage of this text when the crystal structure of the nickel-iron hydrogenase (6.7) from <i>Desulphovibrio gigas</i> was announced. This showed the presence of two 4Fe&#x2014;4S&#x002A; clusters and one 3Fe&#x2014;4S&#x002A; cluster, arranged as &#x2018;stepping stones&#x2019; for electron transfer, together with a hydrogen-binding site which, quite unexpectedly, appears to be a heterodinuclear iron&#x2013;nickel cluster. The nickel is bound to four protein cysteine ligands and the iron to two bridging cysteines together with three or four as yet unidentified non-protein ligands. Nature continues to confound the chemist and by doing so provides us with many challenging problems.</p>
