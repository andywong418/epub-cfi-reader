<p class="noindent">When astronauts venture into space they are reliant upon life-support systems. On earth we exist because we each have our own built-in support system. When we breathe, dioxygen enters our bloodstream through interaction with the iron atoms present in our oxygen-carrier haemoglobin (Hb) and then is carried to the tissues where it is stored by myoglobin (Mb) until it is required for metabolic processes. The iron is bound to a porphyrin ring present in the metalloprotein and this unit is called a haem protein. Hb is a tetrameric metalloprotein having molecular weight of 65,000 and four haem-units; Mb, which is also a haem-protein, may be regarded as a monomer of Hb. The haem unit absorbs one molecule of dioxygen per iron atom and is responsible for the red colour of your blood.</p>
<p class="indent">The potency of the haem units may be gauged by comparison of the solubility of dioxygen in water and in blood. In water the solubility is quite low with 6.59cm<sup>3</sup> of dioxygen dissolving in 1dm<sup>3</sup> at 20&#x00B0;C and 1 atmosphere to give a 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-4</sup>M solution. It is possible to dissolve 200cm<sup>3</sup> of dioxygen in blood under the same conditions to give a 9 x 10<sup>-3</sup>M solution. Blood therefore can carry about 30 times as much dioxygen as water.</p>

<p class="noindent2">A porphyrin is a compound having a fully conjugated cyclic structure of four pyrolle rings linked via their 2- and 5- positions by methine (&#x003D;CH-) links.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The dioxygen carriage and storage proteins are called respiratory pigments and are required by all animals and many other species. Not all species, however, use haem proteins. Molluscs and arthropods such as lobsters, squid, cuttlefish, and octopi use haemocyanin, a dinuclear copper protein which absorbs one molecule of dioxygen per two metal atoms and gives the blood a blue colour. Certain marine worms use haemerythrin, a diiron non-haem protein which gives their blood a violet colour.</p>

<p class="noindent">Early X-ray crystal structural studies on Hb by Max Perutz and John Kendrew revealed that the active site in Hb and Mb is the haem which is tightly bound to the protein chain, but the question of whether the dioxygen was bound to the metal in a side-on <b>(3.1)</b> or bent, end-on <b>(3.2)</b> manner was not solved at this time. Small molecule model compounds for this interaction were devized and played an important role in helping to understand the nature of the Fe-O<sub>2</sub> interaction. Two jigsaw puzzles were completed in parallel with movements in each helping towards the solution of the other.</p>

<p class="noindent">Extensive studies on the reaction of dioxygen with cobalt(II) complexes of Schiff base ligands [Co(SB)] gave the first real clues to the probable nature<a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Dioxygen management&#x2014;storage and transport</a>of the metal&#x2013;dioxygen interaction. If the reaction of the Co(SB) complex with O<sub>2</sub> was carried out in a coordinating solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or in a non-coordinating solvent with the presence of added Lewis base (B) such as pyridine or imidazole, then at temperatures of 0&#x00B0;C or below, rapid and reversible uptake of O<sub>2</sub> corresponding to the formation of 1:1 Co(SB)(B)O<sub>2</sub> (<b>3.3</b>) complexes occurred; in the absence of (B) an oxy-bridged dimer was obtained.</p>

<p class="indent">The purpose of the strongly coordinating axial ligand may be rationalized by considering the d-orbital energy levels of cobalt(II) in the different coordination environments (<a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). In the square-planar starting material the unpaired electron is located in the <i>d<sub>xy</sub></i> orbital and so is not available for interaction with the approaching dioxygen. The axial ligand leads to a square pyramidal arrangement and raises the <img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/f0022-02.jpg" alt="images"/> orbital above the <i>d<sub>xy</sub></i> level and it is this configuration which appears to be a prerequisite for dioxygen interaction.</p>

<p class="indent">After oxygenation the complexes still have one unpaired electron and the EPR spectra of the oxygenated complexes indicates that this electron has only a small spin density at the cobalt nucleus. This means that the electron is delocalized on the dioxygen ligand and that the cobalt dioxygen interaction should be designated as Co(III)&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex Co(L<sup>1</sup>)(DMSO)O<sub>2</sub> showed that the di-oxygen bonding was end-on with a Co&#x2013;O&#x2013;O angle of 125&#x00B0;; furthermore the O&#x2013;O distance of 1.26&#x00C5; is very close to that of the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is useful at this point to remember the molecular orbital energy level diagram for dioxygen (<a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>) and to add the electrons which generate the O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup> systems. The bond orders resulting are 2, 1.5, and 1 and this is reflected in the increase in bond length. A crystal structure of a dioxygen complex by revealing the O&#x2013;O distance can therefore help in deducing the nature of the metal-dioxygen interaction.</p>
<p class="indent">If one can use these small molecule ligands to try and help understand the interaction of dioxygen with a metal then why not use porphyrins themselves in the modelling of the biosite&#x003F; The problem that arises is that the simple iron(II) porphyrins react irreversibly with dioxygen in the<a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Dioxygen management&#x2014;storage and transport</a>presence of axial base but this is then followed by irreversible formation of a &#x03BC;-oxo dimer.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The way in which this problem has been overcome is to work at low temperatures in order to show the reactions leading to dimerization and to introduce steric constraints onto the porphyrin such that dimerization is inhibited. The classic example of the latter is the &#x2018;picket fence&#x2019; porphyrin developed by James Collman and his group, <i>meso</i>-tztra(&#x03B1;,&#x03B1;,&#x03B1;,&#x03B1;-<i>o</i>-pivalamidophenyl)porphyrin, and many other modifications of porphyrins have subsequently been developed and used to study the Fe-O<sub>2</sub> interaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/f0023-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The principle involved is that the porphyrin should be modified in such a way that there is great steric bulk on one side in order to inhibit bimolecular reactions involving two iron centres and dioxygen, and that the iron atom should be five-coordinated by a bulky base on the unhindered side of the porphyrin. This leaves a hydrophobic pocket for interaction with dioxygen (<a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>).<a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Dioxygen management&#x2014;storage and transport</a></p>

<p class="noindent2">John C. Kendrew and Max F. Perutz were awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1962</p>
<p class="noindent">for studies on the structures of globular proteins including haemoglobin.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Subsequent to these studies the stereochemistry at the iron sites in both oxy- Mb and oxy-Hb were revealed through their crystal structures, by work carried out by Simon Phillips and Boaz Shaanan respectively. A comparison was now possible with the structures of the deoxy-forms of the proteins. In the deoxy forms the iron atom is five-coordinate, high spin, and sited below the plane of the porphyrin ring towards an axial imidazole ligand. On oxygenation the iron in Hb moves towards the porphyrin plane (from 0.60A to 0.13A from the plane) and pulls this histidine with it thus commencing<a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Dioxygen management&#x2014;storage and transport</a>the cooperativity shown by Hb in binding dioxygen (<a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>). In Mb this change is not so pronounced (from 0.42&#x00C5; to 0.18&#x00C5;). The dioxygen atom is found to be bent, end-on, as in the models, and by using neutron diffraction analysis it was possible to show that the bound dioxygen forms a medium strong hydrogen bond with the distal histidine in oxy-Mb (<a href="#fig_3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>). The Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;O bond angle has been found to vary from 115&#x00B0; in oxy-Mb to &#x007E;130&#x00B0; in the &#x2018;picket fence&#x2019; model and 156&#x00B0; in oxy-Hb; these angular changes may reflect the differing steric constraints imposed at the binding site.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Cooperativity</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The most significant property of Hb is cooperative oxygen binding in which the oxygen affinity of the tetramer rises with increasing oxygen saturation. The four subunits of Hb do not act independently and appear to communicate with each other such that when one haem unit interacts with an oxygen molecule the other three units show an enhanced ability to interact with dioxygen. Hb is less efficient than Mb at oxygen uptake under low oxygen pressures and so in muscle tissue where this is so, there is a thermodynamically favourable transfer of dioxygen from oxy-Hb to oxy-Mb. The basis of cooperativity has been proposed to arise from a &#x2018;trigger&#x2019; mechanism. In deoxy-Hb the high-spin Fe(II) atom is about 0.60&#x00C5; below the mean plane of the porphyrin ring and upon oxygenation the iron atom changes to low spin and moves into the plane of the ring. At the same time the proximal histidine is moved by about 0.8&#x00C5; so causing conformational changes in the protein which can in turn induce changes at the remaining iron sites in a concerted action.</p>

Haemerythrin is a dinuclear iron compound, and haemocyanin is a dicopper compound, neither of which have porphyrin rings present.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Oxy- and deoxy-haemerythrin</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">X-ray crystal structures of the active site in haemerythrins have been carried out by Ronald Stenkamp&#x2019;s research team and reveal an unusual structure in which the two iron atoms are triply bridged by an oxo-atom, the carboxylate functions from a glutamate residue and an aspartate residue, such that the bridges provide the central ligands of a confacial bioctahedral array. Five of the remaining ligands are provided by histidine ligands from the polypeptide chain, leaving one accessible ligand site. The presence of the Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe motif in haemerythrins is consistent with the strong antiferromagnetic coupling (-J &#x003D; 134cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and the Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe vibration mode at 510cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in the six-coordinate <i>met</i>-forms which have iron(III) present and are inactive towards dioxygen. The Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe motif has now been found to be widespread in nature, also occurring in a range of metalloenzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase, methane mono-oxygenase, and the purple acid phosphatases.</p>

<p class="indent">Modelling studies for hemerythrins are necessarily corroborative and have mainly concerned the six-coordinate <i>met</i>-forms. The ligands involved have been derived from tridentate nitrogen ligands such as the tripodal hydridotris(l-pyrazoyl)borate anion (HBpyz<sub>3</sub>) and the macrocycle 1,4,7- triazacyclononane (TACN) which provide a rigid face-capping donor set and so facilitate the formation of confacial bioctahedral complexes (<a href="#fig_3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>). The model complexes were developed in parallel by the groups of Stephen Lippard and Karl Wieghardt and the complexes prepared using a technique, now termed &#x2018;spontaneous self-assembly&#x2019;, in which all of the components are simply mixed and left to crystallize. These ligands have proved to be versatile and have also been used to cap one face of a tetrahedron in the derivation of models for the active site in zinc enzymes.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Oxy- and deoxy-haemocyanin</b></h3>
<p class="indent">The speculative modelling of the active site in oxy-haemocyanin provides another detective story which is well worth private study. From cumulative spectroscopic studies on the metalloprotein a site proposal (<b><a href="#fi_3.4">3.4</a></b>) was made in which the two copper atoms were coordinated by three histidine ligands each together with an endogenously bridging donor atom, believed to be an oxygen from tyrosinase, and an exogenously bridged <i>cis</i>-1,2-peroxide.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fi_3.4">
 <img src="../images/f0029-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This proposal generated many model studies and the thrust of these studies was to provide an endogenous bridge, as this was held responsible for the observed strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two copper(II) ions and to replicate this together with the intercopper distance of <i>c</i>.3.5&#x00C5;, and the charge transfer band at 330nm. Much of the seminal work on model complexes capable of activating dioxygen derives from the laboratory of Kenneth Karlin. The eventual solution of the crystal structure of deoxy- haemocyanin from the spiny lobster <i>(Panulirus interruptus</i>), by Wim Hoi and his group (<a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>a), confirmed that the dinuclear nature of the site and the presence of three histidine ligands per copper atom but eliminated the concept of an endogenous bridge as there was no conserved candidate suitable for such bridging within 12&#x00C5; of the site.</p>
<p class="indent">One intriguing model (<b><a href="#fig_3.10">3.5</a></b>) in which there was no endogenous bridge eventually emerged from the laboratory of Nobumasa Kitajima. The terminal ligands were provided by the 3,5-diisopropyl derivative of the tripodal ligand<a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Dioxygen management&#x2014;storage and transport</a>HBpyz<sub>3</sub> and the structure of the complex showed that the dioxygen present had inserted between the copper atoms in a novel &#x03BC;-&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>:&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup> bridging mode. The spectroscopic and magnetic properties of this molecule closely resembled that of the biosite, so offering a new candidate for the binding of dioxygen at the dinuclear site.</p>
