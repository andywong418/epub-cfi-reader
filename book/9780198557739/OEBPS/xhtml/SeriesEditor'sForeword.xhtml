<p class="fmnoindent">As far as life is concerned, some elements are more essential than others, and biocoordination chemistry deals with those inorganic elements which are present generally in small concentrations in life-forms, but are still vital. This is a very appealing area of science at the interface of inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. It is a field covered by most chemistry degree courses, often in the final year.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as giving up-to-date information, this series provides the explanations and rationales that are the framework of Inorganic Chemistry. In this book, Dave Fenton gives an authoritative guide to the coordination chemistry behind many important biological functions. He builds on the background provided by other books within the series, particularly on <i>d</i>-block chemistry and reaction mechanisms, and shows how a basic understanding of metal complexes is essential to explain many biochemical operations.</p>
