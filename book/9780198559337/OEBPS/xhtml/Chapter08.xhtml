<p class="noindent">In this block of elements, filling of the three p-orbitals is being completed, using six electrons in each series, and giving rise to Groups 13&#x2013;18. The lighter members, which are of most importance in biology, are non-metals. The elements become increasingly more electronegative as the p-orbitals fill, because there is a driving force to accept electrons to reach the very stable p<sup>6</sup> configuration of the noble gases. Elements such as oxygen, fluorine, chlorine and, to a certain extent nitrogen, are highly electronegative and are therefore able to take part in hydrogen bonds (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.4">Section 2.4</a>). Some of the most important molecules in our environment are formed from elements of this group, i.e. O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and others, and in the next sections we shall be concerned with their complex interrelationships. Strictly, the element hydrogen belongs to the s-block, but because the 2H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub> couple is so important in biochemical cycles involving p-block elements, and because H has p-characteristics (i.e. it forms H<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) it is included here. The d-block elements (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">7</a>) are essential components of many of the metalloenzymes which catalyse bond cleavage and overcome the intrinsic low reactivity of N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>; control the extreme reactivity of O<sub>2</sub> and the toxicity of <img src="../images/in50_15.jpg" alt="images"/> and <img src="../images/in50_16.jpg" alt="images"/>; and aid in the reduction of nitrogen oxide compounds. The cycles involved, and their exquisite interlinking, are illustrated in <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>, which is obviously greatly oversimplified. Each cycle will now be examined.</p>

<p class="noindent">This cycle is relevant to animals, plants and bacteria. The transformations can occur in either direction but intermediates are well established, in some cases, in one direction only. A key reaction in the cycle is nitrogen fixation A (<a href="#eq8.1">eqn 8.1</a>) which is catalysed by nitrogenase:</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">The electrons are supplied by the Fe(II) form of ferredoxin and the ammonia produced is used for the synthesis of organic compounds required for cell growth. The enzymes which catalyse this reaction have been the focus of a great deal of attention for a number of years. Although there are forms which contain only vanadium or iron, the most common and most investigated enzyme contains both an Fe protein and a MoFe protein. Nitrogenase is found in certain soil bacteria and on the root nodules of legumes (e.g. pea and alfalfa). The crystal structures of the two proteins in nitrogenase from <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> have been solved, after a decade of active study. The Fe protein contains one Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster which is very sensitive to oxygen. MgATP (and MgADP) binds about 20 <img src="../images/in50_a.jpg" alt="images"/> from the FeS cluster, and its binding causes a substantial conformational change. The Fe protein transfers one electron, for each two molecules of MgATP hydrolysed, to the MoFe protein to which it is bound (probably) by salt bridges. This process is repeated until the MoFe protein has accumulated eight electrons which it then uses to effect the reduction of N<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#eq8.1">eqn 8.1</a>). The nature of the binding site for N<sub>2</sub> in the MoFe protein is unclear. It undoubtedly binds at one of the cofactors in the MoFe protein which has a fascinating structure (<a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>). The low coordination number (three) of some of the Fe sites <i>suggests</i> that one or more of these, and not Mo, as has been supposed, is the substrate binding site. Another cluster (cysteine-bridged 2[4Fe&#x2013;4S]) is also located in the MoFe protein.</p>

<p class="noindent">The interconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and organic compounds, in the form of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids, represents one of the most fundamental processes for most living material. These take place in respiration and photosynthesis, which are complementary because the O<sub>2</sub> consumed in respiration is supplied by photosynthesis. The major pathway for the breakdown of carbohydrates ends in the electron transport chain with the O<sub>2</sub> molecule as the terminal electron acceptor. In photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy by plants, algae and bacteria but not by eukaryotes. Carbohydrates are synthesized from water and carbon dioxide and oxygen is a by-product. Again, a complex electron transfer chain is used following light irradiation. In both respiration and photosynthesis, ATP is generated from ADP and phosphate. Details of these processes have been given in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>. Plants and cyanobacteria, in using photosynthesis, act on about 10<sup>11</sup> tons of carbonaceous material per year. Organic compounds <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 8 The p-block</a>and CO<sub>2</sub> can also be interconverted via CO as an intermediate (<img src="../images/in50_h.jpg" alt="images"/>). The CO/CO2 interchange is catalysed in both directions by carbon monoxide dehydrogenases. In anaerobic bacteria these complicated enzymes contain Ni and FeS centres, while those from aerobic bacteria contain molybdopterin (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#tab6.4">Table 6.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Earth-orbiting satellites using infrared detectors have shown, surprisingly, that atmospheric CO is present in as large amounts in the Southern as in the Northern Hemisphere, from the burning of tropical rain forests. Plant decay produces CH<sub>4</sub> which is converted by OH radicals and O<sub>2</sub> into CO and CO<sub>2</sub>. Hydroxyl radicals are produced by the effect of sunlight on the ozone layer. As CO accumulates, more OH must be used to generate CO<sub>2</sub>, leaving CH<sub>4</sub> untouched. The accumulation of these gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) contributes to the &#x2018;greenhouse effect&#x2019; and the rise in the mean global air temperature, with potentially devastating effects.</p>

<p class="noindent">In our aerobic world, as we have just described, the oxidation of compounds by O<sub>2</sub> and the oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub> are of paramount importance. All animals, plants, yeasts and some bacteria capture atmospheric oxygen and distribute it to cells where it is reduced to water, with difficulty, in the last step of the respiratory chain. Oxygen is used in the biosynthesis of many compounds in metabolic processes and for the conversion of lipid-soluble to water-soluble molecules for excretion. In addition, oxygen is manipulated by hundreds of enzymes, including many metalloenzymes. Cell components can also convert oxygen to partially reduced forms.

Most of the techniques of <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> have been used to characterize the metal sites and the interaction of O<sub>2</sub> with them. There are three common forms for each: deoxy, in which the metals are fully reduced; oxy, formed by the reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with deoxy; and met, in which the metal is oxidized and unreactive with oxygen. When oxygen reacts with the reduced deoxy form, there is a strong driving force which favours oxidation of the metal ion to the met form over reversible oxygen addition to the deoxy form. Irreversible oxidation of the metal is curtailed by its being located in a hydrophobic pocket and by hydrogen bonding at the active site of the respiratory protein. The mode of attachment of oxygen differs in each case (<a href="#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a>).

<p class="indent">Each subunit of hemoglobin contains an iron protoporphyrin IX centre. In deoxyhemoglobin (and deoxymyoglobin), the Fe(II) is high spin and the fifth coordination site is occupied by an imidazole from the proximal histidine with the sixth ligand probably H<sub>2</sub>O. The Fe(II) is too large to fit into the porphyrin ring and is displaced from the plane of the four nitrogens by 0.4&#x2013;0.5 <img src="../images/in51_3.jpg" alt="images"/> on the histidine side. In oxyhemoglobin, the smaller Fe(III) fits nicely into the ring and in so doing changes the orientation and position of the coordinated histidine. The Fe&#x2013;N (his) bond, which is about 8&#x00B0; off normal in deoxyhemoglobin, becomes almost perpendicular to the porphyrin plane in oxyhemoglobin. The movement of the Fe&#x2013;heme&#x2013;his entity on O<sub>2</sub> binding leads to a reorientation and translation of the &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> dimer relative to the &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>1</sub> dimer. This disrupts a series of salt bridges that stabilize the deoxy form (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.4">Section 2.4</a>) and leads to enhanced O<sub>2</sub> binding and this continues until all four heme irons are ocupied by oxygen molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">High rates of O<sub>2</sub> binding and release are physiologically necessary with all respiratory proteins. Specialized equipment was developed for the measurement of these rates. The invention of the flow method in 1923 for the study of rapid reactions in solution (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a>) stems from the need to measure the rates of the interactions of hemoglobin with O<sub>2</sub> and CO. It is now possible to investigate the reactions of myoglobin with O<sub>2</sub>, CO and NO in great detail. For example, irradiation of oxymyoglobin, A, with short, very intense, laser pulses produces transients which are ascribed to B and C in <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>. After photodissociation, the ligand remains in the protein for several hundred nanoseconds before returning to the iron in a complex reaction. Until recently only spectral and kinetic evidence for transients existed. However, a crystal structure of irradiated MbCO at &#x003C; 40 &#x00B0;K visualized the geminate state corresponding to B with the C &#x2261; O unattached in a well defined site near the Fe and parallel to the heme plane rather than normal to the ring as when bound to the Fe.</p>

It is hoped that this approach will also be useful for structural characterization of short lived intermediates in enzyme reactions.</p>

Maybe nNOS plays a specific role in controlling mammalian social behaviour. There are a variety of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase action and these may be of value in the treatment of certain clinical conditions arising from irregular production of NO (e.g. restoration of normal blood pressure after endotoxic shock). Not surprisingly, NO was named &#x2018;Molecule of the Year (1992)&#x2019; by the journal Science, and featured in a 1993 BBC TV Horizon program.</p>

<p class="noindent">The phosphate ion and derivatives of it are without doubt among the most important moieties of the p-block in biochemistry. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the most common currency for energy transactions and is probably present in every living organism except viruses. With three negatively charged phosphate groups attached (<a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>) the molecule is unstable toward hydrolysis and one or both of the P&#x2013;O&#x2013;P bonds may be broken by water. The energy thus released can be used to drive other reactions. The hydrolysis of ATP and the reverse reactions (formation) are conveniently written in <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Chapter 8 The p-block</a>biochemistry as in eqns 8.21 and 8.22 with no charges shown and with Pj and PPi representing the protonated forms of phosphate and pyrophosphate ions present at the pH of the reaction. At pH &#x223C; 7 <i>in vivo</i>, the reaction shown in <a href="#eq8.21">eqn 8.21</a>, for example is <i>mainly</i> as shown in <a href="#eq8.23">eqn 8.23</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.11<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ubiquitous water</h2>
<p class="noindent">Water has been observed in the spectra of red giant stars and, very recently, intact within sunspots, where temperatures are around 3000 &#x00B0;C. Its importance on earth is self evident. Were it not for hydrogen bonding, water would be a gas like H<sub>2</sub>S at ambient temperature and pressure. It is, of course, a liquid and forms the medium in which most biological reactions take place. When it freezes at 0 &#x00B0;C, the solid ice floats, and this is also a result of extensive hydrogen bonding which produces a more open structure. It is very unusual for the solid form of an element or molecule to be less dense than the liquid form. In water this effect is vital, since otherwise ice would sink to the bottoms of lakes, ponds etc., remain unthawed and build up to the detriment of marine life. A hope for the future is the use of special forms of water to dissolve or convert hazardous wastes. At high pressures, the boiling point of water is substantially raised (374 &#x00B0;C at &#x003E;200 atmospheres). Under these conditions it is a supercritical fluid and has the properties both of a gas and a liquid. In this state, it has the ability to dissolve oils or sewage sludge and even slowly corrodes gold. Ultrasound creates tiny bubbles for short times which burst at high temperature and pressure and convert some H<sub>2</sub>O into OH radicals. These can be used to transform chlorofluorocarbons into CO<sub>2</sub> for easy disposal.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-25em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Another environmentally friendly solvent is CO<sub>2</sub> which is a liquid above 31 &#x00B0;C and 72.8 atmospheres. It has been used in the production of decaffeinated coffee. Recently water- in-CO<sub>2</sub> microemulsions, induced by perfluoropoly ether surfactants, have been found to dissolve proteins. This has unique potential applications.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">It probably comes as a surprise that some organisms, as well as their associated enzymes, termed extremozymes can tolerate extreme conditions (high temperatures, high salt or low pH). Hyperthermophilic organisms can grow optimally at 100 &#x00B0;C or above, are usually prokaryotes and similar to bacteria, and are isolated from geothermal environments. They have attracted interest because the conditions in which they grow mimic those of prehistory on earth. In addition, they may have practical applications. Xylose or glucose isomerase (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.2">Section 7.2</a>) from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> is optimally active at 100 &#x00B0;C, at which temperature there is a higher (desired) fructose concentration in the equilibrium mixture than at the lower temperatures usually employed.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.14<span class="space">&#160;</span>The Future</h2>
<p class="noindent">Predicting the important future developments in bioinorganic chemistry is more difficult than picking the winner of a horserace. The winner in science may not even have been in the starting lineup! For example, who would have guessed that a toxic gas (nitric oxide) would turn out to be an important chemical messenger, and who would have imagined that a simple platinum complex would be a clinically useful anticancer agent?</p>
<p class="indent">We can however, with some confidence, suggest areas and problems with which future researchers will be concerned. There are still large gaps in our understanding of the uptake, storage and roles of the trace elements in the human body and their chemical speciation under cellular conditions. Iron especially appears to be an important mediator of oxidative damage <i>in vivo</i>. How does this occur? Only quite recently was the reason for the relatively high abundance of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in living systems clarified by the discovery of its part in gene regulation. The importance of other metal ions in this area is also becoming apparent.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of intense synchrotron X-rays with sophisticated computers allow the crystal structures of the most complicated metalloproteins to be solved. Even more important will be efforts to determine the structures of intermediates in enzyme catalysed reactions and thus begin to build up a moving picture of enzyme action. This will be achieved by slowing down the formation and decomposition of intermediates by lowering the temperature or by using genetically engineered mutants in which there is a change in the rate determining step in the process under investigation. Intermediates will then be stable for sufficient time for a crystal structure to be determined.</p>
<p class="indent">The value of inorganic compounds in the treatment of disease has so far been mainly a story of serendipity (e.g. Li and Pt compounds). A concerted effort is needed to understand the principles underlying their value and to exploit these to develop the field. One area where rewards for sucess will be high is in the understanding of biomineralization. Already, the manufacture and use of artificial bone is promising. Mixtures of hydroxyapatite and polyethylene are accepted by natural bone and may be used as implants. Some inorganic mixtures can be moulded into any shape.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be clear from the necessarily short survey in this book, that a sizable chunk of the periodic table is involved in the biological functions of all organisms. The chemistry of these elements and their compounds have been thoroughly explored, so that there is a firm basis for understanding their roles in biology. They may be involved only in trace amounts, and as simple ions, metal complexes or as components of large biological molecules. The relationship of these elements to all facets of biochemistry and molecular biology, pharmacology, clinical and environmental chemistry will be examined in an exciting, assured future.</p>
