<h2 class="h2">7.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The transition elements with a propensity for facile one or two electron changes, namely Fe, Cu and Mo, feature heavily in the oxidoreductases. The other transition elements, particularly Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> with stable d<sup>5</sup> and d<sup>10</sup> configurations, respectively, but also Ni<sup>2+</sup>, are important as metal centres in enzymes which catalyse nonredox reactions. The coordinated ligands emanate mainly from the protein (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">Section 2.1</a>) but a coordinated water molecule is also usually present. The H<sub>2</sub>O is labile when attached to a first row transition metal bivalent ion, half-lives of exchange being in the milli- to the microsecond range. This lability is essential for the metal ions to operate in metalloenzymes, since substitution of H<sub>2</sub>O by substrate is often a necessary step and is rarely rate limiting in the overall mechanism. In some cases, the substrate will add to the existing coordinated ligands. This is possible because these metal ions have variable coordination numbers, usually from 4 to 6. Lability is lost when the metal ion is strongly chelated, as is required when the purpose of the ligand is to help transport the metal ion (<a href="#sec7.5">Section 7.5</a>).</p>

<section id="sec7.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">7.2 Metalloenzymes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first row transition elements (especially Zn<sup>2+</sup>) are well represented in the hydrolase, lyase and isomerase classes (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>) of enzymes. Selected examples are shown in <a href="#tab7.1">Tables 7.1</a> and <a href="#tab7.2">7.2</a>. Zinc is essential (with Mg<sup>2+</sup>) in the nucleotidyl transferases, including the DNA and RNA polymerases. In these enzymes the M<sup>2+</sup> ion (often part of a binuclear metal cluster) provides a nucleophilic OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ion in the form of M<sup>2+</sup>&#x2013;OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. This attacks a phosphoryl or carbonyl centre, which may be coordinated to the metal ion at some time during the process. Hydrolysis or hydration is assisted by amino acids near the metal site. The M<sup>2+</sup> also stabilizes intrinsic (reactants) or developing (five-coordinate intermediates) negative charge and may organize the reactants spacially for easier interaction. <i>In toto</i>, a not insignificant contribution!</p>
<p class="indent">As with the entries in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#tab6.3">Tables 6.3</a> and 6.4, most of the metalloenzymes in <a href="#tab7.1">Tables 7.1</a> and <a href="#tab7.2">7.2</a> have known crystal structures and their sources are indicated. We shall discuss, in some detail, two systems as typifying the sorts of reactions and behaviours that are likely to be encountered with these metalloenzymes or metallocoenzymes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3 Carbonic anhydrase</h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the most studied metalloenzymes, and one whose mechanism of action is well understood, is carbonic anhydrase. This name will be found in most of the literature although the correct one, carbonate dehydratase, is now being used occasionally. This enzyme occurs in nearly all phyla and has a MW ~ 30 kDa. Most studies (including a crystal structure) have been with the high activity human carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme, HCA II. It catalyses the reactions:</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.4 Cobalamin-dependent reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are about a dozen enzymes which depend on the presence of cobalamins for their activity. These are mainly lyases and mutases, justifying the inclusion of cobalamins in this section, even though the coenzymes themselves are involved in redox reactions. There are two derivatives which concern us. Coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>, which has been described as Nature&#x0027;s most beautiful cofactor (<a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>), assists in a 1,2 shift, which is normally difficult to achieve in organic chemistry (X = NH<sub>2</sub>, OH or CR<sub>3</sub>):</p>

<p class="noindent">These reactions probably proceed via homolytic cleavage of the Co&#x2013;C bond (which is relatively weak), to give the adenosyl radical (&#x2022;CH<sub>2</sub>R) which mediates the 1,2 shift:</p>

<p class="indent">The other cobalamin derivative of interest here is methylcobalamin, <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>. It is one of the three cofactors with methylating abilities used by the enzyme system methionine synthase, which catalyses the reaction in <a href="#eq7.9">eqn 7.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been suggested that on transfer of the CH<sub>3</sub> group to homocysteine, a four-coordinate cobalamin (<a href="#eq7.10">eqn 7.10</a>), containing cobalt(I), may be an intermediate (CH<sub>3</sub>THFo = <i>N</i>,5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the second cofactor).</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.5 Transport and storage of d-block elements</h2>
<p class="noindent">The transition metal ions must be moved from their point of ingestion to the organs which require them. As with the s-block cations, there is an unequal cellular distribution of transition metal ions (e.g. Cu is mainly extracellular while Zn is mainly intracellular) so that cation transport across biological frontiers is necessary. There are, however, big differences between the d- and s-block cations. The transition metal ions precipitate at biological pHs and are often toxic because they can produce small amounts of radicals by reactions such as (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.6">Section 8.6</a>):</p>

<p class="noindent">They thus require carrier ligands for transport. Although some detail is lacking, iron is the best understood of the transition metals, both because of its importance and of the relative availability of material (e.g. in humans). The modes of transport of the d-block elements differ in bacteria and vertebrates.</p>
<section id="sec7.5.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Iron in bacteria</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nearly all microorganisms require iron for growth. In bacteria, iron is usually solubilized and transported by non-protein chelating ligands, called siderophores. These are widespread and have been found in maritime microorganisms and in plants (phytosiderophores, Gk: plant iron carriers). Siderophores provide O-donors and chelate Fe(III) very strongly with binding constants greater thanl0<sup>30</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. The usual chelating centres are hydroxamate, <i>o</i>-dihydroxy aromatic or &#x03B1;-hydroxycarboxylate groups. All these types of groups are present in pseudobactin (<a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>).</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">Certain rhizobacteria produce extracellular siderophores such as pseudobactin, which sequester iron and make it unavailable to disease causing microorganisms. Their growth is thereby inhibited, and so that of plants they infect (e.g. potatoes, carrots) is promoted as their diseases are controlled.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Three hydroxamate groups are contained in the clinically important desferrioxamine B, which is used for the treatment of iron overload diseases (<a href="#sec7.8">Section 7.8</a>). The siderophores are too large to permeate the water filled channels of the outer membrane so they are recognized there by receptor proteins and thereby are moved across the inner membrane to the cytoplasm by an ATP driven reaction (<a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). A vexing problem for some time has been understanding how the iron is released from the ligand. One reasonable idea is that the Fe(III) complex is reduced enzymatically to the Fe(II) form which is known to dissociate (to Fe<sup>2+</sup> + free ligand) much more easily <i>(K</i> ~ 10 M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) than does the oxidized form.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Iron in vertebrates</h3>
<p class="noindent">This discussion is concerned mainly with the transport and storage of iron in humans. In vertebrate species, iron is efficiently recycled and little is absorbed from the diet or is excreted. Only about 1&#x0025; of the body&#x2032;s iron is being used at any time. The remainder is stored. Proteins are used here for the storage and transport of iron and by this means, the sequestering of Fe prevents its easy access and use by parasitic microorganisms.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Transferrin</h3>
<p class="noindent">Iron is transported from the stomach to the various sites for metabolic action by transferrin. It is a glycoprotein, MW&#x223C;80 kDa, consisting of two homologous lobes. Each lobe is made up of two domains which contain a single high affinity metal binding site in the interdomain cleft. One iron is present in each lobe and the two irons are similar structurally (<a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>) but behave differently. The irons are buried about 10<img src="../images/in50_a.jpg" alt="images"/> below the protein surface and are strongly bound <i>(K</i> &#x223C; 10<sup>20</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>).There is an important hinge motion in the protein associated with the addition of Fe(III) and <img src="../images/in50_01.jpg" alt="images"/> to apolactoferrin. This results in the transferrin receptor proteins (which are membrane-bound) recognizing iron containing Iactoferrin but not the apo form. As with the siderophores, it is uncertain how iron is released, but lowered pH and <img src="../images/in50_01.jpg" alt="images"/> may play a role. Once in the cell, the iron is used quickly for enzyme and heme manufacture or for storage by ferritin.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Ferritin</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although iron has been detected in the brain as magnetite, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, it is stored in animals (also in plants and some bacteria) mainly in a non-toxic form in a remarkable piece of biological machinery called ferritin. In humans, it is especially high in concentration (&#x223C;0.1 M) in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Ferritins are a family of large, approximately spherical (diameter &#x223C;130 <img src="../images/in50_a.jpg" alt="images"/>), proteins enclosing a mineral core of &#x223C;75 <img src="../images/in50_a.jpg" alt="images"/> in diameter, most of which is not directly bound to the protein.

<p class="noindent">The trace amounts of most transition metals present in the body makes the study of the mechanisms of their transport and storage extremely difficult. Metallothioneins are used extensively in the animal and plant kingdoms. They are rich in cysteine and therefore have a preference for soft metal ions such as Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, for which they act <i>in vivo</i> as homeostatic control agents. The production of metallothioneins is induced by a number of toxic transition metals (Cd, Hg, Ag, Au) which activate the transcription of specific genes. These proteins thus also act as detoxifying agents. The structures of metallothioneins have been thoroughly examined both in solution (NMR) and as solids (X-ray crystallography, EXAFS), <a href="#fig7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>. The value of metallothioneins as metal ion carriers is consistent with the observations that they interchange metal readily within the cluster, and easily exchange their metal ions with metal ions in other clusters and with free metal ions in solution.</p>

<p class="noindent">The binding of a Pt(II) complex to DNA is an important first step in its anticancer effect (<a href="#sec7.8">Section 7.8</a>).

If the chelates are planar heterocyclic ligands, they will often intercalate, usually in a major groove; that is they stack in between DNA base pairs (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>) and in the process distort the DNA helix. Most complexes, and small molecules in general, will associate with DNA in the minor groove. However, they can be made to intercalate by attachment of the metal complex to an intercalator, an example of which is the specifically designed complex MPE-Fe(II) (<a href="#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>). Reaction of this complex with H202 and a reducing agent generates hydroxyl radicals. Since the methidium segment (the aromatic portion of the molecule) intercalates randomly in DNA, the sugar segments on the DNA will be oxidized randomly by the hydroxy radicals. MPE-Fe(II) is therefore a footprinting agent for large and small molecules.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Metalloproteins</h3>
<p class="noindent">In their interactions with nucleic acids, the metal ion or metal cluster portion of a protein may have a catalytic, structural or regulatory role. These metalloproteins can function in both repair and transcription processes. Endonuclease III is a DNA repair enzyme that removes oxidized pyrimidines from DNA and leaves a single stranded nick at that point. The enzyme contains an Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster which is distant from the DNA binding site in the protein. The cluster is very stable toward oxidation and reduction (which is very unusual, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#tab6.2">Table 6.2</a>) and probably acts only to position certain basic residues in the enzyme so that they can interact with the DNA. In this respect, the Fe4S4 cluster plays a similar role to that of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in zinc fingers. An example of the latter is the transcription factor IIIA (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>). Nine fingers exist in IIIA and each finger binds to appropriate regions of DNA and RNA. Since the discovery of the first zinc finger in the mid 1980s, very many more such eukaryotic regulatory proteins, with different zinc binding patterns, have been found in many species. They contain any number from 2 to 40 tandem fingers which can interact with DNA in a number of ways (usually at a major groove). This variety allows the cell to cleverly produce a vast collection of different transcription factors by changing the order and number of modules (&#x2018;pick and mix&#x2019;).</p>

<p class="indent">Metalloregulatory proteins may also act as triggers, repressing or activating transcription depending on the concentration of the metal ion. The MerR system regulates mercury resistance in bacteria, which depends on the expression of Hg detoxification genes. In the absence of Hg(II), MerR binds tightly to the promoter and thus inhibits its binding by RNA polymerases. Hg(II), even in low concentration (nM), binds specifically and tightly to DNA-bound MerR, promotes a conformational change (some unwinding) which now facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase and so induces the expression of the gene family and the production of detoxifying enzymes. A number of systems involving gene expression are now known to respond to metal ions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The specificity to a metal ion requires that an unusual geometry, specific for that metal ion, must exist in the metal regulatory protein. In the case of MerR this appears to be a 3 cys <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Chapter 7 The d-block &#x2014; nonredox chemistry</a>site in a trigonal plane, which does not easily accommodate other soft metal ions such as Zn(II) and Ag(I).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Clinical use of ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ligands, and particularly organic chelating agents, have a very special clinical role in handling the transition metal ions in the body and in facilitating their external administration. Chelating ligands have been used to:</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Gold has been used to treat leprosy, rheumatic fever, tuberculosis and even mortality. Au(l) compounds are used as antirheumatic agents but side effects can be severe. The mechanisms of action are unclear.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">(a) remove damaging metal ions</p>
<p class="noindent">For this purpose a ligand which can bind strongly to the metal ion in question is required. In addition, it should be quite specific for that metal so that other beneficial metal ions are not removed. The resulting complex should be non-toxic and water soluble so that it can be easily excreted. Excess, and potentially lethal, amounts of metal ions can accumulate in the body for various reasons. Copper accumulation in the liver and the brain arising from a genetic misfunction in the copper storage system in the body (Wilson&#x0027;s disease) can be up to 10&#x2013;15 grams instead of the normal 100&#x2013;150 mg. This constitutes a potential disaster (dementia and eventual death) which can be controlled by the administration of (for life, unfortunately) approximately one gram daily of D-penicillamine (the L- form is toxic). Yet another genetic disorder (thalassemia) can lead to the body being unable to synthesize one or more globin chains correctly. Blood transfusions are necessary to correct the deficiency, but this treatment itself leads to the accumulation of toxic amounts of iron in the body, rising to as much as 70 grams in 10 years where normally it is 4&#x2013;5 grams. Chelation therapy, using the siderophore desferrioxamine B (Desferal), <a href="#fig7.8">Fig. 7.8</a>, can reduce the iron concentration to reasonable amounts, but painful multiintravenous injections are necessary.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Thalassemia: Derived from <i>thalassa</i> (Gk. sea) since originally thallassaemia was diagnosed in children from the Mediterranean area. It is now known to be widely distributed. A 26 year old Chinese sufferer who had over 400 blood transfusions is reported to have set off the metal detector at an airport security checkpoint because of his high iron content. Without treatment, few patients reach the age of ten. With a combination of transfusions and administration of desferrioxamine, patients are still surviving in the 25 years or so since this clinical procedure was adopted.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Therapy</i>: Behind the present day use of <i>cis</i>-Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (cisplatin), <a href="#tab7.3">Table 7.3</a>, as an effective agent for the treatment of certain types of cancers is a fascinating story of an accidental discovery of an unusual phenomenon, tenacious follow up of the implications and finally the production of a drug of great clinical value. A great deal of research has now shown that an effective cytostatic platinum complex must have a square planar disposition of the four ligands around Pt(II), with two c/s-primary or secondary amine ligands and two (relatively easily hydrolysed) chloride or carboxylate groups. The fundamental effectiveness of cisplatin stems from its ability to bind to DNA (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>) and block replication. The major product is Pt(II) bound to adjacent N7 guanines on the same strand to form a chelate complex (intrastrand crosslink, <a href="#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>). This binding disrupts base-base stacking interactions in DNA and finally leads to a kink in the B-DNA helix, which induces binding of specific cellular proteins (other platinum complexes cannot do this). The precise mechanism after this stage is uncertain and complex. One possibility is that the platinum-invoked lesions are repaired faster in non-tumor tissue, leading to the death of the cancer cells.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-23.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">An electric field was found to inhibit bacterial cell division, but not growth. This effect was traced to a platinum complex, formed from the partial dissolution of the Pt from the electrodes into the medium. This very surprising result led to the discovery that the Pt(ll) complex was a very effective antitumour agent. Serendipity is a common occurrence in science. Genius lies in the appreciation and exploitation of a lucky discovery. For a full account consult Further Reading.</p>

This may be related to differences in their DNA-binding characteristics (interstrand crosslinks and nonbending). Proton and <sup>15</sup>N NMR have been very useful for investigating the speciation and reactivity of the Pt(II) drugs in <i>intact</i> biological fluids.
