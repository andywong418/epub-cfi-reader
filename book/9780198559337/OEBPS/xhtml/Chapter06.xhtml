<p class="noindent">The d-block of elements (transition elements) are a family of metals with, generally, similar characteristics. They represent the transition between the highly electropositive s-block metals and the electronegative p-block non-metals. The first row dominates the biologically important transition metals. The electronic configurations are:</p>
<figure class="figure">
<img src="../images/38_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Their behaviour as ions in solution is predominantly coordination and redox chemistry. The transition elements (particularly the middle members of the class) exhibit variable oxidation states. Iron, for example, can exist in oxidation states of II, III, IV and VI, although these are of variable stability. Iron (II) has the 3d<sup>6</sup> electronic configuration. The octahedral arrangement of the six d electrons can be in two dispositions and this possible dichotomy plays an important role in iron-protein chemistry (<a href="#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>). Antiferromagnetic coupling (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.5">Section 3.5</a>) of two Fe(III) ions leads to diamagnetism. A pair of Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions coupled in this way behave like an isolated metal centre with a single unpaired electron and an EPR spectrum which exhibits three <i>g</i> values.</p>

<p class="indent">The transition elements are invariably present in biological material as coordination complexes, with ligands ranging from cellular components such as H<sub>2</sub>0, small organic molecules and porphyrins, to the side chains of amino acids. All types of donor atoms can be coordinated by this versatile group of cations. The transition metal ions differ from the alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions in significant respects. They can usually be easily monitored. They tend to hydrolyse at physiological pHs, <a href="#eq6.1">eqn 6.1</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This hydrolysis must be prevented by metal ion chelation, a necessity in the storage and transport of transition metal ions in living systems (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.5">Section 7.5</a>). Finally, unlike the s-block elements, they have a rich redox chemistry (except zinc). The important redox active metals in biochemistry are Fe (by far the leader), Cu and Mo. V, Co and Mn are also used, but much less often. Zinc, which is very important in other respects, exists only in the +2 oxidation <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 6 The d-block &#x2013; redox chemistry</a>state. The d-block metal ions can be associated both with small molecule binding and oxidoreductase enzyme activity (<a href="#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>). Alternatively the metal centre may act <i>solely</i> as a conduit for electron transfer (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>). The latter apparently is the function of Cu in the blue (type-1) copper proteins, typified by plastocyanins (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a>). In plants and certain aljpe, they transfer electrons from a cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f complex to P700 in photosynthesis (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>). In multisite metalloenzymes, one metal centre may function to shuttle electrons to another metal site where substrate binding and reaction occurs. Examples of this, which we will meet later, are cytochrome c oxidase, the FeMo protein in nitrogenase and probably the Mn<sub>4</sub> cluster in photosystem II. Redox and many other reactions take place in the cell in organelles (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>).</p>

Other organelles (not shown) aid in protein synthesis, as does the nucleus which fills a large part of the cell.

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electron donor and acceptor centres</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a relatively limited number of types of moieties which act solely as electron donors and acceptors. These include cytochromes and other metal porphyrin-containing molecules and iron-sulfur centres. We will also encounter organic redox coenzymes in this section, because they often act in conjuction with metal centres.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Cytochromes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Cytochromes are heme proteins in which the electron transfer is typically between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms. Those termed a, b and c predominate and differ in the peripheral groups on the porphyrin or in the mode of attachment of the porphyrin to the protein (<a href="#tab6.1">Table 6.1</a>). We have already encountered porphyrin b (protoporphyrin IX) in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">Sections 2.1</a> and <a href="#sec6.2">6.2</a>. The much less common cytochromes d have one or two dihydroreduced porphyrin rings and a</p>

<p class="noindent">variety of peripheral groups. There has been a good deal of confusion in the nomenclature of cytochromes, arising from the haphazard history of their discoveries. Consider cytochrome f, a part of the cytochrome b6f complex which functions in photosynthesis (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>), and got its name from <i>frons</i> (Lat. leaf). It is in fact a c-type cytochrome with the heme attached to two cysteines. The fifth ligand is his but the sixth is, surprisingly, a terminal peptide NH<sub>2</sub> group. In addition, the structure of cyt f is dominated by P-sheets and not a-helices, which are normally found in cytochromes. Numeric or maximum absorption wavelength (of the reduced cytochrome) subscripts are further subclassification ploys. Axial groups, typically met and his residues from the protein backbone, usually complete the octahedral coordination around the iron. This tight coordination prevents binding of small molecules and allows the entity to act solely as an electron carrier. Electron transfer involving the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states is facile since there is little structural change during the redox reaction (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Some enzymes are incorrectly referred to as cytochromes, e.g. cytochrome P-450. A cytochrome may also act in concert with one or more additional cofactor(s). Ubiquinol cyt c reductase (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>), for example, contains a diheme cyt b<sub>1</sub> and one cyt c, as well as an FeS cluster (see next section). The structures of several eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytochromes c (from horse, tuna and other species) show striking similarities in being relatively small and globular. There are few similarities among their amino acid sequences, but certain internal glycines and lysines near the heme and other functionally important residues are retained. A useful structure has obviously been conserved during evolutionary change.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Iron&#x2013;sulfur centres</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">tetrahedral arrangement around the metal ion. Several of these arrangements are known, as shown in Table 6.2, which includes the one iron&#x2013;sulfur protein with only cysteine ligands. More than one cluster of the same or different <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Chapter 6 The d-block &#x2013; redox chemistry</a>type, as well as other redox active groups, may be present in one protein (e.g. hydrogenases, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.3">Section 8.3</a>). They are particularly effective redox centres since they exhibit a range of potentials from approximately +350 mV to &#x2013;600 mV. They are therefore found as components in many processes involving electron carrier activity, where they are termed <i>ferredoxins</i> (Fd), as well as in classical oxidoreductase enzymes. Until recently it was believed that FeS centres only had a redox role in biology, but they are now known to function in nonredox enzymes (Table 7.2) and to also have a structural role in the DNA repair enzyme, endonuclease III (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.6">Section 7.6</a>). They therefore constitute one of the more important prosthetic groupings. MCD, EPR <i>(g</i> values) and Mossbauer (isomer shifts) spectroscopies have been very valuable in diagnosing the structures and assigning oxidation and spin states to Fe in the FeS proteins. Modelling has also been important, since the (almost too good to be true!) discovery that FeS clusters form spontaneously when certain iron and sulfur compounds are mixed.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec6.2.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Organic cofactors</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Since several electrons are required in the reduction of certain substrates (e.g. four for O<sub>2</sub> and six for N<sub>2</sub>) it is obviously necessary in some cases for there to be more than one redox centre in the protein to accomplish this. There are a limited number of oxidation states easily attainable with a particular transition metal, so that linking these with other (organic) redox centres aids in the stepwise transfer of electrons. Important organic cofactors are shown in <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>. Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and plastoquinone function as electron acceptors in the electron-transport and photosynthetic chains respectively (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>). These quinones, as well as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), can form stable semiquinone radical species and 2e<sup>&#x2013;</sup> reduced hydroquinones (e.g. for ubiquinone, <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a> and <a href="#eq6.2">eqn 6.2</a>) . The le<sup>&#x2013;</sup> reduced semiquinones are important for the transfer of single electrons particularly when, as in complex III in the respiratory chain (<a href="#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>), the primary source of electrons, namely nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), is only capable of 2e<sup>&#x2013;</sup> transfer (<a href="#eq6.3">eqn 6.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The protein itself may provide centres which can take part in one electron changes and act in concert with redox centres. Radicals derived from cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan and glycine side chains in the protein have been implicated as intermediates in metalloenzyme mechanisms. Galactose oxidase catalyses the two electron oxidation of RCH<sub>2</sub>OH to RCHO by O<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#tab6.4">Table 6.4</a>) . For some time it had been believed that the redox change during catalysis involved Cu(I) and Cu(III). The higher oxidation state of copper, although not common, has been well established in simple Cu(III) complexes. However, there is now substantial evidence that the oxidized active form of the enzyme contains Cu(II) and a tyrosyl radical (A in <a href="#eq6.4">eqn 6.4</a>). B is an intermediate in the proposed mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of <b>RCH<sub>2</sub>OH</b> to <b>RCHO</b> via the ketyl radical, R<sup>*</sup>CHO<sup>&#x2013;</sup>.</p>

These metalloenzymes use O<sub>2</sub>, <img src="../images/in31_3.jpg" alt="images"/> and <img src="../images/in31_4.jpg" alt="images"/> as oxidants (oxidases) in aerobic organisms and <img src="../images/in31_5.jpg" alt="images"/> and other oxidants in anaerobic systems, which are much less well characterized. The hydrogenases use H<sub>2</sub> as the reductant (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.3">Section 8.3</a>). Oxidoreductases act on a wide variety of substrates and a cofactor is often also employed. We have already encountered superoxide dismutase (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a>) which catalyses the disproportionation of <img src="../images/in30_1.jpg" alt="images"/>, a reaction which can be considered as an intermolecular redox reaction.</p>

Most of the enzymes have had their structures solved by X-ray crystallography and in these cases their source is indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Monooxygenases catalyse the insertion of a single oxygen atom from O<sub>2</sub> into a substrate and the reduction of the other O atom to water. Dioxygenases, in contrast, catalyse the insertion of both O<sub>2</sub> oxygen atoms into the substrate. Cytochrome P-450 (Table 6.3) is a very important example of a monooxygenase. It is responsible for catalysing the conversion of endogenous lipophilic bile acids and hormones, as well as exogenous drugs such as barbituates, codeine and others to water soluble products. These are more easily eliminated from the body because the conversion of C&#x2013;H to C&#x2013;OH has been effected. The crystal structure of bacterial P-450<sub>cam</sub> (the enzyme whose specific substrate is camphor) is known and the catalytic mechanism is well understood. We reproduce the catalytic cycle in <a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a> to show the importance of the oxidation and spin state of the iron and the general machinations of the metal centre and substrate which must occur in order to effect the transformations carried out by the active site. Although there are similar considerations for many other metal-containing oxidoreductases, the details will, of course, differ.</p>

Subsequent events will be strongly influenced by the environment of the iron, provided by the protein, in ways which are still incompletely understood. If, for example, the pocket in which the heme sits is strongly hydrophobic, it will then be protected from access by hydrophilic substances (e.g. anions) and the PFe(II)&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub> entity is likely to be relatively stable. Such a protein can function as a storer or transporter of O<sub>2</sub>, e.g. myoglobin and hemoglobin (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.7">Section 8.7</a>). If on the other hand reduction (and protonation) of the O<sub>2</sub> in the PFe&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub> complex cannot be prevented, then a ferric hydroperoxy compound Fe(III)&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub>H<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is formed. This undergoes heterolytic O&#x2013;O bond cleavage to produce a very reactive species, probably <sup>&#x2022;</sup>PFe(IV)O (<a href="#eq6.5">eqn 6.5</a>), in which iron is in the +4 oxidation state and the porphyrin has been one-electron oxidized, as in for example P-450, <a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>. A similar species might be expected, and does indeed arise, in the reactions of the PFe(HI) moiety in peroxidase and catalase, with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#eq6.6">eqn 6.6</a>). Heterolytic cleavage of the coordinated O&#x2013;O moiety is aided by electron donation from the electron rich cys axial ligand in P-450 and by judicious placement of polar residues near the Fe-0 sites in peroxidase and catalase (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). What now happens to the <sup>&#x2022;</sup>PFe(IV)O species? If the substrate binds close to the metal site, as has been shown to be the case with P-450<sub>cam</sub>, <i>oxygen atom transfer</i> from the <sup>&#x2022;</sup>PFe(IV)O to the bound substrate can occur and the resting form of the enzyme, PFe(III) is reformed (<a href="#eq6.5">eqn 6.5</a>). With catalase and peroxidase however, the structural details around the heme site, particularly its being highly polar, prevent substrate, usually lipophilic, from binding close to the Fe. Therefore, only electron transfer (two sequential steps) occurs in forming the final product (<a href="#eq6.6">eqns 6.6</a> and <a href="#eq6.7">6.7</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electron movement in metalloproteins</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have already examined the extremely important group of oxidoreductases which catalyse electron transfer reactions. In addition, electron movement is required in such different processes as respiration, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, and in these, redox centres pass on electrons to neighbours but are not themselves involved with substrates. The transfer of electrons is sometimes coupled with proton transfer which may then be used in the synthesis of ATP. The movement of electrons in biological systems can occur over large distances, as much as 15 <img src="../images/in30_3.jpg" alt="images"/> or more.</p>
<p class="indent">There is extensive use of a variety of electron transfer proteins in (a) the last stage of the catabolism of carbohydrates (the electron transport chain) and in (b) the initial stage of the photosynthetic production of carbohydrates (the light dependent stage, <a href="#eq6.8">eqn 6.8</a>). In (a) CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as reducing equivalents (e<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) in the form of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, arise from the enzymatically catalysed breakdown of carbohydrates by H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are then transferred through a chain to finally convert O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O. In (b), by contrast, H<sub>2</sub>O is converted into O<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup> and electrons via a photoexcited centre. The electrons are then transferred stepwise to produce NADPH, the reducing power of which is used to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into carbohydrates in the later (light independent) steps. The electron transfer chains in (a) and (b) also fulfil an important role in aiding in the enzymatically catalysed synthesis of ATP from ADP. The energy released (exergonic) in the hydrolysis of ATP can be used to drive reactions requiring the input of energy (endergonic).</p>

<p class="indent">Electron transfer may be <i>between</i> two molecules (intermolecular) or <i>within</i> a single molecule (intramolecular). Because in an intermolecular reaction there is necessarily some interaction between two molecules prior to electron transfer (the quantitative aspects of which are not always easy to assess) it is somewhat easier theoretically to examine intramolecular electron transfer. The important parameters which affect rates of electron transfer are:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the potential drive underlying the electron transfer (free energy of reaction, <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/>);</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the reorganization energies (<img src="../images/in30_12.jpg" alt="images"/>) required to have bond lengths and extents of solvation in the oxidised and reduced centres equalized in the transition state so that electron transfer can occur;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the distance (<i>D</i>) between the redox centres.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, this is the distance between the centres of the atoms at the edges of the donor and acceptor moieties. In addition, the parameter <i>D</i> will be <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 6 The d-block &#x2013; redox chemistry</a>modified by a term &#x03B2;, which is a measure of the effectiveness of the medium in the electronic coupling of donor and acceptor. The shortest possible distance will be at van der Waals contact (<i>D</i><sub>o</sub> = 3.6 <img src="../images/in30_15.jpg" alt="images"/>).</p>
<p class="indent">An expression relating these parameters has been derived in which the rate constant (<i>k</i>, s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) for intramolecular electron transfer is given by:</p>
<p class="equation" id="eq6.18"><img src="../images/eq_30_6.18.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent">where <i>A</i> is a constant, ~10<sup>13</sup>. Examination of <a href="#eq6.18">eqn 6.18</a> shows that for a particular reaction pair (constant <i>D</i>) the value of <i>k</i> will increase as <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/> increases, reaching a maximum (<i>k</i><sub>max</sub>) when <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/> = <img src="../images/in30_12.jpg" alt="images"/>. Thereafter, as <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/> increases (&#x003E;<img src="../images/in30_12.jpg" alt="images"/>), the value of <i>k</i> will decrease. The prediction of this so called &#x2018;inverted region&#x2019; which intuitively seems so unlikely, has been confirmed in several systems and has led to universal acceptance of the fundamental concept embodied in <a href="#eq6.18">eqn 6.18</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us apply this concept to a biological system in which there are a number of different pairs of donor and acceptor sites and each pair is separated by a different distance. We can use the system to experimentally test the linear relationship which exists (<a href="#eq6.18">eqn 6.18</a>) between log <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>D</i>, <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> being used so as to correct for the <img src="../images/in30_16.jpg" alt="images"/> and <img src="../images/in30_12.jpg" alt="images"/> terms, i.e. eliminate the term containing them. The photosynthetic reaction centre from the bacterium <i>Rhodopseudomonas viridis</i> (see above) is one such system. Distances between several of the redox sites in the system and the attendant <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> values for electron transfer are known. For example, there is a physiologically important electron transfer from photoreduced bacteropheophytin (BPh<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) to a quinone Q<sub>A</sub> site over a distance of 9.6 <img src="../images/in30_15.jpg" alt="images"/> (compare PSII in <a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>). If the native quinone is replaced by a quinone with a different <i>E<sup>&#x00B0;</sup></i> value, this will impose a different <img src="../images/in30_16.jpg" alt="images"/> value. If the rate constants are measured for electron transfer from BPh<sup>&#x2013;</sup> to the various quinone derivatives, a value of <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> for that particular transfer and distance <i>D</i> can be calculated using <a href="#eq6.18">eqn 6.18</a>. Figure 6.10 shows the plot of log <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> <i>vs D</i> for electron transfer between a number of redox pairs within the photosynthetic centre of <i>Rp</i>. <i>viridis</i>. An excellent linear plot is obtained extending over a 20 <img src="../images/in30_15.jpg" alt="images"/> difference in the electron path distance. The value of <i>A</i> is 10<sup>13</sup> s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, the rate constant at van der Waals contact and the value of &#x03B2; is 1.4 <img src="../images/in30_17.jpg" alt="images"/>. A number of other systems have also been examined. These include cytochrome c and azurin in which modifications have been made to enable electron transfer to be measured between the metal site and specific amino acid residues within the molecule. Although some individual values of <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> vs <i>D</i> lie reasonably well on the line of <a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>, a much lower value (1.1 <img src="../images/in30_17.jpg" alt="images"/>) for the slope (&#x2013;&#x03B2;) is observed for the modified cytochrome c and azurin. This lower value for the &#x03B2; factor means that donor-acceptor electronic coupling decays much more slowly when &#x03B2;&#x2013;strands separate the reaction centres (as is largely the case in azurin) than when &#x03B1;-helices predominate as in the photosynthetic reaction centre. Therefore, although an approximately exponential relationship holds between rate constant and distance for electron transfer within many biological materials, the nature of the medium plays an important role, and this is being actively investigated. <a id="page_56" class="page">Page56, Chapter 6 The d-block &#x2013; redox chemistry</a></p>

<p class="indent">We now return to the chain reactions of the previous sections. From <a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a> there is roughly a tenfold change in rate for a 1.7 <img src="../images/in30_15.jpg" alt="images"/> change in distance. This means that the rates of electron transfer across the 25&#x2013;30 <img src="../images/in30_15.jpg" alt="images"/> distances which separate some of the respiratory chain complexes would be much too slow (half-lives of seconds to days) to be of practical value. The difficulty is obviated by using a series of intervening redox centres. The &#x2018;inverted region&#x2019; predicted by <a href="#eq6.18">eqn 6.18</a> above may be important in photosynthesis. The initial charge separation (see <a href="#eq6.14">eqn 6.14</a>) <img src="../images/in30_18.jpg" alt="images"/> which is the precursor to the productive electron transfer chain, is maintained in spite of a competing and non-productive charge recombination back to the ground state. This is surprising in view of the similar distances involved and a large <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/> value associated with the latter process. It may well be that the large <img src="../images/in30_14.jpg" alt="images"/> value forces the charge recombination reaction into the &#x2018;inverted region* with an attendant slower rate. In this way the rate of charge recombination is less competitive with the rate of charge separation.</p>
