<p class="sidebar-left">Calcium ion indicators must function at neutral pH and be sensitive to small Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration changes, such as 0.1&#x03BC;M (resting cell), increasing to 1&#x2013;10 &#x03BC;M after a message is transmitted. Certain fluorescent dyes or photoproteins like aequorin (from jellyfish) which emit light on binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> are responsive even in the presence of large concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Using a complex fluorescence microscope and living cells or tissue on the microscope stage, it is possible to follow the fluctuations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations <i>in vivo</i> (heartbeat, external stimulations).</p>

<p class="indent">The values refer to the &#x2018;bare&#x2019; ion denuded of any solvation. The aquated ion includes inner shell coordination and outer shell attraction of solvent molecules. As these ions have no unpaired electrons, they are diamagnetic and colourless and therefore monitoring them presents formidable problems. The use of NMR (<sup>23</sup>Na) or replacing the metal with more easily analysed ones (Ca<sup>2+</sup> by Eu<sup>3+</sup>) have been profitable techniques. However, for the detection of rapid changes in concentration (important for the analysis of Ca signalling), the use of fluorescent indicators that specifically bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thereby attenuate the observed fluorescence, has been especially helpful. The s-cations are generally poor complexers (Ca<sup>2+</sup> is by far the best) and require strong binding, and therefore, chelating or macrocyclic ligands or proteins to form very stable entities. They are hard cations (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>) and generally have an affinity for O donor ligands, although Mg<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated to N donors in some very important molecules. The aquated Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are extremely labile, that is their coordinated waters exchange rapidly with ligands in aqueous solution, <i>k</i> &#x007E; 10<sup>8</sup>s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>.

With the exception of Na<sup>+</sup>, the s-block cations tend to function mainly as stabilizers of biomaterials (e.g., Mg<sup>2+</sup> with nucleic acids, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.4">Section 5.4</a>) and stabilizers of, and initiators of conformational changes in, proteins (Ca<sup>2+</sup> with numerous proteins). Calcium helps in the unfolding of trypsinogen and the subsequent cleavage to trypsin, which is then stabilized toward hydrolysis by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Magnesium and calcium ions are used to crosslink and stabilize the outer cell wall, accounting for the ability of chelating agents to disrupt cell membranes by reacting with and thus removing these metal ions. Cations of the s-block, except Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.5">Section 5.5</a>), are rarely found as the tightly bound metal in a metalloenzyme and in this respect they differ markedly from the d-block cations (Chapters 6 and 7). However, they do bind weakly to proteins and thereby play an essential role, either by linking substrate (S) to the enzyme (E) [S&#x2013;M<sup><i>n</i>+</sup>&#x2013;E] to help orientate it for reaction or by modifying the substrate in forming the entity [M<sup><i>n</i>+</sup>&#x2013;S&#x2013;E]. Although intracellular roles for calcium predominate, the higher concentration of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a>) allows it to associate with weakly binding proteins such as prothrombin, which can bind to certain cell membrane platelets in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is an essential step in the complex chain of interconnected processes, involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> and many enzymes and proenzymes, which leads to blood coagulation.</p>

<h2 class="h2" id="sub5.3"><b>5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The transport of ions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Metal ions must frequently be moved between different parts of multicellular organisms. In the body, alkali metal ions in particular, but also alkaline earth cations, can be transported in serum as the aquated ion because they are soluble at physiological pH and therefore do not precipitate as the aquated transition metal ions would. The different distribution of cations inside and outside the cell (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a>) means that metal ions must therefore be constantly transferred across the plasma membrane (<a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>) which encloses the cell, to maintain homeostasis and a healthy cell. Transport is no problem for gases (e.g. O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>) and organic compounds like steroids since these are membrane soluble. Small molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>O, urea and anions (e.g. Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, <img src="../images/in31_1.jpg" alt="images"/>) can also move through transient gaps in the membrane, or through <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter 5 The s-block</a>tunnels in the membrane proteins, by diffusion from regions of higher to lower concentrations. The transfer of the hydrophilic cations Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the central hydrophobic region of the membrane is quite another matter and is still incompletely understood. There are in essence three transmembrane transport mechanisms for these cations:</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption31-justify-60"><b>Fig. 5.1</b> Edge of a plasma membrane. Lipid bilayers are dynamic and fluid since they are composed of many separate molecules. The membrane separates the protoplasm from a hostile environment and in addition regulates the transport of species in and out of the cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">(a) The cation may be encapsulated within a ligand, called an ionophore (<a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>), resulting in the formation of a complex with many organic groups (e.g. &#x2013;Me) on its periphery. These complexes, because of their hydrophobic sheath, can diffuse across the fatty-membrane, although they cannot function at temperatures below which the membrane becomes stiff. This problem does not arise with the next mode of ion transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A channel or tunnel may exist in a polypeptide or protein which spans the membrane. The cation will move down the hydrophilic channel, perhaps with transient interactions with donor atoms (carbonyl groups) from the polypeptide. Gramicidin forms such a channel. It occurs in a variety of conformations depending on the physical environment; i.e. solid or in organic solvents. In the phospholipid membrane, a channel is made up of dimers of single stranded &#x03B2;-helical gramicidin monomers in which terminal formyl NH groups of each monomer are H bonded. It forms a central hole 4 &#x00C5; in diameter and about 50 &#x00C5; in length spanning the lipid bilayer and allowing the passage of <i>monovalent</i> (including H<sup>+</sup>) cations (<a href="#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">These methods, (a) and (b), are &#x2018;passive&#x2019; since ions flow in the direction of the concentration gradient. In contrast, the third method of transfer, (c), <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 5 The s-block</a>termed active ion pump, moves ions against the normal distribution and therefore requires the input of energy from the cell.</p>

<p class="noindent">(Note the involvement of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions with the nucleotides). The net flow of K<sup>+</sup> into and Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell is counter to the normal concentration gradients, but constantly required. The necessary energy is derived from Mg<sup>2+</sup> catalysed ATP hydrolysis (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.10">Section 8.10</a>). There are a number of different ion pumps at various locations, coupled so as to give movement in the same <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 5 The s-block</a>(symport) or opposite directions (antiport). The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport uses respiratory H<sup>+</sup> gradients (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>) to generate transmembrane gradients and acts to maintain pH. An H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> antiport coupled to a K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> symport is used to maintain stomach acidity (pH &#x2248; 1). Once inside the cell, these cations require ligands or proteins to carry them for use or storage. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as a vital secondary messenger (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.5">Section 5.5</a>) the initiation, propagation and termination of the calcium signal is particularly complex. Several transport proteins (calcium binding proteins), storage proteins (calsequestrin) and membrane translocation proteins (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases) are required and the processes involved are far from understood.</p>

<h2 class="h2" id="sub5.4"><b>5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Magnesium, nucleotides and nucleic acids</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the major functions of Mg<sup>2+</sup> arises from it being able to interact with anions in nucleotides (ATP, ADP) and polynucleotides (nucleic acids, DNA and RNA). Indeed most (90%) of intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> is bound to ribosomes (the RNA-protein complexes that mediate protein synthesis) or polynucleotides. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, many RNAs exist in partially denatured states. Addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> initiates formation of the native structure within minutes. Both DNA and RNA polymerases, which catalyse, respectively, the replication and transcription of DNA, have a specific requirement for Zn<sup>2+</sup> as well as another divalent cation, usually Mg<sup>2+</sup> but sometimes Mn<sup>2+</sup>. One can in fact study some Mg<sup>2+</sup>&#x2013;containing proteins by replacing Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the EPR active Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion. The association of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with nucleic acids is necessary for nerve impulse transmissions, the metabolism of carbohydrates and muscle contraction. It was only about ten years ago that it was shown that a non-protein, namely RNA, could function as an enzyme. In all ribozymes (as they are called) so far examined, a divalent metal ion, often Mg<sup>2+</sup>, is essential, so that these represent a new class of metalloenzyme. They catalyse a variety of reactions involving RNA and DNA molecules. Mg<sup>2+</sup> features in the chemistry in ways similar to those seen in metalloproteins, as well as helping the secondary structure of RNA to fold into its active tertiary structure. The metal ion stabilizes the structure by neutralizing the charges on the extended polyanions. The study of the folding pathways in proceeding from a linear polyanionic chain of nucleotides to the final compact structure of a ribozyme induced by adding Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, showed that the mechanism resembled that of multidomain proteins. That is, formation of independent stable substructures preceeds the folding into their final conformation. The resolution of a recent crystal structure of the hammerhead ribozyme substrate complex was too low to detect the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, so its role is still uncertain. However, catalytic (Lewis acid cleavage of a P&#x2013;O bond) and stabilizing functions have been proposed.</p>
<p class="indent">Bacterial exonuclease III is used in DNA repair. The enzyme searches for damaged sites along the DNA helix. It then &#x2018;flips out&#x2019; the incorrect bases (misincorporated during DNA synthesis or chemically damaged) from the interior of the DNA helix and cleaves the backbone. The cut DNA is then corrected and respliced by other enzymes. Exonuclease III binds to the flipped out base in a pocket near to the catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Calcium as a messenger</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A primary messenger is an extracellular agent, e.g. a hormonal or electrical signal, which initiates a response to an extracellular occurence. The signal is transmitted via a secondary messenger. Calcium acts as a secondary messenger intracellularly because its concentration can change rapidly in response to external stimuli. This concentration change is controlled by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein. One such protein is troponin C, which is part of the troponin complex of skeletal muscle thin filaments. A change in concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 10<sup>&#x2013;7</sup>M (resting cell) to 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup>M (stimulated by calcium entry) will induce binding of calcium to troponin C. This binding causes a conformational change in the protein which is transmitted to other protein components of the thin filaments, ultimately resulting in muscle contraction. The requirement of calcium for muscle contraction has been known for over a century. One other Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein of note is calmodulin, whose function, like that of troponin C, is triggered by a change of calcium ion concentration which initiates the activation or deactivation of a large number of proteins and enzymes (<a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>). Examples of such enzymes are NO synthase (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.9">Section 8.9</a>), NAD kinase used in the synthesis of NADP and adenylate and guanylate cyclases which catalyse the formation of</p>

The calcium binding proteins must associate specifically and rapidly with Ca<sup>2+</sup> since K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are present in much higher concentrations (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Calcium in extracellular enzymes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Calcium ion can also form an integral part of a number of extracellular enzymes. Since the extracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is millimolar (Table 5.2) it will bind substantially to a biomolecule even if the affinity constant is as low as 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. The metal ions may help stabilize the molecule as we have observed with trypsin (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.2">Section 5.2</a>). The three Ca<sup>2+</sup>ions present in one of the three domains formed by the folding of the barley &#x03B1;-amylase polypeptide chain are vital to the maintenance of the structural integrity of that domain. One Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is close to the surface of the protein and may have a catalytic role. Phospholipases are a group of digestive enzymes which catalyse the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids. They are present in high concentrations in intestinal juices and venoms. Catalysis is undoubtedly a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pancreatic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. This enzyme contains an hydrophobic channel that allows a phospholipid aggregate to reach the active site of the enzyme. Here there are key amino acids and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>ion, which is believed to stabilize an oxyanion transition state. In these enzymes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> shows its versatility with coordination numbers (O donor ligands) of 6, 7 and 8.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The digestion of starch begins with saliva in the mouth and continues in the small intestine under the influence of &#x03B1;-amylases, which convert it to small glucose polymers. Final conversion to glucose requires other enzymes. &#x03B1;-Amylases are used in paper manufacture and beer production.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Calcium biominerals and biomineralization</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Calcium is a major component of bones, teeth and shells largely because of the insolubility of calcium carbonates and phosphates at physiological pH (<a href="#tab5.4">Table 5.4</a>). Biominerals can be produced both internally and externally by living organisms and may be crystalline or amorphous. An inorganic/organic</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">Calcium from the blood stream can precipitate as a crust on damaged blood vessels and in the heart. This restricts blood flow, raises the blood pressure and can lead to heart attacks. The chelating ligand EDTA (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.8">Section 7.8</a>) in the form of Na<sub>2</sub>Mg EDTA has been suggested for use in dissolving these deposits, thus obviating expensive bypass surgery which is the usual method for correcting this serious problem.</p>

<p class="noindent">composite invariably results from the process, and this combination leads to the desired properties of hardness and flexibility. The composition might well vary during growth. For example, tooth enamel in infants is mainly a protein matrix, whereas by adulthood enamel is approximately 90% hydroxyapatite. Since the biomineral structure is controlled by the cell promoting it, an unusual structure for the biomineral may result. For example, strontium sulfate normally crystallizes as flat rhombs, but in the plankton <i>Acantharia</i>, twenty (exactly!) SrSO<sub>4</sub> single crystals assume complex shapes. Calcium <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 5 The s-block</a>dominates the biomineral world, silicon and iron (see also <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.5">Section 7.5</a>) being the only other elements with even comparable roles. Silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;H<sub>2</sub>O, is present in the defensive spikes used against predators in certain plants and grasses (stinging nettles!). Various iron oxides occur in the teeth of chitons, limpets and beavers, and magnetite acts as a direction sensor in certain bacteria. Biomineralization is a topic of great interest to a variety of scientists including geologists, biologists, medical practioners and inorganic chemists. Attempts are being made to prepare synthetic materials which will simulate natural materials, e.g. bone substitutes for clinical use. The understanding of the underlying principles controlling biomineralization will be necessary to achieve this goal.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although pharmaceuticals are usually associated with organic compounds, inorganic compounds, often simple, have been used in the treatment of many ailments, in some cases since ancient times (<a href="#tab5.5">Table 5.5</a>). An inorganic compound like sodium chloride is often used as an excipient. In some cases the metal ion is the important component (e.g. Li<sup>+</sup>). In other instances, the alkali or alkaline earth cations simply deliver the inorganic anion (e.g. <img src="../images/in31_2.jpg" alt="images"/>, OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>). Occasionally the compound, <i>in toto</i>, is vital (e.g. BaSO<sub>4</sub>).</p>
