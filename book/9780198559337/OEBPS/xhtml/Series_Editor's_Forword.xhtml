<p class="noindent" style="width:100%;">Life on this planet is based on the raw materials available. A substantial proportion of the Periodic Table is utilized within biology, with the roles of the elements being governed by their availability and position in the Periodic Table. Here inorganic chemistry blurs into biology and environmental science, and for many students acquires new life.</p>
<p class="indent" style="width:100%;">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series also provides the explanations and rationales that are the framework of Inorganic Chemistry. Patricia and Ralph Wilkins have provided a fascinating and authoritative description of the place of inorganic chemicals in biology. It will either match specialist courses on this subject or serve as a companion to descriptive inorganic chemistry courses.</p>
