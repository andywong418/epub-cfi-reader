<h1 class="chaptitle">3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The examination of the properties of metalloproteins</h1>
<p class="noindent">A thorough examination of the physical and chemical properties of most metalloproteins will yield information on their overall structure but more especially insight into details of the active site. Since the latter will quite often encompass the metal, a good deal of attention will focus on the metal ion and its immediate environs.</p>
<section id="sec3.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General features</h2>
<p class="noindent">The presence of a metal ion in a biomolecule has not always been easy to detect. It was 50 years after the the discovery of urease (the first protein to be crystallized) and sometime after the isolation of certain hydrogenases, that nickel was found to be present in both. The iron content, in particular, of a number of metalloproteins (several binuclear iron proteins, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a> and iron-sulfur proteins, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>) had been wrongly assessed at first (invariably underestimated), resulting in serious misjudgments of the number of irons present in the protein. Metal analyses of cytochrome c (cyt c) oxidase (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#tab6.3">Table 6.3</a>) indicate that in the purest preparations with the highest activity, the Cu/Fe ratio is 3:2 and not 2:2 as had been reported. This has been confirmed by a recent X-ray crystallographic study. The corrections have been made, largely because of the availability of improved analytical methods and a battery of spectroscopic techniques (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The methods for the determination of the basic characteristics of a metalloprotein are those which are applicable to all proteins (molecular weight, amino acid sequence etc.). With respect to the assessment of molecular weights, there have been exciting developments in mass spectrometry techniques since the 1980s. Fast atom bombardment, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization allow for accurate molecular weight determinations. In addition, a combination of fast atom bombardment and tandem mass spectrometry can yield sequence details for polypeptides, polynucleotides and even for proteins of molecular weights from 10-15 kDa when these are available in only nanomole amounts.</p>
<section id="sec3.1.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Motifs</h3>
<p class="noindent">The comparison of the amino acid sequences of a metalloprotein from a number of sources or of different metalloproteins with a common function can, in favourable cases, allow reasonable guesses as to the amino acids which are essential for its action. These will be invariant amino acids and will almost certainly include the ligands associated with the metal. The alignment of the primary sequences of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 3 The examination of the properties of metalloproteins</a> reductase and the a-subunit of the soluble methane monooxygenase hydroxylase, using the amino acids known to be iron ligands in R2 led to a prediction of the active site structure of the latter, which was later confirmed by X-ray crystallography (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Motifs abound. Thus, although the human matrix metalloproteinases and other zinc proteinases from bacteria, crayfish and snake venom have large overall differences, they all contain the conserved sequence: his*-glu-xx-his*-xx-gly-xx-his*, with the three his* coordinated to the catalytic Zn (metzincins). Part of this consensus is also contained in the zinc enzymes thermolysin, angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#tab7.4">Table 7.4</a>) . Predictions of the amino acids adjacent to the metal site from sequence examinations of zinc enzymes, have been confirmed by NMR and X-ray analyses.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Characterization</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several properties are important in shedding light on the nature of the metal site. Paramount are the wealth of spectroscopic properties which are usually available.</p>
<section id="sec3.2.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Spectroscopic properties</h3>
<p class="noindent">Spectroscopic techniques are extremely important in the study of metalloproteins. A short description and the relevance of such techniques is presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.1">Table 3.1.</a> More detailed explanations of the methods can be obtained from the &#x2018;Further reading&#x2019; section. Metalloproteins usually exhibit a number of spectroscopic features. The more common techniques (e.g., electronic and vibrational spectroscopies, CD and EPR) were used in early studies for categorizing and probing the structure at the metal site. For example, these spectroscopic methods applied to plastocyanin led to the correct prediction of met, cys and 2 his as the Cu ligands arranged in a distorted tetrahedron. In addition, monitoring the interactions of metalloproteins with their biological reaction partners (substrate, inhibitor etc.) usually requires a spectroscopic probe and UV-vis, fluorescence, resonance Raman, EPR and NMR are particularly useful. A wide range of spectroscopic techniques are now available to the bioinorganic chemist (<a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a>) and their value has been enhanced in recent years by the acquisition of computer controlled instruments and Fourier-transform methodologies. The techniques can help, in varying degrees, in the determination of the:</p>
<p class="hang29">(a)<span class="space29"/>number and nature of the ligands attached to the metal;</p>
<p class="hang29">(b)<span class="space29"/>coordination geometry around the metal;</p>
<p class="hang29">(c)<span class="space29"/>oxidation and spin state of the metal;</p>
<p class="hang29">(d)<span class="space29"/>characterization of metal clusters; and, with only the most sophisticated approaches</p>
<p class="hang29">(e)<span class="space29"/>the metal&#x2013;ligand and metal&#x2013;metal distances and angles.</p>
<p class="noindent">Characterization is also more likely if more than one technique is applied. Comparison of the properties of the metal site in a protein with those of simple metal complexes, of known structure, has also proved to be very valuable (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.5">Section 3.5</a>). For some of the techniques to be effective, it is necessary to replace a spectroscopically &#x2018;silent&#x2019; native metal ion (e.g. Zn<sup>2+</sup>) by an apt one (e.g. Co<sup>2+</sup> for UV-vis or <sup>113</sup>Cd<sup>2+</sup> for NMR, see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.3">Table 3.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the techniques shown in <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> are of increasing diagnostic value but are also of increasing complexity and cost and therefore decreasing availability! Synchrotron radiation sources have made EXAFS a viable technique and have improved the capabilities of X-ray crystallography. These methods, based on the absorption and diffraction of X-rays, are among the most powerful and definitive ones for a complete structure determination. It is also now possible to determine the structures of medium sized <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 3 The examination of the properties of metalloproteins</a>metalloproteins (and non-metalloproteins of course) <i>in solution</i> by sophisticated NMR techniques. MCD, M&#x00F6;ssbauer, EPR and EXAFS experiments are usually performed at low temperatures.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Magnetic properties</h3>
<p class="noindent">Several spectroscopic techniques (e.g. MCD, M&#x00F6;ssbauer, EPR and NMR) which focus on the metal ion can be used to determine the magnetic susceptibility and thus the magnetic moment and spin state at the metal centre. These parameters are difficult to obtain by the conventional methods used for metal complexes because of the very large diamagnetic background of the protein and water. This problem can be overcome by the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) which accurately measures very low level magnetic fluxes and has been used to observe where and how signals travel in the brain. Low temperatures are required and the technique is very complicated, however.</p>

A small organic molecule (mediator) is usually added to establish the redox equilibrium between the electrode and the metalloprotein. No direct contact of the protein with the electrode is then necessary. This is not the case with cyclic voltammetry (CV). Here variations of cathodic and anodic currents as the electrode potential is changed are recorded, allowing the determination of <i>E</i>&#x00B0; values. There are formidable problems if the redox centre is buried in a large protein and is inaccessible to the electrode. Modified gold or pyrolytic graphite electrodes are occasionally successful. Cytochrome c shows well behaved cyclic voltamograms at a gold electrode and its interactions with non-redox partners, e.g. cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> or plastocyanin, have been studied using CV.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reaction rates</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is a wide range of rates associated with the reactions of metalloproteins. The First visible events when oxygen binds to the iron in myoglobin (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.7">Section 8.7</a>) or after the photosynthetic reaction centre is irradiated (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>), take place in very short times, 10<sup>&#x2013;12</sup> s (ps). Many other important steps in bioinorganic reaction cycles are also rapid including acid&#x2013;base reactions, electron transfer processes and spin-state changes, protein&#x2013;protein interactions, protein folding and interactions of ligands with <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Chapter 3 The examination of the properties of metalloproteins</a>metalloproteins (a vast area including metalloenzyme catalysis) all of which often occur within 10<sup>&#x2013;6</sup> s (&#x03BC;s) or 10<sup>&#x2013;9</sup> s (ns). The fastest second-order reactions are diffusion-controlled, with rate constants &#x007E;10<sup>8</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Some catalysis by metalloenzymes or conformational changes in metalloproteins can, on the other hand, be quite slow, may take seconds or minutes for completion and be easily measurable by conventional methods.

<p class="sidebar-left">Monitoring a reaction by more than one technique is often rewarding, since each usually provides different information. A good example is the study of the folding of a protein <i>in vitro</i>.

Apoprotein is usually devoid of any activity (e.g. Zn and Fe enzymes) or is less stable (Ca binding proteins). Treatment of the apoprotein with metal ions in solution produces a metalloprotein (holoprotein). If the native metal ion is used, the original metalloprotein with full function can usually be regenerated. Other metalloderivatives are generally much less active than the native form, or completely inactive. In cases where both have been examined by X-ray crystallography, there is usually little difference in the structures of the apo and native metalloproteins (see however transferrin, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.5">Section 7.5</a>). This is interesting in, for example, plastocyanin, since it shows that the unusual geometry around the copper (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>) is imposed by the protein.

<p class="noindent">Altering amino acid residues at or even distant from the active site of a protein can modify the normal function of that protein. There are over 400 variants of human hemoglobin, in most of which a single amino acid is different from that in &#x2018;normal&#x2019; hemoglobin (HbA). In a few cases this has devastating consequences. Sickle-cell anemia was the first human disease to be traced to an abnormal protein, namely hemoglobin S (HbS). In it, a glutamate residue (glu 6) is replaced by valine in the &#x03B2;-subunits of hemoglobin. This creates a hydrophobic patch on the surfaces of the &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub>-subunits, and one of the patches is able therefore to fit into the hydrophobic pocket of another &#x03B2;<sub>1</sub>-subunit. This leads to the production of fibres (by polymerization) in deoxyHbS and the &#x2018;sickling&#x2019; of the red blood cells which reduces their ability to transport O<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.7">Section 8.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is now possible (routinely) to replace one amino acid by another using genetic engineering techniques. In this method, the gene encoding the protein <a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chapter 3 The examination of the properties of metalloproteins</a>is altered and the recombinant protein is expressed in a suitable host (site directed mutagenesis). For example, endopeptidase (NEP) is a membrane-bound zinc metalloenzyme. Replacement of glutamic acid by valine at position 646 (E646V) markedly reduces the catalytic (hydrolytic) activity of NEP. This effect, coupled with other data, strongly indicated that glu 646 is one of the ligands to zinc (his 583 and his 587 are others). In the mutant enzyme, the active site has been disturbed by modifying the coordination around the zinc.</p>

Chemists tend to use binding constants, i.e. <i>K</i>, while biochemists favour the dissociation constant, i.e. <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> The combination of two molecules is a widespread occurence. It can involve interaction of O<sub>2</sub> or CO with a respiratory protein (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.7">Section 8.7</a>), substrate or inhibitor binding to an enzyme or protein&#x2013;protein association.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Site directed mutagenesis has been used very effectively to build metal coordinating ability into a protein. Histidine or cysteine residues have been introduced into specific positions in certain proteins. Rat anionic trypsin catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lys or arg residues. This trypsin is a member of the serine protease family, most of which contain a serine, aspartate and histidine triad at the active site (<a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>) . Replacement of arg 96 by his in rat anionic trypsin (R96H) does not change the activity of the enzyme <i>until metal ions are added</i>. In the recombinant enzyme his 57 and the engineered his 96 can form a chelate with added metal ion, but only after rotation of his 57 around a C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub>&#x2013;C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub> bond thereby removing his 57 from the active site (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). Copper (II) ion forms the most stable chelate (confirmed by a crystal structure) and is therefore a potent non-competitive inhibitor (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 21 &#x03BC;M) of the enzyme. Removal of the Cu<sup>2+</sup> restores the activity.</p>

<p class="noindent">The experimental and theoretical aspects of the entire span of spectral, magnetic and reactivity characteristics of many simple metal complexes have been thoroughly examined. These data have been invaluable for understanding in particular the metal site properties in metalloproteins. In many cases, it has been necessary to synthesize metal complexes of a new design or of an unusual oxidation state, in order to simulate that suspected for a protein metal site. Both mononuclear and polynuclear metal complexes have been prepared to compare with the increasingly complicated and unusual arrangements of metal ions being found in metalloproteins. There are numerous examples of the success of the model complex approach described throughout the book.</p>
<p class="indent">The power of the model approach in the structural characterization of metalloproteins is well illustrated by studies of binuclear copper (II) complexes relevant to oxyhemocyanin (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a>). The size of the hemocyanin isolated from the lobster <i>Panulirus interruptus</i> (460 kDa, 6 subunits) presented considerable problems for crystallographers, although the structure has now been solved. Before this, comparison of the properties of Cu(II) complexes to those of oxyhemocyanin had been invaluable. It was known that in oxyhemocyanin:</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The electron spin due to each Cu(ll) (d<sup>9</sup>) may be cancelled by antiferromagnetic coupling. The net result is no unpaired electrons and no EPR signal nor magnetic splitting in the M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectrum. The important parameter is &#x2013;<i>J</i> (cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) which is a measure of the extent of magnetic exchange in antiferromagnetic coupling.</p>

<p class="noindent">This complex is now known to have the same structure as the dicopper site found in oxyhemocyanin.</p>
<p class="indent">An intense effort has been made to prepare model complexes which mimic the functions as well as the spectral properties and metal site structure of the corresponding metalloprotein. Although there has been some success, the simple models rarely closely replicate the functionality and specificity of the natural systems. The contribution of the protein component cannot be underestimated! A new approach is the synthesis of models incorporating segments of protein. These more closely approach the structures of complicated protein systems and may more nearly act as functioning models. They have been likened to maquettes, which are small models used by sculptors and architects.</p>
