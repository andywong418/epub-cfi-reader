<p class="noindent">As we have seen, the spectroscopic properties of metalloproteins are vital for their monitoring and characterization as well as for illuminating the details of the metal site. Other properties are more directly related to the function of the metalloprotein. We can apportion these properties between those originating from the polypeptide and those arising from the metal ion. This is an artificial division for convenience and it should be emphasized that the two components will also often act synergistically resulting in a unique entity.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The role of protein</h2>
<p class="noindent">(a) The protein imposes a rigid and often unusual arrangement of ligands around the metal ion.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">A type 1 copper centre is present in plastocyanin. This gives rise to an intense blue colour in the Cu(ll) form. The crystal structure of poplar plastocyanin shows a distorted tetrahedral arrangement of donor atoms around the Cu from 2Ns (2 his) and 2Ss (cys, met). The colour arises from the cys &#x2192; Cu(ll) LMCT. Type 1 Cu proteins have a characteristic rhombic EPR signal with separate <i>g<sub>x</sub></i>, <i>g<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>g<sub>z</sub></i> values.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">Q. There is a net negative charge on SOD at physiological pH. The rate of reaction with a negative ion such as <img src="../images/in29_9.jpg" alt="images"/> should increase with increasing ionic strength according to kinetic theories. The rate is observed to decrease however. Why might this be?</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This can have mechanistic implications. In plastocyanin, there is an irregular but similar ligand geometry around the copper (I) and copper (II) forms (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>). This aids in electron transfer between the two oxidation states (in photosynthesis) because major structural changes in interconverting Cu(I) and Cu(II), which would slow down the rate, are unnecessary (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>) . The importance of the protein in establishing this structural feature is confirmed by the observation of little structural difference between the native and apoproteins. In other words, the protein has done the trick!</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The protein provides a pathway for the protected or guided entry of substrates to the metal site.</p>
<p class="indent">In some cases, it is apparent from the crystal structure that there is, for the reactant, an easily accessible cleft leading to the metal ion situated at its base. In carbonic anhydrase, for example, the zinc ion is located at the base of a deep pocket, about 15 &#x00C5; from the surface. In other metalloproteins access for a substrate may require (transient) thermal or allosteric broadening of a channel. The structures of nitrogenase and of the heme proteins myoglobin and cytochrome P-450 indicate no obvious channel for substrate entry. Indeed in P-450, the heme is buried deep inside the protein. In the case of a charged substrate, which is somewhat unusual, electrostatic guidance by certain amino acid side chains may be provided (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>). Only one side of the copper in bovine CuZn superoxide dismutase, SOD, (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>) is accessible to small molecules, which can pass through a conical channel that is narrower at the copper site than at the surface. Lining the channel near the surface are positively charged lys and negatively charged glu residues approximately 13 &#x00C5; from the copper and they are believed to direct <img src="../images/in29_8.jpg" alt="images"/> ions into the channel. There is a network of residues in the channel which are <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a> involved in electrostatic guidance of <img src="../images/in29_8.jpg" alt="images"/> to the copper. Sucessive glu, lys, glu and thr sidechains are linked by hydrogen bonds (dashed line in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>). A positively charged arginine near the catalytic site may be used for docking the <img src="../images/in29_8.jpg" alt="images"/> ion next to the Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion. Ligands attached to the metal ions are omitted in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1.</a></p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Q. Why would only lys residues at the mouth of the channel in superoxide dismutase be unproductive?</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">(c) The main role of the protein, and one related to (a) above, is to provide the environment of the metal ion, specifically, the coordinated ligands and other nearby amino acids.</p>
<p class="indent">These could have a variety of duties. The ability of the protein to fine tune the properties of the metal centre is crucial to its function. This principle is demonstrated in the reaction centres of photosynthesis (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.4">Section 6.4</a>) where the protein environment largely determines the redox potentials of pigment&#x2013;protein complexes.</p>

These play (a) orientation and (b) ionization roles in the catalysis by the metalloenzyme (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). The arrows show the H<sup>+</sup> movements on ionization.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Hydrophobic clefts or patches in the protein can be used as a preturnover location of a hydrophobic molecule. Such a hydrophobic pocket, made up of valine, leucine and tryptophan residues, about 3&#x2013;4 &#x00C5; from the Zn in carbonic anhydrase has been suggested as the binding site for CO<sub>2</sub> prior to, or at, <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a>activation (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.3">Section 7.3</a>). In addition, a hydrogen-bonded solvent network at the Zn site (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>) helps to locate the carbon dioxide molecule for reaction. The interactions shown in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>(a) optimize the geometry for Zn&#x2013;OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> attack on CO<sub>2</sub> and (b) mediate the ionization of the Zn&#x2013;OH<sub>2</sub> species (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.3">Section 7.3</a>). Substitution of Zn by a number of metals (Co, Cu, Mn and Cd), and kinetic and NMR studies in addition to the crystal structure, have provided enough information to make carbonic anhydrase one of the best understood metalloenzymes (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.3">Section 7.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Examination of the crystal structure of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, and of the stable O<sub>2</sub> adduct of an Fe(II) form of a mutant of the enzyme, as well as considerations of its biochemistry, show the influence of hydrogen bonding on the activation of O<sub>2</sub> by the enzyme (<a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). An histidyl imidazole within the active site (his 52) aids in the transfer of a proton from the oxygen of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bound to iron (O<sub>A</sub>) to the departing oxygen (O<sub>B</sub>). The water leaves and hydrogen bonding occurs between the trp 51, arg 48 and the Fe=O entity. The behaviour of site specific mutants has been particularly useful in interpreting the roles of these residues.</p>

<p class="indent">(d) Specialized molecules are required to transport and store metal ions in biological systems.</p>
<p class="indent">For the transition metals, only proteins are used for these tasks in vertebrates, but nonproteins are mainly used in lower organisms. For iron, the most well understood transition metal ion, transferrin and ferritin are used in animals for transport and storage, respectively, while in bacteria siderophores are employed for these purposes (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.5">Section 7.5</a>). The s-block metal ions can be transported as aquated ions, but do require the intervention of ionophores, which are strong chelating ethers, or membrane proteins, for transfer across the central hydrophobic region of a membrane (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.3">Section 5.3</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The role of metal</h2>
<p class="noindent">A specific role for the metal ion can be assigned in a number of cases. These may include:</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-50.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Replacement of his 52 by a leucine residue decreases the rate of formation of compound I (eqn 6.6) by 5 orders of magnitude. Replacing arg 48 by lysine only has a twofold rate effect, suggesting that arg 48 stabilizes compound I but does not promote its formation.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_24" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 24, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a>
<p class="indent">(a) Enhancement of the stability of the biomolecule.</p>
<p class="indent">The s-block metal ions excel at this. Thus Mg<sup>2+</sup> in particular, with its high intracellular concentration, is vital to the stabilization of DNA and RNA helices. The electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged backbone phosphates in the polynucleotides are alleviated by coordination, albeit weakly by outer-sphere complexing, to Mg<sup>2+</sup>. All enzyme catalysed reactions involving DNA and RNA polymerases require divalent cations, usually Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Calcium ions stabilize some proteins, e.g. thermolysin (a peptidase), toward unfolding (denaturing) on heating. The other metal present (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) in thermolysin has a catalytic role (see later). Tungsten-containing proteins are very rare and are found mainly in thermophilic anaerobes. <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> grows optimally at 100 &#x00B0;C. The W-containing enzyme, aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase isolated from it, is extremely thermally stable. It was a disappointment to the authors to learn that the stability of such metalloenzymes is due to a number of factors (salt links, H bonding, low surface area to volume ratio) and not mainly to the presence of the metal ion!</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-22em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">There are two fundamental types of coordination: (a) inner-sphere complexes in which coordinated water in the aqua ion M(H2<sub>O</sub>)<sub>n</sub><sup>m+</sup> is replaced by the ligand and (b) outer-sphere complexes (or ion pairs) in which an undisturbed coordinated water molecule is between the metal ion and ligand, e.g.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:-0.6em;">(b) Promotion of an essential conformational change in the protein.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many calcium binding proteins with negatively charged regions because they are rich in glu and asp residues. In some the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion causes a conformational change in the protein allowing it to interact with another protein and thereby trigger enzyme activity; e.g. calmodulin will activate NO synthase, phosphorylase kinase and (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) ATPases (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> to M<sup>2+</sup> sites in troponin C stabilizes the structure as in (a) above, but may also cause localized structural changes which trigger muscle contraction (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.5">Section 5.5</a>). In concanavalin A (con A), a <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a>manganese ion helps to position the ligands correctly around the calcium ion (<a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>). This in turn ensures the correct orientation of amino acid residues involved in binding the centre of a methyl a-D-pyranoside molecule 8.7 &#x00C5; from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (and 12.8 &#x00C5; from the Mn<sup>2+</sup>, <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>). In the con A&#x2013;sugar complex, the sugar is in the chair conformation, held there by extensive hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.4">Section 2.4</a>), some of which involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligands (tyr 12, asn 14, arg 228). In a final example, in transcription factor III A, zinc ion binds tetrahedrally to 2 cys and 2 his residues and, in so doing, promotes formation of a loop or &#x2018;finger&#x2019; (<a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>) which fits into the major groove of DNA. We shall have more to say about these most important transcription factors later (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.6">Section 7.6</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">There are 100s of lectins, which are sugar-binding proteins. Those from legumes, such as conA from the seeds of jack beans, contain Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Their function in plants is unknown. Lectins from animals contain only Ca<sup>2+</sup> (C-type) which is coordinated to the sugar. These lectins act as mediators of cell recognition, e.g. in the adhesion of viruses to host cells. Lectins are useful for carbohydrate purification and in probing membrane structure.</p>

<p class="indent">MerR is a metalloregulatory protein which switches on the transcription of the bacterial mercuric ion resistant genes when Hg<sup>2+</sup> is present at as low as nM concentration. Mercury (II) ion binds specifically and tightly to the DNA-bound MerR causing a DNA conformational change. This facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase and thus converts MerR from a repressor to a strong activator of transcription.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Metal ions or complexes can act as cofactors.</p>
<p class="indent">Many enzymes require the presence of a + 1 cation, particularly K<sup>+</sup>, for activity. Such ions probably bind to the enzyme some distance from the substrate site and act by stabilizing a particular conformation. Potassium ion is the most effective of the alkali ions for promoting catalysis by pyruvate kinase (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#tab5.3">Table 5.3</a>). The cation is believed to link the substrate to the enzyme surface, thereby stabilizing the enzyme&#x2013;pyruvate complex.</p>
<p class="indent">Nearly all the roles described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Sections 4.2</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">4.3</a> are used at some time or other to bring about the rate enhancements which are promoted by some <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a>metalloproteins.

<p class="noindent">The catalysts of Nature are the enzymes. Metalloenzymes have been estimated to make up about 40% of all enzymes and are represented in each of the internationally recognized six classes. <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a> shows the six basic types of reactions catalysed. Specific examples of these are presented in Tables 5.3, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1 and 7.2. Metalloenzymes range in size from the very small (only about 80 or so amino acids in cytochrome c<sub>551</sub>) to very large entities such as glutamine synthetase, MW = 619 kDa, consisting of 12 subunits arranged at the comers of a hexagonal prism and which has two M<sup>2+</sup> (Mg<sup>2+</sup> <i>in vivo</i>) ions in each subunit. Uncatalysed reactions are much slower and their rates vary more widely than the catalysed ones. Some enzymes are able to enhance the rate of the spontaneous reaction by a factor as large as 10<sup>17</sup> (<a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>). Antibodies, which are large proteins, can also catalyse a wide variety of chemical reactions. Abzymes, as they are termed, are not usually as effective as enzymes, but can produce 10<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;10<sup>6</sup> fold enhanced rates over the uncatalysed reaction. The metal ions in metalloenzymes can participate in the catalysis in several ways, which are usually coupled to, and reinforced by, nearby protein structural effects. The metal ion can:</p>

<p class="indent">This function is analogous to the neighbouring group effect, which is well known in organic chemistry. Invariably, one reactant will be intimately associated with the metal ion, probably coordinated to it. Another reactant will be located near to, and with the correct orientation for attack at, the metal ion. A hydrophobic patch or hydrogen bonds, provided by neighbouring amino acids, may anchor one reactant close to the metal ion (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a>). In an extreme case, the substrate may be radically altered. Thus, D-xylose is forced into an &#x2018;open-chain&#x2019; conformation, rather than the usual cyclic form, when attached to D-xylose isomerase. Terminal hydroxyl groups on the sugar, away from the site of the isomerization, are bound to one of two manganese ions in the enzyme (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#tab7.2">Table 7.2</a>). The other manganese ion has a direct role in the isomerization.</p>
<a id="page_28" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 28, Chapter 4 Structures and functions</a>
<p class="indent">(b) Enhance the acidity of a coordinated ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">The positive charge on the metal ion will, for example, aid in the ionization of a coordinated water, i.e., lower the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> compared to that of bulk water. This ensures a relatively high concentration of (coordinated) hydroxide ion. Although this is a poorer nucleophile than free OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, it is a much more effective nucleophile than water and is thus available for accelerated nucleophilic reactions at <i>neutral</i>, <i>physiological</i> pH where the concentration of OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is only &#x007E;0.1 &#x03BC;M. Another example is in the enhancement of the C&#x2013;H acidity in mandelate, promoting the formation of an enol intermediate and thus (<i>R</i>)-, (<i>S</i>)-interconversion (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#tab5.3">Table 5.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Serve as an.oxidation&#x2013;reduction centre for the manipulation of electrons in the oxidoreductases (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The metal ion can also bind an oxidant such as O<sub>2</sub> and modify its electronic configuration so as to enhance oxidative reactivity. In the heme proteins, the entire metal&#x2013;porphyrin unit plus the axial group or groups play an important role in the function of the enzyme (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Play a structural role (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a> (a)).</p>
<p class="indent">Bivalent Zn<sup>2+</sup>, being ad<sup>10</sup> species with completely filled d-orbitals, has some of the properties of alkaline earth bivalent cations and therefore can have, like them, a structural as well as a catalytic role in metalloproteins. This is well illustrated by liver alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the reaction:</p>

<p class="noindent">and removes alcohol both produced internally and consumed externally. Each subunit of the dimer binds one NAD<sup>+</sup> and two very different Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. One Zn<sup>2+</sup> is bound to four cys residues, is inaccessible to solvent and substrate and undoubtedly has a structural function. The other Zn<sup>2+</sup> is bound tetrahedrally to two cys, his and H<sub>2</sub>O (or OH<sub>&#x2013;</sub>) in a deep pocket (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a>(b)) about 20 &#x00C5; from the surface. It affects catalysis in ways outlined above. It attaches and lowers the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x00B0;f the alcoholic OH (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.4">Section 4.4</a>(b)) facilitating hydride transfer from the alcohol to the nicotinamide ring of the NAD<sup>+</sup> coenzyme (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). It also helps to position the substrate for reaction (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.4">Section 4.4</a>(a)).</p>
<p class="indent">Some microorganisms thrive in extreme conditions (extremophiles). Enzymes derived from them, termed extremozymes, must therefore function at high temperature and pressure (deep-sea hydrothermal vents) or near or below 0 &#x00B0;C (arctic waters), in high salt concentrations (e.g. 3&#x2013;5 M NaCl in the Dead Sea) low pH (geothermal springs) or high pH (sewage sludge). Extremozymes studied so far have similar activities and structures to their mesophilic analogues isolated in moderate conditions. Subtle, and as yet incompletely understood differences must account for their striking variation in stability. The various enzyme classes (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>) are well represented and a number of extremozymes contain metal ions.</p>
