<p class="noindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fm-in">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Peter Biggs has produced an authoritative and easy-to-read introductory account of Computers in Chemistry. The Primer presents essential basic ideas required to understand and exploit computers as encountered by chemistry students in their studies and in the laboratory at all stages up to and including research level. This Primer will be of lasting and broad value to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
