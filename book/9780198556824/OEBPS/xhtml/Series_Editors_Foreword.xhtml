<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Peter Hore presents a clearly written and elegant introductory account of <i>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</i>&#x2014;a spectroscopic technique of unrivaled power and versatility. The book explains in simple terms those basic ideas and applications of NMR which are now essential for any practising chemists. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
