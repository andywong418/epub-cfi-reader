<h2 class="h2"><b>3.1&#160;&#160;Structure and properties of dienes</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In <i>allenes</i> (1,2-dienes) two carbon&#x2013;carbon double bonds share a common carbon atom. This carbon atom is sp<sup>1</sup> hybridised and the molecular orbitals of the two double bonds are therefore at right angles to one another. As a result the two ends of the molecule are held in perpendicular planes and some allenes are indeed chiral (<a href="#fig_3.1">fig. 3.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Allenes are isomeric with alkynes and the two classes of compounds can often be interconverted (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.6">section 2.6</a>). The reactions of allenes are similar to those of alkenes and alkynes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A second very important class of dienes is that in which two doubly bonded carbon atoms are separated by a single bond. These compounds are called <i>conjugated dienes</i> because the unhybridised 2p atomic orbitals on all four carbon atoms interact to give <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals which embrace the entire four-carbon system (<a href="#fig_3.2">fig 3.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The C2&#x2013;C3 bond in 1,3-butadiene is in fact slightly shorter than the carbon&#x2013;carbon single bond in, for example, ethane. This difference can be explained in terms of the different hybridisation of the orbitals involved. Thus, since a C&#x2013;H bond involving an sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbital is shorter than one involving an sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbital, then a C&#x2013;C single bond involving sp<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Certainly any overlap of the unhybridised 2p atomic orbitals on carbon atoms 2 and 3 of butadiene can only occur when the molecule is planar. This imposes a small barrier to rotation about the central C&#x2013;C bond, so that the preferred conformations of 1,3-butadiene are those in which all four carbon atoms are coplanar (<a href="#eqn_3.1">eqn 3.1</a>). Nevertheless, at room temperature the two conformers are easily interconverted.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The molecular orbital picture of conjugated dienes is supported by their characteristic UV spectra. Indeed compounds containing extended conjugation are highly coloured and many natural pigments are of this type (see <a href="#sec_3.4">section 3.4</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2&#160;&#160;Addition reactions of conjugate dienes</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Conjugated dienes react with the same kinds of reagent as alkenes. However in some cases unexpected products are obtained. For example, the reaction of one mole of 1,3-butadiene with one mole of hydrogen bromide gives two products, one corresponding to 1,2-addition, the other corresponding to 1,4-addition (<a href="#eqn_3.2">eqn 3.2</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-3em;" id="eqn_3.2">
 <img src="../images/page30-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Furthermore, the proportions of the two products vary depending upon the reaction temperature (<a href="#eqn_3.3">eqn 3.3</a>). At low temperatures the kinetic product predominates, whilst at higher temperatures the thermodynamic product is favoured. This is because the 1,2-adduct is formed fastest (lowest energy barrier) and is therefore the major product formed under mild conditions. However, the 1,4-adduct is more stable and, since the steps leading to both products are reversible, this is the major product obtained when sufficient thermal energy is available to surmount the higher energy barrier leading to the 1,4-adduct.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A similar situation is observed in the reaction of 1,3-butadiene with bromine (<a href="#eqn_3.4">eqn 3.4</a>). Two products are obtained, one resulting from 1,2-addition and the other from 1,4-addition. The proportions of the two products obtained again depend upon the reaction conditions employed.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.3&#160;&#160;Cycloaddition reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Conjugated dienes undergo one reaction which simple alkenes do not undergo. This is the <i>Diels-Alder reaction</i> in which the diene reacts with a &#x2018;dienophile&#x2019;, which is usually an alkene or alkyne bearing one or more electron-withdrawing groups. This reaction is the prototype of a general class of concerted reactions, called <i>pericyclic reactions</i>, which involve redistribution of electrons around a cyclic transition state (e.g. <a href="#eqn_3.5">eqn 3.5</a>). There are three main types of pericyclic reactions. This particular type of reaction in which two &#x03C3; bonds are formed between the ends of two <i>&#x03C0;</i> systems is called a <i>cycloaddition reaction</i>. The Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction can be formally described as a [4 + 2] cycloaddition, indicating the number of participating electrons contributed by each component. It should be noted however that not all cycloaddition reactions are necessarily concerted, and in some cases they may involve diradical or dipolar intermediates.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction is an important method for the preparation of compounds containing six-membered rings. A number of features of the reaction are of special interest.</p>
<p class="noindentt">1. Concerted reactions such as the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction and other reactions in which ring closure is rapid relative to bond rotation, are invariably highly stereoselective. In contrast, reactions proceeding via a multi-step mechanism involving ring opened intermediates are usually less stereoselective. The Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction is in fact stereospecific, since the</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_32" class="page">page 32, Reactions of dienes</a>stereochemistry of the dienophile and the diene are retained in the product. Using the terminology used to describe such reactions, the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction is said to involve <i>suprafacial</i> (or <i>syn</i>) addition (as opposed to <i>antarafacial</i> or <i>anti</i> addition) to both of the reactants, i.e. the diene and the dienophile (<a href="#fig_3.3">fig. 3.3</a>).</p>

<b>Figure 3.3</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">2.&#x0009;The reaction is also stereoselective in the sense that <i>exo</i> and <i>endo</i> products are obtained in unequal amounts. The <i>endo</i> (kinetic) product is usually the major product although the <i>exo</i> adduct is usually the thermodynamically more stable and may predominate if long reaction times and high temperatures are used. The transition state leading to the <i>endo</i> adduct is stabilised by through-space interactions known as secondary orbital interactions (<a href="#fig_3.4">fig. 3.4</a>).</p>

By using frontier molecular orbital theory it is in fact possible to rationalise the regiochemical preferences observed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="noindent">4.&#x0009;Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions can be catalysed by Lewis acids and by carrying out such reactions at low temperatures it is possible to greatly enhance both the regio- and stereoselectivity. Furthermore by employing a chiral catalyst it is now possible to bring about enantioselective Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, leading to non-racemic products.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">&#x03B2;-Carotene and similar cyclic carotenoids can be cleaved in the liver to give vitamin A. Vitamin A is also closely related to retinal, a component of the photosensitive substance rhodopsin that is found in the retina of the eye. Rhodopsin is a red complex of 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal with the protein opsin which is converted into <i>trans</i>-retinal on absorption of light. Reduction of this aldehyde to <i>trans</i>-vitamin A followed by isomerisation in the dark gives 11 -<i>cis</i>-vitamin A which is reoxidised to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal (<a href="#sche_3.1">scheme 3.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">1,5-Dienes undergo a concerted pericyclic rearrangement on heating. This particular reaction is known as the Cope rearrangement but it belongs to a general class of pericyclic reactions called <i>sigmatropic reactions</i> or sigmatropic shifts which involve the movement of a &#x03C3; bond across one (or more) <i>&#x03C0;</i> systems. The Cope rearrangement is an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic reaction (<a href="#eqn_3.8">eqn 3.8</a>). It is believed to involve a chair-like six-membered transition state, and the stereochemical outcome can be rationalised using the general principles of conformational analysis, namely that conformations are preferred in which bulky groups adopt equatorial positions (<a href="#sche_3.2">scheme 3.2</a>).</p>
