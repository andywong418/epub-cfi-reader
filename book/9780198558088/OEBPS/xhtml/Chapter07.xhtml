<p class="indent3-ka1">Ketenes undergo two characteristic reactions, which are also typical of so-called heterocumulenes. These are nucleophilic addition (<a href="#eqn_7.2">eqn 7.2</a>) and cycloaddition (<a href="#eqn_7.3">eqn 7.3</a>). Reactions with nucleophiles result in acetylation (or more generally acylation) of the nucleophilic reagent. The cycloaddition reactions of ketenes are similar to the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.3">section 3.3</a>), although they are classified as [2+2] cycloaddition reactions, in contrast to the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction which is a [4+2] process. In the example shown (<a href="#eqn_7.3">eqn 7.3</a>), reaction with an alkoxyalkyne gives a cyclobutenone. Since this is an enol ether (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.2">section 8.2</a>) it is readily hydrolysed, giving a &#x03B2;-diketone. The dimerisation of ketene (<a href="#eqn_7.1">eqn 7.1</a>) is a very similar reaction, although in this case one ketene molecule undergoes cycloaddition across the carbon&#x2013;oxygen double bond.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2&#160;&#160;Reactions of &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The chemistry of &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, like that of conjugated dienes, is dependent upon the interaction between the orbitals of the carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond and those of the carbon&#x2013;oxygen double bond. In particular the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group has a profound influence on the reactivity of the carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reaction with electrophiles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The conjugated carbonyl group <i>deactivates</i> the carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond towards <i>electrophiles</i>. &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds are therefore <i>less reactive</i> than simple alkenes towards electrophilic reagents. They do nevertheless undergo addition reactions with electrophiles, but less readily than simple alkenes (<a href="#eqn_7.4">eqns 7.4</a> and <a href="#eqn_7.5">7.5</a>).</p>

Indeed, in contrast to simple alkenes, they undergo nucleophilic addition reactions (<a href="#eqn_7.6">eqns 7.6</a>&#x2013;<a href="#eqn_7.8">7.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">This process is described as 1,4-addition or <i>conjugate addition</i> to distinguish it from the usual 1,2-addition reaction of aldehydes and ketones. Indeed, 1,2- and 1,4-addition reactions compete with one another and reactions of &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds usually give mixtures of 1,2- and 1,4-addition products. An intriguing aspect of the chemistry of<a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Reactions of unsaturated carbonyl compounds</a>these compounds is the competition between these two modes of reaction and the factors which control their relative importance.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since, as we will see, the competition between the two modes of reaction is influenced by several factors including the reagent, reaction mechanism, and reaction conditions, formulating clear guidelines for predicting the outcome of such reactions is difficult. One rule of thumb which can be used in many cases, is to classify nucleophiles as either hard or soft. Anions in which the negative charge is localised on a small atom are classified as <i>hard nucleophiles</i> (e.g. <sup>-</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>, RO<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>-</sup>). Such nucleophiles give mainly 1,2-addition because they attack the carbonyl group directly and irreversibly, since they are usually strong bases and therefore are poor leaving groups. Neutral nucleophiles (e.g. amines) and those in which the negative charge is delocalised (e.g. resonance-stabilised carbanions), or located on a large atom (e.g. RS<sup>-</sup>), are classified as <i>soft nucleophiles</i>. They are usually weak bases and are therefore good leaving groups. As a result they add reversibly to the carbonyl group and lead ultimately to the thermodynamically more stable 1,4-addition product.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Addition of organometallic reagents</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Grignard reagents usually give a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-addition products in which the proportions vary depending upon the steric constraints imposed (<a href="#fig_7.2">Scheme 7.2</a>).</p>

<figcaption><b>Scheme 7.2</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Organolithium reagents on the other hand give exclusively 1,2-addition, while organocopper reagents give mainly 1,4-addition. By careful choice of<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Reactions of unsaturated carbonyl compounds</a>reagent it is therefore possible to achieve either 1,2- or 1,4-addition. As a result of their usefulness in bringing about 1,4-addition, the chemistry of organocopper reagents has been extensively developed, and several different types are available. Two of the simplest and most widely utilised are the lithium dialkylcuprates and alkyl copper species (<a href="#fig_7.3">scheme 7.3</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;" id="fig_7.3">
 <img src="../images/page57-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Scheme 7.3</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The state of aggregation of the lithium organocuprates is uncertain, but it seems likely that, in many, the organic ligands are bonded to tetrahedral clusters of four metal atoms. Spectroscopic evidence suggests that in ether solution lithium dimethylcuprate exists as a dimer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The reason for the high selectivity in favour of 1,4-addition by organocopper reagents is still a matter for debate, but the reaction mechanism is thought to involve an initial electron transfer from the organocopper species to the ketone followed by coupling and intramolecular transfer of the organic group from the metal to the &#x03B2;-carbon atom. Certainly there is good evidence for the involvement of an enolate anion since this can be intercepted not only by a proton but also by other electrophiles such as alkylating agents (<a href="#fig_7.4">scheme 7.4</a>).</p>

<figcaption><b>Scheme 7.4</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">One disadvantage of the use of simple lithium organocuprates LiCuR<sub>2</sub> is that only one of the two organic groups R is transferred. Very often this may not matter, but in cases where the alkyl group to be introduced has <a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Reactions of unsaturated carbonyl compounds</a>been arduously synthesised it is an advantage to use &#x2018;mixed&#x2019; reagents in which one expendable group is tightly bound to copper and not transferred.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Higher yields are sometimes obtained by using so-called higher-order cuprates such as Li<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>Cu(CN) obtained by reacting two equivalents of the organolithium compound with copper(I) cyanide, or by carrying out the reaction in the presence of a Lewis acid. Interestingly, addition of catalytic amounts of copper(I) salts also drives the reaction with Grignard reagents in favour of 1,4-addition (<a href="#eqn_7.9">eqn 7.9</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Addition of carbanions&#x2013;Michael addition</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most useful and well-known reactions of &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is their reaction with resonance stabilised carbanions, called Michael addition. The mechanism of this reaction is shown in <a href="#fig_7.5">scheme 7.5</a>. When the carbanion is derived from a carbonyl compound the product obtained is a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound (<a href="#eqn_7.10">eqns 7.10</a> and <a href="#eqn_7.11">7.11</a>). However a wide variety of carbanions can be employed (e.g. <a href="#eqn_7.12">eqn 7.12</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A special case arises when the anion is derived from a cyclohexanone and the unsaturated carbonyl compound is butenone (<a href="#fig_7.6">scheme 7.6</a>). In this case a second base-catalysed reaction, an aldol condensation, can occur leading to the formation of a second six-membered ring. This two step process is called <i>Robinson annelation</i> and, along with the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, is one of the most important methods for the preparation of structures, such as steroids, containing fused six-membered rings.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#x03B1;&#x03B2;-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds can be reduced using lithium in liquid ammonia (<a href="#eqn_7.13">eqn 7.13</a>). This reaction has the advantage that it is more selective than catalytic hydrogenation (e.g. <a href="#eqn_7.14">eqn 7.14</a>), and also provides yet another useful method for regioselectively generating enolates of carbonyl compounds, which can be trapped by reaction with electrophiles (e.g. <a href="#eqn_7.15">eqns 7.15</a> and <a href="#eqn_7.16">7.16</a>).</p>
