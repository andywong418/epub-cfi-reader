<h2 class="h2">4.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far in this book we have examined the basic principles of retrosynthetic analysis. Armed with this information, it should now be possible for you to devise synthetic routes to reasonably complex molecules. However there are usually a very large number of possible synthetic routes for the preparation of a given target molecule. It is clearly impractical actually to try each method in the laboratory to see which is the best as this would be costly, time consuming and frustrating. The aim of this chapter is to provide some guidelines to enable you to devise a pathway which would lead to the most efficient synthesis of the required product.</p></section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.2">
<h2 class="h2"><b>4.2</b>  Strategy and planning</h2>

<p class="noindent">1)	<i>Consider a range of possibilities.</i> Make sure that you examine a number of possible retrosynthetic approaches to the target molecule. Choose an approach for which reagents are readily available and inexpensive (refer to catalogues) and reactions which, as far as possible, give a high yield of a single product at each stage 
(see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapters 5,</a> <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">6</a> and <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">7</a> for a discussion of selectivity in synthesis).</p>

<p class="noindent">2)	<i>Convergent versus linear synthesis.</i> When considering the first disconnection in the retrosynthetic analysis try to divide the molecule into approximately equal halves, and thereafter aim to do the same with each subsequent disconnection. This will lead to a synthesis which is convergent, i.e. several 'mini-syntheses' leading to the target molecule. The alternative linear approach, in which small units are added to a growing chain, is less efficient. A schematic representation of a convergent versus linear synthesis is shown in <a href="#fig_4.1"> Figure 4.1.</a> The generalised molecule <b>(1)</b> consists of six different groups linked together in a chain. If we assume a 70&#x0025; yield for each synthetic manipulation on the pathway then the linear pathway would give a 17&#x0025; oveall yield for the target molecule whereas the convergent approach would lead to a 34&#x0025; yield (based on the longest pathway). </p>

<p class="indent3-ka">One notable case when a linear synthesis is effectively used is in the construction of peptides by sequentially connecting amino acids one at a time to a growing chain. This method is particularly valuable, for peptide synthesis because it can be efficiently automated (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">see Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">3)	<i>Aim for greatest simplification.</i> Given a choice of possible disconnections, those located at branch points usually give straight chain fragments which are more likely to be commercially available or simply prepared 
(<a href="#fig_4.2">Figure 4.2</a>). </p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_36" class="page"> Page 36, Retrosynthetic analysis III: Strategy and planning</a><b> 4)</b><i> Use any inherent symmetry in the target molecule.</i> The use of elements of symmetry can often dramatically reduce the number of steps involved in a synthetic pathway. In some cases the symmetry is obvious; however, often it is concealed by other structural features. For example in the target molecule<b>(3)</b> the value of symmetry may not be immediately obvious. However disconnection of the carbon-carbon bond shown in<a href="#fig_4.3"> Figure 4.3</a> leads to the use of two molecules of cyclohexanone as starting materials for the synthesis.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A further example of the importance of symmetry is in the synthesis of 3- methylcyclopent-2-enone (<b>4</b>) (<a href="#fig_4.3">Figure 4.4</a>). A functional group interconversion <b>(FGI)</b> of the double bond in (<b>4</b>) to the tertiary alcohol (<b>5</b>) (with a consonant pattern of latent polarities), followed by the disconnection of the carbon-carbon bond leads to the symmetrical diketone <b>(6)</b>, the synthesis of which has already been described in <a  href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_37" class="page" > Page 37, Retrosynthetic analysis III: Strategy and planning</a>   5)	<i>Introduce reactive functional groups at a late stage in a synthesis.</i> It is often difficult to selectively react a less reactive functional group when there is more reactive functionality present within a molecule (see<a  href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). For example an epoxide will react with a wide range of nucleophiles under both acidic and basic conditions (see<a  href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). An elegant example of the introducion of an epoxide as the last stage of a synthesis is in the preparation of scopine <b>(8)</b> by Noyori. The ketone <b>(9)</b> was prepared in good yield using organometallic chemistry. Reduction of the ketone with DIBAL-H gave the alcohol <b>(10)</b> which on treatment with mCPBA gave the required epoxide <b>(8)</b> (<a href="#fig_4.5">Figure 4.5</a>). The reasons for the order of the steps in this reaction sequence will become apparent in later chapters.</p>

<p class="noindent">6) <i>Introduce functional groups when and where required to facilitate bondmaking.</i> The design of a synthetic route to a target molecule must lead to the construction of the required carbon skeleton with all substituents in their correct positions and with the appropriate stereochemistry. However functional groups which are not present in the final molecule may be essential in carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. For example diethyl malonate and ethyl acetoacetate have been widely used in synthesis. The preparation of the acid <b>(11)</b> (<a href="#fig_4.6">Figure 4.6</a>) involves the reaction of ethyl acetoacetate <b>(12)</b> with ethyl acrylate to give the diester <b>(13)</b> followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the |3-keto acid <b>(14)</b> (see<a  href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Retrosynthetic analysis III: Strategy and planning</a> If our target molecule contains a complex carbon skeleton and very few or no functional groups then clearly further functional groups will be required to assemble the requisite carbon skeleton. An elegant example of this is in the synthesis of patchouli alcohol <b>(15)</b>, (<a href="#fig_4.7">Figure 4.7</a>). An intramolecular Diels- Alder reaction of the ring diene with the terminal alkene was successfully used to establish the required carbon skeleton in one step. Catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant alkene gave the target molecule <b>(15)</b>.</p>
