<p class="glossary"><b>Asymmetric (or stereogenic) centre</b> A tetrahedral atom with four different groups attached to it. In the case of third row elements a nonbonding pair of electrons may count as one of the groups.</p>

<p class="glossary"><b><i>cis</i></b> (Latin, on the same side). A term similar in meaning to Z, but referring to identical atoms or groups on the same side of a double bond. Also used to describe substituents positioned on the same face of a ring.</p>
<p class="glossary"><b>Configuration</b> The fixed relative spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.</p>
<p class="glossary"><b>&#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;</b>- <b>configuration</b> The &#x03B1;-configuration is used to denote the downward substituent position and the &#x03B2;-configuration to denote the upward substituent position in rigid molecules such as the pyrollizidine alkaloids, <i>n.b.</i> It may be a source of some confusion that &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, &#x03B3; etc are also used to denote substituent positions with respect to functional groups.</p>

<p class="glossary"><b>Conformation</b> A particular orientation of the atoms in a molecule, differing from other possible orientations by rotation(s) around single bonds.

<p class="glossary"><b><i>endo</i></b> That postion in a bicyclic molecule opposite the main bridge. The <i>endo</i> substituent is generally considered to be in the 'inside' or more hindered position. The main bridge is determined by applying the priorities (highest first): i) bridge with heteroatoms; ii) bridge with fewest members; iii) saturated bridge; iv) bridge with fewest substituents; v) bridge with lowest priority substituents.</p>

<p class="glossary"><a id="page_90" class="page" >Page 90, Glossary</a></p>
<p class="glossary"><b>Latent polarity</b> The imaginary pattern of alternating positive and negative charges used to assist in the identification of suitable disconnections and synthons when using retrosynthetic analysis. Latent polarities are arranged such that a positive charge is placed on the carbon adjacent to the heteroatom.</p>

<p class="glossary"><b><i>re</i> and <i>si</i></b> In trigonal molecules containing for example a carbonyl group or an alkene, the two faces can be named by an extension of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system. If the three groups are arranged by the sequence rules that have the order X &#x003E; Y &#x003E; Z, that face in which the groups in the sequence are clockwise (as in I) is the <i>re</i> face (from <i>Latin-rectus)</i> whereas II shows the <i>si</i> face (from <i>haim-sinster).</i></p>

<p class="glossary"><b>Stereoisomers</b> Molecules having the same sequence of atoms and bonds,but differing in the fixed three dimensional arrangement of these atoms. Each stereoisomer has a unique configuration that can only be converted to a different configuration by chemical means (i.e. making and breaking of bonds). There are two distinct classes of stereoisomers:enantiomers and diastereomers.</p>
