<p class="fmnoindent">Synthesis is the central area of organic chemistry where the chemist&#x2019;s art and imagination are involved as much as his knowledge. As a consequence synthesis is a crucial topic for all students of chemistry but one they often find difficult.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. This present primer by Christine Willis and Martin Wills presents the concepts of synthesis in a very logical and student-friendly fashion. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
