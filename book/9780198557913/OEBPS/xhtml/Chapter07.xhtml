<h2 class="h2">7.1 Introduction</h2> 
<p class="noindent">The biological and physical properties of organic molecules used as drugs, insecticides, plant growth regulators, perfumes, etc., depend to a large extent on the <i>stereochemistry</i> of substituents and functional groups. Stereochemistry also has an important effect on the reactivity of compounds. For example, the oxidation of <i>cis</i>-4-<i>t</i>-butylcyclohexanol occurs at a rate three times as fast as that of the <i>trans-</i> isomer using chromium trioxide in acetic acid.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Stereoisomers have the same carbon framework and the substituents have identical regiochemistry; however the isomers differ in their three- dimensional spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule. Each isomer has a unique <i>relative configuration</i> that can only be converted to another by a process of breaking and making bonds.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Stereoisomers containing two or more stereogenic centres are described as being diastereomers (or <i>diastereoisomers).</i> Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are non-enantiomers, i.e. not mirror images of each other. A compound with n stereocentres will have a <i>maximum</i> of 2<sup>n</sup> stereoisomers. However the symmetrical compound tartaric acid may exist in only three forms instead of the theoretical maximum of four. Two of these, the <i>(&#x002B;)R,R-</i> and <i>(-)S,S-</i> forms, are enantiomers of each other, and therefore have opposite rotation signs. The third form (i.e. the <i>R,S</i> and <i>S,R</i> diastereomers) has no optical activity and is known as <i>meso</i>-tartaric acid.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.2 Stereospecific reactions</h2> 
<p class="indent3-ka">Some chemical reactions have a mechanism which demands a specific stereochemical outcome- these are known as <i>stereospecific reactions</i>, e.g. S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions. An S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction involves a concerted displacement of a good leaving group by a nucleophile via a stereospecific backside attack resulting in an inversion of configuration at a stereogenic centre.</p>

<p class="aside">Stereospecific S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction</p></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">1,2-Diols may be prepared from alkenes using stereospecific oxidative procedures. Reaction of cyclohexene with osmium tetroxide gives the osmate ester which may be cleaved to give the product with the two hydroxyl groups on the same side of the molecule, the <i>syn</i> or <i>cis</i> diol (<a href="#fig_7.2">Figure 7.2</a>). In contrast, reaction of cyclohexene with a peracid gives an epoxide which, on treatment with aqueous acid, gives attack from the backside of the epoxide yielding the product with the two hydroxyl groups on different sides of the molecule (the <i>anti</i> or <i>trans</i> diol).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Another method for the preparation of 1,2-diols from alkenes requires the use of silver acetate and iodine (<a href="#fig_7.3">Figure 7.3</a>). The stereochemical outcome of the reaction depends critically on whether or not water is present, and either the <i>cis</i> or the <i>trans</i> diol may be prepared selectively in good yield. If water is present then a <i>cis</i>- diol is formed (Woodward reaction), if not then a <i>trans-</i> diol is formed after hydrolysis of the diacetate (Prevost reaction).</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3 Stereoselective reactions</h2> 
<p class="noindent">Stereoselective reactions are reactions whose mechanisms offer alternative pathways so that the reaction may proceed either via the most favourable pathway (kinetic control) or via the pathway which gives the most stable stereoisomer as the major product (thermodynamic control). Most commonly, selectivity of this type is achieved through the presence of a physical barrier which hinders the formation of one isomer (steric hindrance). In general it is simpler to achieve this type of control in rigid cyclic systems.</p>

<figcaption class="aside" style="margin-top:1em"><b>Figure 7.4 </b>Stereoselective conjugate addition reaction</figcaption></figure></aside>
<h3 class="h3">Cyclic molecules</h3>
<p class="noindent">An example of a stereoselective reaction in a cyclic molecule is the reaction of 4-methylcyclohexenone with lithium dimethylcuprate which results in conjugate addition of a methyl group to the &#x03B2;-position of the enone (i.e. a regioselective reaction, <a href="#fig_7.4">Figure 7.4</a>). However two stereoisomers may be formed, one in which the newly introduced methyl group is <i>cis</i> to the existing methyl group and the other isomer in which the methyl groups are <i>trans.</i> In practice the <i>trans-</i> isomer is the major product since approach of the bulky cuprate reagent occurs predominantly on the less sterically hindered face of the enone, i.e. away from the 4-methyl group.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A further substituent may be introduced &#x03B1; to the carbonyl group if the enolate which is formed in the conjugate addition reaction is alkylated by an electrophile. Steric factors once more control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction and the preferred product is the one in which the substituents &#x03B1; and &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group are <i>trans</i> to each other. Sequential control of stereochemistry in this way has been used in the synthesis of prostaglandins, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_7.5">Figure 7.5.</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">Acyclic molecules</h3>
<p class="noindent">Stereocontrol in acyclic molecules is rather more difficult to achieve than in cyclic cases because of the greater flexibility of the compounds. However one case in which we <i>can</i> predict the stereochemical outcome is in the addition of a nucleophile to an acyclic ketone. As we have already seen, addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl compound may occur under acidic or basic conditions. The addition of a nucleophile to a simple unsymmetrical ketone gives a tertiary alcohol. The product will always be a racemate (i.e. 1:1 mixture of enantiomers) because the initial attack by the nucleophile will statistically be equally likely from above or below the plane of the molecule (<a href="#fig_7.6">Figure 7.6</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_7.6">
<img src="../images/page_71_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 7.6 Addition of nucleophiles to ketones</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However if the carbon atom &#x03B1; to the carbonyl group bears a stereogenic centre, then the two faces of the carbonyl group are no longer equivalent. Addition of the nucleophile from above or below the plane of the carbonyl group is no longer statistically equal and a mixture of diastereoisomers is formed (<a href="#fig_7.7">Figure 7.7</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">Addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl compound is irreversible if the nucleophile is hydride (H&#x203E;) or a carbanion (R&#x203E;), but generally is reversible if the nucleophile is an alkoxide (RO&#x203E;), halide (X<sup>-</sup>) or an amine (RNH<sub>2</sub>).</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">When the addition of the nucleophile is reversible, it is likely that the thermodynamically more stable of the two possible products will be formed predominantly. In contrast for essentially irreversible reactions, e.g. a Grignard reaction or reduction, the kinetic product is likely to be the major diastereomer. The two faces of the carbonyl group are described as <i>re</i> or <i>si;</i> and the products are described as <i>syn</i> and <i>anti.</i> These terms are defined in the Glossary.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 7.7 Diastereoselective addition to a ketone</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka"> Several models have been formulated to rationalise the stereochemical outcome of these reactions. Although the earliest model, that of <i>Cram</i>, is often cited, the <i>Felkin-Ahn</i> model is now preferred. The basis of this model is that the face of the carbonyl group to which addition of the nucleophile is preferred is controlled by the positions in space of the substituents on the stereogenic centre relative to the carbonyl group. The most reactive conformers are assumed to be those in which the bond to the largest group on<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Selectivity III: Stereoselectivity</a>the stereogenic centre is perpendicular to the plane of the carbonyl group. The two remaining substituents on the stereogenic centre may then be arranged in two ways, i.e. with the smaller group towards or away from the carbonyl oxygen, (<b>1</b>) or (<b>2</b>) respectively.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Remember that a nucleophile adds to a carbonyl group at an optimum angle of 107&#x00B0;. Comparison of the two possible reactive conformers reveals the nucleophile will be hindered by the medium sized group in (<b>1</b>) but only by the small group in (<b>2</b>). Hence (<b>4</b>) is the major product (<a href="#fig_7.8">Figure 7.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The stereochemical outcome of the reaction may be different when there is a coordinating group, such as methoxyl, at the centre &#x03B1;- to the ketone. In this case chelation of the counterion (i.e. the magnesium cation in the case of a Grignard reagent) takes place which effectively locks the molecule in a cyclic form. The large group then blocks approach of a nucleophile to one face and addition takes place predominantly from the opposite side (<a href="#fig_7.9">Figure 7.9</a>).</p>
