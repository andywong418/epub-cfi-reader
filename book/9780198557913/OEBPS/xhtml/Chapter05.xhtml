<p class="noindent">   The goal in any synthesis is to obtain a pure sample of the desired product by an efficient and convenient procedure. A synthetic route to the target compound must be designed to enable the required pattern of carbon bonds to be constructed with all the functional groups and substituents in their correct positions (regiochemistry) and with control of relative orientation of the substituents (stereochemistry). In addition, the shortest route is required and each step in the synthesis should ideally give only the desired product. With the vast array of reagents and synthetic methods which are now available, it is often possible to introduce the required functionality with total regio- and stereocontrol. <i>Chemoselective</i>, <i>regioselective, stereoselective</i>, and <i>enantioselective reactions</i> may be used to prepare the required target compounds. These reactions may be defined as follows:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">   In a <i>chemoselective reaction</i> one functional group within the molecule reacts leaving further potentially reactive functionality unaffected. Reactions of this type will be discussed in this chapter.</p>	


<p class="indent3-ka">In a <i>regioselective reaction</i> the formation of one structural (or positional) isomer is favoured (see<a  href="Chapter06.xhtml"> Chapter 6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">   In a <i>stereoselective reaction</i> one stereoisomer of a mixture is produced (or destroyed) more rapidly than another, resulting in the formation of axs preponderance of the favoured stereoisomer (see<a  href="Chapter07.xhtml"> Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside" > In stereoisomers the pattern of connected bonds is identical. This is in contrast to regioisomers in which a different bond connectivity pattern is present.</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">Enantiomers are two molecules related as object to mirror image, i.e. each enantiomer of an enantiomeric pair has a non-superimposable mirror image and is described as chiral. In an <i>enantioselective reaction</i> one enantiomer is produced (or destroyed) more rapidly than the other; the amount by which one enantiomer exceeds the other in a mixture is known as the enantiomeric excess (ee), e.g. a compound containing an 85:15 ratio of enantiomers would be described as having a 70&#x0025; ee, i.e. containing 30&#x0025; of the racemate &#x007B;15&#x002B;15&#x007D;, leavin 70&#x0025; enantiomeric excess of one enantiomer. There is an increasing demand for the enantioselective synthesis of homochiral molecules</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Chemoselective reactions</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">   Many of the principal transformations involved in functional group interconversions (FGIs) were introduced in <a  href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. The reactions may involve addition, substitution, elimination, reduction, oxidation etc.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">   There are a plethora of mild and selective reagents now available to effect specific transformations. For example the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde may simply be achieved using the chromium reagents pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) and pyridinium dichromate (PDC) or by the use of reagents based on activated sulphoxonium ion complexes, e.g. the Swern oxidation with oxalyl chloride, dimethylsulphoxide and a base such as triethylamine (<a href="#fig_5.1">Figure 5.1</a>). Under more forcing conditions, e.g. the use of Jones reagent (Cr0<sub>3</sub>, H2SO4) or acidic potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), it is not possible to isolate the aldehyde as it is immediately further oxidised to the carboxylic acid.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">   A further use of mild and selective reagents is in the reduction of carbonyl compounds. At low temperature (-78&#x00B0;C), DIBAL-H will reduce an ester to an aldehyde whilst under more forcing conditions, e.g. with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAIH4), an ester is reduced to a primary alcohol. In contrast diborane will reduce a carboxylic acid but will leave other carbonyl containing functions, e.g. an ester, unaffected (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig_4.3">Figure 5.2</a>).</p>

A further example of a chemoselective reduction is the reduction of an enone (<a href="#fig_5.4">Figure 5.4</a>). Reaction of cyclohexenone with sodium borohydride in the presence of cerium ions gives the allylic alcohol whereas in the presence of copper(I) ions the major product is the saturated alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>5.3 Protecting groups in synthesis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, when there are two functional groups of unequal reactivity within a molecule, the more reactive can be made to react alone. However it may not be possible to react the less reactive functional group selectively. For example in the case of keto-ester (<b>1</b>) shown above, the ester cannot be directly reduced leaving the ketone unaffected. The problem may be circumvented in two ways:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">i)&#160;&#160;&#160;By the use of protecting groups.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">ii)&#160;&#160;By changing the synthetic strategy to the target molecule such that it is not necessary to react selectively a less reactive functional group.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em">If it is necessary to reduce an ester in the presence of a ketone, as in the conversion of (<b>1</b>) to <b>(4)</b> (<a href="#fig_5.5">Figure 5.5</a>), first the ketone must be converted to a function which is stable to the reducing agent. The ester may then be reduced<a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42,  Selectivity I: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>and the ketone subsequently regenerated. In this case the ketone may be <i>protected</i> as the acetal (<b>5</b>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_5.5">
<img src="../images/page_42_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="width:100%;text-align:center;margin-top:0.8em">
Figure 5.5 Protection of a ketone during reduction of an ester</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">When choosing a suitable protecting group, the following features must be considered. The protecting group must be:</p>
<ol type="i" style="margin-left:2em">
<li>&#160;&#160;Simple to put on, in high yield.</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;Stable to the reaction conditions.</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;Easy to remove, also in high yield.</li></ol>
<p class="indent3-ka">The acetal protecting group given in the above example satisfies all of these criteria. Protecting groups have been designed for most functional groups including alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids and alkenes. They are widely used in the synthesis of complex molecules such as peptides, amino acids, &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics and carbohydrates. Excellent texts have been written describing the advantages and disadvantages of the plethora of protecting groups which are now available, hence these will not be considered in detail here. However some commonly used protecting groups for alcohols as well as the use of acetals to protect aldehydes and ketones are outlined below.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Protection of carbonyl groups as cyclic acetals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the synthesis of cedrol (<a href="#fig_5.6">Figure 5.6</a>) it is necessary to protect the ketone prior to reaction of the ester function with two equivalents of methyl lithium to give the tertiary alcohol. As seen in <a href="#fig_5.5">Figure 5.5</a> a useful protecting group for aldehydes and ketones is a cyclic acetal which may be prepared from reaction of the carbonyl compound with 1,2-ethanediol or a related diol in the presence of an acid catalyst.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The use of a diol provides an entropic advantage over the use of two equivalents of an alcohol to prepare an acetal because two molecules of starting material give two molecules of product (with a mono-ol or alcohol three molecules of starting material are required to react to form the acetal).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43,  Selectivity I: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Cyclic acetals readily revert to aldehydes and ketones in the presence of aqueous acid. However in contrast to aldehydes and ketones, acetals are relatively inert groups. For example acetals do not react with basic or organometallic reagents (e.g. Grignard reagents) or with hydride reducing agents and hence proved valuable in the synthesis of cedrol as shown in <a href="#fig_5.6">Figure 5.6</a>.</p>

Figure 5.6 Use of an acetal as a protecting group in a natural product synthesis</figcaption></figure>


<h3 class="h3"><b>Protection of alcohols</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Alcohols may be converted to a range of derivatives to prevent their further reaction in synthesis. The choice of protecting group depends on the other functionality present within the molecule and the nature of the synthetic transformations to be performed.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><u>a)	Use of acetals</u> <i>Acetals</i> not only serve as useful protecting groups for aldehydes and ketones, they also find widespread use in the protection of alcohols. Commonly used acetals include tetrahydropyranyl (THP) derivatives (prepared from dihydropyran in the presence of an acid catalyst), and the methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM) derivative (prepared by reaction of the alcohol with methoxyethoxymethyl chloride under basic conditions). Each acetal has similar properties to the cyclic acetals described above and is simply removed by treatment with aqueous acid (<a href="#fig_5.7">Figure 5.7</a>).</p>

<b>Figure 5.7 </b>Acetals as protecting groups for alcohols</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka"><u>b)	Use of ethers</u> Alcohols may be simply converted to <i>ethers</i> by nucleophilic attack on a suitable alkyl halide. Ethers are stable to basic and mildly acidic conditions; they do not react with oxidising or reducing agents and are inert to organometallic reagents. However this stability means that many ethers are not easily cleaved to their parent alcohol under mild conditions. Therefore only certain ethers are commonly used as protecting groups for alcohols, e.g. benzyl ethers (<a href="#fig_5.8">Figure 5.8</a>) which are converted to alcohols under neutral conditions by catalytic hydrogenolysis and <i>t</i>-butyl ethers (<a href="#fig_5.8">Figure 5.8</a>) which are readily hydrolysed with dilute acid.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A <i>t</i>-butyl ether protection step has been employed in the series of reactions shown in <a href="#fig_5.9">Figure 5.9</a>, in which the positions of a ketone and an<a id="page_45" class="page" >Page 45,  Selectivity I: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>alcohol are transposed. The initial protection permits the differentiation of two alcohol groups, one of which must be subsequently oxidised.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><u>c)	Use of trialkvlsilvl ethers</u> A further group which has found widespread use for the protection of alcohols in organic synthesis, are <i>trialkylsilyl ether</i> derivatives such as trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers. These are prepared by reaction of an alcohol with trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of a base. However trimethylsilyl ethers are not particularly stable and are cleaved under acidic or basic conditions and are attacked by certain nucleophiles (<a href="#fig_5.10">Figure 5.10</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_5.10">

</section>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Selectivity I: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">To overcome these problems a number of more bulky trialkylsilyl protecting groups have been developed, e.g. <i>t</i>-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), triisopropylsilyl (TIPS), and <i>t</i>-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) ethers. TBDMS ethers are more stable to hydrolysis than TMS ethers by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>. The steric bulk which renders the TBDMS group more stable than the TMS group also hinders the formation of the ether from <i>t</i>-butyldimethylchlorosilane. However reaction of the alcohol with the silyl chloride in the presence of imidazole gives high yields of the silyl ether.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Silyl ethers may be cleaved to their parent alcohols by fluoride ion. A convenient source of fluoride ion for this application is tetra-<i>n</i>- butylammonium fluoride (Bu<sub>4</sub>NF, or TBAF). The use of hydrofluoric acid itself is not favoured due to its corrosive nature.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the synthesis of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> reported by Corey, a key early intermediate (<b>6</b>) containing both silyl and acetal protecting groups was prepared using a Wittig reaction (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). Using mild acid conditions it was possible to selectively hydrolyse the acetal without removing the silyl group to give (<b>7</b>), thus freeing one hydroxy group selectively for use in another Wittig reaction. The silyl group was kept in place until the end of the synthesis, which is shown in abbreviated form in <a href="#fig_5.11">Figure 5.11</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Protection of amines</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The reactive lone pair of electrons on the amino group allows protonation of an amine as well as reactions with electrophiles. It is therefore often necessary to protect this group in a form in which the lone pair is much less reactive. The most efficient and convenient way of doing this is to convert the amine into an amide or a carbamate group. The carbonyl group effectively withdraws electron density from the nitrogen and renders it unreactive. When required, the amine can be regenerated by acid catalysed hydrolysis of the amide or carbamate. The <i>t</i>-butylcarbamate group is especially valuable in this respect since it is easily removed using mild acid. It has been successfully exploited in the Merrifield process for the synthesis of peptides in which a peptide chain is &#x2018;grown&#x2019; one amino acid at a time from a solid polymer support (<a href="#fig_5.12">Figure 5.12</a>). After all the amino acids have been added the peptide is removed from the polymer by hydrolysis.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Avoiding the use of a protecting group</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although protecting groups should be easy to put on and readily cleaved in high yield, one of the criteria of a good synthetic strategy is to keep the route as short as possible. Therefore ideally a synthetic scheme should be designed and reagents chosen such that the use of protecting groups is kept to a minimum.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">As an example consider the conversion of 3-bromopropan-l-ol to 3-deuteriopropan-l-ol. It is well established that hydrolysis of a Grignard reagent with D<sub>2</sub>O is an effective method for the introduction of deuterium into a molecule. If this reaction is to be utilised in this case, the alcohol must be protected, for example as the <i>t</i>-butyl ether derivative, prior to formation of the Grignard reagent. (<i>Why is it necessary to protect the alcohol prior to formation of the Grignard reagent?)</i> Reaction of the O-protected<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Selectivity I: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>Grignard reagent with D<sub>2</sub>O followed by deprotection of the ether with aqueous sulphuric acid would then give 3-deuteriopropan-l-ol.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4	<b>Reaction of just one of two identical functional groups</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">When a molecule contains two reactive groups, we have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively react each functional group separately with the use of mild reagents and/or protecting groups. However not only is it possible to differentiate between two functional groups of unequal reactivity within a molecule, it may also be possible to react just one of two identical functional groups. This may be achieved with limited success by reaction with one equivalent of reagent, e.g. in the conversion of the diol to the ethyl ether (<a href="#fig_5.14">Figure 5.14</a>). The other compounds which are present in the reaction mixture are the diol and the diether; these are easily separable. However in the case of a molecule with two <i>almost identical</i> groups, reaction with one equivalent of reagent would lead to a mixture of products which would be difficult to separate.</p>
