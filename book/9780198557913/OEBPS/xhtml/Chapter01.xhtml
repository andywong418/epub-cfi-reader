<h2 class="h2"><b>1.1 The aims and assumptions of this book</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">In 1965 Professor R. B. Woodward was awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions over many years to 'The Art of Organic Synthesis&#x2019;, an apt description of a science which requires creativity and ingenuity as much as logical analysis. When considering possible routes for the synthesis of a particular target molecule, one draws on an almost unimaginably vast database of potential transformations and for this reason the subject remains largely a matter of personal opinion and interpretation. In this respect organic synthesis is like the game of chess, in which the rules are simple to learn yet the effective application may take many years to perfect. It is the aim of this book to teach the rules and to provide some hints and guidelines for their application.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In writing this book we have assumed a basic chemical knowledge up to approximately the end of first year degree level although some brief revision of key terms and conventions is provided. If at any stage you find that you are not familiar with any reaction mechanism or concept, we suggest that you refer to one of the texts listed under further reading at the end of each chapter. For a general introduction or revision of key concepts of organic synthesis we recommend the OUP primer <i>Foundations of Organic Chemistry</i>, number 9 in this series.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.2  The importance of organic synthesis </b></h2>

<p class="noindent">The synthesis of a particular compound from commercially available starting materials is fundamental to nearly all aspects of organic chemistry. After all, if the physical, chemical, or physiological properties of a compound are to be examined we need a pure sample of it, e.g. the football-shaped molecule buckminsterfullerene (C<sub>60</sub>) Thousands of organic compounds are naturally occurring and may be isolated from natural sources such as fungi, bacteria and plants but often not in sufficient quantities for a comprehensive study. In addition many fascinating compounds are not naturally occurring and hence these molecules must be prepared to enable their properties to be investigated.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">By working steadily through this book we hope that you will learn to draw on your chemical knowledge to design logically efficient syntheses of organic compounds and to assess critically the proposed synthetic route.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">One class of natural products which has aroused a great deal of interest from the scientific community is the prostaglandins. These compounds all have a framework based on a five-membered carbocyclic ring bearing two long carbon chains on adjacent atoms, e.g. prostaglandin PGA<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2,  Introduction to synthesis</a>Prostaglandins have been found in nearly all human tissues and are intimately involved in a host of physiological processes including the induction of labour in childbirth, regulation of the inflammatory response, and the lowering of blood pressure. Initial research on prostaglandins was hampered significantly by the small amounts of material which could be isolated from natural sources, hence many elegant synthetic approaches have been devised.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Consider the problems posed by a synthesis of a molecule such as PGA<sub>2</sub>: a <i>trans</i>-disubstituted cyclopentenone ring must be constructed, the secondary alcohol, ketone, carboxylic acid, and three double bonds must all be placed in their correct positions (regiochemistry) and the geometry of two of the double bonds must be controlled. In addition the stereochemistry of the alcohol and the side chains must be established. To achieve an efficient synthesis of PGA<sub>2</sub> therefore presents a significant challenge to the skills of the organic chemist&#x0021;</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Before addressing methods to approach these problems, a brief revision will be given of the importance of bond polarity and the use of the &#x2018;curly arrow&#x2019; notation.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.3  Bond polarity</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Although the depiction of covalent bonds (e.g. H<sub>3</sub>C&#x2014;OH ) suggests an even sharing of electrons, this is rarely the case due to the inherent <i>electronegativity</i> of atoms. The most electronegative atoms generally lie towards the top right hand corner of the periodic table and are those to which electrons are most strongly attracted. As a result, carbon-heteroatom bonds are polarised and, since most heteroatoms are more electronegative than carbon (i.e. O, N, Br, Cl, I, etc.), a net positive charge resides on carbon. However hydrogen, silicon and metals such as magnesium and lithium are electropositive compared with carbon; the polarity on the C-X bond in these cases is reversed and a net negative charge resides on carbon.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">These influences on the electron distribution in &#x03C3; bonds are known as <i>inductive effects.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Bond polarisation effects may be transmitted to remote locations through conjugated &#x03C0;-bonds leading to delocalisation of the charge. For example an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound has two sites bearing a partial positive charge as illustrated by the resonance structures shown below (<a href="#fig_1.1">Figure 1.1</a>). By judicious choice of reaction conditions, it is often possible to control the position of attack of a nucleophile to an enone so that only one of these<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3,  Introduction to synthesis</a>

electron deficient sites is attacked. Transmissions of electron distribution through the &#x03C0;-orbitals are known as <i>mesomeric</i> effects.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"> Although electronegative atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen attract electrons through inductive effects, their lone pair of electrons may be donated through a suitably aligned &#x03C0;-system by mesomeric effects. The resultant patterns of polarisation have an important bearing on the reactivity of organic compounds as illustrated for the case of aniline (aminobenzene), which reacts with electrophiles at the <i>ortho-</i> or <i>para</i>- positions of the aromatic ring as well as on nitrogen (<a href="#fig_1.2">Figure 1.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.4 &#x2018;Curly arrow &#x2019; notation</b></h2>

<p class="noindent"><b>Arrow pushing to depict mechanism: a brief revision</b></p>
<p class="noindent">When one molecule reacts with another, a bond may be formed between an electron deficient atom with a partial (&#x03B4;&#x002B;) or full positive charge and an electron rich moiety with a partial (&#x03B4;-) or full negative charge via electron transfer. &#x2018;Arrow pushing&#x2019; is the convention used by organic chemists to illustrate the <i>movement of electrons</i>. Each side of the head of the &#x2018;curly arrow&#x2019; represents one electron. Thus, the single-headed arrows or so-called &#x2018;fish hooks&#x2019; represent the movement of one electron (as in radical reactions, see below) and a double-headed arrow indicates the movement of two electrons. Therefore each double-headed arrow represents:</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.5 Free radical reactions</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Most organic reactions involve heterolytic cleavage of bonds and reactions between positive or negatively charged or polarised species. However organic compounds can also become involved in radical reactions, an area which is growing in importance in synthesis. In radical reactions the mechanisms are illustrated using single-headed arrows which show the movement of single electrons rather than pairs of electrons. Unlike double-headed arrows, radical arrows <i>are permitted</i> to point towards each other, and indeed this is the general case, since each contributes one member of a pair of electrons.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Radical reactions have been used recently for intramolecular cyclisation reactions as illustrated by the synthesis of hirsutene. The key step involves formation of the target molecule from a simple precursor in one impressive radical reaction (<a href="#fig_1.6">Figure 1.6</a>). Homolytic cleavage of the carbon-iodine bond occurs first (initiated by attack by a tributyltin radical), followed by an intramolecular cyclisation and finally reaction with tributyltin hydride gives hirsutene.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.6  Conclusions </b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Further discussions of polarity and its significance in synthetic design are given in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a>  to  <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">  4</a>. Many excellent texts are available describing the vast array of chemical reactions which are known, some of which are referenced below. With practice you will not only become familiar with these reactions but also begin to appreciate the evolving patterns of reactivity which give organic chemistry beauty in its simplicity and logic.</p>
