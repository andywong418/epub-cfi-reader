<p class="indent3-ka">In the previous chapter the basic concepts of retrosynthetic analysis were introduced and the importance of polarity highlighted. The reactivity of unsaturated carbonyl compounds introduces the use of a further pattern of bond polarity which is emerging in our logical approach for the design of efficient syntheses of target molecules. The best disconnections (all but disconnection 3) of target alcohol (<b>1</b>) shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (summarised in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.9">Figure 2.9</a>) led to synthons which had an alternating pattern of charges as we move away from the hydroxyl or carbonyl group, starting with a positive charge on the carbon adjacent to oxygen. Writing this alternating pattern of <i>imaginary</i> charges or 'latent polarities' on a target molecule can greatly assist the identification of potential synthons since breaking a bond in the retrosynthetic direction immediately gives viable synthons for which corresponding reagents are available.</p>

<p class="aside">Note that in this text latent polarities will be represented as the circled forms &#x2295; and &#x229D; to distinguish them from full charges. However please note that this should not be regarded as a widely accepted notation.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Many functional groups commonly found in organic molecules exhibit a similar pattern of latent polarities to the carbonyl and hydroxyl group. For example alkyl halides (which may be prepared from alcohols), imines and amines have the same pattern of latent polarities as a carbonyl group (<a href="#fig_3.2">Figure 3.2</a>). Note that in all cases, the polarities are arranged such that a positive <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Retrosynthetic analysis II: Latent polarity and FGIs</a>charge is initially placed on the carbon adjacent to the heteroatom, whether linked through a single or double bond. Exceptions to these patterns will be highlighted as appropriate in the following discussion.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2 Target molecules with two functional groups</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">If a target molecule contains more than one substituent or functional group, it is essential that the synthesis is designed to take account of the final position of all of these groups. The concept of latent polarity often enables us to identify the best position to make a disconnection within more complex molecules.</p>


<h3 class="h3">1,3-Disubstituted compounds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Consider the synthesis of the &#x03B2;-hydroxy ketone <b>(3).</b> If the latent polarities arising from each of the functional groups are added, we see that they overlap (<a href="#fig_3.3">Figure 3.3</a>). This coincident relationship of overlapping latent polarities is known as a <i>consonant</i> pattern and when this pattern is present within a molecule, a simple synthesis may often be achieved.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Examining the retrosynthetic analysis of (<b>3</b>), it is apparent that one of the best disconnections leads to the synthons (<b>4</b>) and (<b>5</b>) corresponding to benzaldehyde and the enolate of acetone (<a href="#fig_3.4">Figure 3.4</a>). Under appropriate conditions this molecule may dehydrate to give the unsaturated ketone (<a href="#fig_3.5">Figure 3.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This simple synthesis neatly puts both functional groups in the &#x03B2;-hydroxy ketone (<b>3</b>) in their correct position. A similar approach may be used for the synthesis of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and 1,3-diols, since these compounds may be simply prepared from the &#x03B2;-hydroxy ketone (<b>3</b>) by functional group interconversions (<a href="#fig_3.6">Figure 3.6</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">'As a general rule <i>a disconnection nearer the centre of a molecule is usually favoured so that maximum simplification is achieved.</i> As a logical extension to the above example, the retrosynthetic analysis of the 1,5-dicarbonyl compound (<b>6</b>) reveals a similar matching or consonant pattern of latent polarities (<a href="#fig_3.7">Figure 3.7</a>). In this case the best synthon pair is (<b>7</b>) and (<b>8</b>) corresponding to the enone (<b>9</b>) and enolate derived from acetone as shown in <a href="#fig_3.8">Figure 3.8.</a> The synthesis then is a conjugate addition (or Michael addition) of the enolate to the enone.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Simplicity is the key.</i> Carbonyl reactivity alone is enough to control the location of functional groups in the target molecule (<b>6</b>). Not only may compounds containing 1,3- or 1,5- dioxygenated functions be disconnected in this way, any system containing a l,<i>n</i>-dioxygenated function where <i>n</i> is an odd number follows this pattern, provided the reagents for its synthesis are unsaturated to enable transmission of polarity.

<p class="noindent">The process of identifying suitable disconnections becomes rather more complex when groups in a <b>T.M.</b> form patterns of latent polarity which do not match up. Consider the synthesis of 2,5-hexadione (<b>10</b>). If the patterns of latent charges are added to (<b>10</b>) it becomes apparent that they are not superimposable (<a href="#fig_3.9">Figure 3.9</a>). This relationship is termed <i>dissonant.</i> In this case we cannot disconnect the system to a pair of precursors which can be linked simply under the control of the reactivity of the carbonyl group.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Retrosynthetic analysis of (<b>10</b>) (<a href="#fig_3.10">Figure 3.10</a>) may lead to synthons (<b>11</b>) and (<b>12</b>); it is clear that whilst the former corresponds to the enolate of acetone, the charge in (<b>12</b>) does not correspond to the polarity normally associated with a carbonyl group or its derivatives. We therefore require a reagent equivalent to synthon (<b>12</b>). The German word <i>umpolung</i> is used to describe situations of this sort in which a synthon of opposite polarity to that normally associated with the required functional group must be used. A great deal of research has been targeted towards devising solutions to this type of disconnection problem and some commonly used methods are outlined below.</p>

nucleophilic ring opening of an epoxide in the preparation of the alcohol (<b>1</b>) (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.5">Figure 2.5</a>). Reaction of epoxides with nucleophiles is a relatively facile process due to the relief of strain energy achieved upon opening the oxirane ring. If the nucleophile is an enolate, the product will contain a 1,4-dioxygenated pattern. Subsequent adjustment of the oxidation level of the 1,4-dioxygenated compound may then be used (in the case of (<b>10</b>) an oxidation is required, <a href="#fig_3.11">Figure 3.11</a>).

<p class="indent3-ka"><b>b) &#x03B1;-Haloketones or esters.</b> Perhaps the simplest solution to the problem of mismatched latent polarities is to use reagents with strategically placed heteroatoms. The leaving group ability of the bromide overrides the inherent latent polarity pattern imposed by the carbonyl group (<a href="#fig_3.12">Figure 3.12</a>). &#x03B1;-Bromoketones or esters are generally prepared by the acid catalysed bromination of the parent ketone or ester.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A word of caution: &#x03B1;-halo carbonyl compounds may be readily deprotonated at the position adjacent to the halide and the resultant enolate may then attack another carbonyl group giving an epoxy-ketone as shown in <a href="#fig_3.13">Figure 3.13</a>. This reaction is known as the Darzens condensation. Although this is a valuable reaction, it does not give the product required in this case. A way to circumvent the problem is to use an enamine instead of an enolate (for further details see recommended texts). The Favorskii rearrangement may also be a competing side reaction (see OUP primer <i>Polar Rearrangements</i>, number 5 in this series).</p>

The hydrogen atoms on the carbon atom between the two sulphur atoms are relatively acidic (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 31) so that reaction with a strong base such as butyllithium results in the formation of the corresponding anion. The anion will react with a variety of electrophiles including carbonyl compounds, epoxides and primary and secondary halides. Finally the thioacetal function may be hydrolysed in good yield by mercuric salts to give the corresponding carbonyl compound (<a href="#fig_3.14">Figure 3.14</a>). Thus the electrophilic carbonyl compound has undergone reverse polarisation in the formation of the thioacetal (to become the nucleophile). The 1,3-dithiane is known as an <i>acyl anion</i> equivalent.</p>

In this reaction sequence the cyanide ion has effectively acted as the synthetic equivalent of the synthon (<b>12</b>), in which a negative charge is located on the carbon atom directly attached to oxygen (<a href="#fig_3.16">Figure 3.16</a>).

<p class="noindent">The retrosynthetic analysis and hence the synthesis of cyclic systems follows essentially the same rules as for acyclic systems. However a larger choice of possible disconnections generally exists if more than one functional group is to be incorporated into the cyclic product. Most of the reactions described above may be used in an <i>intramolecular</i> sense to build rings. Several factors have to be considered:</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">i) <i>The probability of the two reactive species meeting to enable an intramolecular reaction to proceed.</i> There is a higher probability of two reactive species colliding when separated by a shorter rather than a longer chain. Indeed if the intramolecular cyclisation reaction would lead to a ring larger than six-membered, intermolecular reactions may compete with the cyclisation process leading to the formation of dimers, trimers and other polymers. Reaction of the diester (<b>15</b>) with sodium ethoxide gives the cyclopentanone (<b>16</b>) (Dieckmann condensation) in 80&#x0025; yield whereas cyclisation of (<b>17</b>) to form the cyclohexanone (<b>18</b>) proceeds in only 54&#x0025; yield (<a href="#fig_3.20">Figure 3.20</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">ii) <i>Stereo electronic effects</i>. It is essential to achieve a suitable orbital alignment for the intramolecular reaction to occur. Some quite dramatic differences in reactivity can result from small structural changes. For example treatment of the ester (<b>19</b>) with sodium methoxide gives a butyrolactone whereas the analogous reaction on ester (<b>20</b>) leads to the tetrahydropyran derivative (<a href="#fig_3.22">Figure 3.22</a>). For a further discussion of such stereoelectronic effects in cyclisation reactions (which are highlighted in Baldwin's rules) see the references cited at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">iii) <i>Ring strain.</i> As a guide the strain energy in unsubstituted saturated carbocyclic rings may be ordered as follows:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">small rings (3, 4) &#x003E; medium rings (8-12) &#x003E; common rings (5, 6, 7) &#x003D;</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"> large rings (13-membered and larger).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">These differences in ring strain may be used to good effect in the ring forming reaction sequence known as the Robinson annelation, e.g. in the synthesis of polycyclic ring systems such as steroids as illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.23">Figure 3.23</a>. Reaction of the ketone (<b>21</b>) with base, e.g. sodium methoxide, generates the enolate which undergoes a Michael addition to pent-l-en-3- one to give the adduct (<b>22</b>). Reaction of (<b>22</b>) with further base also gives an enolate and examination of the structure indicates that several enolates and aldol products could potentially be formed. However only one will lead to an intramolecular aldol reaction with formation of a fused six-membered ring and indeed the product (<b>23</b>) is formed in 65&#x0025; yield from the ketone (<b>22</b>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A further iteration of the annelation process may be employed for conversion of (<b>23</b>) to the tetracyclic compound (<b>24</b>). Ketone (<b>24</b>) is structurally related to the steroids, such as cholesterol, which are an important class of physiologically active compounds, and this is one of the most efficient methods for their preparation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A further important ring forming reaction which deserves particular note is the Diels-Alder reaction in which a diene and a dienophile react in a concerted process to give a six-membered ring containing a double bond. Either component can in principle contain heteroatoms and so a wide range of products containing six-membered rings may be prepared. The most successful Diels-Alder reactions are those in which an electron-withdrawing group is present on the dienophile. An electron-donating group on the diene can also be beneficial. Some examples are given in <a href="#fig_3.24">Figure 3.24</a>, and a specific example of the use of a Diels-Alder reaction in a total synthesis is given in the next chapter.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.6 Functional group interconversions (FGIs)</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Most complex molecules contain many more functional groups than simply the carbonyl group and often these may be prepared from carbonyl containing functional groups. For example, consider the synthesis of the ketone (<b>25</b>), containing a double bond. Since alkenes may be prepared by the dehydration of alcohols, the first step in the retrosynthetic analysis of (<b>25</b>) could be a functional group interconversion to an alcohol. But which alcohol? In one case (<b>26</b>) the resulting substituents are in a consonant disposition whereas in the second case (<b>27</b>) they are dissonant (<a href="#fig_3.25">Figure 3.25</a>). Obviously we can circumvent this problem by using one of the methods involving reversal of polarity described in <a href="#sec_3.3">section 3.3.</a> However it is much simpler to use the functional group interconversion which leads to the consonant relationship of the functional groups. Further retrosynthetic analysis leads to the identification of suitable synthons and reagents. Hence the synthesis of (<b>25</b>) may be simply achieved via an aldol reaction with benzophenone and benzaldehyde.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In this section we will survey the principal functional group interconversions which are commonly encountered in organic synthesis. It is not intended to provide a list of reactions but to simply highlight the relationships between functional groups. More details of the reactions can be found in the recommended texts under further reading.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.6.1">

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.6.1 Functional groups containing heteroatoms</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">For convenience these functional groups will be initially divided into three major classes depending upon their oxidation level.</p>



<p class="noindent"><a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Retrosynthetic analysis II: Latent polarity and FGIs</a></p>
<h3 class="h3">a) Carboxylic acids and their derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">Compounds in this class are at the highest oxidation level of organic compounds and include carboxylic acid (RCO<sub>2</sub>H), ester/lactone (RCO<sub>2</sub>H), amide/lactam (RCONHR), anhydride (RCO.O.COR'), and acid chloride (RCOC1). They may be interconverted by a series of simple reactions as shown in <a href="#fig_3.26">Figure 3.26</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 3.26 Transformations of carboxylic acid derivatives</figcaption></figure>

<h3 class="h3">b) Aldehydes, ketones and their derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">Functional groups in this class are at a lower oxidation level than class a) and may include the feature C&#x003D;X in which the carbon atom is bonded directly to either hydrogen or carbon (but not to another heteroatom). The group includes aldehydes (RHC&#x003D;O), ketones (RR'C&#x003D;O), imines (RR'C&#x003D;NR"), hydrazones (RR'C&#x003D;NNHR") and oximes (RR'C&#x003D;NOH). These compounds may generally be interconverted using addition/dehydration reactions. For example addition of an amine to an aldehyde followed by loss of one molecule of water gives an imine (Figure 3.27).</p>

<figure class="fig1" id="fig_3.27">

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 3.27 Transformations of aldehydes</figcaption></figure>
<a id="page_29" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 29, Retrosynthetic analysis II: Latent polarity and FGIs</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The other important classes of compounds in this section are those which contain two heteroatoms attached to the same carbon atom, e.g. acetals (RO.CHR'.OR) and dithianes (RS.CHR'.SR). Methods for their interconversion are shown in <a href="#fig_3.27">Figure 3.27</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">c) Alcohols and their derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">Apart from alcohols (ROH) themselves, this class includes amines (RNH<sub>2</sub>), thiols (RSH), disulphides (RSSR), ethers (ROR) and alkyl halides (RX). In order to convert an alcohol to other functional groups within the same oxidation level, it is necessary to convert the hydroxyl group into a good leaving group, e.g. an alkylsulphonate ester (<a href="#fig_3.28">Figure 3.28</a>). Sulphonate esters are prepared by the reaction of an alcohol and an appropriate alkylsulphonyl chloride in the presence of a base (n.b. the sulphonate ester is an excellent leaving group since the resultant negative charge is resonance stabilised over three oxygen atoms).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Alcohols may be converted to halides by the <i>in situ</i> activation of the hydroxyl group (<a href="#fig_3.29">Figure 3.29</a>). A word of caution; elimination reactions can often compete with substitution to give alkenes.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Interconversions between the three oxidation levels a, b, and c above</h3>
<p class="noindent">To move between groups classified in the previous section, it is necessary to perform a reduction or oxidation reaction at some stage.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Oxidation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many methods have been developed for the oxidation of organic compounds and it is possible to transform a low oxidation level functional group into essentially any group of higher level (<a href="#fig_3.30">Figure 3.30</a>). Further details of these reactions will be given in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Retrosynthetic analysis II: Latent polarity and FGIs</a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Reduction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Essentially the reverse of oxidation, the reduction of carboxylic acids and their derivatives generally proceeds via the 'aldehyde oxidation level' before reaching the 'alcohol level'. Reduction of carbonyl compounds is usually achieved with metal hydride reagents, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>) (<a href="#fig_3.31">Figure 3.31</a>).</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 3.31 Reductions</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Total removal of a functional group to form a hydrocarbon may be achieved in a number of ways. Dehydration of an alcohol followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant alkene over a metal catalyst, e.g. Pd, gives the corresponding alkane. Alternatively an alcohol may be converted <i>either</i> to an alkylsulphonate ester which in turn may be reduced with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> <i>or</i> to a suitable thio-derivative (e.g. the xanthate) which may be reduced with tri-<i>n</i>-butylstannane under radical conditions to give the alkane (<a href="#fig_3.32">Figure 3.32</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">Figure 3.32 Removal of a hydroxyl group</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Several methods exist for the removal of a carbonyl group including the Clemmensen reduction (Zn, HC1) and the Wolff-Kishner reduction (NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, KOH). The choice of reaction conditions often depends on the presence of other functionality within the molecule (<a href="#fig_3.33">Figure 3.33</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Aromatic compounds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Most of the chemistry of aromatic compounds involves substitution reactions in which an electrophile or nucleophile displaces a hydrogen atom or a functional group already attached to the ring. The aromaticity of the ring is maintained. However a very important reaction of aromatic rings in which the aromaticity is not retained is their reduction to 1,4-dienes using sodium in liquid ammonia (the Birch reduction,
<a href="#fig_3.35"> Figure 3.35</a>). The position of the bonds relative to a substituent in the diene depends on whether the substituents are electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>3.7  Conclusion and practice examples</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most of the reactions described in this section will have been discussed in more detail in first and second year lectures and many excellent texts are available giving reaction mechanisms and experimental procedures. Armed with the knowledge of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, functional group interconversions and the concept of polarity, the retrosynthetic approach described in this book should allow you to tackle the synthesis of some reasonably complex molecules.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">It is useful at this stage to devise syntheses of a range of target molecules for yourself and we recommend that you carry out the retrosynthetic analyses and hence suggest syntheses of the following compounds from readily available starting materials. You will find the table summarising synthons and equivalent reagents given on 
<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_13">page 13</a> useful when working through these examples. </p>
