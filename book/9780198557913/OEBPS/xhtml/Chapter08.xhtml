<h2 class="h2"><b>8.1 Introduction</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">In the previous chapters, guidelines have been given for the logical design of synthetic routes to a particular compound from commercially available materials using retrosynthetic analysis. The importance of a good basic knowledge of potential selective functional group interconversions has also been highlighted. Further details of specific reagents and reaction conditions may be obtained from the literature. In this chapter we bring together these aspects of synthesis by considering a case history of selected syntheses of a class of natural products known as the pyrrolizidine alkaloids. We have deliberately chosen examples which introduce very little &#x2018;new chemistry&#x2019; that has not already been covered in the first and second year of a degree course. With practice, you should find that you have the knowledge to devise equally viable routes to organic molecules.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Background</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The pyrrolizidines are a group of alkaloids (naturally occurring nitrogen containing compounds) which are characterised by the presence of the basic necine skeleton (<b><a href="#ch8img_1">1</a></b>). The pyrrolizidine alkaloids exhibit remarkably diverse types of biological activity and have been reported to act as antitumor, hypotensive, anti-inflammatory, carcinogenic or hepatoxic agents. Indeed some of these compounds are now in clinical trials as antitumor agents.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The pyrrolizidine alkaloids often occur naturally as esters or macrocyclic bislactones (e.g. monocrotaline). The basic azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework (<b>1</b>) may have a number of substitution patterns and oxidation levels; however the most commonly found are the diols, either saturated e.g. platynecine (<b>2</b>), or unsaturated e.g. retronecine (<b>3</b>) and heliotridine (<b>4</b>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Selected organic syntheses</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The pyrrolizidine alkaloids have attracted the interest of the scientific community not only because of their remarkable biological activities but also because their diverse structures have been a stimulating challenge to the skills of the synthetic chemist (there are over 200 members of this class of compound). Many successful routes for the syntheses of these molecules have been described in the literature and we have selected four routes to compare and contrast.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In each of the four retrosynthetic analyses of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids described in this chapter, a different initial disconnection is used for the eventual assembly of the basic azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework. The logic of these will unfold in the discussion. The disconnections may be represented as:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Recall that in designing a synthetic route to the target molecules, it is necessary to</p>
<p class="aside">i.	Construct the basic bicyclic framework</p>
<p class="aside">ii.	Place the functional groups, i.e. the primary and secondary alcohols and in the case of heliotridine and retronecine, the alkene, in their correct positions (regiocontrol)</p>
<p class="aside">iii. Control the stereochemistry of the substituents.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.3	<b>Piatynecine (2)</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">As a first step in the analysis of piatynecine (<b>2</b>), add the latent polarities originating from the secondary alcohol and the nitrogen and, encouragingly, we can see immediately that they form a consonant pattern. Therefore it <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Selected organic syntheses</a>would be reasonable to make disconnection 1 to give synthon (<b>5</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.1">Figure 8.1</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure>
<img src="../images/page_76_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="aside">Latent polarities in (<b>2</b>)</p>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">When considering possible functional groups corresponding to the negatively charged part of the synthon (<b>5</b>) it is apparent that the anion may be either in the form of a Grignard reagent or generated by abstraction of an acidic proton by base. This latter method requires the use of a functional group which may not only serve to stabilise the negative charge formed on abstraction of the acidic proton, but also removed once the appropriate carbon-carbon bond forming reaction has been achieved.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:100%">
Figure 8.1
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">This approach was favoured by Roder, Bourauel and Wiedenfeld<sup>1</sup> who used an ester as the activating functional group as in synthon (<b>6</b>) (remember that an ester of a &#x03B2;-keto-ester group may be simply removed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation, see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). Therefore the positively charged part of synthon (<b>5</b>) should ideally leave a ketone to facilitate this decarboxylation step after carbon-carbon bond formation has been achieved, i.e. it should also be an ester as in (<b>7</b>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure>
<img src="../images/page_76_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Therefore our initial disconnection proposed above becomes the second stage of our retrosynthetic analysis. The first step is in fact functional group interconversion (FGI) of not only the secondary alcohol to a ketone but also the primary alcohol to an ester (<b>8</b>) as shown in <a href="#fig_8.2">Figure 8.2.</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">When analysing a molecule using the retrosynthetic approach it is important to always bear in mind the forward synthesis and to be aware of the presence of other functional groups within the molecule. Therefore in this case it is advantageous to make use of the fact that not only will reduction of a ketone give a secondary alcohol but reduction of an ester would give a primary alcohol, i.e. the two functional groups in our target molecule. The precise utility of this transformation will become apparent later.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The next stage in the retrosynthetic analysis of (<b>2</b>) involves disconnection (labelled 2) of the carbon-nitrogen bond in (<b>9</b>), to give synthons (<b>10</b>) and (<b>11</b>) equivalent to ethyl acrylate and the secondary amine (<b>12</b>) respectively. Although retrosynthetic analysis is a valuable tool in planning a synthesis of a target molecule, it may not be applied successfully at all times. The synthesis of amine (<b>12</b>) is an ideal example of this&#x0021; Adding the latent polarities to (<b>12</b>) starting from either the amine or the two ester functions leads to a dissonant pattern. Therefore it is not apparent which disconnection to make. However the amine (<b>12</b>) has been successfully prepared by Roder and co-workers as shown in <a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3.</a><sup>2</sup></p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Selected organic syntheses</a></p>


<p class="indent3-ka">Therefore in <a href="#fig_8.2">Figure 8.2</a> we have designed a plausible retrosynthetic analysis of platynecine (<b>2</b>) which obeys the rules outlined in this book. The synthesis of the target molecule is shown in <a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3.</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Synthesis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first step in the synthesis of the target molecule (<b>2</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3</a>) was the nucleophilic displacement of the iodide in (<b>13</b>) by dibenzylamine to cleanly give (<b>14</b>). <i>(Why is it necessary to protect the amine?)</i> Reaction of (<b>14</b>) with ethyl oxalyl chloride in the presence of a base, potassium <i>t</i>-butoxide, gave the required keto-diester (<b>15</b>) in 82&#x0025; yield. A series of reactions then took place in one-pot. Firstly the dibenzyl protecting group in (<b>15</b>) was reductively cleaved by catalytic hydrogenolysis to give the free amine which then reacted with the ketone to give a cyclic imine. Rearrangement of the imine gave (<b>16</b>) which was reduced to the required saturated diester (<b>12</b>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Conjugate addition of amine (<b>12</b>) to ethyl acrylate gave (<b>17</b>) which cleanly undergoes a Dieckmann cyclisation in the presence of sodium hydride to give the required bicyclic framework of platynecine with the correct stereochemistry for the ring junction and the ester at C-l.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Decarboxylation of the &#x03B2;-keto ester function in (<b>18</b>) was achieved with potassium hydroxide at reflux and the resulting ketone was not isolated but immediately reduced with sodium borohydride to give the hydroxy acid which lactonised spontaneously to give (<b>19</b>). Sodium borohydride approaches from the less hindered &#x03B1;-face of the ketone giving the required &#x03B2;-alcohol which lactonised. Finally lithium aluminium hydride reduction of the lactone (<b>19</b>) gave the target molecule platynecine (<b>2</b>) in eight steps and 13&#x0025; overall yield.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the retrosynthetic analysis of platynecine (<b>2</b>) described above, this analysis begins by considering a disconnection of type B as described in <a href="#sec_8.2">Section 8.2.</a> Two functional group interconversions need to be considered prior to this disconnection:</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em">i.	Conversion of the primary alcohol to the ester (the forward step being reduction).</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em">ii.	Conversion of the double bond in (<b>3</b>) to the secondary alcohol which bears a consonant relationship with the ester. The equivalent forward synthetic step is dehydration of this secondary alcohol to the required olefin.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em">These two FGIs lead to the dihydroxy-ester (<b>20</b>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em">Disconnection 1, the carbon-carbon bond in (<b>20</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.4">Figure 8.4</a>), gives the synthon (<b>21</b>) in which a negative charge resides &#x03B1; to the ester (simple abstraction of the acidic proton) and the positive charge resides on the carbon of the carbon-oxygen bond, giving (<b>22</b>) as the synthetic equivalent to <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Selected organic syntheses</a>synthon (<b>21</b>). However due to the availability of starting materials, it proved simpler to make the synthetic equivalent to the positive charge in (<b>21</b>) an ester rather than an aldehyde, i.e. (<b>23</b>) rather than (<b>22</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.5">Figure 8.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">As we saw in the formation of (<b>19</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3</a>), a facile lactonisation reaction may occur between an alcohol and an ester if they are positioned in a molecule such that the intramolecular reaction leads to the formation of a 5- membered ring lactone (known as a &#x03B3;-lactone). The reverse reaction is also possible, i.e. treatment of a lactone with sodium ethoxide returns the hydroxy-ester. Since intramolecular cyclisation of an alcohol and ester to give a &#x03B3;-lactone is such a facile process (and indeed may be difficult to avoid when the molecule is subjected to basic reaction conditions), the next stage of the retrosynthetic analysis of retronecine (<b>3</b>) involves a FGI to convert the hydroxy diester (<b>23</b>) to a lactone (<b>24</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.5">Figure 8.5</a>). Disconnection 2 in (<b>24</b>) then gives synthons (<b>25</b>) and (<b>26</b>), the synthetic equivalents of which are the secondary amine (<b>27</b>) and commercially available ethyl 2-bromoethanoate (<b>28</b>) respectively. FGI of the lactone (<b>27</b>) via cleavage of the 5-membered ring lactone back to the hydroxy-ester followed by conversion of the resultant secondary alcohol to a ketone, gives the keto-ester (<b>29</b>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Unlike the retrosynthetic analysis of amine (<b>12</b>) in the previous synthesis 
(<a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3</a>) which did not aid the design of a synthetic route because of a dissonant pattern of latent polarities, adding the latent polarities to (<b>29</b>) leads to a consonant pattern between the ketone and the nitrogen. Working backwards, first it is necessary to protect the amine function (see below) and then, in theory, two disconnections could be considered in (<b>34</b>), either the C- N bond (labelled A) or the C-CO bond (labelled B) (<a href="#fig_8.6">Figure 8.6</a>). The latter was selected. In order to obtain a synthetic equivalent with a negative charge at the required position, an ester (<b>32</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.7">Figure 8.7</a>) was used. The use of this ester is analogous to the use of the ester (<b>7</b>) for the synthesis of platynecine described in the previous section.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">As with the synthesis of platynecine described above, it is necessary to initially protect the amine to prevent the formation of unwanted by-products in the first reaction.

<p class="indent3-ka">Chemoselective reduction of the ketone in (<b>34</b>) with sodium borohydride gave a secondary alcohol which spontaneously cyclised to give the lactone(<b>35</b>). Deprotection of the amine with barium hydroxide proceeded smoothly to give (<b>27</b>) in 70&#x0025; yield. The next stage of the synthesis involved alkylation of the amine (<b>27</b>) with ethyl bromoacetate giving the N- carboethoxymethyl lactone (<b>24</b>) which was used by Narasaka and his co-workers to complete the synthesis of the target molecule, retronecine (<b>3</b>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Treatment of the bicyclic lactone (<b>24</b>) with sodium ethoxide gave a hydroxy ester which on reaction with sodium hydride gave the keto ester (<b>36</b>) via a Dieckmann cyclisation.

<p class="indent3-ka">During the last twenty years several methods have been developed for the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds including S<sub>N</sub>2 attack of nitrogen to a carbon atom bearing a suitable leaving group. In addition in this chapter, we <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Selected organic syntheses</a>have illustrated the value of the condensation of an amine with a ketone to give an imine which in turn may be reduced to give the C-N bond (<a href="#fig_8.3">Figure 8.3</a>). In the approach adopted in the synthesis described below, cyclisation to form the basic necine skeleton is achieved using a C-N bond forming reaction involving electrophilic attack of benzenesulphenyl chloride to an olefin to give the epi-sulphonium ion which in turn is attacked by nitrogen (<a href="#fig_8.8">Figure 8.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The synthesis of (&#x002B;)-heliotridine described below uses a homochiral starting material, (S)-malic acid. The approach to (&#x002B;)-heliotridine involves the disconnection D (introduced in <a href="#sec_8.2">section 8.2</a>) of the azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton.</p>

<p class="noindent">In common with the other three retrosyntheses that we have now considered, the first stage of the analysis of (<b>4</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.12">Figure 8.12</a>) involves a FGI. In this case the secondary alcohol must be protected and in place of the primary alcohol, a functional group (X) is required to give the synthetic equivalent to the negative charge of the disconnected carbon-carbon bond highlighted in (<b>51</b>). Several functional groups could have been considered to serve this purpose e.g. X may be an ester. However the dithiane was favoured by Chamberlin and Chung<sup>7</sup> The positive charge of synthon (<b>52</b>) requires a good leaving group &#x03B1; to nitrogen, and a hydroxyl group was used. Hence the synthetic equivalent of synthon (<b>52</b>) is (<b>53</b>). FGI on (<b>53</b>) gives the imide (<b>54</b>). The necessity of this FGI is not immediately apparent but relates to the availablity of starting materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Disconnection of the carbon-nitrogen bond of (<b>54</b>) gives two fragments (<b>55</b>)	, with a negative charge on nitrogen and the positively charged synthon (<b>56</b>)	. Due to the availability of starting materials, the most easily accessible homochiral synthetic equivalent of (<b>55</b>) proved to be the succinimide (<b>57</b>) (<a href="#fig_8.13">Figure 8.13</a>) which may, in turn, be prepared from commercially available (<i>S</i>)-malic acid and ammonia as described below. A synthetic equivalent to (<b>56</b>) is 2-(3-hydroxypropylidine)-l,3-dithiane (58) which may be prepared in good yield by the method of Chamberlin and Chung<sup>7</sup></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Synthesis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the first stage of the synthesis of (&#x002B;)-heliotridine (<a href="#fig_8.13">Figure 8.13</a>) (<i>S</i>)-malic acid was treated sequentially with acetyl chloride, gaseous ammonia and then acetyl chloride again to give the (<i>S</i>)-acetoxysuccinimide (<b>57</b>) in 52&#x0025; yield after crystallisation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The imide (<b>57</b>) was coupled with 2-(3-hydroxypropylidene)-l,3-dithiane in good yield. It was necessary to activate the alcohol in this reaction and Chamberlin and Chung<sup>7</sup> used a method first described by Mitsunobu which is outlined in <a href="#fig_8.14">Figure 8.14.</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Reduction of the diimide (<b>54</b>) with sodium borohydride gave (<b>53</b>) in 85&#x0025; yield. This reaction was carefully monitored since succinimides are sensitive to over-reduction by sodium borohydride.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The key ring forming step was then achieved in 68&#x0025; yield by firstly converting the alcohol to a good leaving group (a mesylate) which then spontaneously cyclised to (<b>51</b>) by the mechanism illustrated in <a href="#fig_8.15">Figure 8.15.</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Having formed the pyrrolizidine ring system, the next operation was to hydrolyse the acetate to free the secondary alcohol using potassium carbonate and then to migrate the double bond to the endocyclic position via a deprotonation-protonation reaction with LDA. These two steps were achieved to give (<b>59</b>) in 51&#x0025; yield.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Finally hydrolysis of the dithiane to the aldehyde and reduction of both the aldehyde and the lactam carbonyl groups with lithium aluminium hydride gave (&#x002B;)-heliotridine (<b>4</b>) in 8&#x0025; overall yield from commercially available (<i>S</i>)-malic acid.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>Concluding remarks</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Four methods for the synthesis of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been described using four different initial disconnections of the azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework. It would be difficult to select which is the best method. Each route has its own particular merits, e.g. the route to platynecine gives the highest yield, the second method for the synthesis of retronecine uses stereoselectivity to good effect and of course, the route to (&#x002B;)-heliotridine is the only enantioselective synthesis. As stated on page one of this primer: &#x2018;When considering possible routes for the synthesis of a particular target molecule, one draws on an almost unimaginably vast database of potential transformations and for this reason the subject remains largely a matter of personal opinion and interpretation&#x2019;.</p>
