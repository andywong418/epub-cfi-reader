<p class="noindent">As stated in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, the ability to synthesise a particular compound from commercially available materials is fundamental to nearly all aspects of organic chemistry. When presented with a specific target molecule, a synthetic route must be designed which enables a pure sample of the desired product to be obtained using a convenient and efficient procedure. The following factors need to be taken into consideration:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure>
<img src="../images/page_6_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">i)	The synthetic design must lead to the construction of the required carbon skeleton with all the substituents and functional groups in the correct positions (regiochemistry) and with the requisite three-dimensional orientations (stereochemistry).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">ii)	Ideally <i>the shortest synthetic route</i> to the product is required. A ten step synthesis with 80&#x0025; yield at each stage would only give a 10.7&#x0025; overall yield of the final product.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">iii)	Each stage of the synthesis should ideally <i>give only the desired product.</i> With the armoury of reagents and chemical reactions now at our fingertips, it is often possible to selectively introduce or react one functional group or isomer in an organic molecule when other reactions are possible. However at times mixtures of products are obtained which must be separated by chromatography or distillation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Taxol - a powerful anti-cancer agent</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Chemists have developed a logical approach for the design of routes for the preparation of organic compounds which involves working the synthesis backwards by making strategic carbon-carbon bond cleavages at points where, in the forward direction, bond forming reactions may be achieved. This is known as either the disconnection approach or <i>retrosynthetic analysis</i>. The fundamentals of the process of retrosynthetic analysis may be demonstrated by consideration of the synthesis of the secondary alcohol <b>(1)</b></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">From an examination of <b>(1)</b>, intuitively you may be able to suggest a possible route for its synthesis and, if you can, there is a high probability that you may be quite unconsciously using your chemical knowledge to achieve an &#x2018;informal&#x2019; retrosynthetic analysis of <b>(1)</b>. However this &#x2018;informal&#x2019; approach may not be so successful for the synthesis of a more complex molecule, e.g. taxol. In this chapter we have chosen the simple alcohol <b>(1)</b> to illustrate the basic principles of retrosynthetic analysis and these fundamental &#x2018;guidelines&#x2019; will be extended to more complex systems in<a href="Chapter03.xhtml"> Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2" style="text-indent:-1.5em;margin-left:1.5em"><b>2.2  Synthesis of a target molecule containing one functional group requiring a single disconnection</b></h2>

<p class="noindent"><i>Retrosynthetic analysis</i> is the process of &#x2018;breaking down&#x2019; a target molecule into readily available starting materials by means of imaginary breaking of bonds (<i>disconnections</i>) and by the conversion of one functional group to another by efficient chemical reactions <i>(functional group interconversions).</i> What is meant by &#x2018;readily available or simple starting materials&#x2019; is often not obvious when you first begin to think about synthesis. As a guide, readily available starting materials contain five carbon atoms or less (apart from units such as aromatic rings) and only one or two functional groups. However there are many exceptions to this general rule and when designing routes for the synthesis of organic compounds, it is valuable to refer to catalogues of commercially available materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In this case we will use retrosynthetic analysis to break down the alcohol <b>(1)</b> (our target molecule, <b>T.M.</b>), into readily available starting materials and then use this analysis to devise an appropriate &#x2018;forward&#x2019; synthetic route to the T.M. There is often more than one &#x2018;correct&#x2019; analysis. For example, even for a relatively simple molecule such as <b>(1)</b> we can easily think of at least six different ways to work backwards to break the molecule down into readily available starting materials. These six methods will now be described to highlight the principles of retrosynthetic analysis and then the relative merits of each route will be assessed.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis 1 of (1)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">First, imagine breaking (disconnecting) the carbon-carbon bond of <b>(1)</b> shown in <a href="#fig_2.1">Figure 2.1 </a>and putting a positive charge on one end of the cleaved bond and a negative charge on the other fragment.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8,  Retrosynthetic analysis  I :The basic concepts</a>The disconnection is represented by a wavy line through the bond to be broken and the retrosynthetic arrow &#x21D2; represents going from the target molecule &#x2018;backwards&#x2019; to the pair of charged fragments (known as <i>synthons).</i> In theory this disconnection may lead to two pairs of idealised fragments or synthons from which the alcohol can be prepared. If at first you are not sure which charge to put on which fragment, try both to see which of the two alternatives relates to recognisable functional groups in readily available starting materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In this case, since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, it is <i>not</i> easy to think of a simple reagent which will give the polarity on the carbon atom of synthon <b>(2)</b> resulting from pathway A. However considering pathway B, benzaldehyde and the Grignard reagent <b>(5)</b> are readily available reagents equivalent to the synthons<b> (3)</b> and <b>(4)</b>. Therefore from this analysis it is apparent that a straightforward synthesis of <b>(1)</b> would be the reaction of the Grignard reagent and benzaldehyde as shown in <a href="#fig_2.2"> Figure 2.2</a>.</p>

<figcaption   style="text-align:center;width:100%"><b>Figure 2.2 </b>Synthesis 1 of (1)</figcaption></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis and synthesis 2 of (1)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another equally possible retrosynthetic analysis of <b>(1) </b>involves disconnecting the carbon-carbon bond shown in <a href="#fig_2.3"> Figure 2.3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9,  Retrosynthetic analysis  I :The basic concepts</a>Again this leads to two possible pairs of ionised fragments. Only pathway D gives a pair of synthons <b>(6) </b>and<b> (7)</b>, for which there are obvious simple equivalent reagents, i.e. a Grignard reagent and an aldehyde. The synthetic route derived from this analysis is shown in  <a href="#fig_2.4">Figure 2.4</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis and synthesis 3 of (1)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">As a rule, an unsuitable pair of synthons which may arise from a disconnection is not shown in the final written version of the retrosynthetic analysis although it may have been taken into consideration when choosing the eventually favoured route for the synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore a third retrosynthetic analysis of <b>(1)</b> may be represented as shown in  <a href="#fig_2.5">Figure 2.5</a>. The favoured pair of synthons <b>(8)</b> and <b>(9)</b> are equivalent to the epoxide and the Grignard reagent which leads to the simple synthetic route shown in the same figure.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis and synthesis 4 of (1)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In each of the three synthetic routes described above, the alcohol<b> (1)</b> has simply been prepared by the reaction of a Grignard reagent with either an aldehyde (Methods 1 and 2) or an epoxide (Method 3). A different approach to the synthesis of<b> (1)</b> derives from the knowledge that ketones may be cleanly

reduced to give secondary alcohols with reagents such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Functional group interconversion</i> (FGI) is the term used in retrosynthetic analysis to describe the process of converting one functional group into another, for example by oxidation or reduction. It is represented by the symbol &#x21D2; with &#x2019;FGI&#x2019; above it.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Therefore if the alcohol<b> (1)</b> is converted into a ketone as the first stage of the analysis prior to cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond shown in  <a href="#fig_2.6">Figure 2.6</a>, then the pair of synthons <b>(10) </b>and <b>(11)</b> is simply equivalent to the addition of the enolate of acetophenone to the halide giving the synthesis shown below ( <a href="#fig_2.6">Figure 2.6</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis and synthesis 5 of <b>(1)</b></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A further retrosynthetic analysis of <b>(1) </b>( <a href="#fig_2.7">Figure 2.7</a>) again involves a functional group interconversion of the alcohol to the ketone prior to cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond. This gives the synthon <b>(12)</b> with the positive charge &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group (for which we can use the enone <b>(14)</b> as the synthetic equivalent), and the synthon <b>(13)</b> for which an appropriate carbon nucleophile such as a dialkylcuprate or a copper catalysed Grignard reagent (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) may be used ( <a href="#fig_2.7">Figure 2.7</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis and synthesis 6 of <b>(1)</b></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The final retrosynthetic analysis of<b> (1)</b> to be considered again requires an initial functional group interconversion of the alcohol to a ketone followed by a second FGI to form the &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ketone <b>(15)</b>. Cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond shown in <a href="#fig_2.8"> Figure 2.8 </a>leads to a synthesis in which addition of lithium diphenylcuprate to the dienone<b> (16)</b> furnishes the required carbon skeleton. Reduction of the enone <b>(15)</b> with sodium borohydride in the presence of copper (I) ions leads to 1,4-reduction (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) to give the requisite secondary alcohol <b>(1)</b> ( <a href="#fig_2.8">Figure 2.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Which is the best method?</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The route which is eventually chosen for the synthesis of<b> (1)</b> may depend on a variety of factors including the cost and availability of the reagents.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">As a general rule, disconnections nearer the centre of a molecule usually lead to the greatest simplification as will be seen in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">4</a>; therefore methods 1, 3, and 4 may be preferred.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In addition, the number of synthetic steps should ideally be kept to a minimum <i>unless</i> there is an advantage in using an FGI to facilitate a high yielding carbon-carbon bond forming reaction. By this criterion methods 1, 2, and 3 each require only a one-pot synthesis of <b>(1)</b> and would therefore be on our initial short list for investigation. However lithium dialkylcuprate additions to enones have proved to be excellent methods for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds; therefore method 5 should be given serious consideration.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In retrosynthetic analysis there is often more than one &#x2018;correct&#x2019; answer and the route eventually chosen may come down simply to personal choice. The advantages of retrosynthetic analysis may not be apparent to you from the
<a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13,  Retrosynthetic analysis  I :The basic concepts</a>
example of the synthesis of the simple alcohol <b>(1)</b>, but its value should become more obvious when we consider more complex target molecules.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3	<b>Synthetic equivalents to common synthons</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">In all the cases described above, the importance of the concept of polarity of bonds within functional groups (as outlined in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>) should be apparent, e.g. the epoxide with a &#x03B4;- on oxygen and a &#x03B4;&#x002B; on carbon enabling attack by the electron rich carbon atom of the Grignard reagent to form the required carbon-carbon bond. It is worth familiarising yourself with some of the synthetic equivalents which correspond to common synthons. These are given in <a href="#table_2.1"> Table 2.1</a> and may be deduced directly from a consideration of bond polarity and resonance effects.</p>
