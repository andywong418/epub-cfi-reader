<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of the topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series is designed to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this, the first Physical Chemistry Primer, Hugh Cartwright has produced a stimulating and easy-to-read account of the use of Artificial Intelligence in Chemistry. This is an emergent topic which is expected to facilitate the study of new types of problems within chemistry. This Primer will interest all students (and their mentors) who wish to see how modem computational approaches can transform the methodology of science.</p>
