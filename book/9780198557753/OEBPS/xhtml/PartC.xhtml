<p class="noindent">In Parts A and B we focused on organonitrogen compounds in which the nitrogen was bonded only to carbon or hydrogen. Although this yields a rich chemistry, the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups increases enormously if we also consider N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O bonds.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The reactivity of these compounds varies enormously, and we will consider some of the factors that influence this before looking at specific functional groups in more detail.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:3.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Typical bond strengths of C&#x2013;C, N&#x2013;N, and N&#x2013;O bonds are:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:1em;">C&#x2013;C&#160;&#160;345 KJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup></p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">N&#x2013;N&#160;&#160;220 KJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup></p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">N&#x2013;O&#160;&#160;220 KJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup></p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Strength of neutral N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O bonds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The main bonds we need to consider are N&#x2013;N, N&#x2013;O, N=N, and N=O. In general, carbon forms strong bonds with itself. In contrast, bonding is weaker between a pair of atoms which possess lone pairs because of lone pair&#x2013;lone pair repulsion&#x2026; so N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O systems are generally less stable than functional groups lacking this interaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The presence of &#x03C0;-bonds between the heteroatoms often provides a mechanism by which such compounds can react. For example, the N&#x2013;O bond may be thermodynamically quite weak, but (perhaps surprisingly) such compounds are relatively stable because there is no simple mechanism by which the N&#x2013;O bond can be broken. In contrast, nitroso compounds (R&#x2013;N=O) are very reactive since the polarized N=O &#x03C0;-bond facilitates mechanisms for a wide range of reactions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The stability of N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O systems is also strongly influenced by conjugated &#x03C0;-bonds. Thus oximes are stabilized by the &#x03C0;-bond being able to overlap with the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Charged functional groups</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some of the most important N&#x2013;O-containing functional groups are zwitterionic&#x2014;they possess both a positive <b>and</b> a negatively charged atom within the overall neutral group. One would normally expect charged compounds to be highly reactive, so why is that not the case with many charged N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O systems? The full reasons will become more apparent in later chapters, but some key factors can be gleaned by considering nitro compounds (R&#x2013;NO<sub>2</sub>):</p>

<p class="indentbullet" style="margin-top:0.5em;">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;&#160;The NO<sub>2</sub> functional group is strongly resonance stabilized&#x2014;this stabilization is lost during any chemical transformation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;&#160;The N and O atoms possess a full octet of electrons and have a charge which they are able to accommodate quite easily (remember that ammonium cations and alkoxide anions are relatively stable).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no simple mechanism by which the zwitterion can react&#x2014;this becomes apparent when you try the arrow pushing required to react with an electrophile or a nucleophile.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Inorganic counterparts</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">For many N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O functional groups, there is a simple inorganic analogue that contains the structural unit. These inorganic compounds are usually the source of the functional group when these organonitrogen compounds are synthesized:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:0em;width:70%;">

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">With these inorganic building blocks available, a wide range of N&#x2013;N and N&#x2013;O organonitrogen compounds are accessible. Of special importance is that nitrous and nitric acids can be sources of [NO]<sup>+</sup> and [NO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> respectively.</p>
