<p class="noindent">Amines are accessible from three main sources. Some (e.g. ethylamine, pyridine) are directly available from natural sources or as major industrial products&#x2014;these are the basic amine building blocks. Others can be synthesized by the introduction of the amino group to a suitable precursor. Finally, simple amines can be alkylated (directly or indirectly) to yield more complex amines.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">There are two types of reaction which are widely used for preparing or interconverting amines&#x2014;substitution and reduction.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>4.1&#160;&#160;Synthesis of amines via substitution reactions using amines or ammonia</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The simplest route to amines is displacement of a leaving group by ammonia. However, this is rarely of practical use, because further substitution reactions almost invariably occur:</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page25-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">So, if methylamine (MeNH<sub>2</sub>) or dimethylamine (Me<sub>2</sub>NH) was required, the other amino by-products would have to be removed. The order of reactivity of amines is controlled by both inductive and steric effects.</p>
<p class="noindentt">i.e. Reactivity of Me<sub>2</sub>NH > MeNH<sub>2</sub> > NH<sub>3</sub> > Me<sub>3</sub>N</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">There are two ways of getting the above reaction (i.e. methylation of ammonia) to yield largely a single product:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Use a large excess of NH<sub>3</sub></i>. In the above example, MeNH<sub>2</sub> would then be the main product, because the MeI will only rarely encounter any nucleophile other than ammonia. Of course, once all the MeI has been used up, no further reaction is possible. These reactions use the excess ammonia as a base (see below). This tactic is rarely practicable in organic synthesis, so special reagents that act like a mononucleophilic ammonia have been devised (see the next section).</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Use a large excess of MeI</i>. This will generate the ammonium salt, <img src="../images/page25-5.jpg" alt="images"/> and this reaction forms the basis of the Hoffmann exhaustive methylation/elimination procedure for degrading amines. In general, any amine can be fully methylated using an excess of MeI, although a base must be added to make sure that the liberated HI doesn&#x2019;t simply protonate the amine, and slow down any further alkylation. </p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">When amines are alkylated with groups larger than methyl, steric crowding makes the quatemization step very slow, and it is then often quite easy to stop the reaction at the tertiary amine stage.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.2&#160;&#160;Using mononucleophilic &#x2018;ammonia&#x2019;</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are several of these reagents now available, and they all require a second chemical step in order to liberate the free amino group:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-1em;">
 <img src="../images/page26-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Here are five widely used methods:</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(a) The classical Gabriel method</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">React the alkyl halide with potassium phthalimide, then reflux with OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (aq) or with H<sub>2</sub>N&#x2013;NH<sub>2</sub>. The Gabriel reagent (potassium phthalimide) can be made from readily available phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride, but it is usually bought ready for use.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-1em;">
 <img src="../images/page26-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Because the negative charge is delocalized on to the adjacent carbonyl oxygens, the Gabriel reagent acts as a nucleophile rather than a base, and readily displaces leaving groups from organic molecules. Once the nitrogen has acted as a nucleophile, it is essentially inert since its lone pair is <a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, Synthesis of amines</a>conjugated with the carbonyl groups, and it doesn&#x2019;t have the option of reforming an anion&#x2026;so it only acts as a nucleophile once. The full procedure is therefore:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page27-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><b>Trifluoroacetamide</b> itself is both non-basic and non-nucleophilic. This is because the lone pair on the nitrogen is delocalized onto the carbonyl (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#Ch07">Chapter 7</a>) and because the CF<sub>3</sub> group is so electron-withdrawing.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(b) CF<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>/NaH, then OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (aq)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is the same type of reaction as the Gabriel procedure, but the final hydrolysis step is much milder. The sodium hydride deprotonates the trifluoroacetamide; the adjacent carbonyl group (&#x2212;M) and nearby CF<sub>3</sub> group (&#x2212;I) help to stabilize the charge, and ensure that the nitrogen acts as a nucleophile rather than as a base.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-4em;">
 <img src="../images/page27-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Once the trifluoroacetamide anion has acted as a nucleophile, its reactivity is lost (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#Ch07">Chapter 7</a> on amides), and it does not easily lose another proton. Amides are hydrolysed a bit more readily than imides (cf. Gabriel&#x2019;s reagent), but the electron-withdrawing CF<sub>3</sub> group increases that rate of hydrolysis further&#x2014;so these species are about as reactive as esters. Thus, treatment with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M at room temperature) liberates the desired primary amine.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(c) NaN<sub>3</sub> then H<sub>2</sub>/Pd&#x2013;C</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a justly popular method that usually proceeds in very good yield. Sodium azide is an excellent nucleophile, but will only react <b>once</b> (compare <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Synthesis of amines</a>with amines) Reduction by catalytic hydrogenation then forms the free primary amine.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;">

<p class="indent3-ka1">The (perhaps surprising) stability of these dipolar azides is discussed in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#Ch10">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A neat variation is to use the chiral amine shown below (&#x00D7;), which undergoes conjugate addition to &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;- unsaturated esters with high asymmetric induction:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>(d)(PhCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH then H<sub>2</sub>/Pd&#x2013;C</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If secondary amines can be readily alkylated to tertiary amines, then a secondary amine with <b>removable</b> alkyl groups should be a good selective reagent for making primary amines. As the benzyl group can be removed from amines by hydrogenation, dibenzylamine can fulfil this role.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page28-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">All of the above methods used nitrogen as a nucleophile in a key substitution reaction, although a subsequent step was then needed to free the amino group. One last substitution trick introduces the &#x2018;CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>&#x2019; unit.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Cyanide is another good inorganic nucleophile that can only react once. This time, it is a nucleophilic carbon rather than nitrogen that displaces the leaving group, and the product therefore gains an extra carbon atom. The nitrogen can be liberated as the free NH<sub>2</sub> by reduction (lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>) or H<sub>2</sub>/Raney nickel under pressure), leading to the overall introduction of the CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> unit.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3&#160;&#160;Amines via reduction reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a range of nitrogen functional groups that can be readily reduced to the corresponding amine. In this section, we won&#x2019;t discuss in detail how the nitrogen functional groups can be incorporated, or how they enable other parts of the structure to be built up&#x2014;we will simply list some of those that can be reduced to the amine, and then discuss them briefly.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-6.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page29-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(a) Reduction of imines</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This simple reduction can be achieved by catalytic hydrogenation (H<sub>2</sub>/Pd&#x2013;C) or by a hydride reducing agent&#x2014;sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) is widely employed.</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-10em;">
 <img src="../images/page29-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The monobenzyl final product would have been very difficult to prepare using simple alkylation methods.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Importantly, it is often possible to form the imine <i>in situ</i>, and to carry out imine formation/reduction in a &#x2018;one-pot&#x2019; reaction. In particular, this can be exploited when ammonia is the amine, allowing aldehydes and ketones to undergo overall reductive amination to the primary amine.</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-10em;">
 <img src="../images/page29-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The source of the ammonia &#x2018;NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2019; is usually aqueous ammonium acetate <img src="../images/page29-4.jpg" alt="images"/> which generates the imine in an initial equilibrium step. The sodium cyanoborohydride is a less reactive <a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Synthesis of amines</a>hydride source than NaBH<sub>4</sub>, and is able to reduce the imine to the amine without reducing the ketone to the alcohol (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A variation to this approach is the Leuckart reaction, which effectively uses methanoic acid (formic acid) as the reducing agent: </p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The usual procedure is to employ the alkyl ammonium formate salt (RNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>. HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>); this reacts with aldehydes and ketones as if it were a mixture of the amine and formic acid, thereby generating a new amine in a &#x2018;one-pot&#x2019; reaction. An excess of the ammonium salt is required to avoid mixtures of amine products.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(b) Reduction of amides</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Amides are readily formed, but are less readily reduced; LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is the usual reducing agent. Amides can be formed from amines by acylation with an acid chloride or acid anhydride (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#Ch07">Chapter 7</a>). The nitrogen in the product can delocalize its lone pair on to the carbonyl group; this stabilization explains why monoacylation is easily accomplished, but this stability is also the reason that such powerful reducing agents are required.</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The base in the first step ensures that the acylation goes to completion. Once again, the overall process is monoalkylation of a primary amine&#x2014;a transformation that is very hard to achieve by direct alkylation. However, because LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is such a powerful reducing agent, it is important to check that other unwanted reductions won&#x2019;t also occur in the final step.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(c) Reduction of nitro compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Nitro compounds are readily reduced by a huge range of reagents:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<a id="page_31" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 31, Synthesis of amines</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Aromatic nitro compounds are, of course, readily accessible by direct nitration of a benzene derivative, so this is a particularly attractive way of making aromatic amines.</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-10em;">
 <img src="../images/page31-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Although most of the reduction methods outlined above <b>do</b> work with aromatic nitrocompounds, the use of tin and hydrochloric acid is common, and this is the classical way of preparing aniline (phenylamine) from benzene. For aliphatic nitro compounds, the other reductive methods (especially catalytic hydrogenation) are used more often.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><b>Complex amines from nitriles</b></p>
<p class="noindent2">As we will see in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#Ch08">Chapter 8</a>, nitriles can act like carbonyls and stabilize an adjacent negative charge:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1em;">
 <img src="../images/page31-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>(d) Reduction of nitriles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This was mentioned when cyanide was discussed as a nucleophilic source of nitrogen. In fact, nitriles can be further elaborated before the &#x2212;C&#x2261;N group is reduced (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#Ch08">Chapter 8</a>), so this is a particularly useful trick for preparing compounds containing the &#x2212;CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">e.g.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-1em;">
 <img src="../images/page31-3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Thus the nitrile could be further functionalized prior to the reduction leading to relatively complex amine side-chains.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">As the &#x2212;CN group is rather stable, powerful reduction methods are required such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, or hydrogenation under pressure over Raney nickel (a highly activated nickel catalyst).</p>
