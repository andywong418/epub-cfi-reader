<h1 class="main"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent" style="margin-top:-3em;">Nitrogen plays a pivotal role in organic chemistry, and there are a huge number of organonitrogen functional groups in natural products, man-made drugs, and new materials. Organonitrogen chemistry is so diverse that coverage in most organic textbooks is very fragmented. However, in this OUP primer we have brought together the features and reactions of organonitrogen functional groups, and the key principles which underly virtually all of the chemistry have been emphasized in short introductions to each of the three Parts of the book. We hope this will simplify matters for the newcomer at early undergraduate level, and may provide a clearer understanding (or useful revision) for those who are more experienced.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Organonitrogen chemistry is still delivering a wealth of fascinating research results, and the authors are currently studying aspects of asymmetric synthesis, heterocyclic synthesis, and the chemistry of unusual peptides. It is our continued fascination with nitrogen chemistry, and support from friends and family, that has spurred us on to complete this book. In particular, P. D. B. would like to thank his family for their support (Judy, Hannah, Thomas, and &#x2018;Junior&#x2019;), and his research group for their inspiration and enthusiasm, and K. M. M. would like to dedicate this book to his grandmother and grandfather.</p>
