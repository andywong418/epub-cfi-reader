<p class="fmnoindent" style="margin-top:-3em;">Organonitrogen compounds are amongst the most ubiquitous in chemistry and nature. The chemical properties of organonitrogen functional groups span the whole gamut of reactivity and mechanism and hence the topic provides an ideal focus for teaching organic chemistry: surprisingly this opportunity is rarely if ever exploited fully in standard texts.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry, and only contain the essential material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. This Organic Chemistry Primer provides an excellent and easy to read account of the universal topic of organonitrogen chemistry. It provides the basis for both specific courses and for the supplementary study of most aspects of organic chemistry conventionally dealt with in complementary ways throughout all chemistry courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
