<p class="noindent">Ammonium compounds have the general formula R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>R<sup>4</sup>N<sup>+</sup>, where R<sup><i>n</i></sup> can be alkyl, aryl, or hydrogen. But they fall into two distinct classes. Firstly, those in which one or more of the R groups is hydrogen; these ammonium cations are formed by simple protonation of an amine, and their formation is readily reversed.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">This is actually just another way of writing the <i>K</i><sub>b</sub> equilibrium discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#Ch01">Chapter 1</a> (just try adding OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to both sides). Importantly, when base is added to protonated amines, the ammonium ion just loses the proton to regenerate the free amine, and no other reactions occur.</p>

<p class="noindent2">It is released when a nerve ending receives an impulse. By altering the potential across the synapse, acetylcholine allows transmission of the impulse to the next nerve cell. Once the impulse has been transmitted, the acetylcholine is removed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester group. Organophosphate &#x2018;nerve gases&#x2019; inhibit this enzymatic process leading to a series of continuous nerve impulses, paralysis, and death.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The second class of ammonium ions are called quaternary ammonium ions. For these cations, all four R<sup><i>n</i></sup> groups in R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>R<sup>4</sup>N<sup>+</sup> are alkyl or aryl. Crucially, these cations are not in equilibrium with a neutral amine, and we will look at their properties, how they are made, and their key reactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.1&#160;&#160;Properties of quaternary ammonium ions</b></h2>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Quaternary ammonium compounds have a number of important properties, of which we will look at three:</p>
<p class="noindent">(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;chirality;</p>
<p class="noindent">(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;solubility in solvents;</p>
<p class="noindent">(iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;phase transfer catalysis.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chirality</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Amines possessing three different groups attached to nitrogen are potentially chiral. In practice, such compounds invert their stereochemistry thousands of times per second (the so-called &#x2018;umbrella&#x2019; effect):</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This idea is the basis of <b>resolution</b> whereby mixtures are separated at the end of a racemic synthesis. Prior to the development of modem asymmetric methods, this was the most commonly employed route to single enantiomers of chiral synthetic targets.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">If the racemic ammonium cation is allowed to form a salt with an enantiomerically pure carboxylic acid (e.g. (<i>R</i>)-2-phenylpropanoic acid, (<i>R</i>)-Ph&#x2013;CHMe&#x2013;CO<sub>2</sub>H), then the two ion pairs ((<i>R</i>)-ammonium ion/(<i>R</i>)-acid and (<i>S</i>)-ammonium ion/(<i>R</i>)-acid) are diastereoisomers, and should have slightly different properties. With a bit of luck, one ion pair might be persuaded to precipitate from a solvent in which the other pair is soluble. Chiral ammonium compounds are primarily of academic interest, but chiral phase transfer catalysts (see below) can be used to generate optically active products in some reactions.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Solubility in solvents</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Quaternary ammonium ions are schizophrenic! The charged ammonium part prefers polar solvents like water (it is hydrophilic or water-loving); the alkyl/aryl R groups are hydrocarbons that prefer non-polar organic solvents like benzene, ethoxyethane, dichloromethane (which are hydrophobic or water-hating). The result is pretty obvious&#x2014;in a two-phase water/organic <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Saturated nitrogen compounds</a>solvent system, quaternary ammonium compounds tend to partition appreciably into <b>both</b> phases. If the R groups are generally small, or have some hydrophilic functional groups, then the cation is mainly present in the aqueous phase. Conversely, if the R groups are large and hydrophobic, then the cation favours the organic phase.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Phase transfer catalysis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">So far, we have pretended that the quaternary ammonium species can exist on its own, and we have tried to look at its properties in isolation from any counter-ion. But whether as a solid or in solution, ammonium ions must be associated with an equivalent number of counter-ions. The <b>solubility</b> properties of the ammonium part can be used to control the solubility of the counter-ion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This trick is most widely used when inorganic nucleophiles are being used with organic substrates in an organic solvent. If a quaternary ammonium compound is added, some of the cation will enter the organic phase (see previous section). The cation has to carry a counter-ion with it in order to maintain electrical neutrality. The positive and negative ions needn&#x2019;t travel around as tightly bound salt pairs. In fact, bulky groups on the ammonium ion can shield it from any associated anion and make the anion more nucleophilic. For example, the rate of displacement of a halogen (X) with CN<sup>&#x2212;</sup> can be greatly enhanced by the addition of a small amount of phase transfer catalyst.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.2&#160;&#160;Synthesis of quaternary ammonium ions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Starting from a tertiary amine the key step is usually an S<sub>N<sup>2</sup></sub> reaction.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;">
 <img src="../images/page17-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">If all four alkyl groups on the ammonium ion are the same, then the synthesis is particularly simple&#x2014;just add excess alkylating agent to ammonia (and a base like NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to mop up the protons); successive S<sub>N<sup>2</sup></sub> reactions should ultimately yield the desired product.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page17-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">On the other hand, when there is a mixture of R groups, the synthesis of a suitable tertiary amine (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>N) for the final alkylation can be a major problem&#x2014;methods for the synthesis of amines are discussed in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>. If one or more of the R groups are aryl, they cannot usually be introduced at the final step (only strongly electron-deficient aryl halides are susceptible to nucleophile attack)&#x2014;so aryl groups would normally be introduced earlier in the synthesis.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.3">
<h2 class="h2"><b>2.3&#160;&#160;Reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Considering that they are charged, quaternary ammonium ions are perhaps surprisingly stable; but remember that the C&#x2013;N bond is strong, and there is no nitrogen lone pair available at which reactions can easily occur. In fact, the only two important reactions are elimination and reduction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Elimination</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Quaternary ammonium compounds will usually undergo elimination reactions when treated with strong base.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
 <img src="../images/page17-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Ammonium ions lacking a (&#x03B2;-hydrogen atom <img src="../images/page17-4.jpg" alt="images"/> cannot undergo this elimination, and are generally stable to base&#x2014;they are useful phase transfer catalysts if harsh reaction conditions are required.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Because the C&#x2013;N bond is strong, elimination reactions of quaternary ammonium ions virtually never follow the El pathway (i.e. unimolecular loss of a leaving group, in this case a tertiary amine, as the first step of the reaction). In almost all cases, E2 kinetics are followed, in which the base and substrate are both involved in the rate-determining step.</p>

An alkoxide (e.g. sodium methoxide in methanol) or strong heating in aqueous sodium hydroxide is usually effective. Heating with moist silver oxide also works well, as will be discussed below.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The most important feature of these elimination reactions is the direction of elimination when there is a choice.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">Hoffmann&#x2019;s observations are in stark contrast to most other E2 eliminations (e.g. from alkyl halides, perhaps the commonest examples). Because the double bond forms <b>during</b> an E2 reaction, we might expect the more stable alkene to be formed preferentially&#x2014;and this is the case for alkyl halides&#x2026;hence Saytzeff&#x2019;s rule that eliminations generate the most substituted alkene. But two factors drive the Hoffmann elimination of quaternary ammonium ions towards less substituted alkenes:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">However, some compounds that undergo Hoffmann elimination cannot attain an <i>anti</i> conformation. Obviously something interesting is happening! A neat experiment to investigate this is:</p>

 <img src="../images/page19-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indentbullett">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;The reaction has &#x2018;a hint of&#x2019; El<sub>cb</sub> about it. As the C&#x2013;N bond is strong, and the nitrogen has a powerful -I effect, the C&#x2013;H bond <b>starts</b> to break first. The most acidic proton has the <b>least</b> +I alkyl groups attached, and loss of this proton therefore generates a less substituted alkene.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#x2022;&#160;&#160;The transition state is very crowded&#x2014;but less so if the base attacks the proton attached to the least substituted carbon.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">So, E2 elimination can also take place if the angle between the leaving group and the proton is 0<sup>.</sup>. This (rare) elimination is therefore <i>syn</i>-periplanar.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Even with a small base, the bulky ammonium ion must be in a high energy conformation if elimination is to take place (<i>anti</i>/-periplanar). Even the smallest quaternary ammonium group (i.e. &#x2212;NMe<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) is roughly the size of a tertiary butyl group (i.e. &#x2212;CMe<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p class="boxtitlec"><b>E2 Elimination with large base</b></p>

</div>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">Hoffmann was a brilliant chemist, who utilized his elimination reaction to great effect for the structural analysis of naturally occurring alkaloids, long before spectroscopic methods were to dominate such work. He would fully methylate any nitrogens to the quaternary ammonium ions with methyl iodide (Hoffmann exhaustive methylation), then trigger elimination by heating with moist silver oxide (Ag<sub>2</sub>O). The silver reacted with the iodide counter-ion, generating the hydroxide salt (with the OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> acting as the base) which, on heating, would undergo elimination. This elimination sequence would be repeated until no nitrogen was left, and the resulting (poly)alkene could then be analysed further.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Reduction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Reduction of quaternary ammonium compounds can be achieved with powerful reducing agents such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> or Na/NH<sub>3</sub>(liq). However, yields are only modest and mixed products are formed unless all four substituents on nitrogen are the same.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">More selective is the Emde reaction, using sodium amalgam (Na&#x2013;Hg) in water. Only unsaturated groups are cleaved, and this can allow selective reduction of aryl&#x2013;N bonds as demonstrated in the following example.</p>
