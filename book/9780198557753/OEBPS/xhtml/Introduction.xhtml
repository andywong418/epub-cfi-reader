Despite the lack of reactivity of the element itself, nature has found several ways of incorporating nitrogen into the molecules of life. This is fortunate indeed, for it is impossible to imagine the evolution of life in which organonitrogen chemistry does not play a crucial role.</p><p class="indent3-ka1">But what is so special about the presence of nitrogen in organic compounds? The answer lies in a combination of factors.</p><aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar"><p class="noindent2"><b>Trivalent</b> nitrogen functional groups are neutral on nitrogen.</p><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Tetravalent</b> nitrogen must share its lone pair of electrons, and thus carries a positive charge.</p><p class="noindent2">e.g.</p><figure style="margin-left:1em;"> <img src="../images/page1-1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside><table class="width50"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;" class="width25"><p class="tabled">&#160;</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;" class="width25"><p class="tabled"><b>C</b></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;" class="width25"><p class="tabled"><b>N</b></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;" class="width25"><p class="tabled"><b>O</b></p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">Number of bonds (when neutral)</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">4</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">3</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">2</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">Number of lone pairs</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">0</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">1</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><p class="tabled">2</p></td></tr></table><p class="indent3-ka1t">Firstly, neutral nitrogen is trivalent, and this opens up a whole range of functional groups and structural variants that are inaccessible to its divalent neighbour oxygen. Secondly, trivalent nitrogen possesses a lone pair of electrons; this not only influences its chemistry, but also allows nitrogen to utilize these unpaired electrons in additional functional groups (e.g. ammonium ions and nitro groups).</p><p class="indent3-ka1">So let&#x2019;s have a quick look at some common organonitrogen functional groups.</p><figure style="margin-left:-7em;"> <img src="../images/page1-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-21em;" epub:type="sidebar"><p class="noindent2"><b>Amides</b> contain the functional group:</p><figure style="margin-left:1em;"> <img src="../images/page1-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><p class="noindent2"><b>&#x2018;Metal amides&#x2018;</b>, on the other hand, are the salts of amines: e.g. sodamide (NaNH<sub>2</sub>,) lithium diisopropylamide (LiNPr<sup><i>i</i></sup><sub>2</sub>).</p><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.5em;">There are three acceptable representations of the <b>nitro</b> group:</p></aside><p class="indent3-ka1">The examples listed above have been divided into three groups, whose chemistry will be covered in more detail in Parts A, B, and C of this book.</p><aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar"><figure style="margin-left:1em;"> <img src="../images/page1-4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><p class="noindent2">We will use the first valence bond representation for this and related functional groups, as this simplifies mechanistic arrow pushing.</p></aside><p class="indent3-ka1">In Part A, we will look at simple saturated amines. These can be protonated or alkylated to give ammonium cations, or deprotonated to generate anions. Although this chemistry is relatively straightforward, the<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Introduction</a> properties and synthesis of simple amines cover important aspects of organonitrogen chemistry that relate to many other functional groups.</p><p class="indent3-ka1">Much more varied chemistry becomes available when unsaturation is present, and these compounds are covered in Part B. Imines, enamines, amides, and nitriles are representative of the wide range of structural units in which the nitrogen forms part of a &#x03C0;-conjugated system.</p><p class="indent3-ka1">A further range of functional groups is accessible when N-N and N-O bonding occurs. These groups can be either saturated (e.g. <i>N</i>-oxides) or unsaturated (e.g. nitro compounds), and a bewildering array of combinations is known. A selection of these functional groups is discussed in Part C.</p><aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar"><figure style="margin-left:1em;"> <img src="../images/page2-1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside><p class="indent3-ka1">As if that were not enough, there is a range of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds that adds further interest. Those that are aromatic (e.g. pyridine, imidazole) are covered in another OUP primer (<i>Aromatic Heterocyclic Chemistry</i>, by D. T. Davies) but non-aromatic ones like morpholine and pyrrolidine behave pretty well like their acyclic counterparts, and such cyclic compounds will be discussed in this book.</p><p class="indent3-ka1">But before we start to look at the chemistry of organonitrogen compounds in earnest, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves of the importance of these compounds both in nature and in the industrialized world.</p><p class="indent3-ka1">At the core of all life, controlling the very form and function of all organisms, is the genetic code. This is composed of a (nitrogen-free) polymer backbone of ribose sugars linked by phosphate groups. The code itself is contained within the sequence of nitrogen-rich bases (B<sup>n</sup>); their hydrogenbonding potential holds the DNA double helix together, and is also utilized when the code (in triplets of bases) is transformed into a chain of amino acids.</p><figure style="margin-left:-2em;"> <img src="../images/page2-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><a id="page_3" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 3, Introduction</a><p class="indent3-ka1">The DNA-controlled condensation of amino acids generates peptides and proteins that carry out most of the functions of life. Peptides (&lt; 50 amino acids) are primarily chemical messengers, whilst proteins (&gt; 50 amino acids) provide much of the structure of skin and bone, help in the functioning of cells, and act as receptors, enzymes, and transporters.</p><figure style="margin-left:-9em;"> <img src="../images/page3-1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><p class="indent3-ka1">Many plants contain alkaloids which are simply nitrogen-containing natural products whose toxicity was harnessed in classical herbal medicines, and whose biological properties have prompted their use as &#x2018;lead structures&#x2019; in modern drug design.</p><figure style="margin-left:-9em;"> <img src="../images/page3-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><p class="indent3-ka1">Organonitrogen compounds also feature strongly in man-made materials, such as the synthetic fibres and dyes that led to the development of the modern chemical industry.</p><figure style="margin-left:-9em;"> <img src="../images/page3-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure><p class="indent3-ka1">So organonitrogen chemistry really is central to modern life, relating to natural products like DNA, peptides, proteins, alkaloids&#x2026;and to man-made pharmaceuticals, fibres, and dyes. Nitrogen is probably the most important element in organic chemistry&#x2014;with the possible exception of carbon!</p></section></body></html>
