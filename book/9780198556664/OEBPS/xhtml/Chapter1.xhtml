<p class="indent">The reagent is produced as a complex with lithium bromide in ether Solution. Fortunately, butyllithium solution is available commercially and so it is not normally prepared. Indeed the availability of easily handled butyllithium solutions is one of the most important events in modern organic synthesis. The actual structure of butyllithium is more complicated than the Bu<sup>&#8722;</sup> reagent we normally think of. Extensive studies based on X-ray crystal structures and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments indicate that what is actually present in a solution of methyl- or butyllithium is not simply the monomeric species. Metallated alkanes exist as clearly defined aggregates in which the metal atoms make up a regular framework with each carbanionic carbon atom acting as a bridge between the lithium atoms.</p>

<p class="indent">In THF solution butyllithium is in equilibrium between a tetramer and a dimer, the position of this equilibrium is affected by the solvent<a id="page_3" class="page">3, Metallated saturated hydrocarbons</a> and the temperature. The lithium atoms in the tetramer make up a regular tetrahedron with the carbon atom at the end of the butyl chain symmetrically bridging the lithium atoms. This structure is shown clearly in <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> above: it may seem unusual compared to the usual abbreviated structures (e.g. Bu<sup>&#8722;</sup>), however it gives a much more accurate representation of the structure of polar organometallic compounds. Tetrameric structures have been observed in X-ray crystal analyses of MeLi and EtLi, while similar aggregated structures are now the norm for all metalled organic compounds. These aggregates have a profound effect on the reactivity of alkyllithium reagents and other polar organometallic compounds. In general the monomers and lower aggregates are more reactive than the higher aggregates. Solvents which co-ordinate to the metal lead to a marked increase in the reactivity of these reagents which is usually explained by deaggregation of the aggregated structures into monomeric species, examples of these solvents are given in <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Potassium tertiary butoxide has been shown to be an especially effective activator of butyllithium so that mixtures of these two reagents provide a stronger base than butyllithium alone. The explanation normally given for this effect is co-ordination of the oxygen atom to the lithium, causing deaggregation and formation of a more reactive monomeric species.</p>

<p class="indent">The main use of butyllithium is as a strong base for the deprotonation of other organic functional groups. The state of oligomerization of the butyllithium affects its efficiency as a base and this can be changed by the solvent in which the reaction is carried out. Commercial butyllithium<a id="page_4" class="page">4, Metallated saturated hydrocarbons</a> solution is normally supplied in the non-polar solvent, hexane. One way of producing a monomeric species is to carry out the reaction with co-solvents such as tetramethylethylenediamine or hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), these solvents co-ordinate to the lithium leaving a monomeric carbanion available for reactions. Another trick is to evaporate the hexane from the butyllithium and add a polar solvent such as ether with or without a co-solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">If a stronger base is required than butyllithium itself, the reagent may be complexed with sodium or potassium tertiary butoxide. Alternatively, secondary or tertiary butyllithium may be used, which are both commercially available.</p>
<p class="indent">To state the obvious, butyllithium will deprotonate protons that are more acidic than those of butane (<a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The deprotonation of the NH in diisopropylamine to give lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is one of the most useful reactions of butyllithium. BuLi is a highly basic non-hindered reagent which often leads to nucleophilic attack at carbon instead of deprotonation. LDA solves this problem as it is a hindered non-nucleophilic base with which deprotonation can be achieved without interference by nucleophilic attack. Other non-nucleophilic bases are lithium hexamethyldisilazane (sodium and potassium salts are also used) and lithium tetramethyl- piperidine (LTMP) (<a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">The reaction of an alkyl halide with magnesium to form a Grignard reagent, e.g. RMgBr is a fundamental organic reaction (<a href="#eqn1.3">Equation 1.3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Almost all simple alkyl halides undergo this reaction to give the Grignard reagents which are stable at refluxing ether temperatures, but they do react with oxygen or moisture. Grignard reagents can react as bases or nucleophiles, however in general they are less basic than the corresponding organolithium reagent. An important factor which governs the reactivity of Grignard reagents is their equilibrium with dialkylmagnesium and magnesium dibromide known as the Schlenk Equilibrium (<a href="#eqn1.4">Equation 1.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The presence of the Lewis acid MgBr<sub>2</sub> in solutions of Grignard reagents has a profound effect on their reactivity. In many reactions it is the co-ordination of MgBr<sub>2</sub> to the electrophile, such as an epoxide or carbonyl group, which makes the relatively poor nucleophilic Grignard reagent undergo addition and substitution reactions in high yield. The presence of MgBr<sub>2</sub> is also thought to catalyse the formation of Grignard reagents from alkyl halides and magnesium.</p>

<p class="noindent">Metallated alkanes are both good nucleophiles and strong bases; in this section we will consider the addition reactions of these reagents to carbonyl compounds and similar groups. <a href="#sch1.1">Scheme 1.1</a> shows the reactions of ethylmagnesium bromide with a wide range of carbonyl and imine compounds where nucleophilic addition occurs, followed, on work up, by protonation. Grignard reagents are good nucleophiles and they are less basic than the corresponding lithium compounds; they react well in these addition reactions. Deprotonation a to the carbonyl group is a significant side reaction if many of the conversions indicated in <a href="#sch1.1">Scheme 1.1</a> are attempted with the more basic organolithium reagents, this is especially true in hindered cases. However, many of the transformations shown in <a href="#sch1.1">Scheme 1.1</a> are successful with lithiated alkanes. In order to enable the student to be aware of the possible side reactions involved in these conversions we will treat each one in turn for both alkyllithium reagents and Grignards and also include some related reactions of special importance such as the preparation of ketones from alkyllithium reagents and carboxylic acids.</p>

If the Grignard reagent has a &#946;-hydrogen atom, e.g. <i>t</i>-BuMgCl or cyclohexyl magnesium bromide, then with some hindered ketones, reduction of the carbonyl group via hydride transfer is observed. The co-ordination of the metal to a lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen is believed to be a prelude to both reactions (<a href="#eqn1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>).</p>

The two transition states have different energies because of the greater steric interaction between two phenyl and two isopropyl groups (in the minor pathway), than that between the two sets of phenyl and isopropyl groups (in the major pathway). This difference in energy is sufficient to produce a product ratio of 91 :9 (<a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The two faces of a carbonyl compound with an &#945;-chiral centre are diastereotopic and hence nucleophilic addition to such compounds can lead to two diastereoisomeric products. Cram&#8217;s rule is a way of predicting which of the two diastereotopic faces is preferentially attacked by nucleophiles and hence which diastereoisomer of the product predominates. Although there is free rotation about the single bond between the carbonyl and the &#945;-carbon atoms, when applying Cram&#8217;s rule we say that certain conformations will be more reactive and these will be used to predict the major product. When the &#945;-carbon has three groups which may be classified as small (S), medium (M), and large (L), then the most reactive conformation in a more recent investigation of this topic by Felkin and Ahn is where the groups are staggered so that the carbonyl oxygen is between the large and medium groups. Nucleophilic attack occurs <i>anti</i> to the large group to give the major product diastereoisomer. The other face of the carbonyl is attacked in a more hindered, staggered conformation in which the carbonyl oxygen lies between a large and a small group, leading to the minor diastereoisomer (<a href="#fig1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">This sequence illustrates a fundamental yet simple truth about chemical reactions; for a reaction to be successful the product must be less reactive with the reagent than the starting material. If one equivalent of Grignard is added to an ester, the tetrahedral intermediate formed may lose ethoxide to give the ketone, which is more reactive towards the Grignard than the ester, and so the reaction proceeds to the tertiary alcohol directly as the ketone is being formed. If the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate can be prevented by carrying out the reaction at low temperature (&#8722;78&#176;C) or adding the reagent to a large excess of ester then the ketone may be isolated.

<p class="noindent">Sodium, potassium, lithium, and magnesium alkanes are generally regarded as Compounds in which the negative Charge is localized on the metallated carbon. Such nucleophiles are known as &#8216;hard&#8217; nucleophiles, and they add to &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated carbonyl Compounds at the carbonyl carbon to give 1,2 addition (<a href="#eqn1.29">Equation 1.29</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">The terms &#8216;Hard and Soft&#8217; acids and bases are used extensively in organic chemistry. A hard nucleophile is one in which the negative charge is completely localized on one small atom e.g. MeLi. A soft nucleophile is one in which the negative Charge is delocalized e.g. Na+ <sup>&#8722;</sup>CH(CO<sub>2</sub>Et)<sub>2</sub>.&#945;, &#946;-Unsaturated ketones have a hard electophilic centre at the carbonyl carbon and a soft electrophilic centre at the &#946;-carbon</p>

<p class="indent">Organocopper reagents are known as &#8216;soft&#8217; reagents, as the large transition metal atom is more polarizable with its d orbitals available for bonding and the negative Charge is not as localized as in the case of hard <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Metallated saturated hydrocarbons</a>nucleophiles. Soft nucleophiles such as copper catalysed Grignard reagents or dialkyl cuprates attack &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated carbonyl Compounds at the &#946;-carbon to produce an enolate. This type of reaction is called 1,4-addition or Michael addition, the intermediate enolate may be alkylated or simply protonated at the end of the reaction (<a href="#fig1.40">Fig. 1.40</a>).</p>
