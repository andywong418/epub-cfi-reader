<p class="noindent2" style="width:140%;">In naphthalene there is a steric interaction between substituents on the 1 and 8 positions which is called a &#8216;peri&#8217; interaction. One reason why 2-metallated naphthalene is more stable than the 1 -isomer is that there are no peri interactions at the 2-position.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The pK<sub>a</sub> of benzene is 43 and that of butane is estimated to be about 50, therefore, it should be possible thermodynamically to deprotonate benzene with butyllithium. However, this is not an effective synthesis of phenyl- or naphthyllithium because both reactions are kinetically very slow. These two hydrocarbons are kinetically deprotonated with BuLi.<i>t</i>-BuOK, to produce phenyl and &#946;-naphthylpotassium (<a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of naphthalene, a mixture of isomers is obtained in which the 2-substituted product predominates. The generation of metallated aromatic compounds from aromatic halides is a far more efficient route to these reagents. Phenyl Grignard and phenyllithium are easily prepared from bromobenzene and the metal in ether (<a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>).</p>

Examples of these conversions will not be repeated here, but two topics which are of unique importance to aromatic compounds will be covered fully with illustrations of the reactions of the metallated species.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Directed metallation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Substituents exert a profound effect on the reaction of a benzene ring with butyllithium in both deprotonation and lithium-halogen exchange reactions. Heteroatoms on substituents co-ordinate to the butyllithium and direct lithiation to the position <i>ortho</i> to the substituent. The so-called process of <i>ortho</i> lithiation or directed metallation is one of the most useful procedures in aromatic chemistry. The effect is a strong one and enables us to lithiate <i>ortho</i> to a single substituent on a benzene ring (<a href="#eqn4.2">Equation 4.2</a>).</p>
<figure id="eqn4.2" style="width:70%;text-align:right;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556664_0248.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Although the exact mechanism of this reaction is not known, it is usually thought of as an initial co-ordination of the lithium with the lone pair on the substituent which anchors the base and simply removes the nearest proton, which happens to be <i>ortho</i>, to the substituent (<a href="#eqn4.3">Equation 4.3</a>).</p>
<figure id="eqn4.3" style="width:70%;text-align:right;">

<p class="indent">Substituents which have a strong electron withdrawing inductive effect, e.g. F, and CF<sub>3</sub> also show <i>ortho</i> lithiation. On the basis of extensive studies in this area, substituents may be divided into three groups.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Group 1. Strong activation of <i>ortho</i> lithiation: &#8211;CN, &#8211;SO<sub>2</sub>NR<sub>2</sub>, OCONR<sub>2</sub>, &#8211;CONR<sub>2</sub>, 2-oxazoline (<a href="#eqn4.4">equation 4.4</a>).</p>
<figure id="eqn4.4" style="width:70%;text-align:right;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556664_0250.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">These groups have an electron withdrawing effect on the benzene ring as well as lone pairs available for co-ordination to the butyllithium.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Group 2. Moderate activation of <i>ortho</i>-lithiation: &#8211;CH<sub>2</sub>NR<sub>2</sub>, &#8211;F, &#8211;CF<sub>3</sub>, &#8211;OMe, &#8211;OCH<sub>2</sub>OMe, &#8211;SR. The electron withdrawing and/or co-ordinating ability of these substituents is less than those in Group 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Group 3. Weak activation of <i>ortho</i>-lithiation &#8211;CH<sub>2</sub>OLi, &#8211;CH(OLi)NR<sub>2</sub>, NR<sub>2</sub>. These substituents co-ordinate to the base but have an electron donating effect on the benzene ring, their effect is therefore weaker than the members of Groups 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="indent">The vast synthetic utility of these simple generalizations will now be shown by examples of the 3 groups of reactions mentioned above. The nitrile group is a strong activator of <i>ortho</i> lithiation, however the electrophilic nature of the nitrile often causes side reactions before combination with an external electrophile is possible. There are exceptions to this and one is <i>m</i>-chlorobenzonitrile which is lithiated with lithium tetramethylpiperidine and reacts with dimethyldisulphide at low temperature (<a href="#eqn4.5">Equation 4.5</a>).</p>
<figure id="eqn4.5" style="width:70%;text-align:right;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556664_0251.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The balance between a substituent being sufficiently electron withdrawing and co-ordinating to produce good directed lithiation yet not being reactive itself, so that the anion is stable, is the key to this whole area of aromatic lithiations. Secondary and tertiary sulphonamide groups are the strongest <i>ortho</i>-directing groups for lithiation. The reason for this is the highly electron withdrawing nature of the sulphonamide group, along with its co-ordinating ability in the lithiated species and the stability of the group to nucleophilic attack (<a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">One equivalent of butyllithium and no special conditions are necessary to lithiate tertiary aromatic sulphonamides. Two equivalents<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Metallated aromatic compounds</a> of butyllithium, one to deprotonate the NH and a second to deprotonate the aromatic ring, are required by secondary sulphonamides (<a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">Chelation via nitrogen and oxygen is possible in this example and with other group 1 activating substituents. The real situation is best described by a polymerie structure where the lithium is co-ordinated to both oxygen and nitrogen. In this discussion monomeric struetures with co-ordination at oxygen will be used in the case of lithiated tertiary amides and sulphonamides.</p>

<p class="indent">As is the case with all dianions, the site of the least acidic proton gives the more nucleophilic anion and electrophiles therefore react on the aromatic ring first. In many cases the product of reaction with the electrophile undergoes cyclization under acidic conditions (<a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Direct intramolecular cyclization is also possible when the sulphonamide contains an appropriate electrophilic carbon (<a href="#eqn4.6">Equation 4.6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">However, cases are known where the tertiary amide suffers nucleophilic attack by the strong base required for deprotonation. This is not the case for secondary amides where two equivalents of base are required, the first to deprotonate the amide NH and the second to remove an <i>ortho</i> aromatic proton. The deprotonated secondary amide group is inert towards nucleophilic attack by organolithium reagents, so<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Metallated aromatic compounds</a> in general, secondary aromatic amides are more useful than tertiary aromatic amides.

<p class="indent">The substituents in Group 2 and 3 have a lower directing effect than those in Group 1 as shown by the fact that lithiation <i>ortho</i> to a Group 1<a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Metallated aromatic compounds</a> substituent occurs in the presence of a Group 2 and 3 substituent. Group 2 and 3 substituents fall into two classes, those that have a direct electron withdrawing effect on the ring and show co-ordination with the aryllithium once formed, and those that are separated from the aromatic ring by one or more CH<sub>2</sub> groups and can only exert a stabilizing effect by co-ordination.</p>
<p class="indent">The electron withdrawing effect of the halogens makes them show <i>ortho</i>-directing effects, however the competing reactions of lithium halogen exchange and a tendency for the <i>ortho</i>-lithiated aromatic to undergo elimination to produce benzyne, limits their utility. Fluoro-benzene is readily lithiated and <i>o</i>-fluorolithiobenzene does not undergo elimination at low temperature so that the addition of an electrophile is possible (<a href="#eqn4.8">Equation 4.8</a>).</p>
