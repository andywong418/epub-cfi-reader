<h1 class="fmmain">Preface</h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">This book is concerned with polar organometallic reagents and their use in organic synthesis. It will be useful in undergraduate chemistry courses and also to the practising chemist looking for a concise overview of this area. My aim is to provide sufficient information for the student to be able to propose polar organometallic reagents to solve synthetic problems, and also to avoid the pitfalls involved in their use.</p>
<p class="fmindent">I am indebted to the following people for helpful comments and criticism of the text: Nicholas Lawrence, Susan Booth, Robert Atkinson, David Dawkins, Jonathan Clark, Laurence Harwood, and Stephen Davies.</p>
<p class="fmindent">I would also like to thank my wife Rhiannon for her constant encouragement, the musical communities of Leicester and Grittleton for their enthusiastic support of all new projects, Sylvia Brivati for help with the typing, Ann Crane for advice, and Pat Raiment for his interest and sustenance.</p>
