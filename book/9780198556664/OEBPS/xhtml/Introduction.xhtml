<p class="noindent">The use of reagents of the general structure RM where R is an organic fragment and M is a metal have had a profound effect on organic synthesis. The electropositive metal and the electronegative carbon means that the carbon-metal bond is polarized <sup>&#948;&#8722;</sup>R&#8211;M<sup>&#948;+</sup>. Indeed the chemistry of the organometallic reagents of sodium, potassium, lithium, and magnesium has been approximately explained by regarding the reagents as equivalent to a carbanion R<sup>&#8722;</sup> with a metal cation M<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">If we follow this idea for a moment we would use our carbanion R<sup>&#8722;</sup> to react with various organic electrophiles to make carbon-carbon bonds (<a href="#eqn0.1">Equation 0.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">This example shows one of the most important uses of these reagents. Initially an alkoxide salt is produced which is protonated when the reaction mixture is poured into water during the work-up procedure. If we consider the electrophile benzaldehyde we can see that there are no hydrogens &#945; to the carbonyl group which can be deprotonated. However, in acetaldehyde this is not the case (<a href="#fig0.1">Fig. 0.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">Protons a to a carbonyl group need to adopt a conformation where the C&#8211;H bond is orthogonal to the C&#8211;C=O plane before removal by base to generate the enolate in which the three p Orbitals overlap.</p>

<p class="noindent">hydrogen to act as a base producing an enolate (<a href="#eqn0.2">Equation 0.2</a>), or attacking the carbonyl carbon to act as a nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">It is this dual reactivity of the organometallic reagent which determines the scope and limitations of its use in synthesis. This book will cover the various structural types in turn, looking at methods of preparation and uses in synthesis. Coverage of structural studies and practical procedures will be kept to a minimum.</p>
