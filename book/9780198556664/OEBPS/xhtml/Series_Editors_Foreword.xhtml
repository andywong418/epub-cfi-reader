<p class="fmnoindent">Reactions involving nucleophilic carbon derived from organometallic reagents are amongst the most versatile methods for carbon-carbon bond formation: these reagents are crucial to many synthetic strategies for simple as well as complex targets. The understanding of polar organometallic reagents and their reactions is therefore essential for all students of chemistry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be covered in an 8&#8211;10 lecture course. In this third primer of the series, Paul Jenkins provides, in an easy-to-read style, an excellent introduction to the complex topic of organometallic reagents. With this foundation students will be much better equipped to tackle synthetic problems. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
