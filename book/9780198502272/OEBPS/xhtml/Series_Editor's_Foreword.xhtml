<p class="fm-no">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fm-in">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, and its companion volume, Nick Green presents a clearly written and elegant account of the foundations and applications of Quantum Mechanics. He develops and builds on ideas that undergraduate chemists will have encountered via introductory courses to give insight and understanding of the behaviour of the microscopic world at the atomic and molecular level. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
