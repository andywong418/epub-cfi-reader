<p class="banoindent">When a crystal surface is exposed to a supersaturated environment, the flux of growth units (atoms, ions, molecules) to the surface exceeds the equilibrium flux so that the number of growth units joining the surface is greater than that leaving. This results in growth of the surface. The ability of a surface to capture arriving growth units and integrate them into the crystal lattice is, among other things, dependent upon the strength and number of interactions that can form between the surface and the growth unit.</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">The nature of a growth unit remains the subject of some debate: in some cases it wili be a single molecule, in others some pre-association may have occurred in solution and the growth unit may be a dimer or an even larger aggregate.</p>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">The importance of solid state structural effects is illustrated for a simple two-dimensional crystal in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. In the interior of this crystal each molecule is bound to four of its nearest neighbours as indicated by the solid lines. Two surfaces bound this crystal, one having two intermolecular interactions available at the surface (1) and one with only a single interaction (2). When molecules join surface 1 the system gains twice as much energy as when they join 2. For this reason surface 1 will grow faster than surface 2.</p>

Surface 1grows faster than surface 2. As a result surface 1gets smaller and surface 2 is enlarged. This leads to the general conclusion that the importance of a face in the overall crystal morphology varies as the inverse of its growth rate-a crystal is eventually bounded by the slow- growing faces.</p>

<p class="baindent">In three dimensions (<a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) it is clear that a growth unit may form a maximum of three bonds with a crystal surface. Using the classification first introduced by Hartman and Perdock the following definitions are made: a surface with which three bonds are possible is a <i>kinked</i> or K face, a surface with which two bonds are possible is a <i>stepped</i> or S face, and a face with which just one surface bond is possible is a&#x0024;at or F face. If we assume that the linear growth rate, <i>u,</i> of a face is proportional to the total binding energy of a growth unit to that surface, it would be expected that</p>


<p class="center"><i>u<sub>K</sub></i> &#x02C3; <i>u<sub>S</sub></i> &#x02C3; <i>u<sub>F</sub>.</i></p>


<p class="banoindent">Thus, as indicated by the dotted outline in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a> the final shape (also termed the morphology, form or habit) of a crystal, a subject discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, will be defined by the slowest growing F faces.</p>
<p class="baindent">Crystal growth theory, therefore, is concerned with the mechanisms by which F faces grow. We also need to recognize that F faces are characterized not only by the fact that they offer a single binding interaction to incoming growth units but also by the way in which other structural bonds lie parallel to the plane of the face. Given that the strength of even the strongest intermolecular interaction (a hydrogen bond) is only about 20 kJ/mol, compared to perhaps 200 kJ/mol for the strength of a covalent bond, the direct addition of molecules to flat surfaces would never proceed quickly enough to explain why crystals grow at measurable rates.</p>
<p class="baindent">The growth of such faces can in fact only proceed at a reasonable rate if some means of creating growth sites with higher interaction energies can be envisaged. This might involve, for example, the creation of step and kink sites <a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, 4 Crystal growth</a> on an F face. Since the energetics of this process will depend not only on the solid state structure but also on the supersaturated fluid adjoining it, we need to have some description of solid-fluid interfaces.</p>

<p class="banoindent">The most useful model of the crystal-fluid interface is the so-called 'multilayer' model attributed to Temkin (1965). Solid and fluid are divided into blocks of equal size (in a melt each block could be identified with a molecule) and the interfacial region may consist of any number of layers. <a href="#fig4.3">Figure 4.3</a> shows a typical interface depicted in this way. The model can easily be used to deduce the energy change, <i>&#x25B3;E,</i> occurring when a perfectly flat surface is roughened by removing one block from the surface and using it to start a new layer. This is an important quantity for crystal growth since if this is an energetically favourable process it would be a means by which sites with higher interaction energies could be formed. To explore this concept further three energies are defined:</p>

As the<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, 4 Crystal growth</a> value increases growth becomes more difficult and special mechanisms have to be envisaged by which necessary growth sites can be created.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-28em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;width:100%;">The rate of growth of a crystal can be defined by the rate at which either its mass or one of its dimensions changes with time. In order to differentiate the behaviour of different faces of a crystal it is common to measure the linear rate of advance normal to the plane of a specific face. A typical value would be 0.5 mm/nr (= 1.4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-7</sup> <i>&#x00B5;</i>m/s), equivalent to about molecules per hour per mm2 of crystal surface.

<p class="baindent">In three dimensions, the block-structured interface appears as in <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a> with ledge sites (having an interaction energy of &#x00F8;<sub><i>ss</i></sub>), step sites (with interaction energy <i>2&#x00F8;<sub>ss</sub></i>) and kink sites (of interaction energy <i>3&#x00F8;<sub>ss</sub></i>)indicated. These kink site positions offer enhanced binding to a growth unit and hence are crucial to the growth process. In a real crystal such sites may be identified with specific intemolecular interactions. <a href="#fig4.5">Figure 4.5</a> is a two-dimensional projection of the crystal structure of the dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, C00H(CH2)6C00H.This is an important intermediate in the production of nylon and it is purified by crystallization.

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;width:110%;">If a crystal surface is considered to be created by cleaving through the crystal structure then it is apparent that any number of surfaces may be created, each exposing different parts of the constituent molecules to the growth environment. In order to relate a surface to the structure of the crystal a system of <i>Miller Indices</i> is used. These define the orientation of the surface in relation to the crystallographic unit cell. Each face is designated with three numbers, these being the inverse of the intersections of that face with the three crystallographic axes, a, b and c. Thus, a surface (110) is the surface that cuts the &#x03B1;- and b-axes one unit cell length from the origin but which is parallel to the c-axis. Different types of brackets have different meanings: (hkl&#x007D; refers to a set of symmetry- related faces all having the same surface structure; (hkl) refers to a specific single face; and &#x005B;hkl&#x005D; is a direction perpendicular to the (hkl) face.</p>

<p class="baindent">As a crystal surface grows, growth units are transferred from the fluid to the solid state. <a href="#fig4.6">Figure 4.6</a> illustrates schematically the free energy barriers to be overcome during the growth process. Thus the growth unit, initially solvated, loses some of its solvent molecules upon passage over the first barrier. &#x25B3;<i>G<sub>desolv</sub></i>. This partially desolvated growth unit then enters the adsorption layer (position 1) from where it may diffuse across the surface (&#x25B3;<i>G<sub>sdiff</sub></i>) to a step (position 2) and undergo further desolvation to enter a kink site at position 3 (&#x25B3;<i>G<sub>k</sub></i>).</p>

<p class="banoindent">If the value of &#x03b1; is less than about 3, the energy required to form a step is low and so the surface of the crystal will contain many kink and step sites.

</aside>

<p class="banoindent">As &#x03B1; increases (3&#x02C2; &#x03B1; &#x02C2; 5) the inherent roughness of the interface decreases and some of the growth units that arrive at the surface do not find a growth site. These either return to the fluid phase or join other adsorbed growth units to form surface islands or nuclei. As <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a> shows, the circumference of such islands becomes the source of new step and kink sites at which additional units can join the surface. In this way the islands spread laterally across the surface and growth occurs normal to the plane of the face.

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Spiral growth</span></h3>

<p class="banoindent">As &#x03B1; rises above 5, the enhanced intermolecular interactions in the plane of the interface result in a molecular surface that is flat. This is reflected in an increasing value of <i>&#x03B3;e</i> which begins to inhibit surface nucleation, particularly at low supersaturation. Growth can now only take place if a step can be created by some energetically 'cheap' process. Built-in lattice defects, in particular screw dislocations (see <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.8</a>, provide such a route.</p>

<p class="baindent">A dislocation is the result of the stresses that occur during crystal growth, particularly when growth takes place onto seed crystals, around heteronuclei and around liquid inclusions. Usually one part of the crystal lattice becomes misaligned with respect to the rest of the crystal.</p>


<p class="baindent">Screw dislocations emerge on the growing crystal faces and the points of emergence are characterized by steps at which growth can then take place. This possibility was first postulated by Frank (1949) and represented a major advance in understanding the mechanism of crystal growth. For crystal growth the important feature of the emergent step is that it extends over only a part of the surface and during growth winds up into a spiral to create a growth hillock (<a href="#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">F. C. Frank was a physicist working at Bristol University. He had played an important role as a scientific advisor to the government during World War It and his seminal work on crystal growth was supported in part by the chemical company ICI.</p>

<p class="baindent">The theoretical expression for the growth rate of a surface growing in this manner is again rather complex although simple in concept. It has the form</p>

<p class="banoindent">The step velocity is related to the flux of growth units that enter lank sites. Burton, Cabrera and Frank (BCF, 1951) postulated that this may be controlled either by diffusion from the bulk of the solution directly into kink sites, or by two-dimensional diffusion across the crystal surface. The step density is related to their spiral nature. As the supersaturation increases the spiral winds itself tighter, thereby increasing the step density.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The importance of mass transport</h2>

<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Before growth units can become incorporated into the crystal lattice by one of the mechanisms described above they must be transported from the bulk of the solution to the crystal-solution interface. The solute concentration at the interface, <i>c<sub>i</sub>,</i> is thus less than that in the bulk solution, <i>c</i><sub>&#x221E;</sub>, as a result of the diffusive or convective mass transfer resistance.</p>

<p class="baindent">Many sets of experimental data demonstrate the role of mass transfer in crystal growth from solution. <a href="#fig4.15">Figure 4.15</a> illustrates one example; increasing the solution velocity past the crystal results in an increase in the growth rate of the &#x007B; l l <b>l</b> j faces of a potash alum clystal because the mass transport resistance is reduced at the higher solution flow rate.</p>

<p class="baindent">Mass transport and surface integration take place consecutively (is. in series with one another) and therefore at steady state the solution concentration at the crystal surface adjusts to a value such that the rates of the two steps are equal. <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, 4 Crystal growth</a></p>

<p class="banoindent">This is the well-known expression for the addition of two resistances in series, the coefficients representing conductances and their reciprocals the resist- ances. The mass transfer and surface integration steps can thus be thought of as two processes taking place in series with <i>k<sub>G</sub></i> being the overall growth rate coefficient.</p>

<p class="baindent">The concept of effectiveness factor, well established in reaction engineering (e.g. Levenspiel, 1972). is useful in characterizing the relative importance of the diffusional and integration resistances (Garside, 1991).

<p class="baindent">If the integration step has a much higher rate constant than the mass transport step (i.e. if the Damkijhler number <i>Da</i> &#x226B; 1) the overall rate of growth is controlled by the mass transfer process. In this case, the driving force for the mass transfer step must be large to force the rate of the transport step to match that of integration. As a result the concentration of solute at the crystal surface, <i>c<sub>i</sub></i>, is close to the equilibrium value, <i>c<sub>eq</sub></i> as shown in <a href="#fig4.17">Fig. 4.17</a>. The driving force for the transport step is essentially equal to (<i>c<sub>&#x221E;</sub></i> -<i>c<sub>eq</sub></i>) while the driving force for the integration step is very small. If the rate constants for the two steps are comparable (i.e. <i>Da</i> &#x2248; 1) they both participate in determining the overall rate of growth while if <i>Da</i> &#x226A; I growth, is surface integration controlled</p>

<p class="baindent">Temperature usually has a profound effect on the crystal growth rate and effectiveness factors can be used to demonstrate this. The temperature dependence of both the diffusion and integration steps can be characterized by activation energies:</p>

<p class="banoindent">&#x25B3;<i>Ed</i> is typically in the range 8 to 20 kJ/mol while values of <i>AEr</i> are invariably higher, typically 40 to 80 kJ/mol. As a result the rate of the integration process increases much more rapidly with temperature than does the diffusion process and so crystal growth rates tend to be diffusion controlled at high temperature and integration controlled at low temperatures. Values of <i>qi</i> are thus close to unity at low temperatures but much lower values are obtained at high temperatures. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig4.18">Fig. 4.18</a>.</p>
