<p class="banoindent">We have seen in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">3</a> that some molecules exhibit polymorphism, that is they are able to adopt more than one crystal structure. When preparing materials by crystallization it is important to recognize and to be able to control this phenomenon because each polymorph has its own unique combination of mechanical, thermal and physical properties. The production of specific and well-defined polymorphs is therefore crucial in chemical manufacture.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">The three polymorphs of calcium carbonate are calcite, aragonite and vaterite. They differ in the arrangement of calcium and carbonate ions and their solubility products at 298 K are 3.31 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>, 4.61 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> and 1.22 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> mol<sup>2</sup> dm<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> respectively.</p>
</aside>
<p class="baindent">A definition of polymorphic forms was first made by Mitscherlich in 1821 in relation to arsenates, phosphates and sulphur. In 1832 W&#x00F6;hler and Liebig discovered the first example of polymorphism in an organic material, benzamide. In 1899, Ostwald concluded that almost every substance could exist in two or more solid phases provided the experimental conditions are suitable. The development of solid state chemistry during the twentieth century has confirmed and exemplified this statement. <a href="#tab_6.1">Table 6.1</a> gives some common examples.</p>
<p class="baindent">In the chemical and pharmaceutical industry he demand for high yields and high production rates has forced chemists and engineers to operate processes far from equilibrium, so exacerbating the tendency to form polymorphic structures that, for a given temperature, pressure and composi- tion, are not the most stable. Such unstable structures will eventually undergo phase transitions to more stable phases. This transformation process and its structural and thermodynamic basis are the subjects of this chapter. Although we only deal specifically with polymorphs it is worth pointing out that materials may also adopt other different solid forrns such as:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">The famous American chemical analyst Walter C. McCrone, who was one of the few scientists entrusted to examine the Turin Shroud, commented in 1963 that virtually all compounds are poiymorphic; the number of polymorphs of a material is in direct proportion to the time and money spent looking for them.</p>
</aside>
<h4><i>Solvates</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">In this case both solute and solvent molecule are part of the crystal structure that make up the solid phase. This results in a crystal of defined composition in which the solvent molecules adopt well-defined lattice positions.</p>
<h4><i>Compounds</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">In multicomponent systems, particularly aqueous solutions of ionic materials, the composition of the solid phase that is crystallized can depend on composition. In the system MgCl<sub>2</sub>-KCl-H<sub>2</sub>O, crystals of a compound salt KCl.MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O can precipitate, while in the NaCl-urea-H<sub>2</sub>O system the compound NaCl.Urea.H<sub>2</sub>O can form.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">Gypsum, the major component of wall plaster, is a calcium sulphate dihydrate; citric acid, the lemon flavouring used in foods, can crystallize as a monohydrate.</p>
</aside>
<h4><i>Amorphous solids</i></h4>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">The term amorphous is ssually used in relation to an X-ray diffractogram that shows no diffraction peaks and hence no structural periodicity or long-range order.</p>
</aside>
<p class="banoindent">These are formed in both ionic and molecular systems and are solid phases in which there is no long-range order. Common window glass is perhaps the best<a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, 6 Polymorphism</a> known example, being a mixture of metal oxides, but amorphous forms of calcium phosphate and aluminium phosphate and sulphates are also known. Amorphous ice results when water is frozen very rapidly, while sugars are known to form glassy solids.</p>

<h4><i>Mesophases</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">Occasionally, when materials precipitate at very high supersaturations or when they comprise molecules that exhibit amphiphilic behaviour, they appear not as solids but as liquid-like droplets. Such droplets may be undercooled isotropic liquid or they may be liquid crystalline in nature. In the latter case the molecules will be ordered in one or two dimensions and the drops will be birefringent when observed in the polarizing microscope.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">Amphiphilic molecules have well- defined Polar and non-polar domains. Surfactants are good the major component of washing-up liquids forms a crystailine lamella phase as well as a crystalline phase.</p>

<p class="banoindent">Two polymorphic modifications of a given material constitute two There is no universal convention for homogeneous phases. As we saw in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, if they are in equilibrium with each other they must conform to the Gibbs phase rule:</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">There is no universal convention for naming polymorphs; sometimes Greek letters <i>&#x03B1;</i>, <i>&#x03B2;</i>, <i>&#x03B3;</i> are used, sometimes the Roman numerals I, II, III, etc. It is important to note that the latter do not imply anything about the relative stability of the various forms, rather they usually follow the order of discovery.</p>

In addition, since F cannot be negative, no more than three polymorphs can be in equilibrium with each other.</p>
<p class="baindent">Temperatures at which two or more polymorphs are in equilibrium are called <i>transition temperatures</i> and their dependence on pressure is given by the Clapeyron equation:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page45a-1.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(<a id="eq_6.1">6.1</a>)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, 6 Polymorphism</a></p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x2206;<i>V</i> is the difference in molar volume of the polymorphs, &#x2206;<i>H<sub>t</sub></i> the latent heat of the transition and <i>T<sub>t</sub></i> the transition temperature at a given pressure. This equation makes it possible to calculate the change &#x2206;<i>T</i> in the transition temperature due to a change in pressure &#x2206;<i>P.</i> We have seen in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> that for a crystallization process the solubility curves provide important data. In a dimorphic system consisting of polymorphs I and II, with polymorph II being the more stable at the temperature of interest, it follows that for molecules in the solid state:</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">The painkiller paracetamol is polymorphic. The stable form I crystallizes from aqueous solutions whilst the metastable form can only be grown from ethanol. Such solvent dependence of polymorph appearance is common, but is related to kinetics not thermodynamics.</p>
</aside>

<p class="banoindent">If we place a crystal of each polymorph in contact with its saturated solution, then the chemical potentials of molecules in solid and liquid phases are equal. We can therefore write each in terms of the solubility, <i>x<sub>eq</sub>,</i> of each phase in a given solvent. Thus assuming ideal solutions:</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page46a-7.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(6.3)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">Hence the relative solubility of each polymorph reflects its relative stability, the more stable polymorph having the lower solubility. This relationship is completely independent of the solvent.</p>

<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">The existence of polymoryhic structures is a reflection of alternative ways in which molecules or ions can pack in a crystal in attempting to minimize their free energy whilst crystallizing at a reasonable rate. In some cases different paclung is driven by intermoleculx interactions (enthalpy) and in others by considerations of entropy. <a href="#fig_6.4">Figure 6.4</a> shows three different packing motifs for <i>n</i>-alkanes.

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">In 1897 Ostwald published his &#x2018;Rule of Stages&#x2019;. This was a statement of his experimental observations that when systems crystallized they often formed metastable phases first and then transformed in stages, each transformation lowering the free energy of the system until it reached equilibrium. <a href="#fig_6.8">Fig. 6.8</a> shows this for potassium nitrate.</p>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">In the transformation process molecules in the solid phase undergo appropriate positional changes to yield a new structure with lower free energy. One commonly used method of characterizing such transitions at constant pressure is to consider how various thermodynamic functions change at the In 1897 Ostwald published his 'Rule transition temperature. An <i>n</i>th-order transition is defined as one for which the <i>n</i>th derivative of the free energy with temperature is discontinuous. A <i>first</i>-<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, 6 Polymorphism</a> <i>order transition</i> is characterized by discontinuous entropy, enthalpy and heat capacity curves whereas a <i>second-order dransition</i> is characterized by continuous entropy and enthalpy but discontinuous heat capacity curves.</p>

It is purified by crystallization on the scale of 10<sup>6</sup> tonnes pa. before it is reacted with ethylene glycol to form the polymer. Since this is a solid-liquid reaction, the crystal morphology of the product is crucial in ensuring that it can be easily mixed with the ethylene glycol. Commerciai PTA is sold as the metastable polymorph I. It is fortunate that the transformation to the stable form is kinetically hindered at room temperature.</p>

</aside>

<h4><i>Reconstructive transformations</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">Here the two structures are so different that the transition between them can only be affected by the disintegration of one and reconstruction of the new. A well-known example is the aragonite to calcite transformation in calcium carbonate. It is common in systems of this type that the transformation is catalysed if the crystals are in contact with their saturated solutions, since dissolution of the metastable structure is a convenient way of disintegrating it.</p>
<h4><i>Displacive transformations</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">In this case, molecules of one structure can be displaced to yield the new structure in such a way that nearest neighbour interactions are preserved and only second neighbours change. In these cases, activation energies are low. transformation rates are high and the process can be accomplished in the solid state. An example of this class is the I to <b>II</b> transition in terephthalic acid in which hydrogen-bonded sheets of one structure slide and twist to give the new structure and the transformation can proceed without disrupting the parent crystal. <a href="#fig_6.6">Figure 6.6</a> shows this process as evidenced by the morphological change.</p>
<p class="baindent">Since the free energy change associated with a transformation can be written as</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;">&#x2206;<i>G</i> = &#x2206;<i>H</i> &#x2212; <i>T</i>&#x2206;<i>S</i>, <span class="eq">(6.4)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">it follows that a transformation can be accompanied by either an exothermic or an endothermic enthalpy change as long as the overall AG is negative. If the enthalpy change is endothermic then it must be balanced by a positive change in entropy and hence the new phase is more disordered than its precursor. Such a transition is termed an <i>order-disorder transfirmation</i> and is again exemplified by the terephthalic acid transition.</p>

<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">The kinetic processes involved in phase transitions between polymorphs depend largely on the extent of structural changes involved. Following the above discussion, two mechanistic scenarios can be described. <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, 6 Polymorphism</a></p>


<p class="banoindent"><i>Solvent-mediated (reconstructive) transformation,</i> in which the metastable phase dissolves while the stable phase renucleates and grows from solution. <a href="#fig_6.8">Figure 6.8</a> is an example of this. This route often involves a lower activation energy than a solid state process and hence is favoured for reconstructive transitions occurring well below the melting point.</p>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:0.5em;"><i>Solid state (displacive) tmnsformation,</i> in which nucleation and growth of the new phase take place in crystals of the unstable phase. Such transitions are often reversible (enantiotropic) when the temperature is raised and lowered through the transition temperature.</p>

<p class="baindent">For solid state transformations, <a href="#fig_6.9">Fig. 6.9</a> illustrates the basis of the derivation of kinetic expressions (Gardew <i>et al.,</i> 1984).

<p class="baindent">For solvent - mediated transformations the extent of transformation, <i>V</i>(<i>t</i>)/<i>V</i>(<i>total</i>), does not yield useful mechanistic information (Cardew and Davey, 1985). Consideration of <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a> shows that this is because the kinetics of this process are controlled by the relative rates of dissolution of the metastable (I) and growth of the stable (II) phases. Thus, when a metastable phase is in contact with its mother liquor this liquid is supersaturated with respect to the stable phase and hence crystals of form II can also nucleate and grow. Growth<a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, 6 Polymorphism</a> of I1 reduces the solution composition below the saturation level of form I, causing more form I to dissolve. This process continues until all the form I has dissolved and recrystallization to form 11is complete.</p>

<p class="baindent">Refemng to <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>, two supersaturations can be defined. The first is the driving force for the growth of polymorph 11that is given by:</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>&#x03C3;</i> = (<i>x</i> &#x2212; <i>x<sub>II</sub></i>)/<i>x<sub>II</sub></i></p>

<p class="banoindent">while the second is the supersaturation at the start of the transformation process:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="../images/page50-2.jpg" alt="images"/></p>

<p class="banoindent">A kinetic description of this overall process is then given by three simultaneous equations describing:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="banoindent">(i) dissolution of form I:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page50-3.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(6.7)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">(ii) growth of form II:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page50-4.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(6.8)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">(iii) the mass balance:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page50-5.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(6.9)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent"><i>r<sub>I</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>II</sub></i> are the crystal sizes of forms I and I1 respectively, the subscripts <i>i</i> and <i>f</i> refer to initial and final values of relevant parameters and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>i</sub></i> is the supersaturation that would exist if all the crystals of both forms were dissolved.</p>
<p class="baindent">Simultaneous solution of these equations allows the supersaturation-time profiles to be predicted for various situations. A typical result is seen in <a href="#fig_6.11">Fig. 6.1la</a> and a number of general features of such curves can be identified. First, a decrease in supersaturation from the maximum value, <i>&#x03C3;<sub>I,II</sub>,</i> occurs as form II<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, 6 Polymorphism</a> nucleates and grows. Second, there is a period during which the growth and dissolution processes are precisely balanced, resulting in a supersaturation plateau. Finally, when the last of the phase I has dissolved, a reduction in the supersaturation to zero takes place as form II completes its growth. <a href="#fig_6.11">Figure 6.11b</a> shows this in more detail. Desupersaturation profiles have been chosen to illustrate situations in which the transformation is controlled either by growth of form II (<i>k<sub>D</sub></i>/<i>k<sub>G</sub></i> = 10) or dissolution of form I (<i>k<sub>D</sub></i>/<i>k<sub>G</sub></i> = 0.1). The two extremes are easily distinguishable by the position of the plateau relative to the maximum supersaturation. If the two are close together then form I dissolves rapidly enough to maintain the solution at its maximum allowable composition. The slower the dissolution process, the lower the plateau.</p>

<p class="baindent"><a href="#fig_6.12">Figure 6.12</a> shows two examples, one for a dyestuff in which dissolution is rate controlling. and one for an agrochemical in which growth is rate controlling. It is worth noting that because the plateau supersaturation is so low when the dissolution process is controlling, the total transformation time can be very long, perhaps extending to a number of days.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conclusions</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Although polymorphic transformations are structurally driven, mechanistically they show many similarities to other nucleation and growth processes. The implications of these transformation processes are considerable when considering process and product design and development. Crystalline solids may break down to give powders with very different size distributions to the starring material, while solvent-mediated transformations will lead to changes in morphology (or form) and increases in crystal size. In all cases a change in polymorph will impact upon the operation of a process and give a product with variable physical properties.</p>
