<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">In the commodity chemical industry, crystalline products are commonly manufactured at production rates of millions of tonnes per annum. Terephthalic acid, for example, is specified by its purity and particle size since it is used as a solid reagent to form polyester fibre. Ammonium nitrate is specified by its bulk density and mechanical properties as it is sold for direct application as a fertilizer. Speciality chemicals, on the other hand, rely heavily on formulation. Aspirin tablets contain a fixed amount of the active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid, together will an inert diluent, a binder and a disintegrating agent, the whole mixture being sugar coated. This is thus a complex multicomponent system, sold for its effect (as a painkiller) rather than on the basis of its chemical composition.</p>

<p class="banoindent">Having developed a process for preparing a product in a crystalline form, it is important to appreciate that these crystals usually then have to be transformed into a product. In some cases this is achieved by further chemical reaction, in others by formulation. Formulation is a generic term given to the collection of physical processes such as milling, mixing, dissolution, tableting, and melting that transform individual single components into multicomponent products.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch09-9.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>9.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Crystals as active products</b></h2>
<p class="baindent">Perhaps the most important component of a formulated product is the active ingredient which, although isolated in the production plant as a crystalline material with appropriate characteristics for purity and bulk handling, must now be present in a form suitable for maximizing its effectiveness in its end use. For example, many pharmaceutical materials are formulated as tablets for oral dosage. These tablets are designed to disintegrate in the stomach, releasing crystalline particles of the active drug that then enters the blood stream by dissolution in the gastric fluids and absorption across the gastrointestinal membrane. The rate of dissolution in such a situation is given by</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page74-1.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(9.1)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="banoindent">in which <i>dm/dt</i> is the rate of dissolution, <i>D</i> the diffusion coefficient of the drug molecule, <i>A</i> the surface area of drug crystals, <i>h</i> the thickncss of the diffusional layer around each crystal, and <i>c<sub>eq</sub></i> and <i>c</i> the saturation and actual concentrations of the drug in the gastric fluids. The form of this equation suggests that the key step in the formulation process will be the reduction of crystal size in order to maximize the surface area of the active drug in the tablet and hence maximize the dissolution rate. Size reduction is usually achieved by milling and grinding processes which impose mechanical forces on the crystals, either using a ball mill or as a result of self-impact in an attritor mill. Such processes typically reduce sizes from 200 to 0.5 <i>&#x00B5;</i>m.</p>
<p class="baindent">In other situations, for example agrochemicals, molecules with biocidal activity, and transdemal implants of drugs, it is important that the release of the active component from the formulation be controlled so that it occurs over an extended period. This can be done by formulating large crystals or by encapsulating the active crystalline material with a barrier coating which slows its dissolution and diffusion during use. <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Crystals in formulated products</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Crystals as property controllers</b></h2>
<p class="banoindent">In some formulated products the active component plays a dual role in contributing both to the efficacy and to the overall physical properties of the product. In margarine and chocolate, for example, triglyceride crystals are not only important contributors to the 'mouth feel' of the product but also the size and shape of these crystals contribute to its rheological and mechanical properties.</p>
<p class="baindent">In other cases the active material is formulated with other ingredients or excipients which. when crystallized, may form an interconnected network encapsulating the active. It is this network that determines the overall mechanical and chemical properties of the product. Catalysts are good examples. A catalyst for a gas-phase reaction must satisfy a number of key requirements. Since it will be charged into a large-scale reactor it must be in a physical form that will not degrade during its lifetime otherwise discharge of spent material becomes problematic. It must have sufficient mechanical robustness to withstand high temperatures and pressures without degrading. Reactants must have easy and sustained access to an active catalytic surface. To satisfy these criteria active catalyst phases (typically crystalline metals or oxides) are mixed with inert support materials (often alumina or silica) and pelleted by compression to yield centimetre-sized pellets with appropriate mechanical and porosity properties. The relative crystal sizes and method of mixing of active and inert phases, together with the pelleting conditions, all have to be optimized to create an acceptable product.</p>
<p class="baindent">Other examples are found in bars of soap, shoe polish, greases and deodorant sticks where an organic material such as an alkane or long-chain alcohol forms a crystal network to provide the product with required mechanical properties. The active biocides, perfumes or pigments can then be held within this matrix of small crystals and released by mechanical action, rubbing for example, when needed.</p>
<p class="baindent">The key to achieving an acceptable product in all these cases is in the control of crystallization during product manufacture. In some cases specialist equipment is used, a good example being scraped surface heat exchangers that are employed in both ice cream manufacture and the refining of vegetable oils (composed mainly of triglycerides).</p>
<p class="baindent">Manufacture of ice cream involves passing a mixture of water. milk. sugars, cream, stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavouring and air through such a heat exchanger. The exchanger has the form of a cylindrical barrel through which the mixture is transported by a revolving helical screw. Cooling at the outer barrel wall initiates nucleation and subsequent growth of ice crystals. The characteristics and acceptability of the ice cream depend in part on the size and size distribution of these crystals; if the size is greater than about 60 &#x00B5;m the 'mouth feel' of the product becomes excessively gritty. It is possible to model the exchanger as a continuous crystallizer but, as we have seen in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">8</a>, this requires knowledge of the appropriate nucleation and growth kinetics. Knowledge of the mechanism by which the crystals nucleate, the site(s) in the exchanger where nucleation occurs, and an understanding of the <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Crystals in formulated products</a>path that crystals take on their subsequent passage through the exchanger, are all essential to the development of such a model and hence to control of the ultimate size distribution and achievement of a satisfactory product.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.3 Crystals causing problems</b></h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">Formulated products often deteriorate with time due to the growth of crystals. Ice cream continually put into and taken out of the freezer is subject to temperature cycling which causes subsequent melting and solidification of ice. Over a long period of time this leads to coarsening of the ice and loss of creamy texture. Such processes are often referred to as 'ripening' but should not be confused with 'Ostwald ripening', which drives changes of size on the nanometre scale (Eqn 3.10).</p>
</aside>
<p class="banoindent">With formulated products in which the active is in the form of a crystalline solid there is potential for things to go wrong. In aqueous dispersions, creams and aerosols where micrometre-sized crystals are involved, particle enlargement due to crystal growth commonly destabilizes the product. In a dispersion this would result in settling out of the active to the bottom of its container, in a cream an undesirable grittiness would occur, while in an aerosol the valve would become blocked with the result that the canister becomes inoperable.</p>
<p class="baindent">Crystal growth in these situations is often driven by temperature cycling during storage with warm days and cold nights causing the active to dissolve in the day and crystallize at night. Over a period of time the smaller crystals in the population disappear while the larger ones grow. As the surface area of crystals decreases, so the dissolution cycle in this process becomes less effective in returning the crystals to their original size and the product changes irreversibly.</p>
<p class="baindent">Sometimes a polymorphic transformation can occur in the active with the structure as formulated converting to a more stable crystalline polymorph. As discussed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, if the two structures are enantiotropicdly related, this switch will occur reversibly with cycling temperature. Ammonium nitrate used in explosives and fertilizers provides a good example. The transition temperature between forms IV and III is 32&#x00B0;C and temperature cycling causes the product to fracture into a fine powder which subsequently cakes and can give severe handling problems. For materials in which the structures are related monotropically, the change is irreversible. If the transformation mechanism is through dissolution and crystal growth, an increase in crystal size will occur. The overall result of these processes is that the product will need to be reformulated, perhaps with a growth inhibitor incorporated and certainly from the most stable crystal structure.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch09-9.4">
<h2 class="h2"><b>9.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Crystallization controllers as products</b></h2>
<p class="banoindent">This final category refers to molecules that have been developed specifically as products to prevent unwanted crystallisation.</p>
<p class="baindent">One example is found in fuel additives. Middle distillate fuels for use in diesel engines and as heating oil are complex mixtures of hydrocarbon molecules, between 15 and 30% of which are straight-chain paraffins (<i>n</i>-alkanes) with chain lengths between about C<sub>9</sub> and C<sub>28</sub>. When these distillates are subject to low temperatures the heavier paraffins become insoluble and crystallize. The crystals are typically thin plate-like rhombs which can grow as large as 1 mm across. Having formed, such crystals (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>) rapidly block the in-line fuel filters present in both diesel engines and heating systems, causing fuel starvation and failure of the vehicle or heating system. In <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Crystals in formulated products</a>addition, attractive colloidal forces between the surfaces of the crystals can lead to the formation of a crystal network. This causes the viscosity of the fuel to rise until, with as little as 1% of paraffins in the crystalline state, the fuel becomes gel-like and can no longer be pumped through the narrow pipelines in diesel engines or heating systems. To prevent these phenomena crystal growth inhibitors and nucleating aids are added to the fuel.</p>

<p class="baindent">In order to develop such products it is important to have a test against which the activity of selected molecules can be compared. In this way it is possible to develop <i>structure-actiuify</i> relationships for potential product molecules. One such measure in the paraffin application is the <i>cloud point,</i> the temperature at which the first wax crystals begin to appear on cooling. A second is the <i>pour point,</i> the temperature at which the fuel becomes sufficiently gelled that it no longer behaves as a liquid. A typical additive would be a copolymer of ethylene and vinylacetate which has sequences of alkyl chains separated by more polar groups. The former bind to the crystal while the latter offer a good steric barrier to further crystal growth. The activity of such polymers as a function of their molecular structure can be explored by measuring the amount needed to inhibit crystal growth. Typical data are shown in <a href="#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a> for the crystallization of <i>n</i>-C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>66</sub> in the presence of a series of polymers. These results reveal the importance of alkyl chain length in determining the efficacy of the polymeric additive.</p>

</figure>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">A second example of this type of product is the use of inhibitors to reduce precipitation of insoluble inorganic species from water, so-called <i>scale inhibitors.</i> All natural water contains dissolved inorganic ions and the appearance of a furry coating of calcium carbonate on the heating element of a kettle is a comn occurrence, particularly in areas of hard water. Domestic washing powders contain phosphates and scquestrants to prevent crystals depositing during the washing process. Industrial cooling water is treated with organic phosphonates and carboxylates to prevent scale build-up on heat exchanger surfaces. In off-shore oil recovery similar scale inhibitors are used to prevent blocking of pipelines and pores in oil-bearing rock.</p>
<p class="baindent">In the context of off-shore oil recovery one particularly difficult scale to treat is barium sulphate, the most insoluble of the common inorganic scales. Boreholes are sunk into porous oil-bearing rock strata beneath the sea bed. Oil is recovered from this rock (which contains both oil and water within its pores) by pumping seawater into the bore hole and displacing the oil which is then pumped to the surface as an oil-in-water dispersion. Seawater contains sulphate ions while some oil-bearing rocks contain water that is rich in dissolved barium. In these cases, when the seawater is pumped into the pores barium sulphate is precipitated and the pores become blocked. This prevents further oil being recovered and can threaten the viability of the oil field.</p>
<p class="baindent">Using the concept of tailor-made additives discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> it is possible to develop a design strategy to identify molecules which could be dissolved in the seawater and inhibit the crystallization of barium sulphate. Step one of this procedure involves identifying the crystal face(s) on which the additive is to act. This would normally be the fastest growing face. The second step is to visualize the molecular or ionic structure of the face in question. <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Crystals in formulated products</a>Both these steps require knowledge of the crystal structure of the crystallizing material in question. The find step is to identify and test molecules that have appropriate functional znd geometric features to bind strongly to the face and to act as an inhibitor.</p>

<p class="baindent">Barium sulphate crystals form from seawater as (001) rhombic plates bounded by fast-growing &#x007B;210&#x007D; faces as shown in <a href="#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>. Organic phosphonate anions have been tested as crystallization inhibitors since it would be anticipated that the divalent phophonate group might mimic the sulphate ion and allow such molecules to enter growing surfaces. The organic functionality would then disrupt growth. One particular molecular motif has been found to be highly effective-two phosphonate groups joined by a three-atom chain. An example of such a molecule 1s aminodimethylene diphosphonic acid. <a href="#fig9.3">Figure 9.3</a> shows this molecule occupying two sulphate sites on a (011) face of barium sulphate. It is clear that the geometry of the molecule is particularly favourable in allowing both phosphonate groups simultaneously to access related sulphate sites. Energetic calculations confirm this and show that the three-atom chain then lays across the surface to form a steric and electrostatic barrier to further growth (Rohl <i>et al.,</i> 1996).</p>

</figure>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">Using this model it is possible to extend the concept to the design of molecules that may be even more effective. For example, additive molecules that contain two of the diphosphonate motifs would be able simultaneously to access four sulphate sites and hence might be more active than molecules containing only one motif. Thus <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a> shows the geometric juxtaposition of three additive molecules occupying adjacent surface sites. It also defines the geometry of such a molecule in that the link between two motifs must be at least a seven-carbon chain having a distance of 0.74 nm. To develop a <i>stmcture-proper</i> relationship for this system, a series of such molecules having a range of link lengths from 0.60 to 1.20 nm was prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit the precipitation of barium sulphate from mixtures of barium chloride and sodium sulphate. <a href="#fig9.4">Figure 9.4</a> shows the results of such studies. The sudden enhancement of inhibition when the link length reaches 0.74 nm is consistent with the principles on which the molecular design was based and is the basis for enhanced product activity (Davey <i>et al.,</i> 1991).</p>
<p class="baindent">Two further examples of these principles of molecular additive design are to be found in preventing crystallization of dyes in dyesheets for thermal transfer printing (Davey <i>et al.,</i> 1997) and controlling the setting of cements (Coveney <i>et al.,</i> 1998).</p>
<p class="baindent">In the former, dye dissolved in an amorphous polymer is coated onto a polymeric support sheet to create a ribbon of alternate red, blue and yellow dye. This dyesheet is then utilized to create coloured images from digitally recorded photographs. In order to achieve acceptable optical colour densities it is often necessary to have such high dye loadings that, over a period of months, crystals form in the dyesheet. This causes diffusion of the dyc to the growing crystals and hence inhomogeneities in the dyesheet and in the subsequent colour prints. Incorporation of suitably designed additives into the formulation can prevent the nucleation and growth of crystals and hence extend the shelf life of the dyesheets.</p>

<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Crystals in formulated products</a></p>

<p class="baindent">The case of setting of cement is rather different. Here the setting process involves the dissolution and recrystallization of calcium silicates and aluminates with the mineral etlringite (calcium aluminium sulphate) being a key intermediate controlling the setting process. In order to extend setting times and so allow cements to be pumped as fluids to their point of application (in an off-shore oil well, for example), retardants must be designed to interact with and inhibit the formation of ettringite. As with barium sulphate, organic phosphonates are also highly active in this instance, particularly when designed with the appropriate geometry to match the crystal surfaces of ettringite. Most importantly from an application standpoint, setting is delayed without interfering with the subsequent mechanical properties of the cement.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.5 Conclusions</b></h2>
<p class="banoindent">This chapter has provided a brief overview of some aspects of crystals as they exist and transform in formulated products. Conceptually, this aspect of crystals and crystallization belongs more to the tradition of materials science than lo that of physical chemistry or process technology. Materials science is concerned largely with the relationship between physical properties such as grain sue, crystal structure and mechanical behaviour, and the micro and atomic level structure of materials wch as metals, alloys. ceramics and polymers. There is now an increasing awareness that a similar approach would greatly benefit the area of product formulation.</p>
