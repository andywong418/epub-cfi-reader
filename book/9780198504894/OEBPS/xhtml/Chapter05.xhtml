<p class="banoindent">The overall shape of a crystal, often called its habit, form or morphology, is a vital parameter in determining the viability of both processes and products. It is usual to distinguish between 'equilibrium' and 'growth' morphologies. The former is the shape that a crystal adopts when allowed to equilibrate with its surroundings and corresponds to the minimization of the surface free energy of the crystal, while the latter is the shape that a crystal develops during growth when kinetics may dominate.</p>
<p class="baindent">Morphology is determined by two factors, the symmetry of the internal crystal structure, which is manifest in the point group symmetry of the crystal form, and the relative growth rates of the faces bounding the crystal, which are related to the energetics of molecule or ion attachment to the crystal surfaces. The surface-specific nature of this attachment process means that crystal morphology can be dramatically influenced by external factors such as the level of supersaturation, temperature, the growth solvent, and solution purity.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Predicting crystal morphology</h2>

<p class="banoindent">If the crystal structure of a material is known then its crystal morphology may, in principle, be predicted. Structural information provides the necessary symetxy constraints (the point group) together with the positional coordinates of all the atoms in the structure. As shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, the relative growth rates of the crystal faces can be assessed by calculating the strength of bonds formed when a growth unit joins different surfaces. This simple concept can be extended by making two assumptions:</p>

<p class="hang1">(a)&#x00A0;&#x00A0; A crystal surface, designated by the Miller indices (hkl), grows by the addition of complete layers having the same crystal structure as the bulk and a thickness <i>d<sub>hkl</sub>,</i> the lattice spacing in the direction perpendicular to the face.</p>

<p class="hang">(b)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The energy released per mole of layer added to a crystal face, the so- called <i>attachment energy E<sub>att</sub>,</i> is directly proportional to the growth rate of a given face.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="banoindent">The introduction and use of these approximations is attributed to the pioneering work of Hartman and Perdok (1955). In this way the problem of predicting morphology reduces to the calculation of <i>E<sub>att</sub>,</i> for various crystal faces. The faces that bound the crystal will be those with the lowest values of <i>E<sub>att</sub>,</i> that are consistent with the point group symmetry. <i><b>E<sub>att</sub>,</b></i> can be calculated using various approximations. <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, 5 Crystal morphology</a></p>

<h4><i>Brauais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">This approach assumes that the binding energy bctween crystal planes is inversely proportional to the interplanar spacing, i.e. the closer the molecules, the larger are their interaction energies. From this it follows that the growth rate <i>uhkl</i> of the (hkl) face is proportional to the inverse of the distance between the (hkl) planes in the crystal structure, <i>l/d<sub>hkl</sub>.</i> Thus, the relative growth rates of a series of faces can be assessed purely on the basis of the known crystal structure.</p>


<h4><i>Specific force fields (molecular mechanics)</i></h4>
<p class="banoindent">With increasing availability of cheap computer power, the precise calculation of <i>E<sub>att</sub>,</i> using available potential functions to describe the interactions between molecules and ions is now possible (Clydesdale <i>et al.,</i> 1993).</p>

<p class="baindent">The interaction energies <i>E<sub>ij</sub></i> between the individual ith and jth non-bonded atoms of the molecules that constitute the crystal are usually calculated in terms of van der Waals and electrostatic contributions through an equation of the fom:</p>


<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page43-4.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(5.1)</span></p>

<p class="banoindent">in which the van der Waals energy is expressed in terms of the well-known 6-12 Lennard-Jones function and the electrostatic term as a function of the fractional charges <i>q</i> on the ith and jth atoms. their separation <i>r,j</i> which is known from the crystal structure, and the dielectric constant <i>E.</i> The example of succinic acid shows the outcome of such calculations with the values of <i>E,,</i> for various faces shown in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">It was Auguste Bravais (1811-1863), a typical 19th century scientific 'all- rounder', who first attempted to quantify the link between morphology and structure. The crystallographer George Friedel (1865-1933) continued this work and was visited in Strasbourg, in 1931, by the young American mineralogist, Donnay, who consequently developed an interest in problems of crystal morphology. Donnay's later collaboration with the crystailographer David Harker led in</p>

It is worth noting that the &#x007B; <i>100)</i> and <i>(020)</i> faces that grow most slowly occupy the largest areas in the final morphology. The observed morphology of crystals grown from the vapour shows that the crystals are thinner but essentially similar to the calculated habit.</p>

<h4><i>Atomistic lattice simulations</i></h4>

<p class="banoindent">In the case of ionic crystals, energetic parameters may again be calculated by use of potential functions. These allow for both long-range electrostatic forces and short-range interactions and assign appropriate charges to the constituents of polyatomic species. In this methodology, it has been conventional to calculate not attachment energies but surface energies directly (Mackrodr <i>et</i> al., 1987). Thus, it is imagined that a crystal is cleaved to expose the desired face, (hkl). The energy changes involved are calculated so that the surface energy is given by:</p>


<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page44-6.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(5.2)</span></p>

<p class="banoindent">where the energy of the crystal plane (hkl) is <i>Efkl</i> in the bulk and <i>Elk,</i> in the surface. In the case of barium sulphate the calculated values are given in <a href="#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a></p>

<h2 class="h2" style="width:68%;">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The influence of supersaturation, temperature, solvents, additives and impurities</h2>

<p class="banoindent">The predictions discussed above assume that structural factors alone control crystal growth rates. It is known, however, that the relative growth rates of different crystal surfaces can be particularly susceptible to the conditions prevailing in the growth medium. We have seen in Chapter <i>4</i> how the growth rate of a face can depend in a non-linear way on supersaturation. This makes it possible for growth kinetic curves to intersect as shown in <a href="#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>. This shows the growth rates of paracetamol crystals in the <i>&#x005B;010&#x005D;</i>and <i>&#x005B;001&#x005D;</i>directions when grown from aqueous solution (Finnie <i><b>et</b> ul., 1996).</i> Because the growth rate curves for these two faces intersect, needles elongated along <i>&#x005B;0011</i> are produced at low supersaturations while at high supersaturations the crystals are bipyramidal.</p>

<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, 5 Crystal morphology</a></p>


<p class="baindent">As discussed in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> ((<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.17">Eqns 4.17</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.18">4.18</a>) crystal growth is a thermally activated process in which growth rates increase with temperature (as do chemical reactions) according to an Arrhenius relationship. One Selectiveconsequence of this is that growth tends to become diffusion controlled with adsorptionon increasing temperature. This leads to the general rule of thumb that crystals are faces more isotropic in their shape when grown at higher temperatures.</p>

<p class="baindent">In addition to these global kinetic effects. specific morphological changes can occur in both solution and melt growth due to the selective adsorption of non-crjstallizing components on particular crystal surfaces. For example, the presence of specific impurities even at low (ppm) levels can have a profound effect on crystal morphology. The converse of this is that impurities are sometimes deliberately added to produce a desired morphological effect; in this case they are referred to as <i>additives.</i></p>

<p class="baindent">When impurities become adsorbed at a growing surface so strongly that they block kink sites then the growth rate of the face is reduced. Because the concentration of active growth sites on the surface is low, additives and impurities can exert significant effects at very low concentrations. Similar effects ar'e seen in the poisoning of catalysts. The result of such surface- specific adsorption processes can often be lo bring about a change in crystal morphology. This is demonstrated in <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a> where specific adsorption on the fastest growing faccs modifies a needle morphology to a more equant shape. Wen designing an additive to inhibit crystallization we work in the reverse way; the additive should be targeted to adsorb selectively on the fast growing faces. <a href="#fig5.8">Figure 5.8</a> illustrates schematically how impurities adsorbed at a step can block growth.</p>

<p class="baindent">The reduction in cryqtal growth rate (<i>v<sub>f</sub>,</i> in impure and <i>u,</i> in pure solution) the fast growing faces of a needle can be expressed by an equation of the form:</p>

<p class="banoindent">As the separation 1 between adsorbed impurities on the surface decreases towards the dimension of the critical radius <i>r<sub>c</sub></i> of a two-dimensional nucleus, steps cannot advance and growth eventually stops. <a href="#fig5.9">Figure 5.9</a> displays kinetic data for three molecular systems showing how the growth rate falls rapidly with increasing additive concentration.</p>

<p class="baindent">Solvents may act in a similax way but they also determine the value of <i>a</i> (see Section 4.2) for a paxtichalar interface. It follows that for growth from soh&#x007E;tion, morphological changes can result not only from strong solvent adsorption but also from surface-specific changes in growth mechanisms <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, 5 Crystal morphology</a>brought about by solvent changes.

Growth of the &#x007B;110&#x007D; faces of hexamethylene tetramine provides such an example (<a href="#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>). When grown from the vapour, from ethanol and from water, and hence as the solubility increases, the growth mechanism changes from one that is controlled by screw dislocations, through surface nucleation to continuous growth.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Some specific examples</h2>

<p class="banoindent">It is apparent that particular morphological effects are largely structurally driven and for this reason are specific to each crystallizing system. In this section we will look at some examples chosen to demonstrate the effects discussed above.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The influence of solvent: succinic acid</span></h3>

<p class="banoindent">The predicted morphology of succinic acid and its good agreement with that observed for crystals grown from the vapour has been illustrated in <a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>. <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, 5 Crystal morphology</a></p>

</figure>

<p class="banoindent">Crystals grown from aqueous and alcoholic solutions. however, have a different morphology as is evident from Fig. 5.11. Whereas the &#x007B;020&#x007D; faces dominate in vapour growth, the &#x007B;100&#x007D; faces dominate when crystallization takes place from a solvent. By visualizing the molecular paclung in the various crystal sub-faces we can gain further insight into this phenomenon. This may be done by referring back to the crystallographic projection shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> <a href="#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11</a> The morphology of since succinic acid, COOH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COOH, has essentially the same crystal succinic acid crystals grown from structure as adipic acid. For the &#x007B;loo&#x007D; surface the polar carboxylic acids groups protrude into the solution where they will interact strongly with a polar solvent .This may be contrasted with the &#x007B;020&#x007D; faces which, like the &#x007B;001 &#x007D; face of adipic acid, lie parallel to the alkyl chains. This preferential solvent binding results in the &#x007B;loo&#x005D; faces having slower growth rates and hence being more important faces than expected from the prediction. The kinetics of crystal growth shown in <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12</a> reflect this with the &#x007B;020&#x007D; growing faster in both water and isopropanol.</p>

<p class="baindent">These kinetic data also reveal that at equivalent supersaturations crystal growth is slower from isopropanol than from water. Values of the &#945;-factors for each face are shown in <a href="#tab5.3">Table 5.3</a>. These show no significant effect of solvent on the value of a and hence on the nature of the interface. Thus, no change in growth mechanism would be expected, implying that the growth rates in water are likely to be the same as those in isopropanol. The observed lower growth rates in isopropanol can only be explained by a specific stereochemical effect related to solvent adsorption, presumably linked to hydrogen bonding of water or isopropanol with surface carboxylic acid groups. The larger size of the<a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, 5 Crystal morphology</a> isopropanol molecule would it a more effective inhibitor of growth and hence give rise to the observed relative growth rates in water and isopropanal.</p>

<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:0.6em;margin-bottom:0.4em;">The influence of impnritieeurea and biuret</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">When urea [(NW<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2CO</sub>] is synthesized from ammonia and carbon dioxide a dimer, biuret (NH<sub>2</sub>CONHCONH<sub>2</sub>) is also formed in small amounts. Urea crystals grown in pure aqueous solutions form long [001] needles while in solutions that also contain biuret the crystals are shorter and stubby, having had growth in [001] suppressed (Davey et al., 1986). The structural basis for the needle-like morphology of urea lies in the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding along the c-axis as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 5.13. Furthermore, the structure is such that the {001) surfaces cannot casily discriminate between two urea molecules and one biuret molecule. The biuret molecules can therefore become attached to the lattice at growth sites in the [001] direction. For urea molecules trying to bind to a biuret-contaminated surface, however, life is difficult since the NH<sub>2</sub>- groups in the crystal sufiace that are needed to form hydrogen bonds are now nlissing. This effectively reduces the growth rate in the [OOl] direction, so resulting in stubby crystals.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:100%;">One of the first recorded examples of an impurity effect is that noted by Rome de I'lsle in 1783. Common salt crystallized in the presence of horse urine was found to produce octahedral rather than cubic salt.</p>

<p class="baindent">This example illustrates the important general rule that additives capable of modifying crystal morphologies are those that are in some way molecular impostors. They are able to enter the growing surface and yet once there, they disrupt further growth. To perform this function effectively the additive molecule must resemble the crystallizing molecule while containing some small difference in stereochemistry or functionality, rendering it capable of inhibiting growth in a selected direction. In recent years this principle of tnibr-made <i>additives</i> has been applied to the rational design of crystallization inhibitors for a number of applications (Davey <i>et</i> al., 1993; Weissbuch <i>et</i> al., 1994).</p>
<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Crystal purity</h2>
<p class="banoindent">In many industrial situations crystals arc grown from solvents under impure conditions. As we have seen, reaction by-products such as biuret may themselves act as tailor-made additives for the growth of the crystallizing material. In some applications such as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymer intermediates and electronic materials, crystallization is used as a means of purification. This relies on the selectivity of the crystal-liquid interface and its power in discriminating between various solute species, There is clearly a link between purification and habit modification by impurities, since those molecules that bind selectively to su~faces are also those most likely to be incorporated into the crystal lattice.</p>
<p class="baindent">The degree of purification by crystallization is usually described quantitatively by a distribution segregation coefficient defined as:</p>
