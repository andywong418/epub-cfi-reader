<h2 class="h2">8.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Continuous MSMPR crystallizers</h2>
<p class="banoindent">We have seen in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> that the continuous MSMPR crystallizer produces a crystal size distribution that has a fixed shape, one measure of which is a coefficient of variation for the mass distribution of 0.5. The mean size of the distribution can be varied and is always given by a simple multiple of the product <i>G&#x03C4;</i>. One might instinctively expect that an increase in the residence time <i>&#x03C4;</i> would result in an increase in the mean crystal size. Examination of the information flow diagram in Fig. 7.9, however, suggests that more subtle effects must be considered.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">We have seen that secondary nucleation kinetics can be represented by an equation of the form</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:-0em;"><i>B</i> = <i>K<sub>b</sub>M<sup>T</sup></i>&#x0394;<i>c<sup>b</sup></i></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">while the growth rate can be written</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:0em;"><i>G</i> = <i>K<sub>g</sub></i>&#x0394;<i>c<sup>g</sup>.</i></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">It is often convenient to eliminate the concentration driving force between these two equations and write the nucleation rate as a function of the growth rate:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:0.1em;"><i>B</i> = <i>K<sub>R</sub>M<sub>T</sub>G<sup>i</sup></i></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">where the relative rate constant</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:0.1em;"><i>K<sub>R</sub></i> = <i>k<sub>b</sub></i>/<i>k<sub>g</sub><sup>i</sup></i></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">and the relative kinetic order <i>i</i> is given by</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:0.2em;"><i>i</i> = <i>b</i>/<i>g</i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="baindent">An increase in the residence time, for example, also results in a decrease in the solution supersaturation within the crystallizer as is specified by Eqn (7.22). This lower supersaturation will result in a lower growth rate (as well as a lower nucleation rate). Thus, although the crystals stay in the crystallizer for longer, they are growing more slowing during this longer time. The net result will be either an increase or a decrease in the mean crystal size, the outcome depending on whether or not the increase in residence time outweighs the decrease in growth rate.</p>
<p class="baindent">It is possible to determine the overall effect of changes in residence time on the average crystal size in a quantitative way by combining some of the previously derived equations.</p>
<p class="baindent">Let us use the mode of the mass distribution <img class="inline" src="../images/page62-1.jpg" alt="images"/> to characterize the mean crystal size and recall that <img class="inline" src="../images/page62-1.jpg" alt="images"/> = 3<i>G&#x03C4;</i> (Eqn 7.19). The production rate of the crystallizer is given by the product of the volumetric flow rate through the vessel, <i>Q</i>, and the total concentration of crystals, <i>M<sub>T</sub></i>, in the slurry; <i>M<sub>T</sub></i> is given by Eqn (7.15):</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>M<sup>T</sup></i> = 6<i>p<sub>cry</sub>&#x03B1;BG</i><sup>3</sup> &#x0394;<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p class="banoindent">If the relative crystallization kinetics are represented by</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:-0em;"><i>B</i> = <i>K<sub>R</sub>M<sub>T</sub>G<sup>i</sup></i>,</p>

<p class="banoindent">Since the clystallizer volume <i>V</i> = <i>Q&#x03C4;</i>, this equation in effect gives the crystallizer volume required to produce a size distribution having the mean <a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a>size <img class="inline"  src="../images/page62-1.jpg" alt="images"/>.

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:120%;"><b>Fig. 8.1</b> Relation between the residence time and mean size for an MSMPR crystallizer. Note the great insensitivity of size to changes in residence time for low values of the relative growth order <i>i</i>. For example if, <i>i</i> = 2 and an increase in mean size of 20% is required (i.e. <i>L</i><sub><i>D</i>2</sub>/<i>L</i><sub><i>D</i>1</sub> = 1.2), the required ratio of residence times would be 2.5. This would require a reduction in production rate of the same ratio, a penalty that is unlikely to be economic. The mean crystal size produced in an MSMPR crystallizer for a given system is therefore determined principally by the kinetics (i.e. by the values of <i>K<sub>R</sub></i> and <i>i</i>) rather than by the residence time.</p>

<p class="banoindent">and the mean size is independent of residence time. In this case the increased time that the crystals spend in thc crystallizer is exactly offset by the lower growth rate that they experience during their residence in the vessel. Under these circumstances Eqn (<a href="#eq8.3">8.3</a>) indicates that the only way to change the crystal size is by changing the relative rate constant <i>K<sub>R</sub></i>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Size-dependent removal rates</h2>
<p class="banoindent">The &#x2018;mixed product removal&#x2019; assumption of the MSMPR crystallizer ensures that crystals of all qizes have the same mean residence time. which is also equal to that of the solution. If crystals have mean residence times that depend on their size, considerable extra flexibility of operation is achieved and greater variations in the CSD are possible.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Fines removal</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">We have seen that increasing the residence time in an MSMPR crystallizer is an ineffective way of increasing crystal size. Far more effective in addressing this objective is the removal of a large proportion of the <i>numbers</i> of the small, or fine, crystals before they have grown to a size where they contribute significantly to the <i>mass</i> of the crystal product. The net effect of this strategy is to force the supersaturation, and hence the growth rate, to higher levcls, so producing the same production rate on fewer crystals of larger average size.</p>
<p class="baindent">The essential fcatures of a fines removal system can be illustrated by the simple model shown in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>. Size classification results in crystals smaller than the &#x2018;cut&#x2019; size <i>L<sub>F</sub></i> being removed preferentially in a stream with flow rate <i>Q<sub>F</sub></i>. This is often achieved by the presence of a baffle that forms a calming section. Here the larger crystals settle out while the upflowing liquor containing fine crystals is removed. The largest crystal size removed in this stream is determined by the solution velocity and the terminal settling velocity of the crystals but typically may be between 50 and 100 <i>&#x00B5;</i>m. Crystal product comprising all crystal sizes is removed at rate <i>Q<sub>p</sub></i>. The mean residence times of the fines <i>&#x03C4;<sub>F</sub></i> and of the product <i>&#x03C4;<sub>p</sub></i> are then:</p>

<p class="baindent">Since the <i>nzass</i> of crystals smaller than <i>L<sub>F</sub></i> is negligible, the mass distribution of the product can be calculated by considering only that part of the distribution larger than <i>L<sub>F</sub></i>. Equation (<a href="#eq8.7">8.7</a>) gives the &#x2018;effective&#x2019; nucleation rate for the distribution.</p>
<p class="baindent">Using an analogous derivation to that for Eqn (<a href="#eq8.1">8.1</a>) we can now show that the product residence time required to produce an average size <img class="inline"  src="../images/page62-1.jpg" alt="images"/> when fines removal is in place is:</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.8" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page64-5.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(8.8)</span></p>

<p class="center" id="eq8.9" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page64-6.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(8.9)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">Typical values for a fines removal system might be <i>&#x03C4;<sub>P</sub></i>/<i>&#x03C4;<sub>F</sub></i> = 10, <i>L<sub>F</sub></i>/<img class="inline"  src="../images/page62-1.jpg" alt="images"/> = 0.1 and <i>i</i> = 3, so giving <i>f</i> = 0.22. The residence time required to produce a given product average size is thus reduced to less than one-quarter of the value for an MSMPR crystallizer. Alternatively, for a given residence time the average product size achieved with a fines removal system is greater than in the standard MSMPR configuration.</p>
<p class="baindent">Inevitably, a number of disadvantages arise when fines removal systems are employed. The higher operating supersaturation can lead to greater <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a>encrustation on the walls of the crystallizer, there is a higher possibility of instability, and the economics are often poor since dissolution of the fines by either heating or dilution must be accomplished. Nevertheless, the greater operating flexibility makes this mode of operation very attractive and it is widely employed industxially.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Classified prodset removal</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The bulk of the product mass occurs in the larger size ranges of the CSD. If these larger sizes have residence times that are a function of their size. the resulting &#x2018;classified product removal&#x2019; can have a profound effect on the operation of the crystallizer. The larger crystals may have a shorter or longer mean residence time than thc smaller crystals and so the slope of the population density plot in the classified region will be higher or lower, respectively, than that in the smaller size range (<a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:120%;"><b>Fig. 8.5</b> The shape of the population density distribution for classified product removal follows directly from the mean residence time in the larger size ranges. In this case crystals larger than <i>L<sub>C</sub></i> have a shorter mean residence time, .ec, than that of the smaller crystals, <i>&#x03C4;</i>, and so the number of crystals larger than <i>L<sub>C</sub></i> decays more rapidly than those in the smaller size range.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">A shorter mean residence time for the larger crystals may arise if they classify preferentially into the region of the crystallizer from which the product is removed. This may be deliberately designed for, using an elutriation leg for example. or it might occur inadvertently through poor control of local solution velocities. Ira either case the product size distribut~onis narrowed compared to the corresponding MSMPR case. The mean crystal size, however, is usually smaller. This result might appear surprising but it occurs becausc. for a given production rate, the product now contams a smaller <i>number</i> of crystals. In an MSMPR crystallizer large numbers of fine crystals are removed in the product so that a higher nucleation rate can bc tolerated. The smaller number of crystals in the classified product can only be sustained if the nucleation rate is lower. This demands a lower supersaturation and hence lower growth rate. In practice. product classification is often combined with fines removal. the latter removing the excess fines that result from operating at the hlgher supersaturation necessary to maintain the required product size.</p>
<p class="baindent">Longer mean residence times for the larger crystals usually result when the product off-take is some distance from a region into which larger crystals classify. Product CSDs are then wider than in the MSMPR case. Such a mode of operation frequently leads to unstable conditions: the larger crystals gradually accumulate in the classifying region until a large proportion of them is rapidly removed in the product. The resulting rapid decrease in crystal surface area leads to a corresponding increase in supersaturation and hence in the nucleation rate.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Other factors influencing crystal size distribution</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Size-dependent growth rate</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Up to this point we have assumed that crystals of all sizes have the same growth rate. Conditions can exist where this is not the case. For example. if the mass transfer process controls the growth rate (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#ch04-4.4">Section 4.4</a>). the larger crystals would be expected to grow more rapidly than the smaller becausc of the enhanced mass transfer coefficient that results from the higher relative velocities between large crystals and the solution. An example of this is shown<a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a> in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.15">Fig. 4.15</a>. There is also evidence that very small crystals in the range below about 10 <i>&#x00B5;</i>m often have lower average growth rates than the larger sizes. This is possibly because many of them are bounded by faces which do not possess dislocations (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>), or because they are so strained that they have solubilities that are higher than that of larger crystals (Ristic <i>et al</i>., 1990).</p>

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:115%;"><b>Fig. 8.6</b> An empirical equation that has proved useful in describing size-dependent growth has been suggested by Abegg <i>et al</i>. (1968):</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">where <i>G</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>b</i> and <i>&#x03B3;</i> are constants. Corresponding population density plots can be calculated and are shown here for various values of <i>b</i>. When <i>b</i> = 0 the growth rate becomes independent of size and the exponential decay of the MSMPR equation holds. For <i>b</i> &#x003E; 0 the growth rate increases with crystal size.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">The slope of the population density plot again directly reflects the variation of growth rate with size. If the growth rate increases with crystal size, the slope of the population density plot (&#x2212;1/<i>G&#x03C3;</i>) decreases with size. The plot is now no longer linear and the curvature follows the growth rate variation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Agglomeration and breakage</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Agglomeration is a frequent occurrence in many crystallizing systems, particularly within the smaller size range. The net result is that the distribution contains more crystals of larger sizes, and fewer of smaller sizes, than would be found in the normal MSMPR distribution. A non-linear population density plot thus results, the shape of which is similar to that obtained for size- dependent growth when growth rate increases with size.</p>
<p class="baindent">Crystal breakage can be thought of as the reverse of agglomeration. Now there is a deficit of large crystals because some of them have been broken, the breakage fragments populating the smaller sizes and so increasing the numbers of small crystals. The population density plot is again non-linear but now with the opposite curvature, the negative slope increasing with increasing size.</p>
<p class="baindent">Incorporation of agglomeration or breakage into the population balance requires the use of birth and death functions. A full mathematical analysis of either of these cases is rather difficult since the particle growth process is now discontinuous with size, unlike the continuous process of normal crystal growth. The size distribution of those crystals contributing to an agglomera- tion event or resulting from a breakage event must be known and the equations to be solved must include the requirement that the total crystal volume is conserved during the agglomeration or breakage event. Illustrative examples of work in this area are given by Randolph and Larson (1988) for breakage and by David <i>et al</i>. (1991) for agglomeration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Dynamics and stability of continuous crystallizers</h2>
<p class="banoindent">A description of the unsteady-state behaviour of a continuous crystallizer requires solution of the unsteady-state population balance equation. Retaining all the assumptions made in deriving the MSMPR equation shown in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#eq7.8">Eqn 7.8</a> except that of steady state gives the appropriate equation:</p>

<p class="banoindent">Transients in the CSD are caused by disturbances that have their origin outside the crystallizer; examples are changes in feed rate, feed composition, feed temperature and boil-up rate. The course of such transients can be calculated from Eqn (<a href="#eq8.10">8.10</a>) and demonstrates how long it takes for the crystallizer to <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a>regain a new steady state. This time has been shown to be typically between 8 and 10 residence times (see, for example, Randolph and Larson, 1962). Such a long period is a direct result of the feedback betwecn changes in supersaturation and crystal area illustrated in Fig. 7.9. An example of calculated transient behaviour is shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>.</p>

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:130%;"><b>Fig. 8.7</b> When the population density distributions in MSMPR crystallizers are measured down to sizes below about 10 <i>&#x00B5;</i>m, curvature is frequently observed In the plot of In(<i>n</i>) against <i>L</i>.

Given the structure-sensitive nature of the growth process discussed in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, this is not surprising. Consequently, a large fraction of the crystals at very small sizes has an extremely low growth rate.</p>

</aside>

<p class="baindent">Instabilities are linked to the interactions between the inherent kinetics of the crystallizing system and the residence time distribution function. It is possible to envisage that the feedback loop to supersaturation, through the crystal surface area (Fig. 7.9), could result in changes to the supersaturation, and hence to other variables, of ever-increasing magnitude: such a system would be inherently unstable. The classic paper of Randolph and Larson (1962) showed that such a situation would only occur in an MSMPR crystallizer if the relative kinetic order <i>i</i> &#x003E; 21. Such a high value is extremely unlikely and so MSMPR crystallizers are generally inherently stable and will eventually return to a steady state following a disturbance. Instability could occur, however, if there are discontinuous changes in the nucleation rate as may happen, for example, if changes in supersaturation cause the nucleation mechanism to change from secondary to primary.</p>
<p class="baindent">Many industrial ciystallizers exhibit low-frequency cycling that persists over long periods of time. This is usually associated with the use of product classification and is exacerbated if this is combined with a fines removal system. A number of such examples arc discussed in the literature (for exarnple Randolph <i>et al</i>., 1977; Eek <i>et al</i>., 1995).</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Batch ctystallizers</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Batch crystallizers are very widely used, particularly in the production of speciality, agro- and pharmaceutical chemicals where the production rates are comparatively low. They are simple, flexible and require less capital investment than continuous units. Whereas continuous crystallizers arc usually purpose-built for a specific application, batch crystallization operations tend to be carried out in a multipurpose piant, the same vessel serving as a reactor, crystallizer, mixer and blender, as well as handling many different products. In discussing batch crystallization, the emphasis thus tends to be on the mode of operation rather than on the design of a specific piece of equipment.</p>
<p class="baindent">A wide range of methods is used to produce supersaturation in batch processing. Cooling and evaporation are frequently encountered, but with organic materials, in particular, drowning out crystallization is very common (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). This mvoIves adding a miscible non-solvent to reduce the solubility of the desired crystalline product in its mother liquor. This third component may be water if the product is dissolved in a polar organic solvent, a polar organic solvent if the product is in aqueous solution (see for example <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>), an acid or base if the solubility is pH dependent resulting, for example, from a zwitterionic form of the product, or a salt to make use of the common ion effect (salting out). Reaction crystallization, where the reaction product is relatively insoluble and crystallizes directly following a chemical reaction, is also frequently encountered.</p>
<p class="baindent">All batch crystallizations take place under unsteady-state conditions. Central to their successful operation is the control of supersaturation during the batch. This depends on the operating policy which specifies the batch time. the rate at which supersaturation is generated, the possible addition of seed crystals, and the type and level of agitation.</p>

<p class="banoindent">Consideration of a simple mass balance defines the factors that control crystallization rate. A mass balance on the solute can be written</p>

<p class="banoindent">The first derivative in the bracket represents the slope of the soIubility curve and is a characteristic of the system being crystallized, while the second tern is the cooling rate. It is therefore the cooling rate that determines the rate of crystallization, <i>dM</i>/<i>dt</i>. <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a></p>
<p class="baindent">In evaporative crystallization the solution concentration remains approximately constant at a value close to the equilibrium point at the evaporation temperature. Equation (<a href="#eq8.11">8.11</a>) can therefore be written</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.13" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page69-1.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(8.13)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">In this case the crystallization rate is determined by the evaporation rate <i>dV</i>/<i>dt</i>.</p>
<p class="baindent">These two examples demonstrate the importance of the rate of production of supersaturation. as determined by the rate of cooling or of evaporation, in controlling the crystallization. This rate is the key control variable in batch crystallization. The same principle can be extended to crystallization produced by any other means, by drowning out crystallization for example, where the rate of addition of the third component is the key control variable.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Supersaturation control and seeding</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">We will take cooling crystallization as an example and recall the solubility/supersolubility diagram and the concept of the metastable zone (<a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>). Rapid cooling will inevitably cause the solution to cross the boundary of the metastable zone, resulting in uncontrolled nucleation. The very large numbers of nuclei so produced set a limit on the size to which they can grow, since the available solute resources must be distributed over this large number of particles.</p>
<p class="baindent">Supersaturation control entails ensuring that uncontrolled nucleation does not occur but rather that the supersaturation remains constant. and within the metastable zone, during the whole of the crystallization. Such a process requires a concentration-temperature profile of the form shown in <a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>.</p>
<figure  style="text-align:center" id="fig8.9">

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:100%;"><b>Fig. 8.9</b> Maintaining a constant supersaturation during the course of a batch crystallization usually enables the nucleation rate to be minimized and maximum growth to take place on the crjstals. The result Is a larger crystal size together with a narrower size distribution. This effect is further enhanced if the system is seeded just after supersaturation is initially produced. In cooling crystallization the required concentration-temperature profile is shown above.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="baindent">Even better control of supersaturation and hence of crystal size can often be achieved if seed crystals are added to the solution. Deposition of solute by growth on these seeds rather than by the production of new nuclei is thus <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a>enhanced. An initial estimate of the amount of seed to add can be made by assuming that all the depletion of supersaturation takes place by growth on the seeds, and that the seed are monodisperse of size <i>L<sub>s</sub></i>. The mass of seeds <i>M<sub>s</sub></i> is then related to the product yield <i>M<sub>p</sub></i> and size <i>L<sub>p</sub></i> by</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Cooling crystallization</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">If a crystallizing batch is cooled naturally by, for example, allowing constant temperature cooling water to flow at a constant rate through the cooling jacket of the crystallizer, the temperature-time profile <i>&#x00B8;</i>(<i>t</i>) can be calculated as</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.15" style="margin-left:0em;">(<i>&#x03B8;</i> &#x2212; <i>&#x03B8;</i>)/(<i>&#x03B8;<sub>i</sub></i> &#x2212; <i>&#x03B8;<sub>o</sub></i>) = exp(&#x2212;<i>t</i>/<i>&#x03C4;<sub>B</sub></i>) <span class="eq">(8.15)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">where <i>&#x03B8;<sub>i</sub></i> is the initial temperature and <i>&#x03B8;<sub>o</sub></i>, is the final and hence the cooling water temperature. The batch time constant <i>&#x03C4;<sub>B</sub></i> is given by</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.16" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>&#x03C4;<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>M<sub>s</sub>C<sub>p</sub></i>/<i>UA<sub>B</sub></i>. <span class="eq">(8.16)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent"><i>U</i> is the overall heat transfer coefficient, <i>A<sub>B</sub></i> the heat transfer area and <i>M<sub>s</sub></i> the mass of solution that has specific heat <i>C<sub>p</sub></i>.</p>
<p class="baindent">A cooling curve of this type gives very high cooling rates initially, when the temperature driving force is greatest. This is exactly what is <i>not</i> required to maintain the supersaturation at a constant value within the metastable zone. The rapid initial cooling will produce uncontrolled crystallization and resillt in the solution inevitably crossing the metastability limit, so producing massive nucleation. Controlled crystallization, on the other hand, demands very low rates of supersaturation production, and hence very low cooling rates in the early stages of the batch, with the cooling rate gradually increasing with time. This ensures that the rate of production of supersaturation always matches the crystal surface area on which the supersaturation is deposited.</p>
<p class="baindent">Much work has been done to calculate the temperature&#x2013;time profile required to achieve such controlled crystallization. Assuming an unseeded system and a linear temperature-solubility relation, the cooling curve that must be followed to ensure constant supersaturation during the whole of the batch process was first calculated by Mullin and Nyvlt (1971) to be</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.17" style="margin-left:0em;">(<i>&#x03B8;<sub>i</sub></i> &#x2212; <i>&#x03B8;</i>)/(<i>&#x03B8;<sub>i</sub></i> &#x2212; <i>&#x03B8;<sub>o</sub></i>) = (<i>t</i>/<i>t<sub>B</sub></i>)<sup>4</sup> <span class="eq">(8.17)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">where <i>t<sub>B</sub></i> is the batch time. If the batch is seeded the exponent on (<i>t/t<sub>B</sub></i>) becomes 3 (Nyvlt, 1991). Such controlled cooling curves are almost mirror images of the natural cooling curve (<a href="#eq8.15">Eqn 8.15</a>), giving the required very low initial cooling rate that then gradually increases as the batch proceeds (<a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>). Experimental results confirm the advantages to be gained through the increase in product crystal size and the narrowing of the size distribution by following a controlled crystallization.</p>

<figcaption><p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;width:120%;"><b>Fig. 8.10</b> Natural cooling curves give very high initial cooling rates. This is the opposite of that required for controlled crystallization (cf. <a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>). The controlled cooling curve ensures the necessary very slow rates of supersaturation production during the initial siages of the batch and so minimizes nucleation.</p>

<p class="baindent">The occurrence of secondary nucleation sets some limits on the size distribution that can be achieved with controlled crystallization. As soon as crystals appear in the solution secondary nucleation is likely (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#ch03-3.5">Section 3.5</a>) and the number of nuclei that are produced by this mechanism will increase <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, 8 Characteristics of continuous and batch crystallizers</a>with increasing mass of crystals in the solution. The longer the batch time, therefore, the greater the number of secondary nuclei and the more their presence will widen the size distribution by the development of a population of crystals in thc smaller size range. A bimodal size distribution lrequently resuits, If a large product size and narrow distribution are required it is important to minimize secondary nucleation and the most effective way of doing this is usually to minimize the stirrer power input.</p>

Both natural and linear cooling result in sharp peaks in the concentration driving force (a), whereas the controlled cooling curve produces an almost constant level of supersaturation throughout the batch. The improvement in the product size distribution (b) is evideni.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Other crystallization methods</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The principles that have been outlined fox cooling crystallization can be applied to any other method of batch crystallization. In all cases the key is control of the supersaturation thoughout the batch by manipulating the rate at which supersaturation is produced. So. in evaporative crystallization, the evaporation rate vhould be very small at the start of the batch, gradually increasing as a greater crystal surface area develops. In drowning out crystallization the diluent should initially be added very slowly and gradually increased during the course of the batch.</p>
<p class="baindent">By making a number of simplifying assumptions the required equations for theqe different time profiles can be calculated (e.g. Tavare <i>et al</i>., 1980). In practice, it is not usually important that the exact form of the theoretical equation is followed. but rather that a reasonable approximation to the appropriate time profile is achieved. Final optimiration of the process is invariably achieved through subsequent experimentation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The population balance for batch crystallhation</span></h3>

Tavare, 1987) but it has proved to be of somewhat limited practical value, The partial differential equation (<a href="#eq8.18">8.18</a>) is not easy to solve and even more difficult is accurate specification of realistic initial and boundary conditions. Appropriate kinetic data, without which system-specific results cannot be obtained, are rarely available. Development of a useful description of the batch process has therefore generally focused on techniques to control the supersaturation as described above.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Practical operating factors in batch crystallization</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The need to minimize secondary nucleation has already been alluded to. Nienow (1976) has shown that this is best achieved by using a large slow-moving stirrer rather than a small high-speed device. Whatever the stirrer type employed, it is crucial that the crystals are kept in suspension: crystals that settle to the base of the vessel are no longer exposed to fresh supersaturated solution and tend to agglomerate. Many equations have been suggested for calculating the stirrer speed, <i>N<sub>js</sub></i>, required to just suspend crystals of a specific size, <i>L</i>. That suggested by Zweitering (1958) is probably the most satishctory:</p>
<p class="center" id="eq8.19" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page72-3.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(8.19)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">where <i>v</i> is the kinematic viscosity of the solution, <i>X</i> is the fraction of solids in the vessel, <i>D</i> is the stirrer diameter, <i>g</i> is the gravitational acceleration, <i>p<sub>l</sub></i> is the liquid density and <i>&#x0394;&#x03C1;</i> the difference in density between crystal and liquid. The value of the dimensionless constant <i>S</i> depends on the vessel geometry and values are given in a number of texts (e.g. Mullin, 1993).</p>
