<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:3em;">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> Why crystallization?</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Crystallization is a purification technique, a separation process and a branch of particle technology. It thus encompasses key areas of chemical and process engineering. It is a supramolecular process by which an ensemble of randomly organized molecules, ions or atoms in a fluid come together to form an ordered three-dimensional molecular array which we call a crystal. The formation and growth of crystals is thus also of fundamental scientific interest.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">When a crystal forms, something like 10<sup>20</sup> molecules come together in an array which is identical no matter where in the world the process takes place.</p>
</aside>
<p class="baindent">The power of crystallization arises from the reproducibility of this assembly process and the nature of crystals themselves. Because the constituent atoms, ions or molecules of a crystal are arranged in a regular infinite manner, crystal surfaces are highly discriminating. In general, they only allow similar molecular-scale growth units to attach themselves to the crystal lattice. As a result crystals are highly effective in their separating power.</p>
<p class="baindent">Many commonly encountered solid materials are crystalline&#x2014;sugar and salt, diamond and quartz, icicles and snowflakes. Other common materials may not be immediately recognizable as crystalline either because of their small size or, more often perhaps, because they form part of a composite material. Thus, cement contains crystalline calcium hydroxide and silicate; paints contain pigment crystals; most pharmaceutical materials are prepared in the crystalline state and subsequently ground to yield powders; washing powders are mixtures of crystalline carbonates, phosphates and perborates. Crystals that we encounter are not just man-made; eggs and mollusc shells are composed primarily of crystalline calcium carbonate, while bones and teeth are mainly calcium phosphates.</p>
<p class="baindent">The properties of crystals are often directionally dependent&#x2014;they are anisotropic. They grow and dissolve at different rates in different directions, their refractive indices vary with direction, and their thermal expansion coefficients and electrical conductivity are directionally dependent, as are their mechanical properties.</p>
<p class="baindent">Crystals can be almost any size from a few nanometres (active phases in catalysts), through submicrometre (pigments, pharmaceuticals, silver halides in photographic emulsions) up to several millimetres (salt, sugar and diamonds). Size is no indication of crystallinity. The production of crystals having sizes smaller than a few micrometres is traditionally referred to as <i>precipitation.</i></p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span> What do we need to know?</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Before we can understand the way in which crystallization processes work, we need to understand a number of different phenomena. An appreciation of the<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, 1 Introduction</a> underlying phase equilibrium is clearly important; we need to know what crystalline phases it is possible to produce under known conditions&#x2014;this is a question of thermodynamics. We must also understand issues surrounding the rates at which crystallization takes place&#x2014;here it is the kinetics of nucleation (the rate at which new crystals are formed) and of growth (the rate at which existing crystals grow) that are of greatest importance. Both of these kinetic events have their basis in molecular-level phenomena and this implies that we also need some understanding of solid state chemistry.</p>

</figure>
<p class="baindent">At the process level, control of crystal size and size distribution is important. Here we have to develop an understanding of population balances to set alongside the mass and energy balances that are written instinctively by chemical engineers. Finally, the process flows within the section of process plant where a crystallization is taking place must be known. Is the process batch or continuous? Is the system fully mixed with respect to the solution and the crystals or does the residence time distribution (RTD) of one or both of the phases differ from that corresponding to the fully mixed case? The answers to these questions depend on the nature of the process flows, and hence on the fluid/particle mechanics of the crystal suspension within the crystallizer.</p>
<p class="baindent">These various features form a framework that will guide the structure of this book (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). The interactions between the kinetics, the process flows within the crystallizer and the crystal size distribution are illustrated diagrammatically in <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> and the recognition of these interactions was the basis for the first rigorous process engineering description of crystallization (Randolph and Larson, 1988).</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span> What are crystals and how do we recognize them?</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Formally a solid is defined by the way in which its constituent atoms, ions or molecules are packed. If this packing is regular, forming an infinite three-<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, 1 Introduction</a>dimensional array, the material is said to be crystalline. There is long-range order. If no such infinite array exists, there is only short-range order and the material is classified as amorphous; glass and rubber are such examples.</p>

</figure>
<p class="baindent">The symmetry of the ordered array of molecules in a crystal (the lattice) is expressed by crystallographers as a <i>space group</i> which is a combination of symmetry operations that enables a complete crystal structure to be generated from a single (or group of) molecule(s), the asymmetric unit. One important consequence of the ordered packing of molecules in a crystal is that crystals have regular shapes. They grow as polyhedra, never as spheres, with the crystal shape being a characteristic of the material in question.</p>
<p class="baindent">For example, sodium chloride crystals are cubes, alum crystals are octahedral, and sulphur grows as needles. The symmetry inherent in the shape, or <i>morphology,</i> of a crystal reflects the underlying packing symmetry of the crystal lattice and is called the <i>point group symmetry.</i></p>

<p class="baindent">The molecular order inherent in crystals enables the identification of crystalline materials to be made by a number of specific techniques. Crystals larger than about 5 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m may be imaged directly in the optical microscope. Crystalline particles are often birefringent and hence may be identified by use of crossed polars when they appear as bright areas on a black background. Crystalline solids have well-defined melting points that may be measured to give an indication of crystallinity. As a result of their long-range order, crystalline solids demonstrate a further property which is the most important in characterizing crystallinity&#x2014;diffraction of X-rays and electrons. Chemists are familiar with using NMR, UV and IR spectroscopy to fingerprint single molecules; diffractograms, such as that in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>, give an equivalent fingerprint for a collection of molecules as they exist in a crystal.</p>


<p class="baindent">Often it is important to measure the size of crystals that have been produced. This can be done by a number of techniques. Laser diffraction,<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, 1 Introduction</a> sieving and electric zone sensing are commonly used for particles in the size range 1 to 2000 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m. Light scattering and electron microscopy are used for sizes from about 3 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m down to 3 nm.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">Crystal surfaces are smooth and planar (faceted). Although the relative facial areas may vary, within a sample of a given material the interfacial angles are constant.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> Book organization</b></h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">In this book we explore many of the issues surrounding the conditions under which crystals form in a system and the kinetic processes of nucleation and growth that give rise to crystalline materials. We then describe the factors that control commercially important parameters such as crystal morphology and crystal structure, as well as the development of processes for the control of crystal size. Finally, the importance of crystalline materials in formulated products such as pharmaceuticals and foods is described.<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, 1 Introduction</a></p>
