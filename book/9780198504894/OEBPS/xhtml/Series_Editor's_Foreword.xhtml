<p class="noindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions to topics commonly encountered in chemistry, and more recently, chemical engineering undergraduate courses. In the context of chemical engineering no such series would be complete without a Primer on crystallization. Quite apart from its industrial importance, crystallization provides an excellent example of how the skills and knowledge base of the chemist, materials scientist and chemical engineer can be brought together to design a product with the particular attributes required for its application. The shear diversity of products containing components that have been manufactured in crystalline form&#x2014;including, for example, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals&#x2014;also hints at the wide range in chemical knowledge required in this field and the importance of being able to produce such products to very exacting specification.</p>
<p class="indent">In this Primer, two international leaders in the field of crystallization&#x2014;Roger Davey and John Garside&#x2014;have worked together to produce a text which has drawn together the relevant chemistry and chemical engineering to show how, in the real world, molecular-scale science and chemical engineering process design are integrated to produce the crystalline materials we require in our everyday lives. This is a book that can be understood by both chemistry and chemical engineering undergraduates&#x2014;I hope both communities will read, learn and enjoy!</p>
