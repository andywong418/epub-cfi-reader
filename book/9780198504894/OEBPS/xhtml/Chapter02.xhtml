<p class="banoindent">In this chapter we look first at the use of the information available in phase diagrams to define the nature of the crystalline phase that will appear under a given set of conditions of temperature, pressure and composition. We then examine the nature of the driving force for crystallization processes and finally discuss some typical techniques used for preparing crystalline materials.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> The phase rule</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em;"><i>A phase</i> is defined as a homogeneous, physically distinct and mechanically separable portion of a system. Examples would be gases, pure liquids (melts), solids and solutions.</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Equilibrium</i> is a state of rest of a system. At constant temperature, <i>T,</i> pressure, <i>P,</i> and composition, <i>x,</i> the phases which comprise the equilibrium state will remain constant for infinite time. A change in <i>T, P</i> or <i>x</i> will change the equilibrium state. For a given <i>T, P</i> and <i>x</i> the same state of equilibrium is reached, no matter how it is approached.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;width:100%;">The solubility of sodium chloride in water is shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Figs 2.1</a> and <a href="#fig2.3">2.3</a>. The solubility represents the maximum concentration of this salt that can be dissolved at any temperature. If a solution saturated at 40&#x00B0; C were allowed to cool to 30&#x00B0; C then NaCl would crystallize until the solution phase composition reached its equilibrium value, 36.1g NaCl per 100 g H<sub>2</sub>0, at this temperature.</p>
</aside>
<p class="baindent">As an example consider sodium chloride crystals and water. If excess sodium chloride is shaken with water at 30&#x00B0; C the equilibrium composition of the solution phase will be 36.1 g NaCl per 100 g H<sub>2</sub>O. This is the solubility of sodium chloride in water at 30&#x00B0;C. If the composition of the water were changed by adding hydrochloric acid (HC1) at 30&#x00B0;C then the equilibrium NaCl content of the solution would fall to a value that depends on the HC1 level in the water. This decrease would be governed by the constancy of the <i>solubility product,</i></p>
<p class="center" style="width:70%;"><i>K<sub>sp</sub></i> = <i>a<sub>Na</sub></i>+<i>a<sub>Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup></sub></i> <span class="eq" style="text-align:right;">(2.1)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="banoindent">where <i>a</i> is the ionic activity.</p>
<p class="baindent">For a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride in contact with solid salt the <i>number of phases</i> is three: solid NaCl, aqueous solution and vapour. There are two <i>constituents</i> of the system: salt and water. The composition of any phase can be expressed in terms of NaCl and H<sub>2</sub>O and hence there are two <i>components</i> in the system. The number of components is the minimum number of chemical compounds (constituents) required to express the composition of any phase.</p>
<p class="baindent">Every system has a <i>number of degrees of freedom,</i> which is the number of the variables (temperature, pressure and composition) that must be fixed in order to specify an equilibrium state. In 1876, Gibbs showed that the<a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> relationship between the number of phases, P, number of components, C, and degrees of freedom, F, is</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:-0em;">P + F = C + 2.</p>
<p class="banoindent">This is known as the <i>phase rule.</i></p>
<p class="baindent">The phase rule tells us under which conditions certain systems can be in equilibrium. For example, in a one-component system such as H<sub>2</sub>0, the phase rule tells us that for the three phases steam, water and ice to coexist at equilibrium,</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;width:100%;">It is worth noting that for some elements and compounds it is possible to prepare two or more different crystai structures so that irom one molecule we can crystailize at least two different materials. Wellknown examples of this phenomenon are graphite and diamond which are different forms of carbon, and calcite, aragonite and vaterite which are all calcium carbonate. This is known as <i>polymorphism</i> and is so important that we have devoted the whole of <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> to this topic.</p>
</aside>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;">F = 1 + 2 &#x2013; 3 = 0.</p>
<p class="banoindent">Thus there are no degrees of freedom and so equilibrium can only exist at one temperature and pressure.</p>
<p class="baindent">If equilibrium is established between a solid and a solution (e.g. NaCl crystals and water) then the solution becomes saturated and there are two components and three phases (solid, liquid and vapour), hence:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:-0em;">F = 2 + 2 &#x2013; 3 = 1.</p>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:0.5em;">By specifying any one of the variables <i>T,</i> vapour pressure or jc(solution), an equilibrium state is defined. If the value of one of these variables is changed, a new equilibrium state will be reached. This is reflected, for example, in the sodium chloride-water solubility curve shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. Thus the phase rule may be used in a qualitative way to describe and define equilibrium states. Measured data on the relation between <i>T, P, x</i> and the crystal structure of solid phases are always required for specific systems and are usually represented on a <i>phase diagram.</i></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Solubility curves</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Returning to the NaCl/H<sub>2</sub>0 example it is possible, by experiment, to determine the composition of saturated aqueous solutions in contact with solid salt at any temperature. When these data points are plotted as solubility versus temperature, the solubility curve is produced. For NaCl the solubility in water is almost independent of temperature. For other materials the solubility may be a strongly increasing function of temperature as in the case of sucrose or citric acid. These examples are shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>.</p>
<p class="baindent">Conceptually, creating a solution from a solid and a solvent may be considered in a number of stages:</p>
<p class="baindent">1. melt the solid;</p>
<p class="baindent">2. mix the molten solid with solvent;</p>
<p class="baindent">3. allow to become homogeneous.</p>
<p class="baindent">In some systems, defined as <i>ideal,</i> the only enthalpy change involved in this process is that for melting the solid. Then the solubility, <i>x<sub>eq</sub></i> is given by:</p>

<p class="banoindent">In other systems the mixing process is accompanied by considerable change in enthalpy due to solvent-solute interactions; such solutions are <i>non-ideal.</i></p>
<p class="baindent">The variation of solubility with temperature is often described by an equation based on 2.2 but using empirical constants <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> fitted from experimental data:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><img src="../images/page8-3.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="eq">(2.3)</span></p>

<p class="baindent">A compilation of data in this form for inorganic two-component systems is given by Broul <i>et al</i> (1981). As an alternative an empirical power law equation of the form</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>c<sub>eq</sub></i> = <i>A</i> + <i>B&#x03B8;</i> + <i>C&#x03B8;</i><sup>2</sup> + &#x2026; <span class="eq">(2.4)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">is often used where <i>c<sub>eq</sub></i> is the solubility, <i>&#x03B8;</i> is the temperature (&#x00B0;C) and <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, etc. are fitted constants.</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:-2em;">F = 2 + 2 &#x2013; 4 = 0.</p>
<p class="baindent" style="margin-top:0.5em;">If in the NaCl/H<sub>2</sub>O system measurements are made below 0&#x00B0;C, then the equilibrium solution compositions are found to lie on a second solubility curve as shown in <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. Analysis of the solid phase present (by X-ray diffraction for example) would indicate that a hydrate, NaC1.2H<sub>2</sub>0, has formed. The line DC is the solubility curve of anhydrous NaCl and CB that of the dihydrate. At the point C the solution is saturated with respect to both of the solid constituents. Thus the system of two components exists in four phases&#x2014;two solid phases, a solution and a vapour&#x2014;and so<a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> The system has no degrees of freedom and therefore it is not possible to change any variable and retain equilibrium. By introducing an extra component, say HC1, then a degree of freedom may be introduced so that if the composition is changed the equilibrium point C will move to a different temperature, while if the temperature is changed it will adopt a new composition. It is clear from this type of phase diagram that NaCl may be crystallized at temperatures above 0&#x00B0;C while NaCl&#x00B7;2H<sub>2</sub>O crystallizes at lower temperatures. The point C is called a <i>transition point.</i></p>
<p class="baindent">Finally we note, again using the sodium chloride example, that solubility may also be varied by adding a third component in the form of a miscible cosolvent. Now the phase rule tells us that such a system (NaCl, water and, say, acetone) has two degrees of freedom. The equilibrium position could be changed either by a change in temperature or composition. It is common for the crystallization of organic molecules to be achieved by such a reduction in solubility, a process often referred to as <i>drowning out.</i></p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Eutectic systems</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The solubility curves of <a href="#fig2.1">Figs 2.1</a> to <a href="#fig2.3">2.3</a> are regions of much larger phase diagrams in which the composition of the two components varies continuously from pure &#x2018;solvent&#x2019; to pure &#x2018;solute&#x2019;. In the case of solubility the term solvent is used to describe the component which is in excess. Such a distinction between solvent and solute becomes meaningless in the extended diagram; instead we shall refer to components A and B with melting points <i>T</i><sub>A</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>B</sub> with <i>T</i><sub>B</sub> &#x003E; <i>T</i><sub>A</sub>.</p>
<p class="baindent">A phase diagram may be constructed for this system by making a range of two-component (A and B) mixtures and measuring either their melting temperatures or the temperatures at which B just dissolves or at which A just crystallizes.</p>
<p class="baindent"><a href="#fig2.5">Figure 2.5</a> is a generic diagram of this sort. The line BC corresponds to solutions of B in A while the line AC corresponds to solutions of Ain B. Their point of intersection, C, is the <i>eutectic</i> point. Along the line AC pure A is in equilibrium with A/B liquid, along BC pure B is in equilibrium with A/B liquid, while at point C solid A, solid B, liquid of composition C and vapour are in equilibrium. This means that at C there are no degrees of freedom and hence the eutectic temperature and composition are fixed. In a three-component system the eutectic temperature varies with composition.</p>
<p class="baindent">The line ACB is referred to as the liquidus since it gives the equilibrium composition of the liquid phase. The line ADCEB is the solidus since it gives the composition of the corresponding solid phase. Thus, for example, the point M represents a mixture of solid A (composition S) and liquid of composition L. Examples of this type of system are gold/thallium, naphthalene/benzene, <i>meta-</i> and <i>para-</i> nitrochlorobenzene and KCI/H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p class="baindent">From the point of view of crystallization it is important to appreciate that in a eutectic system, while it is possible to crystallize pure components from an impure mixture in a single step, the maximum yield achievable is limited by the existence of the eutectic point. <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a></p>

<p class="banoindent">In some systems the two components can co-crystallize either as a <i>compound</i> as in the case of water and salt in NaC1.2H<sub>2</sub>0 or as a <i>solid solution</i> as with NaCl and NaBr or naphthalene and <i>&#x03B2;</i>-naphthol. In such systems it is never possible to crystallize pure components in a single step. The reason for this is clear from <a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>, which is a typical phase diagram for such a two-component mixture.</p>
<p class="baindent">Consider the liquid of composition M. On cooling along MN the point L is reached at which solid of composition S is precipitated. Further cooling creates more solid solution, whose composition changes progressively along SS<i>&#x0027;</i>, in contact with liquids of compositions lying along LL<i>&#x0027;</i>. The last solid to form has composition S<i>&#x0027;</i> and the remaining liquid a composition L<i>&#x0027;</i>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The importance of phase diagrams</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The guidance of the phase rule and the availability of phase diagrams are important adjuncts to the development of crystallization processes. They provide vital data on the possible phases crystallizing, the likely process yields and the number of variables that may be utilized to control a process. Where no data are available for a specific product, the measurement of solubility and heats and temperatures of melting will be an important first phase of development work.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span> The driving force for crystallization</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.8em;">Crystallization is a kinetic process and traditionally chemists are familiar with the use of reagent concentration to describe the driving force for the chemical<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> rate processes. However, in the case of crystallization the concentration range over which the process can occur is limited by the equilibrium composition of the system corresponding to the conditions chosen.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;">In the 19th century the Nobel prize-winning physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald was a major investigator of crystallization phenomena. He discovered that at comparatively low supersaturations, although existing crystals will grow, it is difficult to create new crystals. Once some critical level of supersaturation is exceeded, new crystals form spontaneously and the solution is now <i>labile.</i> The region (see <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>) between equilibrium and labile states is called the <i>metastable</i> zone. Its width depends on the ease of production of new crystals and so is determined by kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="baindent"><a href="#fig2.7">Figure 2.7</a> shows a hypothetical solubility curve. A solution whose composition lies below the solubility curve is <i>unl-tersaturated</i> and existing crystals will dissolve. A solution lying above the solubility curve is termed <i>supersaturated,</i> since the amount of dissolved solute is greater than the equilibrium saturation value. Crystals can nucleate and grow only if the<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> solution is supersaturated and so the production of a supersaturated solution is a prerequisite for crystallization. It is this supersaturation, expressed by comparing the actual to the equilibrium composition, which drives the crystallization process.</p>

<p class="baindent">Formally the supersaturation, <i>&#x03C3;</i>, can be defined in thermodynamic terms as the dimensionless difference in chemical potential between a molecule in an equilibrium state, <i>&#x03BC;<sub>eq</sub></i>, and a molecule in its supersaturated state, <i>&#x03BC;<sub>ss</sub></i>:</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>&#x03C3;</i> = (<i>&#x03BC;<sub>ss</sub></i> &#x2013; <i>&#x03BC;<sub>eq</sub></i>/<i>kT</i>. <span class="eq">(2.5)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">Using the Gibbs-Duhem equation these chemical potentials may be related to solute activities or compositions to give</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>&#x03C3;</i> = ln(<i>a<sub>ss</sub></i>/<i>a<sub>eq</sub></i>) <span class="eq">(2.6)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">in which <i>a</i> is the activity. For an ideal solution or one in which the activity coefficient is independent of concentration, this reduces to</p>
<p class="center" id="eq2.7" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>&#x03C3;</i> = ln(<i>x<sub>ss</sub></i>/<i>x<sub>eq</sub></i>) &#x2248; (<i>x<sub>ss</sub></i> &#x2013; <i>x<sub>eq</sub></i>)/<i>x<sub>eq</sub></i> <span class="eq">(2.7)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">where the approximation is valid for small values of (<i>x<sub>ss</sub></i> &#x2013; <i>x<sub>eq</sub></i>).</p>
<p class="baindent">Chemical engineers, who are predominantly interested in overall yield, often dispense with the use of mole fraction and with the denominator, <i>x<sub>eq</sub></i>, and write the supersaturation as</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:0em;">&#x0394;<i>c</i> = <i>c<sub>ss</sub></i> &#x2013; <i>c<sub>eq</sub></i> <span class="eq">(2.8)</span></p>
<p class="banoindent">with <i>c</i> in some appropriate concentration units. This is usually known as the <i>concentratiorz driving force.</i></p>
<p class="baindent">When crystallization takes place from the melt, in for example a eutectic system, the supersaturation can be conveniently written in terms of the temperature to give the undercooling &#x0394;<i>T</i>. This can be converted into a thermodynamically precise expression by use of the heat of fusion when</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> Crystallization techniques</h2>
<p class="banoindent">The process stage that precedes crystallization is often a chemical reaction. This may be a single-step reaction (e.g. oxidation of paraxylene to yield terephthalic acid or the reaction of onia and carbon dioxide to fom urea) or it may be the final stage in a complex sequence of chemical reactions as in pharmaceutical or agrochemical production. Whatever the process, the product required generally goes forward to the crystallization either in solution or as an impure liquid above its melting point. This situation has led to the development of two major crystallization techniques.</p>
<p class="baindent">The first of these relies on crystallization from solutions and is normally referred to as <i>suspension crystalli,-ation,</i> while the second is concerned with <i>solidification of melts</i> and may take the form of either progressive freezing or of solidification of droplets (spray drying or prilling). Both types of process<a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> can be operated either continuously or batchwise depending on the product involved. Commodity materials (such as sodium chloride. paraxylene, ammonium nitrate, urea and adipic acid) are produced in high tonnages and production costs are minimized by continuous production in customized plant. Speciality chemicals. on the other hand, are produced in low tonnages using flexible batch processes. The high added value that these materials command in the market means that production costs can be considerably higher than for commodity products.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Suspension processes</span></h3>
<p class="baindent">Given a solution containing the required product. the mode of crystallization will depend on the yield required and the phase diagram. Referring again to <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>, if the starting composition of this solution is <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> then clearly it can be brought into the supersaturated region either by cooling (path a) or by solvent evaporation (path b). In either case, once supersaturated the solution will crystallize and the solution composition will fall to the composition specified by the equilibrium solubility. Further crystallization can be achieved by additional cooling, evaporation, or both.</p>
<p class="baindent">The slope of the solubility curve largely determines the most suitable method of crystallization. If the solubility varies significantly with temperature, then crystallization by cooling is likely to be a suitable method since a good crystal yield will be obtained by a modest temperature decrease. If, on the other hand, the solubility is relatively insensitive to temperature, as with sodium chloride, even a large decrease in temperature will produce a poor yield and evaporation of solvent would bc a preferred technique. In this case the yield will be determined by the solubility of the product at the lowest temperature. In a continuous process this will be unimportant since recycling of liquor streams can take place. For batch processes yields are often maximized by changing the absolute solubility of a product either through the addition of non-solvent (drowning out) or by crystallization of a salt with low solubility.</p>
<p class="baindent">Suspension crystallization processes are operated to produce particulate materials in appropriate yields and having desired physical characteristics. In subsequent chapters it will become apparent how combinations of equipment design, temperature and supersaturation control, and addition of specific additives, can be used to give specific crystal size distributions, crystal shapes, crystal purities and crystal structures.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Solidification processes</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">If the product of a chemical reaction is a liquid above its melting point (i.e. a melt) two major techniques are available for conversion to a solid. The largest scale process has been developed in the fertilizer industry for transformation of ammonium nitrate and urea melts into spherical particles (prills) suitable for application to arable land. Molten material is sprayed from the top of a tower in the form of millimetre-sized drops. These cool below their melting point as they fall, so solidifying in flight to give solid particles by the time they reach the base of the tower. Each droplet can be thought of as a micro-crystallizer in<a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, 2 Phase equilibria and crystallization techniques</a> which the melt transforms to a solid sphere comprising many small crystals as illustrated in <a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. No purification can be achieved in this process.</p>

</figure>
</aside>

<p class="baindent">If purification is required then progressive freezing may be used. In this case a cooled surface is placed in contact with the melt and, if the surface temperature is below the melting point, a layer of solid will form at the surface. This layer will grow provided heat is removed at the cooled surface. In a eutectic system a single pure component may be crystallized according to the phase diagram (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). In a system forming a solid solution (<a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>) such a solidification process will have to be repeated a number of times in order to move the solid phase composition towards that of the pure component. This is often termed fractional crystallization. In both these cases the product solid is eventually melted off the cooling surfaces to yield a pure liquid which would then be flaked, pastelled or spray cooled if the product were required in solid form.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span> Final remarks</h2>
<p class="banoindent" style="margin-top:-0.8em;">In order to define a crystallization strategy we must be able to specify</p>
<p class="baindent">(a) the desirable physical characteristics of the product,</p>
<p class="baindent">(b) the phase diagram for the crystallizing system, and</p>
<p class="baindent">(c) the likely scale of production.</p>
<p class="baindent">When particulate characteristics are of highest importance a suspension crystallization process is preferable. If purity is an important aspect then either melt solidification or suspension crystallization may be appropriate. The operation of these processes depends on the generation of supersaturation, the appropriate design of equipment and the economics of the product.</p>
