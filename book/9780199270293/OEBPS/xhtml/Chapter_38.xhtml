<h3 class="maxh3">Diazomethane makes methyl esters from carboxylic acids</h3>

<p class="maxnoindentl">Conveniently, solutions containing diazomethane are yellow, so the reaction is <b>self-titrating</b>&#8212; as the carboxylic acid reacts, the yellow diazomethane is removed, but as long as excess diazomethane remains the yellow colour persists.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Diazomethane methylation is a good way of making methyl esters from carboxylic acids on a small scale because yields are excellent and the only by-product is nitrogen. However, there is a drawback: diazomethane has a boiling point of &#8211;24 &#176;C, and it is a toxic and highly explosive gas. It therefore has to be used in solution, usually in ether; the solution must be dilute, because concentrated solutions of diazomethane are also explosive. It is usually produced by reaction of <i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N</i>-nitrosourea or <i>N</i>-methyl<i>-N</i>-nitrosotoluenesulfonamide with base, and distilled out of that reaction mixture as an azeotrope with ether, straight into a solution of the carboxylic acid.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta">Chemists studying the hormone degradation products present in the urine of pregnant women needed to methylate the phenolic hydroxyl group of the steroid oestriol. By using diazomethane, they avoided reaction at the two other hydroxylic groups. When, subsequently, they did want to methylate the other two hydroxyl groups, they had to add acid (HBF<sub>4</sub>) to the reaction to protonate the diazomethane.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">The best evidence for the existence of carbenes comes from a group of structures which contain a carbene but are stable compounds. The most important of these are known as the &#8216;<i>N</i>-heterocyclic carbenes&#8217;&#8212;the carbene is incorporated into a five-membered ring and stabilized by the presence of two adjacent electron-donating nitrogen atoms and the bulky <i>N</i>-substituents. The example below was first made in 1991: it is crystalline, and its X-ray crystal shows the bond angle at the carbene carbon to be 102&#176;, and 13C NMR confirms that the carbene C atom is electron deficient. We will come back to the significance of this later.</p>

<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> You may be somewhat surprised that the structure of carbenes can be investigated by ESR&#8212;after all, we explained in <a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> that ESR observes unpaired electrons, and you might expect the six valence electrons of a carbene all to be paired. Indeed, in some carbenes they are, but in many they are not. This is an important point, and we will discuss it further later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">These stable carbenes are very much the exception: most carbenes are too reactive to be isolated. Reactive carbenes can, however, be observed by irradiating precursors (often diazo compounds like diazomethane, which we have just been discussing) trapped in frozen argon at very low temperatures (less than 77 K). IR and ESR spectroscopy (see p. <a href="chapter_37.xhtml#page_975">975</a>) can then be used to determine their structure.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The problem with many of these reactions is that they require strong bases&#8212;either the organometallic compound itself is basic or a base must be used to create the carbanion. Carbenes are so unstable that they must be formed in the presence of the compound they are intended to react with, and this can be a problem if that compound is base-sensitive. For dichlorocarbene, a way round the problem is to make the carbanion by losing CO<sub>2</sub> instead of a metal or a proton. Decarboxylation of sodium trichloroacetate is ideal as it happens at about 80 &#176;C in solution.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Carbene formation by deprotonation of a cation</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Our final method is in some ways the most straightforward in terms of mechanism: simple removal of a proton from a stable cation. This is the method used to make very stable carbenes, and it works because both the cation used as the starting material and the carbene product are stabilized by one or more adjacent lone pairs. Here is an example. Imidazoles are nucleophilic, and can be alkylated to give relatively stable imidazolium cations, which we can represent with the charge delocalized between the two nitrogen atoms, although there is another possible representation with the charge on carbon.</p>

A close look at the central carbon shows, however, that it has only two substituents&#8212;it is a carbene. Carbenes with adjacent lone pairs can often be thought of in this way, the lone pair partially delocalized onto the C atom to help stabilize the electron-deficient carbene.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Spectroscopic investigations of a number of carbenes of differing structures have shown that they fall broadly into two groups: (1) those (which you will learn to call &#8216;triplets&#8217;) that ESR spectroscopy demonstrates have unpaired electrons and whose bond angles are 130&#8211;150&#176; and (2) those (like the stable crystalline carbene above, and which you will learn to call &#8216;singlets&#8217;) that have bond angles of 100&#8211;110&#176; but cannot be observed by ESR.

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">All these observations can be accounted for by considering the electronic structure of a carbene. Carbenes have two-coordinate carbon atoms: you might therefore expect them to have a linear (diagonal) structure&#8212;like that of an alkyne&#8212;with an sp hybridized carbon atom.<a class="page" id="page_1011">Page 1011, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a></p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Such a linear carbene would have six electrons to distribute amongst two &#963; orbitals and two (higher-energy) p orbitals. The two electrons in the degenerate p orbitals would remain unpaired because of electron repulsion in the same way as in molecular oxygen &#8226;O&#8211;O&#8226;.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1011-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Yet few carbenes are linear: most are bent, with bond angles between 100&#176; and 150&#176;, suggesting a trigonal (sp2) hybridization state. An sp2 hybridized carbene would have three (lower-energy) sp2 orbitals and one (high-energy) p orbital in which to distribute its six electrons. There are two ways of doing this. Either all of the electrons can be paired, with each pair occupying one of the sp2 orbitals, or two of the electrons can remain unpaired, with one electron in each of the p orbitals and one of the sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In the table on p. <a href="chapter_38.xhtml#page_1010">1010</a> we saw that the substituents on the carbene affect which of the two classes (which we now call singlet and triplet) it falls into. Why? All carbenes have the potential to exist in either the singlet or the triplet state, so what we mean when we say that a carbene such as :CH<sub>2</sub> is a &#8216;triplet carbene&#8217; is that the triplet state for this carbene is lower in energy than the singlet state. The opposite is true for :CCl<sub>2</sub>. Most type of carbenes are more stable as triplets because the energy to be gained by bringing the electron in the p orbital down into the sp2 orbital is insufficient to overcome the repulsion that exists between two electrons in a single orbital.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">For most triplet carbenes the singlet spin state that would arise by pairing up the two electrons lies only about 40 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> above the ground (triplet) state: in other words, 40 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is required to pair up the two electrons.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Carbenes that have singlet ground states (such as :CCl<sub>2</sub>) all have electron-rich substituents carrying lone pairs adjacent to the carbene centre. These lone pairs can interact with the p orbital of the carbene to produce a new, lower-energy orbital which the two electrons occupy. This stabilization of the lone pair provides the incentive that the electron in the p orbital needs to pair up in the sp<sup>2</sup> orbital.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This interaction corresponds to the point we made above about adjacent lone pairs stabilizing carbenes via the delocalization shown in the margin, As these arrows suggest, carbenes that have heavily electron-donating substituents are less electrophilic than other carbenes: indeed, diamino carbenes can be quite nucleophilic. The division of carbenes into two types explains <a class="page" id="page_1013">Page 1013, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a>their structure. It also helps to explain some of their reactions, especially those that have a stereochemical implication. We will spend the rest of this chapter discussing how carbenes react.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">The structure of carbenes depends on how they are made</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">So far we have considered only the most stable possible structure, singlet or triplet, of a given carbene. In reality, a carbene will be formed in a chemical reaction and may well be formed as the less stable of the alternatives. If a reaction occurs by an ionic mechanism on a molecule with all electrons paired (as most molecules are!) then it must be formed as a singlet. Follow the &#945; elimination mechanism, for example.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1013-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The starting material, a molecule of chloroform CHCl<sub>3</sub>, has all paired electrons. The C&#8211;H &#963; bond breaks and the two paired electrons from it form the lone pair of the carbanion. The carbanion also has all paired electrons. The two paired electrons of one of the C&#8211;Cl bonds leaves the carbanion and the carbene is formed. It has two paired electrons in each of the two remaining C&#8211;Cl bonds and the lone pair, also paired. It is formed as a singlet. As it happens, the singlet version of CCl<sub>2</sub> is also the more stable. But if the carbene were instead CH<sub>2</sub> and if it reacted rapidly, it might not have a chance to change into the more stable triplet state. Since carbenes are very reactive, this question can be important. In explaining their reactions in the next section we shall need to consider:</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Carbenes are desperate to find another pair of electrons with which to complete their valence shell of electrons. In this respect they are like carbocations. Like carbocations, they are electro philic but, unlike carbocations, they are uncharged. This has consequences for the type of nucleophiles carbenes choose to react with. Carbocations attack nucleophiles with high charge density&#8212;those carrying a negative or partial negative charge (think of the type of nucleophiles that will take part in S<sub>N</sub>1 or Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions). Carbenes, on the other hand, attack compounds we&#8217;d normally never consider as nucleophiles&#8212;even simple alkanes&#8212;by taking electrons from their HOMO. Of course, a carbocation will usually react with the HOMO of a molecule, but it will be much more selective about which HOMOs will do&#8212;usually these have to be lone pairs or electron-rich alkenes. For carbenes, any HOMO will do&#8212;a lone pair, a C=C double bond (electron-rich or -poor), or even a C&#8211;H bond.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">As you will see (and as we generalized at the beginning of the chapter), many of these reactions can be considered as insertion reactions&#8212;overall the carbene appears to have found a bond and inserted itself in the middle of it. It&#8217;s important to remember that the term &#8216;insertion&#8217; describes the overall consequence of the reaction, but isn&#8217;t always an accurate description of the reaction&#8217;s mechanism.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3" style="width:70%;">Carbenes react with alkenes to give cyclopropanes</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">This reaction is the most important way of making cyclopropanes, and is probably the most important reaction of carbenes. The mechanism of this type of reaction (an example is shown in the margin) depends on whether the carbene is a singlet or a triplet, and the outcome of the reaction can provide our first chemical test of the conclusions we came to in the <a class="page" id="page_1014">Page 1014, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a>previous section. Singlet carbenes, like this one here (remember that substituents with lone pairs stabilize the singlet spin state) can add to alkenes in an entirely concerted manner: the curly arrows for the process can be written as shown in the margin.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Because the process is concerted, we expect that the geometry of the alkene should be preserved in the product&#8212;the reaction ought to be <i>stereospecific</i>. The two examples below show that this is indeed the case. It is more impressive that the <i>Z</i> alkene gives the <i>cis</i>-cyclopropane as this is less stable than the <i>trans</i>-cyclopropane and would change to <i>E</i> if it could.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The alkene insertion reaction is stereospecific only for singlet carbenes. For triplet carbenes, the reaction is non-stereospecific. In the example below, a triplet carbene gives a mixture of cyclopropane diastereosiomers from a pure <i>Z</i> alkene.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mechanism of the reaction must be different with a triplet carbene. In fact, a concerted reaction is impossible for triplet carbenes because of the spins of the electrons involved. The spins of a triplet carbene aren&#8217;t paired, so once the carbene has added to the alkene in a radical reaction, the diradical (triplet) intermediate must wait until one of the spins inverts (&#8216;flips&#8217;) before the second C&#8211;C bond can be formed with paired electrons.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Spin-flipping, which can occur only through collision with another molecule (of solvent usually), is relatively slow on the time-scale of molecular rotations and, by the time the electrons are in a fit state to pair up, the stereochemistry of the starting material has been scrambled by free rotation in the intermediate.</p>

When a carbene forms by &#945; elimination, say, from a molecule with all electrons paired, it must be formed as the singlet, whether or not the triplet state is lower in energy. Only later may the carbene undergo spin-flipping to the triplet state. Since most carbene reactions are very rapid, this means that carbenes that are known to have triplet ground states may, in fact, react in their first-formed singlet state because they don&#8217;t have time to spin-flip to the triplet. This is true for :CH<sub>2</sub> produced from CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, which adds stereospecifically to double bonds because it is formed as a singlet and because the singlet state is more reactive than the triplet.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta">If the reaction is diluted with a large amount of an inert solvent such as C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> (perfluoropropane) then :CH<sub>2</sub> undergoes more collisions before it reacts and so the chances of spin-flipping of singlet :CH<sub>2</sub> to triplet :CH<sub>2</sub> is increased. Addition to alkenes is then less stereospecific.</p>
<figure style="width:1000%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1015-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">Stereospecificity (or lack of it) in the addition of a carbene to an alkene can be a good test of whether the carbene reacts as a singlet or triplet: lack of stereospecificity in a carbene addition almost certainly indicates that a triplet carbene is involved, but the fact that an addition is stereospecific doesn&#8217;t mean that the carbene must be a singlet. In some cases, bond rotation may be quite slow, and spin-flipping rapid, leading to stereospecific addition. Notice that in this example the less stable cis (Z) alkene was used: the reaction will give the less encumbered trans-cyclopropane if it can.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The addition of a triplet carbene to an alkene can be considered to be rather like a radical addition to a double bond.

We might consider the empty p orbital of the carbene (LUMO) interacting with the &#960; bond (HOMO) of the alkene or the lone pair of the carbene in its filled sp2 orbital (HOMO) interacting with the &#960;<i>*</i> antibonding orbital of the alkene (LUMO).</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You can immediately see that there is a problem when we try to interact these orbitals constructively to build two new bonds&#8212;direct approach of the carbene to the alkene is impos sible because there is always an antibonding interaction. Two new bonds can be formed, however, if the carbene approaches the alkene in a &#8216;sideways-on&#8217; manner.<a class="page" id="page_1016">Page 1016, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Some of the evidence for this comes from a reaction that not only throws light on to the mechanism of Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanations, but makes them of even greater value in synthesis. When an allylic alcohol is cyclopropanated, the new methylene group adds stereo-selectively to the same face of the double bond as the hydroxyl group.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Allylic alcohols are also cyclopropanated over 100 times faster than their unfunctionalized alkene equivalents. Coordination between the zinc atom and the hydroxyl group in the transition state explains both the stereoselectivity and the rate increase. Unfortunately, while the Simmons&#8211;Smith reaction works well when a methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) group is being transferred, it is less good with substituted methylene groups (RCH: or R<sub>2</sub>C:).</p>

The diene in the starting material is more nucleophilic (has a higher energy HOMO; see <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) than the single alkene in the product, so the reaction can be stopped after one carbene addition.<a class="page" id="page_1018">Page 1018, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a></p>

<p class="maxnoindenta">Before we leave this section on cyclopropanes, we want you to take a step back from simply thinking about carbenes, and consider the types of reagents that form three-membered rings generally. They all have something in common, which we could call &#8216;-enoid&#8217; character. Cyclopropanes form when a carbene (which, in the singlet state, has an empty, electrophilic p orbital and a full, nominally nucleophilic sp2 orbital) attacks alkenes. The Simmons&#8211;Smith carbenoid is not a carbene, but nonetheless has a carbon atom with joint nucleophilic (alkyl zinc) and electrophilic (alkyl iodide) character. When you think about it, the same is true for peracid epoxidation, which forms the oxygen analogue of a cyclopropane by attacking an alkene using an oxygen atom bearing both a lone pair (nucleophilic) and a carboxylate leaving group (electrophilic). It&#8217;s an &#8216;oxenoid&#8217;. In <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> you met other reagents that form cyclopropanes and epoxides by transferring CH<sub>2</sub>&#8212;sulfonium ylids.

When primary alkyl halides are treated with base, alkenes are formed by elimination. Having read <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, you should expect <a class="page" id="page_1019">Page 1019, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a>the mechanism of this elimination to be E2 and, if you started with a deuterated compound like this, the alkene product would be labelled with two deuterium atoms at its terminus.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Evidently a hydrogen atom has &#8216;migrated&#8217; from the 2-position to the 1-position. The overall mechanism of the elimination with very strong bases like phenylsodium is thought to be: (1) formation of a carbene by &#945; elimination and then (2) 1,2-migration of a hydrogen atom on to the carbene centre. Carbenes with &#946; hydrogens undergo extremely rapid 1,2-migration of hydrogen to the carbene centre, giving alkenes.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The reason for the rapid migration is that the electrophilic carbene has found a nearby source of electrons&#8212;the HOMO of the C&#8211;H bond&#8212;and it has grabbed the electrons for itself, &#8216;inserting&#8217; into the C&#8211;H bond, as shown in the margin.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This type of reaction is better demonstrated by two examples in which the &#8216;insertion reaction&#8217; is a bit more obvious: when there are no &#946; hydrogens, the carbene inserts into C&#8211;H bonds a little further away in the same molecule or even in the solvent (cyclohexane in the second example). In the first case, the carbene is formed by &#945; elimination (using one of the &#8216;Schlosser bases&#8217;, see p. <a href="chapter_38.xhtml#page_1008">1008</a>) and, in the second case, by photolysis of a diazoketone.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">Two groups of chemists, within one year of each other, published syntheses of this compound using rhodium-promoted carbene insertions into C&#8211;H bonds. Cane&#8217;s insertion reaction (route 1) proceeds stereospecifically with retention of stereochemistry. This is excellent evidence for a concerted singlet carbene reaction. In Taber&#8217;s synthesis, the carbene inserts into the six-membered tetrahydropyran ring selectively to give the less strained 5,5-trans ring junction.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In these C&#8211;H insertion reactions, the similarity with cyclopropane formation by insertion into alkenes is clear, and the mechanisms mirror one another quite closely. As with the cyclopropanation reactions, the mechanism depends on whether the carbene is a singlet or triplet. Singlet carbenes can insert in a concerted manner, with the orbitals overlapping constructively provided the carbene approaches side-on.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1020-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This mechanism implies that, if the C&#8211;H bond is at a stereogenic centre, the stereochemistry at that centre will be retained through the reaction, as in Cane&#8217;s synthesis of pentalenolactone (see box above). A nice example of this result is this ingenious synthesis of &#945;-cuparenone using a stereospecific carbene insertion.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> In principle, triplet carbene insertions should follow a two-step radical pathway analogous to their insertion into alkenes. However, very few triplet carbene insertions into C&#8211;H bonds have been observed, and the stereochemical consequence of the two-step mechanism (which should result in mixtures of stereoisomers on insertion into a C&#8211;H bond at a stereogenic centre) has never been verified.</p>

A common strategy for preventing insect damage in agriculture is to lure the weevils into a trap using synthetic versions of their own sex pheromones, and chemists soon showed that it was an easy matter to synthesize a related ester by a conjugate addition of an organocopper derivative (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>) and then alkylation of an ester enolate (<a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).

<h3 class="maxh3">Nitrenes are the nitrogen analogues of carbenes</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">The Wolff rearrangement has some important cousins that we must now introduce to you&#8212; they deserve a mention because they bear a family likeness even though they do not, in fact, involve carbenes. They are a group of reactions that proceed through an intermediate <i>nitrene</i>&#8212; the nitrogen analogue of a carbene. The simplest to understand, because it is the direct nitrogen analogue of the Wolff rearrangement, is the Curtius rearrangement. It starts with an acyl azide, which can be made by nucleophilic substitution on an acyl chloride by sodium azide. The acyl azide is what you would get if you just replaced the &#8211;CH=N<sub>2</sub> of a diazoketone with &#8211;N=N<sub>2</sub>. And, if you heat it, it is not surprising that it decomposes to release nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), forming the nitrene. The nitrene N has only one bond and has two lone pairs, making six electrons in all, like a carbene.</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1022-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Nitrenes, like carbenes, are immensely reactive and electrophilic, and the same Wolff-style migration (insertion into an adjacent C&#8211;C bond) takes place in which the substituent R migrates from carbon to the electron-deficient nitrogen atom of the nitrene. The product is an <i>isocyanate</i>. Isocyanates are unstable to hydrolysis: attack by water on the carbonyl group gives a carbamic acid, which decomposes to an amine. Alternatively, reaction with an alcohol gives a carbamate. If the alcohol is BnOH, the product is a Cbz-protected amine.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Overall, then, the Curtius rearrangement converts an acid chloride (or an acid) to an amine with loss of a carbon atom&#8212;very useful. Also useful is the related Hofmann rearrangement, which turns an amide into an amine with loss of a carbon atom. This time we start with a primary amide and make a nitrene by treatment with base and bromine. Notice how close this nitrene-forming reaction is to the carbene-forming reactions we talked about on p. <a href="chapter_38.xhtml#page_1008">1008</a>. The nitrene rearranges just as in the Curtius reaction, giving an isocyanate that can be hydrolysed to the amine.</p>

Because of the difficulties in forming &#946;-lactams (the four-membered rings found in the penicillin classes of antibiotics), the pharamaceutical company Merck decided to design a synthesis of the class of compounds known as carbapenems around a rhodium-catalysed carbene insertion into an N&#8211;H bond, building the five-membered ring on to the side of the four-membered ring.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In this example, and in many before it, the formation of the carbene is initiated by a metal&#8212; often copper, rhodium, or silver. The carbene intermediates in these reactions are formed as reactive complexes with those metals, but in other cases the complexes are extremely stable. For example, decomposition of phenyldiazomethane in the presence of a ruthenium(II) complex gives a carbene complex stable enough to be isolated and stored for months. This complex, and a family of related Ru complexes, are among the most important of carbene-derived reagents because of a remarkable reaction known as <b>alkene</b> (or <b>olefin) metathesis</b>.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">What happens is a <i>metathesis</i>&#8212;an exchange of groups between the two arms of the molecule. But how? The mechanism is not difficult, but is unlike any other you have met before, except, perhaps, the Wittig reaction, which also forms alkenes. First, the carbene complex adds to one of the alkenes in what can be drawn as a [2 + 2] cycloaddition (<a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a>) to give a four-membered ring with the metal atom in the ring (a &#8216;metallacyclobutane&#8217;).</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This new complex has the same reactivity as the catalyst we started with, so it will quickly find another alkene to undergo [2 + 2] cycloaddition with. There is now one in the same molecule, so a fast intramolecular reaction joins up the five-membered ring and produces a second metallacyclobutane. As before, there are two alternative ways for this metallacyclobutane to break down, and the productive one gives a third carbene complex and the cyclic product.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Not a lot can go wrong in this sequence, which is one reason why the yield is so high. Most of the steps are reversible, and the overall reaction is driven by the only irreversible step&#8212;the loss of ethylene as a gas. Even if the carbene complex adds the wrong way round to the alkene, nothing is lost because the only thing the resulting metallacycle can do is revert back to starting materials.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Metathesis catalysts</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">As you might imagine, the discovery of such a simple and efficient way of making new C=C bonds was a revolutionary point in organic chemistry, and earned a Nobel Prize in 2005 for the three chemists instrumental in its development&#8212;Yves Chauvin, Richard Schrock, and Robert Grubbs. The catalyst we have just been working with was developed by Grubbs and is often known by his name. The early years of the 21st century also saw a rapid improvement in the effectiveness of the catalysts used for metathesis. The most important development was the discovery of alternatives to the phosphine ligands, a change which increases the activity of the catalyst. The most important alternative ligands are themselves carbenes of the stable &#8216;N-heterocyclic&#8217; type we introduced on p. <a href="chapter_38.xhtml#page_1006">1006</a>. Here is an important example, made by deprotonation of a heterocyclic cation:</p>
<figure style="width:75%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1025-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">There is a lot of delocalization in this structure, and usually these ligands are represented with a curved line to show the donation of both nitrogen lone pairs to the carbene C atom. You might prefer to include the formal + and &#8211; charges, but these compounds really do stretch the classical valence bond representation almost to breaking point, and conventionally the charges are not shown as they cancel out.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The remaining lone pair on carbon (which is not delocalized) can coordinate to Ru, just like the phosphine lone pair, giving a catalyst known as &#8216;Grubbs II&#8217; (the &#8216;second generation&#8217; of the &#8216;Grubbs I&#8217; we made use of in the metathesis described above). In another widely used catalyst (known as the &#8216;Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalyst&#8217;) the second phosphine is also replaced by intramolecular coordination.</p>

</figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Cross metathesis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">The first metathesis we introduced you to is known, for obvious reasons, as a <i>ring closing metathesis</i> reaction, and the formation of rings&#8212;even of difficult ring sizes (see <a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapters 16</a> and <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">31</a>) is one of the supreme applications of metathesis chemistry. However, inter molecular metathesis reactions can also work under certain circumstances, especially when the coupling partners have very different electronic or steric properties. The challenge is of course avoiding each alkene coupling with itself. When one of the two partners is hindered and the other isn&#8217;t, the cross metathesis reaction works well: the four carbons of the two alkenes swap partners and a new alkene is produced (as its <i>E</i> isomer), along with ethylene as a by-product.<a class="page" id="page_1026">Page 1026, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a></p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1026-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It&#8217;s not difficult to understand why the less reactive and more hindered alkene doesn&#8217;t react with itself, but why doesn&#8217;t the more reactive alkene just dimerize? The point is. . .it does! But it doesn&#8217;t matter because even the dimer is reactive as a metathesis substrate, and can still go on to form the product. All the metathesis steps proceed through the reversible [2 + 2] cyclo-addition mechanisms you saw earlier.</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>

</figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Ene-yne metathesis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Before we leave metathesis, and carbenes, we need to introduce one final reaction where metathesis leads to a remarkable transformation. Metathesis works on any C=C &#960; bond, but the &#960; bonds need not be an alkene&#8212;it can be an <i>alkyne</i>. The scheme below shows what happens: the two C=C double bonds change places. When an alkene reacts with an alkene, the result is two new alkenes, but when an alkene reacts with an alkyne, there is still a single bond remaining from the original alkyne, which ends up linking the two products together as a diene.</p>
<figure style="width:80%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1026-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mechanism follows exactly the same sequence of events as before. First the ruthenium carbene catalyst undergoes [2 + 2] cycloaddition with the alkyne. The intermediate is now a metallacyclobut<b>e</b>ne, and when the reverse [2 + 2] takes place the Ru carbene is still connected to the alkene product.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Now the new carbene can undergo [2 + 2] cycloaddition and reverse [2 + 2] cycloaddition again, this time with the alkene component, and out comes the diene, plus a Ru carbene ready to start the cycle again.<a class="page" id="page_1027">Page 1027, Chapter 38 Synthesis and reactions of carbenes</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Ene-yne metathesis is therefore a valuable way of constructing dienes&#8212;of the type you might require for a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, for example. Unlike more reactive organometallics such as organolithiums and Grignard reagents, the Ru carbenes are fully compatible with acidic NH and OH bonds and with electrophilic carbonyl groups. You will meet more of the mild chemistry possible with organometallics in <a href="chapter_40.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Summary</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">We have seen in this chapter how carbenes can be formed from many other reactive intermediates, such as carbocations, carbanions, and diazoalkanes, and how they can react to give yet further reactive intermediates such as ylids. Here is a summary of the main relationships between a carbene :CR<sub>2</sub> and these other compounds.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In the last few chapters we have concentrated a lot on what we call reactive intermediates, species like radicals, carbenes, or carbocations that are hard to observe but that definitely exist. Much of the evidence for their existence derives from the study of the mechanisms of reactions. We have discussed some aspects of this as we have met the species concerned, but in the next chapter we will look in detail at how mechanisms are elucidated and the methods used to determine more precisely the structure of reactive intermediates.</p>
