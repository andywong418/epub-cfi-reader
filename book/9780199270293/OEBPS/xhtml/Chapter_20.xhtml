<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">We make no apologies for the number of pages we have devoted to carbonyl chemistry. The first reactions you met, in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, involved carbonyl compounds. Then in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 we considered different aspects of nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbonyl compounds. But carbonyl compounds have two opposed sides to their characters. They can be nucleophilic as well: <i>electrophilic</i> attack on aldehydes, ketones, and acid derivatives is a useful reaction too. How can the same class of compound be subject to both nucleophilic and electrophilic attack? The resolution of this paradox is the subject of this chapter, where we shall see that most carbonyl compounds exist in two forms&#x2014;one electrophilic and one nucleo-philic. The electrophilic form is the carbonyl compound itself and the nucleophilic form is called the enol.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Tautomerism: formation of enols by proton transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent">An enol is exactly what the name implies: an ene-ol. It has a C&#x003D;C double bond and an OH group joined directly to it. In the case of dimedone, the enol must be formed by a transfer of a proton from the central CH<sub>2</sub> group of the keto form to one of the OH groups, a reaction known as <i>enolization</i>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_450_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Notice that there is no change in pH&#x2014;a proton is lost from carbon and gained on oxygen. It is a strange reaction in which little happens: the only change is the transfer of one <a id="page_451" class="page">Page 451, Chapter 20: Formation and reactions of enols and enolates</a> proton and the shift of the double bond.

<p class="bnoindent">This sort of chemistry was discussed in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, where the acidity and basicity of atoms were the prime considerations. In the first case the two tautomers are the same and so the equilibrium constant must be exactly 1 (the mixture must be exactly 50:50).

<p class="noindent">When we were looking at the spectra of carbonyl compounds in Chapters 13 and 18 we saw no signs of enols in IR or NMR spectra. Dimedone is exceptional (we will discuss why later) and while any carbonyl compound with protons adjacent to the carbonyl group can enolize, simpler carbonyl compounds like cyclohexanone or acetone have only a trace of enol present under ordinary conditions. The equilibrium lies well over towards the keto form (the equilibrium constant <i>K</i> for acetone enolization is about 10<sup>-6</sup>).</p>

The balance between the bond energies is quite fine. On the one hand, the O&#x2013;H bond in the enol is a stronger bond than the C&#x2013;H bond in the ketone but, on the other hand, the C&#x003D;O bond of the ketone is much stronger than the C&#x003D;C bond of the enol.

<p class="indent">Typical amounts of enols in solution are about one part in 10<sup>5</sup> for normal ketones. So why do we think they are important? <i>Because enolization is just a proton transfer, it is occurring all the time even though we cannot detect the minute proportion of the enol.</i> Let&#x2019;s look at the evidence for this statement.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_20.4">
<h2 class="h2">Evidence for the equilibration of carbonyl compounds with enols</h2>
<p class="noindent">If you dissolve a simple carbonyl compound (for example, 1-phenylpropan-1-one, &#x2018;propiophe- none&#x2019;) in D<sub>2</sub>O and run a series of <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra over a period of time, the signal for protons next to the carbonyl group very slowly disappears. If the compound is isolated from the solution afterwards, the mass spectrum shows that those hydrogen atoms have been replaced by deuterium atoms: there is a peak at (<i>M</i> &#x002B; 1)<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or (<i>M</i> &#x002B; 2)<sup>&#x002B;</sup> instead of at <i>M</i><sup>&#x002B;</sup></p>
<p class="indent">Enolization usually means losing a proton from C and gaining one at O. But in D<sub>2</sub>O all of the &#x2018;protons&#x2019; are in fact &#x2018;deuterons&#x2019; (D<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or <sup>2</sup>H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>), so initially an enol with an &#x2018;OD&#x2019; group forms. This doesn&#x2019;t matter, though, because when the enol form reverts to the keto form, it loses the D from O. But what does matter is that it also picks up a deuteron instead of a proton at C.</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Notice that the double bond in this enol could be either <i>E</i> or <i>Z</i>. It is drawn as <i>Z</i> here, but in reality is probably a mixture of both, although this is irrelevant to the reaction. We shall not be concerned with the geometry of enols in this chapter, but there are some reactions that you will meet in later chapters where it is important, and you need to appreciate that the possibility exists.</p>

<p class="indent">The process can now be repeated: either the D or the H could be lost this time, but eventually it is certain that the huge excess of D over H in the solvent will mean that both H atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group are replaced by D.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:2em;">
<img src="../images/pg_452_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">We can detect this exchange by the slow disappearance of the 2H signal for the protons on the carbon next to the carbonyl group. There are, of course, eight other hydrogen atoms in the molecule but they are not affected by enolization.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Enolization is catalysed by acids and bases</h2>
<p class="noindent">Enolization is, in fact, quite a slow process in neutral solution, even in D<sub>2</sub>O (the exchange described above might take place over a period of hours to days at room temperature), and we would catalyse it with acid or base if we really wanted it to happen fast. In the acid-catalysed reaction, the molecule is first protonated on oxygen and then loses a proton from C in a second step. We shall use a different example here to show that aldehydes form enols too, but acid or base will catalyse enolization of any carbonyl compound in the same way.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_452_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This is a more detailed mechanism for enolization than those we have been drawing because it shows that something (here a water molecule) must actually be removing the proton from carbon.

<h2 class="h2">The intermediate in the base-catalysed reaction is an enolate ion</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are some more insights to be gained from the base-catalysed reaction. The intermediate anion is called the <b>enolate ion</b>. It is the conjugate base of the enol and can be formed either<a id="page_453" class="page">Page 453, Chapter 20: Formation and reactions of enols and enolates</a> directly from the carbonyl compound by the loss of a C&#x2013;H proton or from the enol by loss of the O&#x2013;H proton.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">On the left you see the populated orbitals of the allyl anion and on the right the corresponding orbitals of the enolate ion. The allyl anion is, of course, symmetrical. Two changes happen when we replace one carbon by an oxygen atom. Because oxygen is more electronegative, both orbitals go down in energy. The orbitals are also distorted. The lower-energy atomic orbital of the more electronegative oxygen contributes more to the lower-energy orbital (&#x03C8;<sub>1</sub>) and correspondingly less to &#x03C8;<sub>2</sub>. The charge distribution comes from both populated orbitals so the negative charge is spread over all three atoms, but is mostly on the ends. The important reactive orbital is the HOMO (&#x03C8;<sub>2</sub>), which has the larger orbital on the terminal carbon atom.</p>
<p class="indent">In the enolate, the oxygen atom has more of the negative charge, but the carbon atom has more of the HOMO. One important consequence is that we can expect reactions dominated by charges and electrostatic interactions to occur on oxygen and reactions dominated by orbital interactions to occur on carbon. Thus acyl chlorides tend to react at oxygen to give enol esters.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Summary of types of enol and enolate</h2>
<p class="noindent">Time to recap and summarize the various kinds of enol and enolate that can form from car-bonyl compounds. You have already seen that <b>ketones</b> and <b>aldehydes</b> enolize. With an unsymmetrical ketone, more than one enol or enolate ion is possible.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent">All carboxylic acid derivatives can form enols of some kind. Those of <b>esters</b> are particularly important and either enols or enolates are easily made. It is obviously necessary to avoid water in the presence of acid or base, as esters hydrolyse under these conditions. One solution is to use the alkoxide belonging to the ester (MeO<sup>-</sup> with a methyl ester, EtO<sup>-</sup> with an ethyl ester, and so on) to make enolate ions.</p>

<p class="indent">The carbonyl group is accepting electrons in both the enolization step and the nucleo- philic attack. The same compounds that are the most electrophilic are also the most easily enolizable. This makes <b>acyl chlorides</b> very enolizable. To avoid nucleophilic attack, we cannot use chloride ion as base since chloride is not basic, so we must use a non-nucleophilic base such as a tertiary amine. The resulting enolate is not stable as it can eliminate chloride ion, a good leaving group, to form a ketene. This works particularly well in making dichloro- ketene from dichloroacetyl chloride as the proton to be removed is very acidic.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Stable enols</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have established that the enol is, in general, less stable than the keto form of the molecule. We might hope to see stable enols if we changed that situation by adding some feature to the molecule that stabilized the enol thermodynamically. Or we might try to create an enol that would revert only slowly to the keto form&#x2014;in other words, it would be <i>kinetically</i> stable. We shall look at this type first.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Kinetically stable enols</h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of enols is catalysed by acids and bases. The reverse of this reaction&#x2014;the formation of ketone from enol&#x2014;must therefore also be catalysed by the same acids and bases. If you prepare simple enols in the strict absence of acid or base they have a reasonably long lifetime. A famous example is the preparation of the simplest enol, vinyl alcohol, by heating ethane-1,2-diol (glycol&#x2014;antifreeze) to very high temperatures (900 &#x00B0;C) at low pressure. Water is lost and the enol of acetaldehyde is formed. It survives long enough for its proton NMR spectrum to be run, but gives acetaldehyde slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">The spectrum illustrates the electronic effect of the oxygen atom on the double bond. The alkene proton next to OH (in green) is deshielded and the two alkene protons on the other carbon atom (in orange) are shielded as you would expect from the feeding of electrons into the double bond by the OH group. The coupling constants across the double bond are as expected too: a large <i>trans</i> coupling (14.0 Hz) and a smaller <i>cis</i> coupling (6.5 Hz). The very small geminal coupling is typical of a terminal double bond CH<sub>2</sub> group.</p>

The enolate ion can attack a bromine molecule in a very similar way to the attack of the enol on bromine. The enolate will, of course, be even more reactive than the enol (the enolate carries a negative charge).</p>

<p class="indent">The same thing happens with iodine, and we can summarize the whole process with iodine using a general structure for a carbonyl compound bearing a methyl group. It must be a methyl group because three halogens are necessary to make the carbanion into a leaving group.</p>
<p class="indent">This reaction is often called the &#x2018;iodoform&#x2019; reaction. Iodoform was an old name for tri- iodomethane, just as chloroform is still used for trichloromethane.

<h3 class="ch3">Why does acid-catalysed halogenation work better?</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">The reason why halogenation in base continues until all the hydrogens have been replaced is clear: each successive halide makes the remaining proton(s) more acidic and the next enolization easier. But why does acid-catalysed halogenation stop after the introduction of one halogen? It would be more accurate to say that it <i>can be made to stop</i> after one halogen is introduced if only one equivalent of halogen is used. Acid-catalysed halogenation <i>will</i> continue if there is more halogen available.</p>
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_463_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bindent">However, the second halogen goes on the other side of the carbonyl group, if it can. It is evidently the case that the second halogenation is slower than the first. Most of the intermediates are positively charged and hence destabilized by the presence of a halogen. The bromoketone is less basic than acetone so less of the reactive protonated form is present. This slows down any further electrophilic attack.</p>
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_463_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bindent">The second step is the rate-determining step, and the presence of a bromine atom at the &#x03B1; position slows this step down still further: if a proton can be lost from a different &#x03B1; position&#x2014;one without a Br atom&#x2014;it will be. The transition state for proton removal illustrates why bromine slows this step down. The part of the structure close to the bromine atom is positively charged.</p>

<p class="bindent">We can add a useful piece of evidence to this weak-sounding explanation. The halogenation of an unsymmetrical dialkyl ketone gives different results in acid and in base. In base halogenation occurs preferentially on a methyl group, that is, on the less highly substituted side. In acid solution by contrast, the first (and only) halogenation occurs on the more substituted side of the carbonyl group. Alkyl groups have the opposite effect to bromine atoms&#x2014;they stabilize positive charges. So the reactions of an enol, with a positively charged transition state, are faster at more highly substituted positions. Enolates react through negatively charged transition states and are faster at less highly substituted carbon atoms.</p>

An alternative view is that the silicon reacts with oxygen first, and the base just converts the oxonium ion to the silyl enol ether. Both mechanisms are given below&#x2014;either might be correct.

Normally, enols and enolate ions prefer to react with alkylating agents (such as alkyl halides) at carbon, as we shall see in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>. If enolate ions are prepared with potassium bases in dipolar aprotic solvents (such as dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) that cannot solvate the oxygen anion, and are treated with dimethylsulfate or trimethyloxonium ion&#x2014;powerful methylating agents that react best with charged atoms&#x2014;some at least of the enol ether is formed.

They react with electrophiles like bromine or chlorine on the &#x03B1; carbon atom, behaving like enol derivatives and not like alkenes.</p>

<p class="indent">Electrophilic attack occurs at the &#x03B1; carbon atom and the halide ion released in this step then attacks the silicon atom to release the product and a molecule of Me3SiX, which will be hydrolysed during the work-up.</p>

<p class="indent">This procedure avoids the difficulties we outlined earlier in the direct halogenation of alde-hydes and ketones. It allows the preparation of haloketones on the less substituted side of the carbonyl group, for instance.</p>

<h2 class="h2">To conclude</h2>
<p class="noindent">You have now seen how enols and enolates react with electrophiles based on hydrogen (deu-terium), carbon, halogens, silicon, sulfur, and nitrogen. What remains to be seen is how new carbon&#x2013;carbon bonds can be formed with alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds in their normal electrophilic mode. These reactions are the subject of Chapters 25&#x2013;26, but next we look at the ways aromatic compounds react with electrophiles. You will see similarities with the behaviour of enols.</p>
