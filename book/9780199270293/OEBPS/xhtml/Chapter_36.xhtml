<p class="htwindent1">The last two chapters introduced <b>pericyclic reactions</b>, and the next one will cover 
reac-tions of <b>radicals</b>. Together with the <b>ionic reactions</b> which have been the subject of most of this
 book, these three classes cover all organic mechanisms. But before we move on to con-sider radicals, we need to fill
 a gap in our coverage of ionic reactions. You have met the most important types of ionic reactions&#x2014;additions,
 substitutions, and eliminations. But two remain and they are closely related. In <b>rearrangements</b> the molecule
 changes its carbon skel-eton and in <b>fragmentations</b> the carbon skeleton splits into pieces. We lead up to these
 types of reaction by looking at a phenomenon known as <b>participation</b>.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Nearby groups can evidently increase the rate of substitution reactions significantly. Now, you may be thinking back to <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> and saying 'yes, yes, we know that'&#x2014;when we were discussing the mechanisms of substitution reactions we pointed out that a cation-stabilizing group at the reaction centre makes S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions very fast, for example:</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_932_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg" /> Neighbouring group participation is occasionally called <b>anchimeric assistance</b>(Greek <i>anchi &#x003D;</i> neighbouring; <i>mer&#x003D;</i> part).</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In the four examples above, though, it is not at the reaction centre itself that the functional groups change but at the carbon <i>next</i> to the reaction centre, and we call these groups <i>neighbouring groups.</i> The mechanism by which they speed up the reactions is known as <i>neighbouring group participation.</i> Compare the reaction of this ether and this sulfide with an alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_932_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In both cases, ionization of the starting material is assisted by the lone pair of an electron- rich functional group. The ether in the first example assists by forming a n bond, the sulfide assists by forming a <i>a</i> bond in a three-membered ring, and a common feature of all mechanisms involving neighbouring group participation is the formation of a cyclic intermediate.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Stereochemistry can indicate neighbouring group participation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">How do we know that neighbouring group participation is taking place? Well, the first bit of evidence is the <i>increase in rate.</i> The neighbouring groups become involved only if they can increase the rate of the substitution reaction&#x2014;otherwise the mechanism will just follow the ordinary S<sub>N</sub>2 pathway. But more important information comes from reactions where stereo-chemistry is involved, and one of these is the last of the four examples at the start of the chapter. Here it is again in more detail. Not only does the first of these reactions go faster than the second&#x2014;its stereochemical course is different too.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_932_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Although one starting material has <i>syn</i> and the other <i>anti</i> stereochemistry, the products have the same (anti) stereochemistry one substitution goes with retention and one goes with<a class="page" id="page_933">Page 933, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a> inversion. Again, neighbouring group participation is the reason. To explain this, we should first draw the six-membered rings in their real conformation. For the <i>anti</i> compound, both substituents can be equatorial. However, not much can happen in this conformation&#x2014;but, if we allow the ring to flip, you can see immediately that the acetate substituent is ideally placed to participate in the departure of the tosylate group.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" />If you are unsure what we are talking about, go back and read <a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> now&#x0021;</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_933_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">What results is an entirely symmetrical intermediate&#x2014;the positive charge on one of the oxygens is, of course, delocalized over both of them. The intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction takes place with inversion, as required by the orbitals, so now the junction of the two rings is <i>cis.</i></p>
<p class="htwindent1">The next step is attack of acetic acid on the intermediate. This is another S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, which also proceeds with inversion and gives back a <i>trans</i> product.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_933_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">Overall, we have <i>retention</i> of stereochemistry. As you know, S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions go with inversion and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions with loss of stereochemical information, so this result is possible only if we have two sequential S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions taking place&#x2014;in other words neighbouring group participation.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Why, then, does the other diastereoisomer react with inversion of stereochemistry? Well, try drawing the mechanism for intramolecular displacement of the tosyl group. Whether you put the tosylate or the acetate group equatorial doesn't matter; there is no way in which the acetate oxygen's lone pair can reach the o* orbital of the tosylate C&#x2014;O bond.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-24em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg" /> While the mechanism of this first step of the substitution reaction is S<sub>N</sub>2 in appearance&#x2014;a nucleophile (the acetate group) arrives just as a leaving group (the tosylate group) departs&#x2014;it is also, of course, only unimolecular.</p>

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Neighbouring group participation is impossible, and substitution goes simply by intermolecular displacement of OTs by AcOH. Just one S<sub>N124:156
</sub>2 step means overall inversion of configuration, and no participation means a slower reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Retention of configuration is an indication of neighbouring group participation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Enantiomerically pure (R)-2-bromopropanoic acid reacts with concentrated sodium hydroxide to give (S)-lactic acid. The reaction goes with inversion and is a typical S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction&#x2014;and a good one too, since the reaction centre is adjacent to a carbonyl group (see <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>). If, on the other hand, the reaction is run using Ag<sub>2</sub>O and a low concentration of sodium hydroxide, (^)-lactic acid is obtained&#x2014;there is overall <i>retention</i> of stereochemistry.</p>

<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/square.jpg" /> Lactones (that is, cyclic esters) don't usually react with hydroxide by this mechanism, and you might expect this intermediate (which is a cyclic ester) to hydrolyse by attack of hydroxide at the C&#x003D;O group. You might like to think about why this doesn't happen in this case.</p>

<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg" /> Interactive mechanism for a-lactone formation</p>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Nucleophilic substitution reactions that go with retention of stereochemistry are rather rare and mostly go through two successive inversions with neighbouring group participation, like the example you saw in the last section. This time the neighbouring group is carboxylate: the silver oxide is important because it encourages the ionization of the starting material by acting as a halogen-selective Lewis acid. A three-membered ring intermediate forms, which then gets opened by hydroxide in a second S<sub>N</sub>2 step.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg" /> <b>Retention suggests participations</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi" style="width:100%"><b>If you see a substitution reaction at a stereogenic saturated carbon atom that goes with retention of stereochemistry, look for neighbouring group participation&#x0021;</b></p>
</div>
<p class="htwindent1">Why does the carboxylate group participate only at low HO<sup>-</sup> concentration and in the presence of Ag&#x002B;? You can think of the situation in these two reactions in terms of the factors that favour S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions. In the first, we have conditions suited to an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction: a very good nucleophile (HO<sup>-</sup>) and a good leaving group (Br<sup>-</sup>). Improve the leaving group by adding Ag&#x002B; (Ag&#x002B; assists Br <sup>-</sup>'s departure much as H&#x002B; assists the departure of OH<sup>-</sup> by allowing it to leave as H<sub>2</sub>O) and worsen the nucleophile (H<sub>2</sub>O instead of HO<sup>-</sup>, of which there is now only a low concentration), and we have the sorts of conditions that <i>would</i> favour an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. The trouble is, without neighbouring group participation, the cation here would be rather unstable&#x2014;right next to a carbonyl group. The carboxylate saves the day by participating in the departure of the Br<sup>-</sup> and forming the lactone. The key thing to remember is that a reaction always goes by the mechanism with the fastest rate.</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="htwyellow">
<p class="htwdivi"><img src="../images/dot.jpg" /> <b>Neighbouring groups participate only if they speed up the reaction.</b></p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3"><b>What sorts of groups can participate?</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">You've already met the most important ones&#x2014;sulfides, esters, carboxylates. Ethers and amines (you will see some of these shortly) can also assist substitution reactions through neighbour-ing group participation. The important thing that they have in common is an electron-rich heteroatom with a lone pair that can be used to form the cyclic intermediate. Sulfides are rather better than ethers&#x2014;this sulfide reacts with water much faster than &#x00AB;-PrCl but the ether reacts with acetic acid four times more <i>slowly</i> than &#x00AB;-PrOSO<sub>2</sub>Ar.</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">sulfide participation ether participation?</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_934_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The OMe group slows the reaction down just because it is electronegative more than it accelerates it by participation. A more distant OMe group can participate: this 4-MeO alkyl sulfonate reacts with alcohols 4000 times faster than the &#x00AB;-Bu sulfonate.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_934_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a class="page" id="page_935">Page 935, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Again neighbouring group participation is involved, but this time through a five- rather than a three-membered ring. Participation is most commonly through three- and five- membered rings, less often six-membered ones, and very rarely four- or more than seven- membered ones.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_935_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mustard gas</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">Participation of sulfides through three-membered rings was used to gruesome effect in the development of mustard gas during the Second World War. Mustard gas itself owes its toxicity to the neighbouring group participation of sulfur, which accelerates its alkylation reactions.</p>

</div>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/square.jpg" /> Why these ring sizes? Well, the underlying reasons are the same as those we discussed in <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> when we talked about the kinetics (rates) of formation and thermodynamics (stability) of different ring sizes: three- and five-membered rings form particularly rapidly in any reaction.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Not all participating groups have lone pairs</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Another of the four examples we started with shows that even the n electrons of a C&#x003D;C double bond can participate. Retention of stereochemistry in the product (the starting tosylate and product acetate are both <i>anti</i> to the double bond) and the extremely fast reaction (10<sup>11</sup> times that of the saturated analogue) are tell-tale signs of neighbouring group participation.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_935_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>What is the structure of the intermediate?</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">During the 1950s and 1960s, this sort of question provoked a prolonged and acrimonious debate, which we have no
intention of stirring up, and all we will do is point out that the intermediate in this reaction is not fully represented by
the structure we have here: it is symmetrical and could be represented by two structures with three-membered rings or
by a delocalized structure in which two electrons are shared between three atoms. The difference need not concern us.</p>

<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_935_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Again, &#x03C0; electrons are involved, but the reaction is now electrophilic aromatic substitution (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) rather like an intramolecular Friedel&#x2014;Crafts alkylation with a delocalized intermediate often termed a phenonium ion.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>More stereochemical consequences of neighbouring group participation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The phenonium ion is symmetrical. The acetic acid can attack either atom in the three- membered ring to give the same product.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwblue">
<p class="htwnoindenta">There is a subtlety here that you should not overlook and that makes this study, which was carried out by Cram in 1949, exceedingly elegant. Reactions of both of these diastereo- isomers are stereospecific: the <i>relative</i> stereochemistry of the products depends on the <i>relative</i> stereochemistry of the starting materials. Yet, while the absolute stereochemistry of the starting materials is retained in one case (we get a single enantiomer of a single diastereo- isomer), it is lost in the other (we get a racemic mixture of both enantiomers of a single diastereoisomer). These are important distinctions, and if you are in any doubt about these terms, re-read Chapters 14 and 33. Donald Cram (1919-2001) of UCLA was awarded the Nobel prize in 1987 jointly with Jean- Marie Lehn (1939-) of Strasbourg and Paris, and Charles Pedersen (a Norwegian born in Korea in 1904) of DuPont for 'their development and use of molecules with struc-ture-specific interactions of high selectivity'.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The phenonium ion is nonetheless still chiral, since it has an axis (and not a plane or centre) of symmetry, so if we use an enantiomerically pure starting material we get an enantiomerically pure product.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_936_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Not so with the other diastereoisomer of this compound&#x0021; Now, the phenonium ion is symmetrical with a plane of symmetry&#x2014;it is therefore achiral, and the same whichever enantiomer we start from. Attack on each end of the phenonium ion gives a different enantiomer, so whichever enantiomer of starting material we use we get the same racemic mixture of products. You can compare this reaction with the loss of stereochemical information that occurs during an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction of enantiomerically pure compounds. Both reactions pass through an achiral intermediate.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_936_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a class="page" id="page_937">Page 937, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The same loss of absolute stereochemical information (but retention of relative stereochemistry) occurs in another reaction that you met at the start of this chapter. We then emphasized two features: the acceleration in rate and the retention of stereochemistry.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_937_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The intermediate oxonium ion is delocalized and achiral. If a single enantiomer of the starting material is used, racemic product is formed through this achiral intermediate. Attack at one carbon atom gives one enantiomer; attack at the other gives the mirror image.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_937_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In this case the neighbouring group can be caught in the act&#x2014;when the rearrangement is carried out in ethanol, the intermediate is trapped by attack at the central carbon atom. It is as though someone switched the light on while the acetate's fingers were in the biscuit tin. The product is an orthoester and is achiral too. This chemistry should remind you of the formation of acetals, as described in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Rearrangements occur when a participating group ends up</h2>
 <h2 class="htwh2" style="margin-top:-0.5em">bonded to a different atom</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Because the intermediates in these examples are symmetrical, 50&#x0025; of the time one substituent ends up moving from one carbon atom to another during the reaction. This is clearer in the following example: the starting material is prepared such that the carbon atom carrying the phenyl group is an unusual isotope&#x2014;carbon-14. This doesn't affect the chemistry, but means that the two carbon atoms are easily distinguishable. Reacting the compound with trifluoro- acetic acid scrambles the label between the two positions: the intermediate is symmetrical and, in the 50&#x0025; of reactions with the nucleophile that take place at the labelled carbon atom, the phenyl ends up migrating to the unlabelled carbon atom in a rearrangement reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_937_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, consider this substitution reaction, in which OH replaces Cl but with a change in the molecular structure. The substitution goes with complete rearrangement&#x2014;the amine ends up attached to a different carbon atom. We can easily see why if we look at the mechanism. The reaction starts off looking like a neighbouring group participation of the sort you are now familiar with (the carbon atoms are numbered for identification).</p>

We start with a secondary alkyl chloride that contains a very bad leaving group (Et<sub>2</sub>N) and a good one (Cl<sup>-</sup>)&#x2014;but the good one is hard for HO<sup>-</sup> to displace because it is at a secondary centre (remember&#x2014;secondary alkyl halides are slow to react by S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2). But the NEt<sub>2</sub> can participate to make an aziridinium intermediate&#x2014;now there is a good leaving group (RNEt<sub>2</sub> without the negative charge) at the primary as well as the secondary carbon, so HO<sup>-</sup> does a fast S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at the primary carbon.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_938_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Another way to look at this reaction is to see that the good internal nucleophile Et<sub>2</sub>N will compete successfully for the electrophile with the external nucleophile HO<sup>-</sup>. Intramolecular reactions are usually faster than bimolecular reactions.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The thiolate nucleophile has not opened the epoxide directly, but instead <i>appears</i> to have displaced HO<sup>-</sup>&#x2014;a very bad leaving group. Almost no nucleophile will displace OH<sup>-</sup>, so we need an alternative explanation. This comes in the form of another rearrangement, this time involving oxygen, but otherwise rather similar to the ones you have just met. Again, our epoxide, although reactive as an electrophile, suffers from being secondary at both electrophilic centres. f-BuS<sup>-</sup> is a bulky nucleophile, so direct attack on the epoxide is slow. Instead, under the basic conditions of the reaction, the neighbouring alkoxide group attacks intramolecularly to make a new, rearranged epoxy alcohol. This is called the Payne rearrangement.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">We can think of the aziridinium ion as a compound containing two alternative leaving groups&#x2014;one from a primary centre and one from a secondary one. Primary centres can take part in fast S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, but cannot undergo S<sub>N</sub>1. Secondary centres can undergo either S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>n</sub>2 reactions, but, in general, do neither very well. Now, the rate of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction depends on the nucleophile, so a good nucleophile (like HO<sup>-</sup>) can do fast S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, while a bad one (like H<sub>2</sub>O) cannot. The fastest reaction HO<sup>-</sup> can do then is S<sub>N</sub>2 at the primary centre (remember: you see only the reaction that goes by the fastest mechanism). Water, on the other hand, takes part only reluctantly in substitution reactions&#x2014;but this does not matter if they are S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions because their rates are independent of nucleophile. H<sub>2</sub>O waits until the leaving group has left of its own accord to give a cation, which rapidly grabs <i>any</i> nucleophile&#x2014;water will do just as well as HO<sup>-</sup>.

Adding Ag&#x002B; makes I<sup>-</sup> desperate to leave, but unassisted this would mean the formation of a primary carbocation. The molecule does the only thing it can to stop this happening and uses the electrons in an adjacent C&#x2014;C bond to assist the departure of I<sup>-</sup>. Having participated, the methyl group continues to migrate to carbon 1 because by doing so it allows the formation of a stable tertiary carbocation, which then captures water in a step reminiscent of the second half of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.

<h2 class="htwh2">Carbocations readily rearrange</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> we showed you that it is possible to run the NMR spectra of carbocations by using a polar but non-nucleophilic solvent such as liquid SO<sub>2</sub> or SOClF. Treating an alkyl halide RX with the powerful Lewis acid SbF<sub>5</sub> under these conditions gives a solution of carbocation: the carbocation reacts neither with solvent nor the SbF<sub>5</sub>X<sup>-</sup> counterion because neither is nucleophilic. We know, for example, that the chemical shifts in both the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the <i>t</i>-butyl cation are very large, particularly the <sup>13</sup>C shift at the positively charged centre.<a class="page" id="page_941">Page 941, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>
<p class="htwindent1">NMR can be used to follow the course of rearrangement reactions involving carbocations too. We can illustrate this with an experiment that tries to make the neopentyl cation by the substitution reaction you have just seen. This time the starting material and solvent are slightly different, but the outcome is nonetheless most revealing. Dissolving neopentyl tosylate in fluorosulfonic acid (a strong, non-nucleophilic acid) at -77&#x00B0;C gives a 77&#x0025; yield of a cation whose spectrum is shown below. Assigning the peaks is not hard once you know that the same spectrum is obtained when 2,2-dimethyl-2-butanol is dissolved in fluorosulfonic acid with SbF<sub>5</sub> added.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_941_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Clearly, the spectrum is the tertiary 2-methylbutyl cation and the neopentyl cation never saw the light of day. The reaction is the same rearrangement that you saw in the substitution reaction of neopentyl iodide, but here the rate of rearrangement can be measured and it is extremely fast. Neopentyl tosylate reacts to form a cation under these conditions about 10<sup>4</sup> times as fast as ethyl tosylate, even though both tosylates are primary. This massive rate difference shows that if migration of an alkyl group can allow rearrangement to a more stable carbocation, it will happen, and happen rapidly.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Primary cations can never be observed by NMR&#x2014;they are too unstable. But secondary cations can, provided the temperature is kept low enough. sec-Butyl chloride in SO<sub>2</sub>ClF at -78&#x00B0;C gives a stable, observable cation. But, as the cation is warmed up, it rearranges to the f-butyl cation. Now this rearrangement truly is a carbocation rearrangement: the starting material is an observable carbocation and so is the product, and we should just look at the mechanism in a little more detail.</p>

<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg" /> The reason we say 'truly is a carbocation rearrangement' here is quite subtle and need not detain us long. We know that a secondary cation is formed in this case because we can see it by NMR; it subsequently rearranges to a tertiary cation. As we can never see primary cations, we don't know that they are ever formed, and the most reasonable explanation for rearrangements of the type you saw on p. <a href="chapter_36.xhtml#page_937">937</a> is that migration of the alkyl group begins <i>before</i> the leaving group is fully gone. This has been proved in a few cases, but we will from now on not distinguish between the two alternatives.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">As these rearrangements are a new type of reaction, we should just spend a moment looking at the molecular orbitals that are involved. For the first step, migration of the methyl group, <a class="page" id="page_942">Page 942, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>the LUMO must clearly be the empty p orbital of the cation, and the HOMO is the C&#x2014;C <i>a</i> bond, which is about to break.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The methyl group can slide smoothly from one orbital to another&#x2014;there are bonding interactions all the way. The next step, migration of H, is just the same&#x2014;except that the HOMO is now a C&#x2014;H <i>a</i> bond. The methyl migration is thermodynamically unfavourable as it transforms a secondary cation into an unstable primary cation but the hydride migration puts that right as it gives a stable tertiary cation. The whole reaction is under thermodynamic control.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The migration of an alkyl group to a cationic centre is known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or Wagner-Meerwein shift, and this migration is, of course, a synthetic manifestation of the rearrangement we have just been looking at in NMR spectra. Wagner-Meerwein shifts have been studied extensively in the class of natural products to which both of these natural products belong&#x2014;terpenes. For the moment, though, we will just illustrate this type of reaction with one more example&#x2014;another acid-catalysed dehydration, of isoborneol to give camphene.<a class="page" id="page_943">Page 943, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>

The cation is next to a quaternary centre, and migration of any of three bonds could generate a more stable tertiary carbocation. But we know that the new bond in the product is between C4 and C6, so let's migrate carbon 4.

Well, here we have another source of electrons to stabilize the carbocation: lone pairs on an oxygen atom. We pointed out early in the chapter that oxygen is very good at stabilizing a positive charge on an adjacent atom, and somewhat less good at stabilizing a positive charge two atoms away. By rearranging, the first-formed carbocation gets the positive charge into a position where the oxygen can stabilize it, and loss of a proton from oxygen then gives a stable ketone.<a class="page" id="page_946">Page 946, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>

followed by Ph, then Et, then Me, <i>very roughly</i> follows the order in which the groups are 
able to stabilize a positive charge. Primary groups are much more reluctant to undergo migration 
than secondary ones or aryl groups, and this makes regioselective Baeyer-Villiger reactions 
possible.</p>

it can be hydroxylated <i>ortho</i> to the OH group. This is where electrophilic substitutions of 
the phenol take place, but electrophilic substitutions with 'HO&#x002B;' are not possible. However,
 after a Friedel&#x002D; Crafts acylation, the acyl group can be converted to hydroxyl by the Baeyer&#x002D;
Villiger reaction and hydrolysis. The Baeyer&#x002D;Villiger reaction means that MeCO&#x002B; can be used

balance is rather delicate. The two factors that matter are: how <i>electrophilic</i> is the ketone 
and how <i>nucleo&#x002D;philic</i> is the alkene? You might like to consider why this reaction
 <i>does</i> work, and why the C&#x003D;C double bond here is particularly unreactive.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Small-ring ketones can relieve ring strain by undergoing Baeyer-Villiger

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will not epoxidize double bonds unless they are electron- deficient 
(see <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_955_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">One point to note about both of the last two reactions is that the insertion of
 oxygen goes with retention of stereochemistry. You may think this is unsurprising in a cyclic 
system like this and, indeed, the first of the two cannot possibly go with inversion. However, this
 is a general feature of Baeyer-Villiger reactions, even when inversion would give a more stable 
product.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_955_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">Even when you might imagine that racemization would occur, as in this benzylic
 ketone, retention is the rule.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_955_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">By looking at the orbitals involved, you can see why this must be so. The
 sp<sup>3</sup> orbital of the migrating carbon just slips from one orbital to the next with the 
minimum amount of structural reorganization. The large lobe of the sp<sup>3</sup> orbital is used
 so the new bond forms to the same face of the migrating group as the old one, and stereochemistry
 is retained.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_955_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The orbital interactions in all 1,2-migrations are similar, and the migrating
 group retains its stereochemistry in these too. In the more familiar S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, 
inversion occurs because the antibonding a* orbital rather than the bonding <i>a</i> orbital is 
used. In the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, carbon undergoes <i>nucleophilic</i> attack with <i>
inversion;</i> in rearrangements the migrating carbon atom undergoes <i>electrophilic</i> attack 
with <i>retention</i> of configuration.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Which group migrates? (II): the reasons</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Why does the more substituted group migrate in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction? 
The transition state has a positive charge spread out over the molecule as the carboxylate leaves 
as an anion. If the migrating group can take some responsibility for the positive charge the 
transition state will be more stable. The more stable the charge, the faster the rearrangement.?<a class="page" id="page_956">Page 956, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_956_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">When a benzene ring migrates, n participation is involved as the benzene ring 
acts as a nucleophile and the positive charge can be spread out even further. Note that the Ph is
 stabilizing the charge here in the way that it stabilizes the intermediate in an electrophilic 
aromatic substitution reaction&#x2014;like a pentadienyl cation rather than like a benzylic cation.
 What was a transition state in alkyl migration becomes an intermediate in phenyl migration.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_956_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The situation in other rearrangements is much more complicated&#x2014;and 
indeed more complicated than many textbooks would have you believe. We shall look just briefly at
 the dienone-phenol rearrangement again, this time considering reactions in which there is 
competition between two different migrating groups. As in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, the 
transition state is cationic, so you would expect cation-stabilizing groups to migrate more 
readily. This appears to be true for Ph versus Me, but is most definitely not true for Ph versus 
CO<sub>2</sub>Et. The cation <i>destabilizing</i> group CO<sub>2</sub>Et migrates even though Ph is 
much better at stabilizing a positive charge&#x0021;</p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_956_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reason is that CO<sub>2</sub>Et is so cation <i>destabilizing</i> that it
prefers to migrate rather than be left behind next door to a cation. In this case, then, it is the 
cation-stabilizing ability of the group that <i>does not</i> migrate that matters most.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> <img src="../images/page_956_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Which group migrates? (III): stereochemistry matters too</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Selectivity in rearrangement reactions is affected by the electronic nature of
 both the group
that migrates and the group that is left behind. But there is more! Stereochemistry is important
too. The outcome of diazotization and semipinacol rearrangement (Tiffeneau&#x002D;Demjanov <a class="page" id="page_957">Page 957, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>rearrangement, p. <a href="chapter_36.xhtml#page_949">949</a>) of this amino-alcohol depends entirely on the 
diastereoisomer you start with. There are four diastereoisomers, and we have drawn each one in the 
only conformation it can reasonably adopt, with the f-butyl group equatorial.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_957_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">In all of these reactions, the OH group provides the electronic 'push'. In the
 first two reactions, the ring contracts by an alkyl migration from the secondary alcohol, while in
 the third it is H that migrates from the same position.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"> <img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img> Interactive explanation of the
stereochemistry of rearrangements</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The only difference between the compounds is stereochemistry and, if we look at
 the orbitals involved in the reactions, we can see why this is so important. As the N<sub>2</sub> 
leaving group departs, electrons in the bond to the migrating group have to flow into the C-N o* 
orbital&#x2014; we discussed this on p. <a href="chapter_36.xhtml#page_949">949</a>. But what we didn't talk about then was the fact that
 best overlap between these two orbitals (o and o*) occurs if they are anti-periplanar to one
 another&#x2014;just as in an E2 elimination reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_957_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">For the first two compounds, with the -N&#x002B; group equatorial, the group 
best placed to migrate is the alkyl group that forms the ring; for the third reaction, there is a 
hydrogen atom anti- periplanar to the leaving group, so H migrates.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_957_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The fourth reaction has, rather than a group that might migrate, the hydroxyl
 group ideally placed to displace N<sub>2</sub> and form an epoxide.?<a class="page" id="page_958">Page 958, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>
<p class="htwindent1">The requirement for the migrating group to be anti-periplanar to the leaving 
group is quite general in rearrangement reactions. The reason we haven't noticed its effect before
 is that most of the compounds we have considered have not been conformationally constrained in the 
way that these are. Free rotation means that the right geometry for rearrangement is always obtain
-able&#x2014;stereochemistry is not a factor in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, for example. We will 
come back to some more aspects of stereochemical control later in the chapter, when we deal with 
fragmentation reactions. Before then, we will consider one last rearrangement reaction, in which
 stereochemistry again plays an important controlling role.</p>
<p class="htwh2"><b>The Beckmann rearrangement</b></p>
<p class="htwnoindent">The industrial manufacture of nylon relies on the alkaline polymerization of a 
cyclic amide known trivially as caprolactam. Caprolactam can be produced by the action of sulfuric
 acid on the oxime of cyclohexanone in a rearrangement known as the <b>Beckmann rearrangement</b>.
</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_958_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The mechanism of the Beckman rearrangement follows the same pattern as a 
pinacol or Baeyer-Villiger reaction: acid converts the oxime OH into a leaving group, and an alkyl
 group migrates to nitrogen as water departs. The product cation is then trapped by water to give
 an amide.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"> <img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img> Interactive mechanism for the
Beckmann rearrangement</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This rearrangement is not confined to cyclic oximes, and other ways of 
converting OH to a leaving group also work, such as PCl<sub>5</sub>, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, and other 
acyl or sulfonyl chlorides. In an acyclic Beckmann rearrangement, the product cation is better
 represented as this nitrilium ion. When we write the mechanism we can then involve the nitrogen's 
lone pair to 'push' the migrating group back on to N.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em">

is impossible in a sevenmembered
ring of the last
example.</p></div></aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Which group migrates in the Beckmann rearrangement?</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the Beckmann rearrangement of unsymmetrical ketones there are two groups 
that could migrate. There are also two possible geometrical isomers of an unsymmetrical oxime: 
C&#x003D;N double bonds can exhibit <i>cis/trans</i> isomerism just as C&#x003D;C double bonds can.
 When mixtures of geometrical isomers of oximes are rearranged, mixtures of products result, but
 the ratio of products mirrors exactly the ratio of geometrical isomers in the starting materials
&#x2014;the group that has migrated is in each case the group <i>trans</i> to the OH in the 
starting material.<a class="page" id="page_959">Page 959, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_959_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We have already touched on the idea that, for migration to occur, a migrating
 group has to be able to interact with the o* of the bond to the leaving group, and this is the 
reason for the specificity here. In the example a couple of pages back the stereospecificity of the
 reaction was due to the starting material being constrained in a conformationally rigid ring. Here
 it is the C&#x003D;N double bond that provides the constraint. If one of the alkyl chains is 
branched, more of the oxime with the OH group <i>anti</i> to that chain will be formed and 
correspondingly more of the branched group will migrate.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_959_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Conditions that allow those double bond isomers to interconvert can allow 
either group to migrate&#x2014; which one does so will then be decided, as in the Baeyer-Villiger
 reaction, by electronic factors. Most protic acids allow the oxime isomers to equilibrate, so, for
 example, this tosylated oxime rearranges with full stereospecificity in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3
</sub> (the <i>anti</i> methyl group migrates), but with TsOH, equilibration of the oxime 
geometrical isomers means that either group could migrate&#x2014;in the event, the propyl group
 (which is more able to support a positive charge) migrates faster.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_959_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Notice that the effect of the Beckmann rearrangement is to insert a 
<i>nitrogen</i> atom next to the carbonyl group. It forms a useful trio with the Baeyer-Villiger
 <i>oxygen</i> insertion and the diazoalkane <i>carbon</i> insertion.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Beckmann fragmentation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">To introduce the theme of the last section of this chapter, a Beckmann 
rearrangement that is not all that it seems. t-Butyl groups migrate well in the Baeyer-Villiger 
reaction and, indeed, Beckmann rearrangement of the compound in the margin appears to be quite 
normal too. But, when this compound and another compound with a tertiary centre next to the oxime
 are mixed together and treated with acid, it becomes apparent that what is happening is not an
 intramolecular reaction.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Each migrating tertiary group must have lost contact with the amide fragment it
 started out with. The molecule must fall apart to give a f&#x002D;alkyl cation and a nitrile: the

<p class="htwindent1">Migrating groups have to provide some degree of cation stabilization.
 But if they stabilize a

You should not use
the second of these names and,
in any case, Beckmann fragmentation
is much better than
either.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Here is a more convincing example of the same fragmentation reaction: the
 conditions, but
not the results, are those of a Beckmann rearrangement. In this reaction, the ring structure
means the cation cannot be trapped by the nitrile, and a fragmentation product is isolated.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Polarization of C&#x002D;C bonds helps fragmentation</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Up to now, you have met few fragmentation reactions&#x2014;reactions in which 
C&#x002D;C bonds
are broken&#x2014;largely because the C&#x002D;C bond is so strong. Why then does the Beckmann <a class="page" id="page_961">Page 961, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>fragmentation work? Well, the reason C&#x002D;C bonds are hard to break is not just because of their
strength, as the table of bond energies indicates.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">For both carbon and hydrogen, a bond to oxygen is stronger than a bond to carbon. Yet we
have no hesitation in breaking O&#x002D;H bonds (of, say, carboxylic acids) with even the weakest of
bases and we have spent much of this chapter showing C&#x002D;O bonds of protonated alcohols
rupturing spontaneously! What is going on?</p>

<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_961_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The answer is polarization. Oxygen&#x2019;s electronegativity means that 
C&#x2019;O and O&#x002D;H bonds
are polarized and are easy to break with hard nucleophiles and bases; C&#x002D;C and C&#x002D;H bonds 
are
(usually) not polarized and, although weaker, are harder to break. It follows that to break a
C&#x002D;C bond it helps a lot if it is polarized&#x002D;there needs to be a source of electrons 
at one end
and an electron &#x2018;sink&#x2019; (into which they can fl ow) at the other.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Numbering the atoms shows which bond fragments&#x2014;now we need to provide a 
source and a sink for the electrons to polarize the bond. Protonation of a hydroxyl group provides
 the sink&#x2014;it can now leave as water. And the lone pair of the other oxygen provides the 
source. You can think of the electrons in the C&#x2014;C bond being pushed&#x2019; by the oxygen&#x2019;s lone
 pair and &#x2019;pulled&#x2019; by the departing water&#x2014;until the bond breaks. A bit of extra impetus 
comes from release of ring strain: C&#x2014;C bonds in three&#x002D; and four&#x002D;membered rings
 are weaker than usual (by about 120 kJ mol<sup>&#x002D;1</sup>).</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Fragmentations are controlled by stereochemistry</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The control of rearrangements can be stereoelectronic in origin&#x2014;if a 
molecule is to rearrange, orbitals have to be able to overlap. This means that, for a Beckmann <i>
rearrangement,</i> the migrating group has to be <i>trans</i> to the leaving group. Not 
surprisingly, the same is true for Beckmann fragmentations like the one at the end of the last 
section, where the green fragmenting bond is <i>trans</i> to the leaving group. Before we extend 
these ideas any further, consider these two quite different reactions of quite similar compounds. </p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_962_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1"><a class="page" id="page_963">Page 963, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a>Just as with the rearrangements we looked at on p. <a href="chapter_36.xhtml#page_933">933</a>, we need to draw these 
compounds in reasonable chair conformations in order to understand what is going on. In the 
<i>cis</i> isomer, both substituents can be equatorial; in the <i>trans</i> isomer one has to be
 axial, and this will be mainly the OTs group, since the two methyl groups of NMe<sub>2</sub> 
suffer greater 1,3&#x002D;diaxial interactions.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_963_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, the <i>cis</i> isomer has clearly undergone a fragmentation reaction and,
 as usual, number&#x002D;ing the atoms can help to identify the bond that breaks. The nitrogen lone pair 
pushes, the departing tosylate pulls, and the resulting iminium ion hydrolyses to the product 
aldehyde.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_963_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Yet the <i>trans</i> isomer does this only in very low yield. Mostly it 
eliminates TsOH to give a mixture of alkenes. Why? Well, notice that, in the <i>cis</i> isomer, 
the fragmenting bond is <i>trans</i> to the leaving group&#x2014;indeed, it is both parallel and 
<i>trans</i> (in other words anti&#x002D;periplanar) to the leaving group. Electrons can flow smoothly

<h2 class="htwh2">Ring expansion by fragmentation</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Ring sizes greater than eight are hard to make. Yet five&#x002D; and six&#x002D;membered 
rings are easy to make. Once you realize that a fused pair of six&#x002D;membered rings is really a ten
&#x002D;membered ring with a bond across the middle, the potential for making medium rings by 
fragmentation becomes apparent.?</p>

<p class="htwindent1">This is the simple overall result, but there is more to explore. The starting
 hydroxytosylate can exist as four diastereoisomers: two <i>trans&#x002D;decalins</i> and two 
cis&#x002D;decalins. What is more, the product has a double bond in a ten&#x002D;membered ring: will it be
 <i>cis</i> or <i>trans?</i> (Both are possible in a ring with more than eight members: see 
<a href="chapter_29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>.) One of the four diastereoisomers of the starting material cannot place the tosylate
 anti&#x002D;periplanar to the ring&#x002D;fusion bond, so it can&#x2019;t fragment. The other three diastereoisomers
 all can, but two of them give a <i>trans</i> double bond while the third gives <i>cis</i>.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Looking at the alignment of the bonds that end up fl anking the double bond in 
the product
shows you where the geometrical isomers come from: these are the black bonds in the starting
material, and are trans across the forming &#x03C0; system in the fi rst two isomers and cis in the third.
Fragmentations are stereospecifi c with regard to double&#x002D;bond geometry, much as E2 elimination
reactions are.</p>

<p class="htwdivi">Corey applied this stereospecificity in conjunction with a ring expansion 
reaction to make the natural product caryophyllene. Caryophyllene is a bicyclic molecule with a
 nine&#x002D;membered ring containing an <i>E</i> trisubstituted double bond. The right relative 
stereochemistry in the starting material leads both to fragmentation of the right bond and to
 formation of the alkene with the right stereochemistry.</p>

 five&#x002D;membered ring and fragmentation of the 12,5&#x002D;ring system is a useful route to these
 15&#x002D;membered ring compounds.?</p>

<p class="htwnoindenta">Albert Eschenmoser (1925&#x002D;)
working at the ETH in Zurich,
synthesized vitamin B12, at the
time (1973) the most complicated
molecule yet made, in
what was for that era an
un usual international collaboration
with Woodward at Harvard.</p></div></aside>
<h3 class="h3">The Eschenmoser fragmentation</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the late 1960s, the Swiss chemist Albert Eschenmoser discovered an important 
reaction that can be used to achieve similar ring expansions and that now bears his name, the 
Eschenmoser fragmentation. The starting material for an Eschenmoser fragmentation is the epoxide of 
an a,P&#x002D;unsaturated ketone. The fragmentation happens when this epoxyketone is treated with 
tosylhydrazine, and one of the remarkable things about the product is that it is an alkyne.
The fragmentation happens across the epoxide (shown in black), and the product contains both a 
ketone (in a different place from the ketone in the starting material) and an alkyne. You can see 
how in this case hydrogenation of the triple bond can give muscone (R&#x003D;Me) or exaltone 
(R&#x003D;H).</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_965_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The Eschenmoser fragmentation does not have to be a ring expansion, and it is a 
useful synthetic method for making keto&#x002D;alkynes. The following reaction, which we will use to 
discuss the fragmentation&#x2019;s mechanism, was used to make an intermediate in the synthesis of an 
insect pheromone, exo&#x002D;brevicomin.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_965_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reaction starts with formation of the tosylhydrazone from the epoxyketone. 
The tosyl&#x002D; hydrazone is unstable with respect to opening of the epoxide in an elimination reaction,
 and it is this elimination that sets up the familiar 1, 2, 3, 4 system ready for fragmentation.
 The &#x2019;push&#x2019; comes from the newly created hydroxyl group, and the &#x2019;pull&#x2019; from the irresistible 
concerted loss of a good leaving group (Ts<sup>&#x002D;</sup>) and an even better one (N<sub>2</sub>). 
Notice how all the (green) bonds that break are parallel to one another, held anti&#x002D;periplanar by 
two double bonds. Perfect&#x0021; </p>

<h2 class="htwh2">The synthesis of nootkatone: fragmentation showcase</h2>
<p class="htwindent1">To finish this chapter, we will present three different synthetic routes to the same compound,
all of which illustrate the power of fragmentation in the synthesis of cyclic compounds.
The story starts with grapefruit, which contains a simple bicyclic enone called
nootkatone. It was assumed, wrongly as it happens, that the scent of grapefruit came from
this compound, and in the 1970s there was quite a rush to synthesize this compound in various
laboratories. A remarkable feature of many successful syntheses was the use of fragmentation
reactions. We shall describe parts of three syntheses involving the fragmentation of a
six&#x002D;, a four&#x002D;, and a three&#x002D;membered ring.</p>
 <aside class="abc" style="margin&#x002D;top:&#x002D;8em">
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_966_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Most syntheses make the side&#x002D;chain alkene by an elimination reaction so the fi rst &#x2018;disconnection&#x2019;
is an FGI adding HX back into the alkene. The last C&#x002D;C bond&#x002D;forming operation in most
syntheses is an intramolecular aldol reaction to make the enone so that can be disconnected
next. It is the starting material for the aldol, a simple monocyclic diketone, which is usually
made by a fragmentation reaction because this is a good way to set up the stereochemistry.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin&#x002D;top:&#x002D;6em">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"> <img src="../images/arrow.jpg"></img>The terminology
(&#x2018;disconnection&#x2019;, &#x2018;FGI&#x2019;) in this
paragraph derives from
<a href="chapter_28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>.</p></aside>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_966_5.jpg" alt="images"/><a class="page" id="page_967">Page 967, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Fragmentation of a three&#x002D;membered ring</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">This synthesis does not look as though it will lead to nootkatone because the
 fragmentation product still requires a great deal of modification. It has the advantage that the 
stereochemistry is correct at one centre at least. The sequence starts from natural (&#x002D;)&#x002D;carone: 
conjugate addition of the enolate to butenone without control leads to a bicyclic diketone with one
 extra stereogenic centre. The enone adds to the bottom face of the enolate opposite the dimethyl&#x002D; 
cyclopropane ring so the methyl group is forced upwards.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_967_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now the diketone is cyclized by a Robinson&#x002D;style aldol condensation in HCl to 
give a bicyclic enone. But during the reaction, a new six&#x002D;membered ring has been formed while the 
old three&#x002D;membered ring has disappeared, evidently by fragmentation.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_967_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The fragmentation is pulled by the enone (with some help from the acid) and 
pushed by the stability of a tertiary carbocation as well as the release of strain as the single 
bond that is fragmented is in a three&#x002D;membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_967_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Addition of a proton to the end of the enol and a chloride ion to the cation 
gives the product. The further development of this compound into nootkatone is beyond the scope of 
this book.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fragmentation of a four&#x002D;membered ring</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">This approach leads directly to the enone needed for nootkatone. A diketone
 prepared from a natural terpene is also treated with HCl and much the same reactions ensue except
 that the fragmentation now breaks open a four&#x002D;membered ring. First, the intramolecular aldol 
reaction to make the second six&#x002D;membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_967_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now the fragmentation, which follows much the same course as the last one: the 
enone again provides the electron pull while the cleavage of a strained C&#x2014;C single bond in a
 four&#x002D;mem&#x002D; bered ring to give a tertiary carbocation provides the electron push. A simple 
elimination is all that is needed to make nootkatone from this bicyclic chloroenone.?<a class="page" id="page_968">Page 968, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_968_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Fragmentation of a six&#x002D;membered ring</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">This chemistry is quite different from the examples we have just seen. The 
starting material has a bridged bicyclic structure and was made by a Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction. 
Fragmentation is initiated by formic acid (HCO<sub>2</sub>H), which protonates the tertiary alcohol
 and creates a tertiary carbocation. The ether provides the push. More serious electronic 
interactions are needed in this fragmentation as the C&#x2014;C bond being broken is not in a 
strained ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_968_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The yield of 50&#x0025; may not seem wonderful, but there is obviously a lot of
 chemistry going on here so it is perfectly acceptable when so much is being achieved. The first 
stage is the fragmentation itself. Drawing the product first of all in the same shape as the 
starting material and then redrawing, to ensure that we don&#x2019;t make a mistake, we discover that we
 are well on the way to nootkatone. Note that the stereochemistry of the two methyl groups comes 
directly from the stereochemistry of the starting materials and no new stereogenic centres are 
created in the fragmentation. Although one six&#x002D;membered ring is fragmented, another remains.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_968_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The first&#x002D;formed product now cyclizes to form the second six&#x002D;membered ring. 
This recreates a carbocation at the tertiary centre like the one that set off the fragmentation as 
the more nucleophilic end of the isolated alkene attacks the end of the conjugate electrophile. 
This is a thermodynamically controlled reaction with the new stereogenic centre choosing to have an
 equatorial substituent.</p>
<figure class="fig3"> 
<img src="../images/page_968_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The cation picks up the only nucleophile available&#x2014;formic acid. This 
gives the product of the fragmentation, which contains two unstable functional groups&#x2014;a 
tertiary formate ester and an enol ether&#x2014;and this product is not isolated from the reaction 
mixture. In water it hydrolyses to the enone, which undergoes elimination of formate to give 
nootkatone on heating. </p>

<img src="../images/page_968_5.jpg" alt="images"/><a class="page" id="page_969">Page 969, Chapter36 Participation, rearrangement, and fragmentation</a></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Yet after all this effort, none of the synthetic samples of nootkatone 
delivered that intense grapefruit smell&#x2014;for the simple reason that nootkatone is not the
 flavour principle of grapefruit&#x0021; The samples of nootkatone that had been isolated from 
grapefruit contained minute traces of the true flavour principle&#x2014;a simple thiol. Humans can 
detect 2 x 10<sup>&#x002D;5</sup> ppb (parts per <i>billion)</i> of this compound, so even the tiniest 
trace is very powerful. Nonetheless, the syntheses allowed chemists to correct a misconception.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Looking forward</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Fragmentation reactions cleave C&#x2014;C single bonds by a combination of 
electron push and electron pull so that both electrons in the bond move in the same direction as 
the bond breaks. In the next chapter we shall see reactions that break C&#x2014;C bonds in a quite
 different way. No electron push or pull is required because one electron goes one way and one the 
other. These are radical reactions.</p>
