<h2 class="h2">Selectivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most organic molecules contain more than one functional group, and most functional groups can react in more than one way, so organic chemists often have to predict <i>which</i> functional group will react, <i>where</i> it will react, and <i>how</i> it will react. These questions are what we call <i>selectivity</i> </p>
<p class="indent">Selectivity comes in three sorts: chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Chemoselectivity is <i>which</i> group reacts; regioselectivity is <i>where</i> it reacts. Stereoselectivity is <i>how</i> the group reacts with regard to the stereochemistry of the product.</p>
<div class="ybox">
<p class="crh3"><b><span class="bull1">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Selectivity</b></p>
<p class="cbh3a0"><b>There are three main types of selectivity:</b></p>
<p class="cbh3a2"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<b>chemoselectivity: <i>which</i> functional group will react (this chapter)</b></p>

</div>
<p class="indent">We have talked a lot about regioselectivity, without calling it that, in the last two chapters. In <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> you learned how to predict and explain which product(s) you get from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The functional group is the aromatic ring: <i>where</i> it reacts is the reaction&#x2019;s regioselectivity. In <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> you saw that nucleophilic addition to an unsaturated ketone can take place in a 1,2- or 1,4-fashion&#x2014;the question of which happens <i>(where</i> the unsaturated ketone reacts) is a question of regioselectivity. We will address regioselectivity in much more detail in the next chapter.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">But this chapter is about <i>chemoselectivity</i>&#x2014;in a compound with more than one functional group, which group reacts? Let&#x2019;s start with a straightforward example&#x2014;the synthesis of the painkiller paracetamol. 4-Aminophenol could react with acetic anhydride at both nitrogen and oxygen to give a compound containing an amide and an ester functional group. This is what happens on heating with excess acetic anhydride (Ac<sub>2</sub>O) in toluene.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg529-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But with just one equivalent of acetic anhydride in the presence of a base (pyridine) only the NH<sub>2</sub> group is acylated, and paracetamol is the product. This is chemoselectivity, and it is to be expected that the NH<sub>2</sub> group is more nucleophilic than the OH group. It is even possible to hydrolyse the doubly acetylated product to paracetamol with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The ester is more reactive than the amide and hydrolyses much more easily. This is another chemo-selective reaction.</p>

<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> Why amines are more nucleophilic than alcohols and why esters are more reactive than amides was all explained in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We know that ketones are more reactive towards Grignard reagents and organolithiums than esters because you can&#x2019;t isolate a ketone from the reaction of an ester with a Grignard reagent or an organolithium. Chemists at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer made use of this fact while they were developing anticonvulsants related to the tranquillizer oblivon. By adding lithium acetylide to ketones, they were able to make a tertiary alcohol by chemoselective reaction of a ketone in the presence of an ester.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">These last two reactions work because, although each starting material contains two carbonyl groups, one is more electrophilic and therefore more reactive towards nucleophiles (OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in the first case; lithium acetylide in the second) than the other.

<h2 class="h2">Reducing agents</h2>
<p class="noindent">Chemists at Glaxo exploited this reactivity sequence in their synthesis of the anti-asthma drug salmefamol (sister compound to the bestseller salbutamol). Three reducing agents are used in the sequence: sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), hydrogen gas over a palladium catalyst, and lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg530-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We shall use this synthesis as a basis for discussion on chemoselectivity in reductions. In the first step, sodium borohydride leaves the carbonyl group of the ester untouched while it reduces the ketone (in orange); in the last step, lithium aluminium hydride reduces the ester (in black). These chemoselectivities are typical of these two most commonly used reducing agents: borohydride can usually be relied upon to reduce an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of an ester, while lithium aluminium hydride will reduce almost any carbonyl group.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<h3 class="ch4">Why not use LiAlH<sub>4</sub> all the time?</h3>
<p class="noindent2">In general, it&#x2019;s best to use the mildest conditions possible for any particular reaction&#x2014;the potential for unwanted side-reactions is lessened. What is more, NaBH<sub>4</sub> is a lot easier to handle than LiAlH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;for example, it simply dissolves in water while LiAlH<sub>4</sub> catches fire if it gets wet. NaBH<sub>4</sub> is usually used to reduce aldehydes and ketones, even though LiAlH<sub>4</sub> also works.</p>

Sodium borohydride will reduce only in protic solvents (usually ethanol or methanol) or in the presence of electrophilic metal cations such as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (LiBH<sub>4</sub> can be used in THF, for example).

The developing <a id="page_531" class="page">Page 531, Chapter 23: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>negative charge on oxygen is protonated by the alcohol, and resulting alkoxide adds to the boron during or immediately after the reduction.

As a milder alternative (needed because LiAlH<sub>4</sub> has caused countless fires through careless handling), lithium borohydride in alcoholic solution will reduce esters&#x2014;in fact, it has useful selectivity for esters over acids or amides that LiAlH<sub>4</sub> does not have. <i>Sodium</i> borohydride reduces most esters only very slowly.</p>

The mechanism follows a similar course to the reduction of esters: both are written out in detail below, and there is a key difference at the steps boxed in orange and in green. In the orange box, loss of alkoxide from the tetrahedral intermediate forms an aldehyde, which is reduced further. This doesn&#x2019;t happen with amides; instead the anionic oxygen is lost&#x2014;assisted by coordination to aluminium&#x2014;to form an iminium ion.

<h3 class="h3">How to reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols</h3>
<p class="noindent">The best reagent for this is borane, BH<sub>3</sub>. Borane is, in fact, a gas with the structure B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, but it can be &#x2018;tamed&#x2019; as a liquid by complexing it with ether (Et<sub>2</sub>O), THF, or dimethyl sulfi de (DMS, Me<sub>2</sub>S).</p>

<p class="indent">Although borane appears superficially similar to borohydride, it is not charged, and that makes all the difference to its reactivity. Whereas borohydride reacts best with the most electrophilic carbonyl groups, borane&#x2019;s reactivity is dominated by its desire to accept an electron pair into the boron&#x2019;s empty p orbital. In the context of carbonyl group reductions, this means that <b>borane reduces electron-rich carbonyl groups fastest</b>. The carbonyl groups of <a id="page_532" class="page">Page 532, Chapter 23: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>acyl chlorides and esters are relatively electron-poor (Cl and OR are very electronegative); borane will not touch acyl chlorides and reduces esters only slowly.

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Borane reacts with carboxylic acids first of all to form triacylborates, with evolution of hydrogen gas. Esters are usually less electrophilic than ketones because of conjugation between the carbonyl group and the lone pair of the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized oxygen atom&#x2014;but, in these boron esters, the oxygen next to the boron has to share its lone pair between the carbonyl group and the boron&#x2019;s empty p orbital, so they are considerably more reactive than normal esters.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Borane and lithium borohydride are a most useful pair of reducing agents, with opposite selectivities. Japanese chemists used an enzyme to make a single enantiomer of the acid below, and were able to reduce either the ester or the carboxylic acid by choosing lithium borohydride or borane as their reagent. Check for yourself that the lactones (cyclic esters) in black frames are enantiomers.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg532-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Because borane reacts well with electron-rich carbonyl groups, it is also a good alternative to LiAlH<sub>4</sub> for reducing amides to amines, and is chemoselective even in the presence of an ester:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg532-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The carbonyl group of an amide is electron-rich because it receives electron density from the delocalized N lone pair. It therefore complexes well with the empty p orbital of the Lewis acidic borane. Hydride transfer is then possible from anionic boron to electrophilic carbon. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses to an iminium ion that is reduced again by the borane.</p>

<h3 class="h3">How to reduce esters or amides to aldehydes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The step boxed in orange in the ester reduction scheme on p. <a href="chapter_23.xhtml#page_531">531</a> gave an aldehyde. The aldehyde is more readily reduced than the ester, so the reduction doesn&#x2019;t stop there, but carries on to the alcohol oxidation level. How, then, can you reduce an ester to an aldehyde? This is a real problem in synthetic chemistry&#x2014;the ester below, for example, is easy to make by methods you will meet in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, but an important synthesis of the antibiotic monensin requires the aldehyde.</p>

<p class="indent">In this case, the chemists decided simply to put up with the fact that LiAlH<sub>4</sub> gives the alcohol, and oxidize the alcohol back to the aldehyde using chromium(VI), the oxidant you met in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> (p. <a href="chapter_9.xhtml#page_194">194</a>). There is, however, a reagent that will sometimes do the job in a single step, although you must bear in mind that this is not at all a general reaction. The reagent is known as DIBAL or DIBALH&#x2014;diisobutyl aluminium hydride, <i>i</i>-Bu<sub>2</sub>AlH.</p>

Its chemistry is in many ways like borane&#x2014;it exists as a bridged dimer, and it becomes a reducing agent only after it has formed a Lewis acid&#x2013;base complex, so like borane it too reduces electron-rich carbonyl groups most rapidly. DIBAL will reduce esters even at &#x2212;70 &#x00B0;C, and at this temperature the tetrahedral intermediate, formed by the transfer of hydride from aluminium to carbon (and shown below), may be stable. Only in the aqueous work-up does it collapse to the aldehyde. This step also destroys any excess DIBAL so no further reduction is possible.</p>

<p class="noindent">The simplest reducing agent is hydrogen itself, H<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen can&#x2019;t generally be used as a reducing agent for carbonyl compounds&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t nucleophilic enough. However, it can act as <a id="page_535" class="page">Page 535, Chapter 23: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a>a reducing agent for other, weaker, double and triple bonds, such as C=C, C=N, C&#x2261;C and C&#x2261;N. To do these reactions, a metal catalyst is required and the process is known as catalytic hydrogenation. The hydrogen is provided by a cylinder, perhaps via a balloon, or can be made by electrolysis and pumped with the substrate over the catalyst. In the example below, the alkene is reduced while the aldehyde remains untouched.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Palladium on charcoal (Pd/C) is usually 5&#x2013;10% by mass Pd and 90&#x2013;95% C. It is made by suspending charcoal powder in a PdCl<sub>2</sub> solution, and then reducing the PdCl<sub>2</sub> to Pd metal, usually with H<sub>2</sub> gas, but sometimes with formaldehyde, HCHO (which is oxidized to formic acid, HCO<sub>2</sub>H). The palladium metal precipitates on to the charcoal, which can be filtered off and dried. The fine Pd particles present maximum surface area to the reaction they catalyse and, while Pd is an expensive metal, it is recyclable since the Pd/C is insoluble and can be recovered by filtration.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The catalysts used to make hydrogen react with double bonds are transition metals: usually palladium (as in this example) or platinum, but sometimes nickel, rhodium, or ruthenium. We will talk about several different reductions in this section, but the mechanisms of all of them are similar, and very different from those involved in carbonyl reductions.</p>
<p class="indent">Catalytic hydrogenation takes place on the surface of the metal. The metal must therefore be finely divided, and is usually dispersed on the surface of an inert support. This is what &#x2018;Pd/C means&#x2014;finely divided palladium carried on a charcoal support. The first step is chemical absorption of hydrogen onto the metal surface, a process that results in breakage of the H&#x2013;H bonds and distributes hydrogen atoms where they can react with the organic substrate. Now the alkene can also bond to the metal, and hydrogen can be transferred from the metal to the alkene.</p>

You may find our mechanism rather unsatisfactory, but it is hard to draw curly arrows for the reactions involved here.

Their low melting points relative to animal fats are largely due to <i>cis</i> double bonds that disrupt the packing of the alkyl chains in the solid state. Treating the crude vegetable oil with hydrogen over a metal catalyst removes some of these double bonds, increases the proportion of saturated fat in the oil, and raises its melting point, making it suitable for making margarine.</p>

This requires rather subtle chemoselectivity: alkenes are usually hydrogenated at least as fast as alkynes, so we need to be sure the reaction stops once the alkene has been formed. The Lindlar catalyst is a palladium catalyst (Pd/CaCO<sub>3</sub>) deliberately poisoned with lead. The lead lessens the activity of the catalyst and makes further reduction of the alkene product slow: most palladium catalysts would reduce alkynes all the way to alkanes. Best selectivities are obtained if quinoline is also added to the reaction, and alkyne to alkene reductions work with Pd/ BaSO<sub>4</sub> &#x002B; quinoline too.

<h2 class="h2">Dissolving metal reductions</h2>
<p class="noindent">You will be familiar with the idea that many metals react with acid to liberate hydrogen, forming a salt at the same time. There is an example in the margin. The metal cation (Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>in this example) results from the loss of electrons, and these electrons reduce 2 &#x00D7; H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to give H<sub>2</sub>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The same thing happens even in very weak acids (water, alcohols.. .even liquid ammonia) if the metal is very reactive (sodium or potassium, say). You can think of the process here in two steps: first sodium releases an electron, then the electron is captured by a proton from NH<sub>3</sub> to give H, which forms H<sub>2</sub>. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and sodium amide (NaNH<sub>2</sub>, p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_171">171</a>) are made by dissolving sodium in ethanol or liquid ammonia, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">But what if, instead of just reducing the solvent to liberate hydrogen, we harness the electrons by giving them a more easily reduced substrate instead? A dissolving metal reduction results: note dissolv<i>ing</i> . The electrons have to be captured as the metal releases them, otherwise they will just reduce the solvent to give H<sub>2</sub>.<a id="page_542" class="page">Page 542, Chapter 23: Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</a></p>
<p class="indent">Dissolving metal reductions work because the electrons released as reactive metals form soluble cations that can be harnessed to do other, more useful, reductions. Electrons are the simplest possible reducing agents, and they will reduce carbonyl compounds, alkynes, or aromatic rings&#x2014;in fact any functional group with a low-energy &#x03C0; orbital into which the electron can go.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Birch reduction of arenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">We shall start by looking at the dissolving metal reduction of aromatic rings, known as the <b>Birch reduction</b> . The margin shows the reaction of benzene with lithium in liquid ammonia. At first sight this reaction looks improbable, with an aromatic ring ending up as an unconjugated diene. The mechanism will explain why we get this regiochemistry, and also why the reaction stops there&#x2014;in other words, why the dissolving lithium reduces an aromatic ring more readily than an alkene.</p>

<p class="indent">The first thing to note is that when lithium or sodium dissolve in ammonia they give an intense blue solution. Blue is the colour of solvated electrons: these group 1 metals ionize to give Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<i>n</i> . With time, the blue colour fades, as the electrons reduce the ammonia to NH<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Birch reductions use those blue solutions, with their solvated electrons, as reducing agents. The reduction of NH<sub>3</sub> to >in> and H<sub>2</sub> is quite slow, and a better electron acceptor will get reduced in preference. With benzene, the electrons go into the lowest lying antibonding orbital (benzene&#x2019;s LUMO). The species we get can be represented in several ways, all of them radical anions (molecules with one excess unpaired electron). The radical anion is very basic, and it picks up a proton from the ethanol that is in the reaction mixture.</p>

<p class="indent">The molecule is now no longer anionic, but it is still a radical.

These Cr(V) species can oxidize alcohols in the same way and are thereby reduced to Cr(III) (the final metal-containing by-product).

The chemoselectivity you obtain is <i>kinetic chemoselectivity</i> &#x2014;reaction at one functional group is simply faster than at another.</p>
<p class="indent">Now look at the acylation of an amino alcohol (which is, in fact, a synthesis of the painkiller isobucaine) using benzoyl chloride under <i>acid</i> conditions.

<p class="noindent">The relative reactivity of the alcohol and amine in the example just given could be overturned by conducting a reaction under thermodynamic control. In kinetically controlled reactions, the idea that you can conduct chemoselective reactions on the more reactive of a pair of functional groups&#x2014; carbonyl-based ones, for example&#x2014;is straightforward. But what if you want to react the less reactive of the pair? There are two commonly used solutions. The first is illustrated by a compound needed by chemists in Cambridge to study an epoxidation reaction. They were able to make the following diol, but wanted to acetylate only the more hindered secondary hydroxyl group.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:2em;">
<img src="../images/pg547-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Treatment with one equivalent of an acetylating agent is no good because the primary hydroxyl group is more reactive; instead, the chemists acetylated both hydroxyl groups, and then treated the bis-acetate with mildly basic methanol (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, MeOH, 20 &#x00B0;C), which reacted only at the less hindered acetoxy group and gave the desired compound in 65% yield.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">In other words, start by letting both groups react and then go backwards so the reaction is reversed, but at only one of the two groups.

<h3 class="h3">How to react the less reactive group (II): protecting groups</h3>
<p class="noindent">The more usual way of reacting a less reactive group in the presence of a more reactive one is to use a <b>protecting group</b> . This tertiary alcohol, for example, could be made from a keto-ester if we could get phenylmagnesium bromide to react with the ester rather than with the ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

In a synthesis of the natural product porantherine, a compound based on the structure in the margin was needed. As it&#x2019;s a symmetrical secondary alcohol (see p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_216">216</a>), a good way to make it is to add a Grignard reagent twice to ethyl formate.</p>

<p class="indent">Why can&#x2019;t we just use a simple alkyl ether (methyl, say) to protect a hydroxyl group? There is no problem making the ether, and it will survive most reactions&#x2014;but there <i>is</i> a problem getting an ether off again. This is always a consideration in protecting group chemistry&#x2014; you want a group that is stable to the conditions of whatever reaction you are going to do (in these examples, strong bases and nucleophiles), but can then be removed under mild conditions that do not result in decomposition of a sensitive molecule. What we need then is an ether that has an Achilles&#x2019; heel&#x2014;a feature that makes it susceptible to attack by some specific reagent or under specific conditions. One such group is the tetra hydropyranyl (THP) group. Although it is stable under basic conditions, as an ether would be, it is an acetal&#x2014;the presence of the second oxygen atom is its Achilles&#x2019; heel and makes the THP protecting group susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic conditions. You could see the lone pair on the second oxygen atom as a safety catch that is released only in the presence of acid.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg550-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Making the THP acetal has to be done in an unfamiliar way because the usual &#x2018;carbonyl plus two alcohols&#x2019; method is inappropriate (work out why&#x0021;). Alcohols are protected by treating them with an enol ether, dihydropyran, under acid catalysis. Notice the oxonium intermediate (formed by a familiar mechanism from <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>)&#x2014;just as in a normal acetal-forming reaction. In this example the THP group is at work preventing a hydroxyl group from interfering in the reduction of an ester.</p>

<p class="noindent2">A little further inspection will show you that the THP group here is not just stopping the OH interfering with the LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduction, but is also crucial to the preservation of the chirality of this compound. The wedged bond shows you that the starting material is a single enantiomer: without a protecting group on one of the hydroxyls, they would be identical and the compound would no longer be chiral. The THP group also complicates the situation by introducing an extra chiral centre, and hence the potential for two diastereoisomers, which we will ignore.</p>

<p class="indent">This time, however, TBDMS will not do because the protecting group needs to withstand the acidic conditions needed to remove the THP protecting group&#x0021; What is more, the protecting group needs to be able to survive acid conditions in later steps of the synthesis of the insecticide. The answer is to use a third type of hydroxyl-protecting group, a benzyl ether. Benzyl (Bn) protecting groups are put on using strong base (usually sodium hydride) plus benzyl bromide, and are stable to both acid and base.</p>

Here&#x2019;s one way to avoid using them. During the development of the anti-asthma drug salbutamol, the triol below was needed. With large quantities of salbutamol already available, it seemed most straightforward to make the triol by adding phenylmagnesium bromide to an ester available from salbutamol. Unfortunately, the ester also contains three acidic protons, making it look as though the hydroxyl and amine groups all need protecting. But, in fact, it was possible to do the reaction just by adding a large excess of Grignard reagent: enough to remove the acidic protons <i>and</i> to add to the ester.</p>

<p class="indent">This strategy is easy to try, and, providing the Grignard reagent isn&#x2019;t valuable (you can buy PhMgBr in bottles), is much more economical than putting on protecting groups and taking them off again. But it doesn&#x2019;t always work&#x2014;there is no way of telling whether it will until you try the reaction in the laboratory. In this closely related reaction, for example, the same chemists found that they needed to protect both the phenolic hydroxyl group (but not the other alcohol OH) as a benzyl ether and the amine NH as a benzyl amine. Both protecting groups come off in one hydrogenation step.</p>

<p class="indent">Benzyl groups are one way of protecting secondary amines against strong bases that might deprotonate them.

<h3 class="h3">Peptide synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Peptide synthesis has become one of the most reliable and predictable fields of practical organic chemistry, principally because of the effectiveness of the protecting groups it employs. For this reason, peptides are one of the few classes of complex organic molecules that can routinely be made by machines, such as the one on the right, in which much of the chemistry we are about to talk about takes place without any human intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">Biology makes peptides and proteins by selectively coupling together members of a pool of 20 or so amino acids. To do the same in the laboratory, we need to overcome a number of challenges. For example, we&#x2019;ll start by thinking about how to react two amino acids together, to make a dipeptide&#x2014;leucine and glycine, for example. If we want the NH<sub>2</sub> group of glycine to react with the CO<sub>2</sub>H group of leucine we will first have to activate the carboxylic acid towards nucleophilic substitution&#x2014;by making the acyl chloride, say, or a particularly reactive ester, which we will represent as RCOX.</p>

<p class="indent">For this reason, we need to protect both the NH<sub>2</sub> group of leucine and the CO<sub>2</sub>H group of glycine. What sort of protecting groups do they need to be? We will need to be able to take them off again once they have done their job, so there is no point using, say, an amide to protect the amine since we would have great diffi culty hydrolysing the amide in the presence of the amide bond we are trying to form. Not only do we want the protecting groups to be removable under mild conditions, but we want two groups (one for each of NH<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>H) which we can take off under <i>different</i> conditions.

The &#x2018;synthetic&#x2019; version of the hormone, syntocinon (identical, of course, with the natural version isolated from human placentas, although without the dangers of biological contamination), is regularly used in modern obstetrics to induce labour in women whose babies are overdue.</p>

The first step in the synthesis of oxytocin is indeed the coupling of glycine (through its amino group) with leucine. This is how it was done by du Vigneaud and Bodanszky. First, the carboxylic acid of the glycine was protected as an ethyl ester. Making an ester is the obvious way to stop CO<sub>2</sub>H groups interfering as acids or as nucleophiles. However, simple methyl and ethyl esters may pose problems&#x2014;they can still react with such nucleophiles as amines. Ethyl esters of amino acids are therefore stable only if the NH<sub>2</sub> group is protected.

<h3 class="h3">The Boc protecting group&#x2014;gastrin and aspartame</h3>
<p class="noindent">Gastrin is a hormone released from the stomach that controls the progress of digestion. Early work on the hormone showed that only the four C-terminal amino acids of the peptide (the C-terminal tetrapeptide) were necessary for its physiological activity.</p>
<p class="indent">The synthesis starts with the coupling of two more amino acids: aspartic acid and phenyl-alanine. As you would expect, the carboxylic acid group of phenylalanine is protected, this time as a methyl ester, and the NH<sub>2</sub> group of aspartic acid is protected as a Cbz derivative. Since aspartic acid has two carboxylic acid groups, one of these also has to be protected. Here is the method&#x2014;first the Cbz group is put on; then both acids are protected as <i>benzyl</i> esters. Then just one of the benzyl esters is hydrolysed. It may seem surprising to you that this chemoselective hydrolysis is possible, and you could not have predicted that it would work without trying it out in the laboratory.</p>

<p class="noindent2">At this point in one synthesis of the tetrapeptide in the laboratories of Searle, the now defunct American pharmaceutical company, a remarkable discovery occurred. The AspPhe methyl ester was accidentally found to taste sweet: extremely sweet&#x2014; about 200 times as sweet as sucrose. AspPhe is now known as aspartame, marketed under the brand name NutraSweet. It goes without saying that despite this extraordinary discovery, tasting anything in the laboratory, accidentally or otherwise, is extremely unwise, ill-judged, and outright dangerous. Donald Rumsfeld was once chief executive of Searle.</p>

<p class="indent">Like Cbz, the Boc group is a carbamate protecting group. But, unlike Cbz, it can be removed simply with dilute aqueous acid. Just 3M HCl will hydrolyse it, again by protonation, loss of <i>t</i>-butyl cation, and decarboxylation. Base, on the other hand, cannot touch the Boc group&#x2014; the carbonyl group is too hindered to be attacked even by OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and Boc is strongly resistant to basic hydrolysis.</p>
