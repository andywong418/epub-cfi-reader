<h2 class="h2">Alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups</h2>
<p class="noindent">To start this chapter, let us take you back to one of the first reactions we introduced: nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups. Here are two examples, both of which give products which you should fully expect. We&#x2019;ve included details of the IR spectra of the products to confirm firstly that the product has no carbonyl group and secondly that the alkene is still there.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Now let&#x2019;s tweak the conditions: we repeat the first reaction at a higher temperature, and we add to the second a small amount of a copper salt. Now the products are different:</p>

<p class="indent">Both products A and B have kept their carbonyl group (IR peak at 1710&#x2212;1715 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) but have lost the C=C. Yet A, at least, is unquestionably an addition product because it contains a C&#x2261;N peak at 2250 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, the identities of A and B are revealed here: they are the products of addition, not to the carbonyl group, but to the C=C bond. Here&#x2019;s a mechanism, for both reactions of cyanide: firstly the direct addition to C=O and secondly addition to the C=C bond.</p>

<p class="indent">This type of reaction, where a nucleophile adds to a C=C double bond, is called conjugate addition, and this chapter is about the sorts of alkenes (and arenes) that do this kind of thing. We will also explain how such small differences in reaction conditions (temperature, or the presence of CuCl) manage to change the outcome so dramatically.</p>
<p class="indent">But first we need to place these conjugate additions into context. As you found out in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <b>alkenes are nucleophilic</b>. Almost regardless of their substituents, they react with electrophiles such as bromine to form adducts in which the &#x03C0; bond of the alkene has been replaced by two &#x03C3; bonds.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Even when the alkene is conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group, as the alkenes on the last page were, bromine addition still occurs, although less readily. Never lose sight of this: alkenes are nucleophilic.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg499-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But as we have just seen, this last type of alkene also reacts with nucleophiles (such as cyanide, Grignard reagents, and, as you see below, more besides), and we now need to consider why.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_22.2">
<h2 class="h2">Conjugated alkenes can be electrophilic</h2>
<p class="noindent">Conjugate additions occur only when the C=C double bond is immediately adjacent to the C=O group. They don&#x2019;t occur to C=C bonds that aren&#x2019;t conjugated (see the box on p. <a href="chapter_22.xhtml#page_501">501</a> for an illustration of this).</p>
<p class="indent">Compounds with double bonds adjacent to a C=O group are known as &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Many &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds have trivial names, and some are shown here. Some <i>classes</i> of &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds also have names such as &#x2018;enone&#x2019;, made up of &#x2018;ene&#x2019; (for the double bond) &#x002B; &#x2018;one&#x2019; (for ketone).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="noindent2">The &#x03B1; and &#x03B2; refer to the distance of the double bond from the C=O group: the &#x03B1; carbon is the one next to C=O <i>(not</i> the carbonyl carbon itself), the &#x03B2; carbon is one further down the chain, and so on.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg500-2.jpg" alt="images"/>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Most types of nucleophiles can be made to undergo conjugate additions with &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and seven examples are shown below. Note that many of these nucleophiles would not add to a simple carbonyl group: we will explain why shortly. Conjugate addition is also known as Michael addition, and the reactive &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds shown here are often known as Michael acceptors.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg500-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reason that &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds react differently is conjugation, the phenomenon we discussed in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. There we introduced you to the idea that bringing two &#x03C0; systems (two C=C bonds, for example, or a C=C bond and a C=O bond) close together leads to a stabilizing interaction. It also leads to modified reactivity, because the &#x03C0; bonds no longer react as independent functional groups but as a single, conjugated system.</p>

<p class="ch3">Termite self-defence and the reactivity of alkenes</p>
<p class="noindent">Soldier termites of the species <i>Schedorhinotermes lamanianus</i> defend their nests with secretions of the enone shown below (compound 1), which is very effective at taking part in conjugate addition reactions with thiols (RSH). This makes it highly toxic, since many important biochemicals carry SH groups (one is described on p. <a href="chapter_22.xhtml#page_508">508</a>). The worker termites of the same species&#x2014;who build the nests&#x2014;need to be able to avoid being caught in the crossfi re, so they are equipped with an enzyme that allows them to reduce compound 1 to compound 2. This still has a double bond, but the double bond is completely unreactive towards nucleophiles because it is not conjugated with a carbonyl group. The workers escape unharmed.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups become polarized</h3>
<p class="noindent">To show why alkenes conjugated with carbonyl groups behave differently from unconjugated alkenes, we use curly arrows to indicate delocalization of the &#x03C0; electrons over the four atoms in the conjugated system. Both representations are extremes, and the true structure lies somewhere in between, but the polarized structure indicates why the conjugated C=C bond is electrophilic and why the &#x03B2; carbon is attacked by nucleophiles.</p>

<img src="../images/pg501-3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="noindent">Think about electronegativities: O is much more electronegative than C, so it is quite happy to accept electrons, but here we have taken electrons away, leaving it with only six electrons.

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_22.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">Polarization is detectable spectroscopically</h3>
<p class="noindent">IR spectroscopy provides us with evidence for polarization in C=C bonds conjugated to C=O bonds. An unconjugated ketone C=O absorbs at 1715 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> while an unconjugated alkene C=C absorbs (usually rather weakly) at about 1650 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Bringing these two groups into conjugation in an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound leads to two peaks at 1675 and 1615 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively, both quite intense. The lowering of the frequency of both peaks is consistent with a weakening of both &#x03C0; bonds (notice that the polarized structure has only single bonds where the C=O and C=C double bonds were). The increase in the <i>intensity</i> of the C=C absorption is consistent with polarization brought about by conjugation with C=O: a conjugated C=C bond has a significantly larger dipole moment than its unconjugated cousins.</p>
<p class="indent">The polarization of the C=C bond is also evident in the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, with the signal for the sp<sup>2</sup> carbon atom furthest from the carbonyl group moving downfield relative to an unconjugated alkene to about 140 ppm, and the signal for the other double bond carbon atom staying at about 120 ppm.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Molecular orbitals control conjugate additions</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have spectroscopic evidence that a conjugated C=C bond is polarized, and we can explain this with curly arrows, but the actual bond-forming step must involve movement of electrons from the HOMO of the nucleophile to the LUMO of the unsaturated carbonyl compound. This example is an efficient (the reaction happens even at 0 &#x00B0;C) addition to acrolein (propenal) with methoxide as the nucleophile.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">But what does this LUMO look like? It will certainly be more complicated than the &#x03C0;<i>*</i> LUMO of a simple carbonyl group. The nearest thing you have met so far (in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) are the orbitals of butadiene (C= C conjugated with C= C), which we can compare with the &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein (C=C conjugated with C=O). The orbitals in the &#x03C0; systems of butadiene and acrolein are shown here. They are different because acrolein&#x2019;s orbitals are perturbed (distorted) by the oxygen atom (<a href="chapter_4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). You need not be concerned with exactly how the sizes of the orbitals are worked out, but for the moment just concentrate on the shape of the LUMO, the orbital that will accept electrons when a nucleophile attacks.</p>

<p class="indent">In the LUMO, the largest coefficient is on the &#x03B2; carbon of the &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated system, shown with an asterisk.

In the reaction you have just seen, the HOMO is the methoxide oxygen&#x2019;s lone pair, so this will be the key orbital interaction that gives rise to the new bond.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0; In acrolein, the HOMO is in fact not the highest filled &#x03C0; orbital you see here, but the lone pairs on oxygen.

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg502-3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The second largest coefficient is on the C=O carbon atom, so it&#x2019;s not surprising that some nucleophiles attack here as well&#x2014;remember the example right at the beginning of the chapter where you saw cyanide attacking either the double bond or the carbonyl group depending on the conditions of the reaction. We shall next look at some conjugate additions with alcohols and amines as nucleophiles, before reconsidering the question of where the nucleophile attacks.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Conjugate additions have enolates or enols as intermediates</h3>
<p class="noindent">So much for the addition step of the reaction. But the product of this step is of course not the final product of the reaction&#x2014;it is in fact an enolate. We hope you recognize these species from <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, where you saw them being made by treating carbonyl compounds with base. Conjugate addition is another way of generating an enolate, and as with all enolates, protonation gives back a carbonyl compound. The proton has to come from somewhere, so conjugate additions are usually done in protic solvents (such as alcohols or water). Here is another example with an alcohol as the nucleophile:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">

</figure>
<p class="indent">In alkaline solution, a small amount of alkoxide is produced (the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of an alcohol is slightly higher than that of water), which attacks the C=C double bond in a conjugate addition. The product is an enolate, which is protonated by water to give the final aldehyde, and regenerates hydroxide as it does so: only a catalytic amount of base is required for this type of reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg503-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Amines are good nucleophiles for conjugate addition. In the reaction below, aqueous dimethylamine is used in a sealed system to stop the amine evaporating (dimethylamine is a gas even at room temperature).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg503-3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">Amines are neutral nucleophiles, and the amine itself provides a proton for the enolate.</p>

Treatment of this &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ketone with HCl, for example, gives a chloroketone. The first step must be protonation of the carbonyl group, which makes the enone even more electrophilic by giving it a positive charge.

<h3 class="h3">Reaction conditions</h3>
<p class="noindent">The very first conjugate addition reaction in this chapter depended on the conditions of the reaction. Treating an enone with cyanide and an acid catalyst at low temperature gives a cyanohydrin by direct attack at C=O, while heating the reaction mixture leads to conjugate addition. What is going on?</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg504-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We&#x2019;ll consider the low-temperature reaction first. As you know from <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, it is quite normal for cyanide to react with a ketone under these conditions to form a cyanohydrin. You also know from <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> that cyanohydrin formation is reversible. Even if the equilibrium for cyanohydrin formation lies well over to the side of the products, there will always be a small amount of starting enone remaining. Most of the time, this enone will react to form more cyanohydrin and, as it does, some cyanohydrin will decompose back to enone plus cyanide&#x2014;such is the nature of a dynamic equilibrium. But every now and then&#x2014;at a much slower rate&#x2014;the starting enone will undergo a <i>conjugate addition</i> with the cyanide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<a id="page_505" class="page" style="width:107%;">Page 505, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now we have a different situation: conjugate addition is essentially an <i>irreversible</i> reaction, so once a molecule of enone has been converted to conjugate addition product, its fate is sealed: it cannot go back to enone again. Very slowly, therefore, the amount of conjugate addition product in the mixture will build up. In order for the enone&#x2013;cyanohydrin equilibrium to be maintained, any enone that is converted to conjugate addition product will have to be replaced by reversion of cyanohydrin to enone plus cyanide. Even at room temperature, we can therefore expect the cyanohydrin to be converted bit by bit to conjugate addition product. This may take a very long time, but reaction rates are faster at higher temperatures, so at 80 &#x00B0;C this process does not take long at all and, after a few hours, the cyanohydrin has all been converted to conjugate addition product.</p>
<p class="indent">The contrast between the two products is this: the cyanohydrin is <b>formed faster</b> than the conjugate addition product, and is known as the product of kinetic control (or the kinetic product), but the conjugate addition product is the <b>more stable compound</b> and is the product of thermodynamic control (or the thermodynamic product). Typically, kinetic control involves lower temperatures and shorter reaction times, which ensures that only the fastest reaction has the chance to occur. And, typically, thermodynamic control involves higher temperatures and long reaction times to ensure that even the slower reactions have a chance to occur, and all the material is converted to the more stable compound.</p>

<p class="indent">Why is direct addition faster than conjugate addition? Well, although the carbon atom &#x03B2; to the C=O group carries some positive charge, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group carries more, and so electrostatic attraction for the charged nucleophiles will encourage it to attack the carbonyl group directly rather than undergo conjugate addition.</p>
<p class="indent">And why is the conjugate addition product the more stable? In the conjugate addition product, we gain a C-C &#x03C3; bond, losing a C=C &#x03C0; bond, but keeping the C=O &#x03C0; bond. With direct addition, we still gain a C-C bond, but we lose the C= O &#x03C0; bond and keep the C= C &#x03C0; bond. C= O &#x03C0; bonds are stronger than C=C &#x03C0; bonds, so the conjugate addition product is more stable.</p>
<p class="indent">Practically, then, to get conjugate addition to occur you just have to give the reaction plenty of energy and maybe plenty of time to find its way to the most stable product. Here&#x2019;s an example: note the temperature&#x0021;</p>

<p class="noindent">So far we have shown you conjugate additions mainly of &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated aldehydes and unsaturated &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-ketones. You won&#x2019;t be at all surprised to learn, however, that unsaturated acids, esters, amides, and nitriles&#x2014;in fact all carboxylic acid derivatives&#x2014;can also take part in conjugate addition reactions. Two examples, an amide and an ester, are shown on the right below. But notice how the selectivity of these reactions depends on the structure of the unsaturated compound: compare the way butyllithium adds to this &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated aldehyde and &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated amide. Both additions are irreversible, and BuLi attacks the reactive carbonyl group of the aldehyde, but prefers conjugate addition to the less reactive amide. Similarly, ammonia reacts with this acyl chloride to give an amide product that derives from direct<a id="page_506" class="page">Page 506, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a> addition to the carbonyl group, while with the ester it undergoes conjugate addition to give an amine.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg506-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">p>In both of these cases, the site of nucleophilic attack is determined simply by reactivity: the more reactive the carbonyl group, the more direct addition to C=O will result. The most reactive carbonyl groups, as you saw in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, are those that are not conjugated with O or N (as they are in esters and amides), and particularly reactive are acyl chlorides and aldehydes. In general, the proportion of direct addition to the carbonyl group follows the reactivity sequence in the margin.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The nature of the nucleophile: hard or soft</h3>
<p class="noindent">Among the best nucleophiles of all at doing conjugate addition are thiols, the sulfur analogues of alcohols. In this example, the nucleophile is thiophenol (phenol with the O replaced by S).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_507" class="page">Page 507, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a>Remarkably, no acid or base catalyst is needed (as it was with the alcohol additions), and the product is obtained in 94% yield under quite mild reaction conditions.</p>

<img src="../images/pg507-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">So what&#x2019;s so special about a thiol? As you&#x2019;ve seen already, attraction between nucleophiles and electrophiles is governed by two related interactions&#x2014;electrostatic attraction between positive and negative charges and orbital overlap between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the electrophile. Successful reactions usually result from a combination of both, but sometimes reactivity can be dominated by one or the other. The dominant factor, be it electrostatic or orbital control, depends on the nucleophile and electrophile involved. Nucleophiles containing small, electronegative atoms (such as O or Cl), which we call &#x2018;hard&#x2019;, tend to react under predominantly electrostatic control, while &#x2018;soft&#x2019; nuclophiles containing larger atoms (including the sulfur of thiols, but also P, I, and Se) are predominantly subject to control by orbital overlap.</p>

<p class="indent">What has all this to do with the conjugate addition of thiols? Well, an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound is unusual in that it has two electrophilic sites, one of which is hard and one of which is soft. The carbonyl group has a high partial charge on the carbonyl carbon and will tend to react with hard nucleophiles, such as organolithium and Grignard reagents, that have a high partial charge on the nucleophilic carbon atom. Conversely, the &#x03B2; carbon of the &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl system does not have a high partial positive charge but is the site of the largest coefficient in the LUMO. This makes the &#x03B2; carbon a soft electrophile and likely to react well with soft nucleophiles such as thiols.</p>

<p class="ch3"><b>Anticancer drugs that work by conjugate addition of thiols</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Drugs to combat cancer act on a range of biochemical pathways, but most commonly on processes that cancerous cells need to use to proliferate rapidly. One class attacks DNA polymerase, an enzyme needed to make the copy of DNA that has to be provided for each new cell. Helenalin and vernolepin are two such compounds, and if you look closely at their structure you should be able to spot two &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl groups in each. Biochemistry is just chemistry in very small fl asks called cells, and the reaction between DNA polymerase and these drugs is simply a conjugate addition reaction between a thiol (the SH group of one of the enzyme&#x2019;s cysteine residues) and the unsaturated carbonyl groups. The reaction is irreversible and shuts down completely the function of the enzyme.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg508-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For this reason any compound capable of conjugate addition is potentially dangerous to living things. Even simple compounds like ethyl acrylate are labelled &#x2018;cancer suspect agents&#x2019;. They attack enzymes, particularly the DNA polymerase involved in cell division by conjugate addition to thiol and amino groups in the enzyme. Fortunately, we are offered some degree of protection by an important compound present in most tissues. The compound is glutathione, a tripeptide&#x2014;a compound made from three amino acids. We shall discuss such compounds in more detail later in the book (<a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>) but notice for the moment that this compound can be divided into three at the two amide bonds.</p>

<p class="indent">The business end of glutathione is the thiol (SH) group, which scavenges carcinogenic compounds by conjugate addition. If we use an &#x2018;exomethylene lactone&#x2019;&#x2014;a highly reactive Michael acceptor&#x2014;as an example and represent glutathione as RCH<sub>2</sub>SH, you can see the sort of thing that happens. If the normally abundant glutathione is removed by such processes as oxidation <a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a> and cannot any longer scavenge toxins, then the organism is in danger. This is one reason why &#x2018;antioxidants&#x2019; like vitamin C are so beneficial&#x2014; they remove stray oxidizing agents and protect the supply of glutathione.

<p class="noindent">Grignard reagents add directly to the carbonyl group of &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to give allylic alcohols: you have seen several examples of this, and you can now explain it by saying that the hard Grignard reagent prefers to attack the harder C=O rather than the softer C=C electrophilic centre. Here is a further example&#x2014;the addition of MeMgBr to a cyclic ketone to give an allylic alcohol, plus, as it happens, some of a diene that arises from this alcohol by loss of water (dehydration). Below this example is the same reaction to which a very small amount (just 0.01 equivalents, that is, 1%) of copper(I) chloride has been added.

<h2 class="h2">Conjugate substitution reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Just as direct addition to C=O (<a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) becomes substitution at C=O (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) when there is a leaving group at the carbonyl carbon, so conjugate <i>addition</i> becomes conjugate <i>substitution</i> if there is a leaving group, such as Cl, at the &#x03B2; carbon atom. Here is an example: substitution replaces Cl with OMe, just as it would have done in a reaction with an acyl chloride.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg511-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">As with substitution at C=O, this apparently simple reaction does <i>not</i> involve a direct displacement of the leaving group in a single step. The mechanism starts in exactly the same way as for conjugate addition, giving an enol intermediate.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg511-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now the leaving group can be expelled by the enol: the double bond moves back into its original position in an elimination reaction&#x2014;the sequence is often called an addition-elimination<a id="page_512" class="page">Page 512, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a> reaction. The &#x2018;new&#x2019; double bond has the more stable <i>E</i> configuration. In the next example, two consecutive conjugate substitution reactions give a 1,1-diamine.</p>

<p class="ch3">Vinylogous behaviour</p>
<p class="bnoindent">Compounds like this are known as vinylogous amides&#x2014;the conjugated double bond serves as an electronic linker between the car-bonyl group and the heteroatom, which makes the chemical and spectroscopic behaviour of the composite functional group similar to that of its simpler relative. You could think of the (3-chloro enone at the beginning of this section as a vinylogous acyl chloride that reacts with methanol to give a vinylogous ester.</p>

<p class="indent">At first sight, the product looks rather unstable&#x2014;sensitive to water, or traces of acid perhaps. But, in fact, it is remarkably resistant to reaction with both. The reason is conjugation: this isn&#x2019;t really an amine (or a diamine) at all because the lone pairs of the nitrogen atoms are delocalized through into the carbonyl group, very much as they are in an amide. This makes them less basic, and makes the carbonyl group less electrophilic.</p>

<p class="ch3"><b>Conjugate substitution and the synthesis of anti-ulcer drugs</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Just as the cyanide (CN) and nitro (NO<sub>2</sub>) groups can be used to bring about conjugate addition, so also can they initiate conjugate substitution. Examples of these reactions play important roles in the synthesis of two of the most signifi cant drugs in the development of modern medicinal chemistry: the anti-ulcer compounds cimetidine (marketed as Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac). We looked at some aspects of the structure of these drugs in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> (p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_178">178</a>) and we are now going to see how conjugate addition is used in their synthesis.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg512-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The simple cyanoimine on the left, with two SMe groups as built-in leaving groups, is readily available and reacts with amines to give guanidines in two stages. Each of the reactions is a conjugate substitution. It will be clearer if we draw the reaction with a generalized primary amine RNH<sub>2</sub> fi rst: conjugate addition, exactly as we saw with acrylonitrile, is followed by expulsion of the best leaving group. Thiols are acidic compounds, and MeS- is a better leaving group than RNH<sup>-</sup>.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg512-6.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reaction stops cleanly at this point and more vigorous conditions are required to displace the second MeS- group. This is because the fi rst product is less reactive than the starting material: the new amino group is electron-donating and conjugation is established between it and the cyano group, deactivating the molecule towards a second conjugate substitution (as shown in the margin). But under more forcing conditions a second and different amine can be introduced and the second MeS<sup>&#x2212;</sup> group displaced. In the synthesis of cimetidine the second amine is MeNH<sub>2</sub> and the molecule is complete.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Nucleophilic epoxidation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The conjugate substitutions we have just been discussing rely on a starting material containing a leaving group. In this section we are going to look at what happens if the leaving group is not attached to the unsaturated carbonyl compound, but instead is attached to the nucleo-phile. We shall look at this class of compounds&#x2014;nucleophiles with leaving groups attached&#x2014; in more detail in <a href="chapter_38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a>), but for the moment the most important will be hydroperoxide, the anion of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p class="indent">Hydroperoxide is a good nucleophile because of the <b>alpha effect</b>: interaction of the two lone pairs on adjacent oxygen atoms raises the HOMO of the anion and makes it a better and softer nucleophile than hydroxide. Hydroperoxide is also less basic than hydroxide because of the inductive electron-withdrawing effect of the second oxygen atom. Basicity and nucleophilicity usually go hand in hand&#x2014;not here though. This means that the hydroperoxide anion can be formed by treating hydrogen peroxide with aqueous sodium hydroxide.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this next section we are going to consider reactions related to conjugate substitutions but in which the double bond is part of an aromatic ring. We spent some considerable time in <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> explaining that aromatic rings are <i>nucleophilic:</i> electrophiles attack them, and typical aromatic reactivity is to undergo electrophilic substitution.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, nucleophilic substitutions of aromatic halides&#x2014;such as the one proposed here in which hydroxide is attempting to displace bromide&#x2014;do not happen. You might well ask, &#x2018;Why not?&#x2019; The reaction looks all right and, if the ring were saturated, it <i>would be</i> all right.</p>
<p class="indent">This is an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, and we know (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>) that attack must occur in line with the C-Br bond from the back, where the largest lobe of the &#x03C3;<i>*</i> orbitals lies. That is perfectly all right for the aliphatic ring because the carbon atom is tetrahedral and the C-Br bond is not in the plane of the ring. Substitution of an equatorial bromine goes like this:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<img src="../images/pg515-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But in the aromatic compound, the C&#x2013;Br bond <i>is</i> in the plane of the ring as the carbon atom is trigonal. To attack from the back, the nucleophile would have to appear inside the benzene ring and invert the carbon atom in an absurd way. This reaction is of course not possible.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is another example of the general rule:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">If S<sub>N</sub>2 is impossible, what about S<sub>N</sub>1? This is possible but very unfavourable unless the leaving group is an exceptionally good one (see below for an example). It would involve the unaided loss of the leaving group and the formation of an aryl cation. All the cations we saw as intermediates in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>) were planar with an empty p orbital. This cation is planar but the p orbital is full&#x2014;it is part of the aromatic ring&#x2014;and the empty orbital is an sp<sup>2</sup> orbital outside the ring.</p>

</aside><p class="indent">Yet some aromatic compounds <i>do</i> undergo nucleophilic substitution. Just as normally nucleophilic alkenes can be made to undergo conjugate substitution if they carry electron-withdrawing substituents, so normally nucleophilic aromatic rings also become electro-philic if they have the right substituents. The mechanism by which they undergo nucleophilic substitution also closely parallels that of conjugate substitution which you have just seen.</p>

When reactions like this last example are carried out, a purple colour often appears in the reaction mixture and then fades away. In some cases the colour is persistent and thought to be due to the intermediate. Here is an example with RO attacking a nitrated aniline.

<p class="indent">What is the nature of this intermediate? Well, in essence it is an anion delocalized over five sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbons of a six-membered ring (the sixth, the point at which the nucleophile attacked, is sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized). It&#x2019;s possible to make a simple homologue of such a species by deprotonating cyclohexadiene. Delocalizing the anion generates the three structures below.</p>

But the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> carbons in the anion have gone upfield to much smaller shifts, indicating greater electron density. By contrast, <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> carbons in the cation have gone downfield to much larger shifts.</p>
<p class="indent">The differences are very great&#x2014;about 100 ppm between the cation and the anion&#x0021; It is very clear from these spectra that the ionic charge is delocalized almost exclusively to the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> carbons in both cases.

<h3 class="h3">The leaving group and the mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the first nucleophilic aromatic substitution that we showed you, we used fluoride ion as a leaving group. Fluoride works very well in these reactions and even such a simple compound as 2-halo-l-nitrophenyl fl uoride reacts efficiently with a variety of nucleophiles, as in these examples.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg518-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The same reactions happen with the other 2-halo-l-nirtobenzenes but less efficiently. The fluoro-compound reacts about 10<sup>2</sup>&#x2212;10<sup>3</sup> times faster than the chloro or bromo compounds and the iodo compound is even slower.</p>
<p class="indent">This ought to surprise you. When we were looking at other nucleophilic substitutions such as those at the carbonyl group or saturated carbon, we never used fluoride as a leaving group&#x0021; The C&#x2212;F bond is very strong&#x2014;the strongest of all the single bonds to carbon&#x2014;and it is difficult to break. As a consequence, these reactions are not a good prospect:</p>

</aside><figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg518-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">So why is fluoride so good in nucleophilic aromatic substitution when the reverse is true with other reactions? You will notice that we have <i>not</i> said that fluoride is a better leaving group in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. It isn&#x2019;t&#x0021; The explanation depends on a better understanding of the mechanism of the reaction. We shall use azide ion as our nucleophile because this has been well studied and because it is one of the best.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism is exactly the same as that we have been discussing all along&#x2014;a two-stage addition-elimination sequence. In a two-step mechanism, one step is slower and rate determining; the other is unimportant to the rate. You may guess that, in the mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, it is the first step that is slower because it disturbs the aromaticity. The second step restores the aromaticity and is faster. The effect of fluoride, or any other leaving group, can only come from its effect on the first step. How good a leaving group it might be does not matter: the rate of the second step&#x2014;the step where fluoride leaves&#x2014; has no effect on the overall rate of the reaction.</p>

The sequence starts with an aromatic compound having four fluorine atoms. Three are replaced sequentially by nucleophiles and the last is present in the antibiotic itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The first reaction is a conjugate substitution of the ethoxy group marked in orange. An amino alcohol is used as the nucleophile and it is the more nucleophilic amino group (rather than the hydroxyl group) that adds to the alkene.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution: diazonium compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">If we really want to make aromatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution in a general way the way to do it is to use absolutely the best leaving group of all&#x2014;nitrogen gas. In fact, the diazonium compound below is so good at nucleophilic aromatic substitution that is does so even without activating groups. On warming, the nitrogen molecule just departs, leaving behind a cation, which is captured by a nucleophile, in this case water. Do you find this reminiscent of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction? We hope so.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent">Before we talk about this group of aromatic S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions in more detail, let&#x2019;s consider how to make the diazonium salt. The reagent we need is the reactive nitrogen electrophile NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. You met NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, but to remind you, it forms when the nitrite anion (usually sodium nitrite) is treated with acid at around 0 &#x00B0;C. Protonation of nitrite gives nitrous acid, HONO; protonation again gives a cation, which can lose water to form NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Butyl nitrite (or other alkyl nitrites) can also be used as a source of NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg521-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A diazonium salt is formed when NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> reacts with an amine. The lone pair of the amine attacks the NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation, and then water is lost. The mechanism is actually quite simple, but it does involve a lot of proton transfers. There is, of course, an anion associated with the nitrogen cation, and this will be the conjugate base (Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> usually) of the acid used to form NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. This reaction is known as <i>diazotization.</i></p>

It may, for example, react with water to give an alcohol:</p>

<p class="indent">If the amine is an aryl amine, then the reaction you saw at the beginning of this section will take place and a phenol will form. This is in fact rather a useful reaction as it is difficult to add an oxygen atom to a benzene ring by normal electrophilic substitution: there is no good reagent for OH<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. A nitrogen atom can be added easily by nitration, and reduction and diazotization provide a way of replacing the nitro group by a hydroxyl group.</p>

<p class="indent">It seems obvious to make this compound by alkylation and acylation of a dihydroxybenzene, but how are we to make sure that the acylation and alkylation go on the right OH groups? French pharmaceutical chemists had an ingenious answer: start with a compound having only one OH group, alkylate that, and only then introduce the second using the diazonium salt method. They used a simple phenol and introduced nitrogen as a nitroso (NO) rather than a nitro (NO<sub>2</sub>) group. This means using the same reagent as we have been using for diazotization. These were the first two steps.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg522-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reduction of NO is easier than that of NO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>S is enough to do the job. The amine can now be converted to an amide to lessen its nucleophilicity so that alkylation of the phenol occurs cleanly&#x2014;a form of protection (see <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg522-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Finally, the amide must be hydrolysed, the amino converted into an OH group by diazotization and hydrolysis, and the new phenol acetylated.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg522-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">However, an aryl carbocation is much less stable than an alkyl carbocation because its empty orbital is an sp<sup>2</sup> rather than a p orbital. This makes the loss of nitrogen slower. If the diazotization is done at temperatures around 0 &#x00B0;C (classically at 5 &#x00B0;C), the diazonium salt is stable and can be reacted with various nucleophiles other than water.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_22.10">
<h2 class="h2">The benzyne mechanism</h2>
<p class="noindent">We now need to introduce you to one last mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution and you may well feel that this is the weirdest mechanism you have yet seen with the most unlikely intermediate ever&#x0021; For our part, we hope to convince you that this mechanism is not only possible but also useful.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier in this chapter we said that the displacement by nucleophiles of bromide from bromobenzene does not occur. In fact substitution reactions of bromobenzene <i>can</i> occur but only under the most vigorous conditions, such as when bromobenzene and NaOH are melted together (fused) at very high temperature. A similar reaction with the very powerful reagent NaNH<sub>2</sub> (which supplies NH<sub>2</sub> ion) also happens, at a rather lower temperature.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg523-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">These reactions were known for a long time before anyone saw what was happening. They do not happen by an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, as we explained earlier, and they can&#x2019;t happen by the addition-elimination mechanism because there is nothing to stabilize the negative charge in the intermediate. The fi rst clue to the true mechanism is that all the nucleophiles that react in this way are very basic. They start the reaction off by removing a proton <i>ortho</i> to the leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg523-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The carbanion is in an sp<sup>2</sup> orbital in the plane of the ring. Indeed, this intermediate is very similar to the aryl cation intermediate in the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism from diazonium salts. That had no electrons in the sp<sup>2</sup> orbital; the carbanion has two. Why should this proton be removed rather than any other? The bromine atom is electronegative and the C-Br bond is in the plane of the sp<sup>2</sup> orbital and removes electrons from it. The stabilization is nonetheless weak and only exceptionally strong bases will do this reaction.</p>
<p class=" indent">The next step is the loss of bromide ion in an elimination reaction. This is the step that is difficult to believe as the intermediate we are proposing looks impossible. The orbitals are bad for the elimination too&#x2014;it is a <i>syn-</i> rather than an <i>anti</i>-periplanar elimination. But it happens.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg523-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The intermediate is called benzyne as it is an alkyne with a triple bond in a benzene ring. But what does this triple bond mean? It certainly isn&#x2019;t a normal alkyne as these are linear. In fact one &#x03C0; bond is normal&#x2014;it is just part of the aromatic system. One &#x03C0; bond&#x2014;the new one&#x2014;is abnormal and is formed by overlap of two sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals outside the ring. This external &#x03C0; bond <a id="page_524" class="page">Page 524, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a>is very weak and benzyne is a very unstable intermediate. Indeed, when the structure was proposed few chemists believed it and some pretty solid evidence was needed before they did. We shall come to that shortly, but let us first finish the mechanism. Unlike normal alkynes, benzyne is electrophilic as the weak third bond can be attacked by nucleophiles.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg524-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The whole mechanism from bromobenzene to aniline involves an elimination to give benzyne followed by an addition of the nucleophile to the triple bond of benzyne. In many ways, this mechanism is the reverse of the normal addition-elimination mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution and it is sometimes called the <b>elimination-addition mechanism.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Any nucleophile basic enough to remove the <i>ortho</i> proton can carry out this reaction. Known examples include oxyanions, amide anions (R<sub>2</sub>N<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), and carbanions. The rather basic alkoxide <i>t</i>-butoxide will do the reaction on bromobenzene if the potassium salt is used in the dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO to maximize reactivity.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg524-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">One rather special feature of the benzyne mechanism allows us to be certain that this proposed mechanism is correct, and this is the fact that the triple bond could in principle be attacked by nucleophiles at either end. This is of no consequence with bromobenzene as the products would be the same, but we can make the ends of the triple bond different and then we see something interesting. <i>ortho</i>-Chloro aryl ethers are easy to prepare by chlorination of the ether (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>). When these compounds are treated with NaNH<sub>2</sub> in liquid ammonia, a single amine is formed in good yield.</p>

<p class="indent">The new amino group finds itself in the <i>meta</i> position even though the chlorine was at the <i>ortho</i> position. It would be very difficult to explain this other than by the benzyne mechanism. Using the same elimination-addition sequence, this must be the mechanism:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg524-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">That shows <i>how</i> the <i>meta</i> product might be formed, but <i>why</i> should it be formed? Attack could also occur at the <i>ortho</i> position, so why is there no <i>ortho</i> product? There are two reasons: electronic and steric. Electronically, the anion next to the electronegative oxygen atom is preferred because oxygen is inductively electron-withdrawing. The same factor facilitates deprotonation next to Cl in the formation of the benzyne. Sterically, it is better for the amide anion to attack away from the OMe group rather than come in alongside it. Nucleophilic attack on a benzyne has to occur in the plane of the benzene ring because that is where the orbitals are. This reaction is therefore very sensitive to steric hindrance as the nucleophile must attack in the plane of the substituent as well.<a id="page_525" class="page">Page 525, Chapter 22: Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a></p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0; Steric hindrance is not nearly as important in electrophilic substitution or in nucleophilic substitution by the addition-elimination mechanism.

<p class="indent">This is a useful way to make amino ethers with a <i>meta</i> relationship as both groups are <i>ortho, para-</i>directing and so the <i>meta</i> compounds cannot be made by electrophilic substitution.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>para-</i>Disubstituted halides can again give only one benzyne and most of them give mixtures of products. A simple alkyl substituent is too far from the triple bond to have much steric effect.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg525-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the substituent is an electron-repelling anion, then the <i>meta</i> product is formed exclusively because this puts the product anion as far as possible from the anion already there.

<div class="bbox">
<p class="ch3">Other evidence for benzyne as an intermediate</p>
<p class="noindent">As you would expect, the formation of benzyne is the slow step in the reaction so there is no hope of isolating benzyne from the reaction mixture or even of detect-</p>
<p class="noindent">ing it spectroscopically. However, it can be made by other reactions where there are no nucleophiles to capture it, for example from this diazotization reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg525-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This diazotization is particularly effi cient as you can see by the quantitative yield of 2-iodobenzoic acid on capture of the diazonium salt with iodide ion. However, if the same diazonium salt is neutralized with NaOH, it gives a zwit-terion with the negative charge on the carboxylate balancing the positive charge</p>
<p class="noindent">on the diazonium group. This diazotization is done with an alkyl nitrite in an organic solvent to avoid the chance that nucleophiles such as chloride or water might capture the product. When the zwitterion is heated it decomposes in an entropically favourable reaction to give carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and benzyne.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg525-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">You can&#x2019;t isolate the benzyne because it reacts with itself to give a benzyne dimer having a four-membered ring between two benzene rings. If the zwitte-rion is injected into a mass spectrometer, there is a peak at 152 for the dimer</p>
<p class="noindent">but also a strong peak at 76, which is benzyne itself. The lifetime of a particle in the mass spectrometer is about 2 <b>&#x00D7;</b> 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> s so benzyne can exist for at least that long in the gas phase.</p>
