<h2 class="h2">Substitution and elimination</h2>
<p class="noindent">Substitution reactions of t-butyl halides, you will recall from <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, invariably follow the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. In other words, the rate-determining step of their substitution reactions is unimolecular&#x2014;it involves only the alkyl halide. This means that, no matter what the nucleophile is, the reaction goes at the same rate. You can&#x2019;t speed this S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction up, for example, by using hydroxide instead of water, or even by increasing the concentration of hydroxide. You&#x2019;d be wasting your time, we said (see p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_332">332</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In this chapter we will talk about the mechanisms of elimination reactions&#x2014;as in the case of substitutions, there is more than one mechanism for eliminations. We will compare eliminations with substitutions&#x2014;either reaction can happen from almost identical starting materials, and you will learn how to predict which is the more likely. Much of the mechanistic discussion relates very closely to <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, and we suggest that you make sure you understand all of the points in that chapter before tackling this one. This chapter will also tell you about uses for elimination reactions. Apart from a brief look at the Wittig reaction in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, this is the first time you have met a way of making simple alkenes.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Elimination happens when the nucleophile attacks hydrogen instead of carbon</h3>
<p class="noindent">The elimination reaction of t-butyl bromide happens because the nucleophile is <i>basic.</i> You will recall from <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> that there is <i>some</i> correlation between basicity and nucleophilic- ity: strong bases are usually good nucleophiles. Being a good nucleophile doesn&#x2019;t get hydroxide anywhere in the substitution reaction because it doesn&#x2019;t appear in the first-order rate equation. But being a good base does get it somewhere in the elimination reaction because hydroxide is involved in the rate-determining step of the elimination, and so it appears in the rate equation. This is the mechanism.</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The correlation between basicity and nucleophilicity is best for attack at C=O.

</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_383_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The hydroxide is behaving as a base because it is attacking the hydrogen atom, instead of the carbon atom it would attack in a substitution reaction. The hydrogen atom is not acidic, but proton removal can occur because bromide is a good leaving group. As the hydroxide attacks, the bromide is forced to leave, taking with it the negative charge. Two molecules&#x2014;<i>t</i>-butyl bromide and hydroxide&#x2014;are involved in the rate-determining step of the reaction. This means that the concentrations of both appear in the rate equation, which is therefore second-order and this mechanism for elimination is termed E2, for <i>elimination, bimolecular. </i></p>

<p class="indent">Now let&#x2019;s look at another sort of elimination. We can approach it again by thinking about another S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution reaction, the reverse of the one at the beginning of the chapter: an alcohol is converted into an alkyl halide.</p>

<p class="indent">Bromide, the nucleophile, is not involved in the rate-determining step, so we know that the rate of the reaction will be independent of the concentration of Br <sup>-</sup>. Indeed the first step, to form the cation, will happen just as fast even if there is <i>no bromide at all</i>. But what happens to the carbocation in such a case? To find out, we need to use an acid whose counterion is such a weak nucleophile that it won&#x2019;t even attack the positive carbon of the carbocation. Here is an example&#x2014;<i>t</i>-butanol in sulfuric acid doesn&#x2019;t undergo substitution, but undergoes elimination instead.</p>

<p class="indent">The HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> anion is not involved in the rate-determining formation of the carbocation, and is also a very bad nucleophile, so it does not attack the C atom of the carbocation. Neither is it basic, but you can see from the mechanism that it does behave as a base (that is, it removes a proton). It does this only because it is even more feeble as a nucleophile. The rate equation will not involve the concentration of HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, and the rate-determining step is the same as that in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction&#x2014;unimolecular loss of water from the protonated t-BuOH. This elimination mechanism is therefore called E1.</p>
<p class="indent">We will shortly come back to these two mechanisms for elimination, plus a third, but it is worth noting at this stage that the choice between E1 and E2 is not based on the same grounds as the choice between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2: you have just seen both E1 and E2 elimination from a substrate that would only undergo S<sub>N</sub>1. The difference between the two reactions was the strength of the base, so first we need to answer the question: when does a nucleophile start behaving as a base?</p>

<p class="c_noindent">We have left detailed discussion of the formation of alkenes until this chapter, but we used the term &#x2018;elimination&#x2019; in Chapters 10 and 11 to describe the loss of a leaving group from a tetrahedral intermediate.

<h2 class="h2">How the nucleophile affects elimination versus substitution</h2>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_17.2.1">
<h3 class="h2">Basicity</h3>
<p class="noindent">You have just seen molecules bearing leaving groups being attacked at two distinct electro- philic sites: the carbon to which the leaving group is attached, and the hydrogen atoms on the carbon adjacent to the leaving group. Attack at carbon leads to substitution; attack at hydrogen leads to elimination. Since strong bases attack protons, it is generally true that, the more basic the nucleophile, the more likely that elimination is going to replace substitution as the main reaction of an alkyl halide.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_384_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Here is an example of this idea at work: a weak base (EtOH) leads to substitution while a strong base (ethoxide ion) leads to elimination.</p>

</figure>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3"><b>Elimination, substitution, and hardness</b></h3>
<p class="c_noindent">We can also rationalize selectivity for elimination versus substitution, or attack on H versus attack on C in terms of hard and soft electrophiles (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_357">357</a>). In an S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution, the carbon centre is a soft electrophile&#x2014;it is essentially uncharged, and with leaving groups such as halide the C-X &#x03C3;* is a relatively low-energy LUMO. Substitution is therefore favoured by nucleophiles whose HOMOs are best able to interact with this LUMO&#x2014;in other words soft nucleophiles. In contrast, the C-H &#x03C3;* is higher in energy because the atoms are less electronegative. This, coupled with the hydrogen&#x2019;s small size, makes the C&#x2014;H bond a hard electrophilic site, and as a result hard nucleophiles favour elimination.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_17.2.2">
<h3 class="h2">Size</h3>
<p class="noindent">For a nucleophile, attacking a carbon atom means squeezing past its substituents&#x2014;and even for unhindered primary alkyl halides there is still one alkyl group attached. This is one of the reasons that S<sub>N</sub>2 is so slow on hindered alkyl halides&#x2014;the nucleophile has difficulty getting to the reactive centre. Getting at a more exposed hydrogen atom in an elimination reaction is much easier, and this means that, as soon as we start using basic nucleophiles that are also bulky, elimination becomes preferred over substitution, even for primary alkyl halides. One of the best bases for promoting elimination and avoiding substitution is potassium <i>t</i>-but- oxide. The large alkyl substituent makes it hard for the negatively charged oxygen to attack carbon in a substitution reaction, but it has no problem attacking hydrogen.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_17.2.3">
<h3 class="h2">Temperature</h3>
<p class="noindent">Temperature has an important role to play in deciding whether a reaction is an elimination or a substitution. In an elimination, two molecules become three (count them). In a substitution, two molecules form two new molecules. The two reactions therefore differ in the change in entropy during the reaction: &#x0394;S is greater for elimination than for substitution. In <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, we discussed the equation</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;This explanation is simplifi ed because what matters is the rate of the reaction, not the stability of the products. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of the book, but the general argument still holds.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_386" class="page">Page 386, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This equation says that a reaction in which &#x0394;<i>S</i> is positive becomes more favourable <i>(&#x0394;G</i> becomes more negative) at higher temperature. Eliminations should therefore be favoured at high temperature, and this is indeed the case: most eliminations you will see are conducted at room temperature or above.</p>

<h2 class="h2">E1 and E2 mechanisms</h2>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have seen a few examples of elimination reactions, it is time to return to our discussion of the two mechanisms for elimination. To summarize what we have said so far:</p>
<p class="blist" style="width:67%;"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;E1 describes an elimination reaction (E) in which the rate-determining step is unimolecular (1) and does not involve the base. The leaving group leaves in this step, and the proton is removed in a separate second step.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_386_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="blist" style="width:67%;"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;E2 describes an elimination (E) that has a bimolecular (2) rate-determining step that must involve the base. Loss of the leaving group is simultaneous with removal of the proton by the base.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;In E2 eliminations the loss of the leaving group and removal f the proton are <b>concerted</b>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_386_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">There are a number of factors that affect whether an elimination goes by an E1 or E2 mechanism. One is immediately obvious from the rate equations: only the E2 is affected by the concentration of base, so at high base concentration E2 is favoured. The rate of an E1 reaction is not even affected by what base is present&#x2014;so E1 is just as likely with weak as with strong bases, while E2 goes faster with strong bases than weak ones: strong bases at whatever concentration will favour E2 over E1. If you see that a strong base is required for an elimination, it is certainly an E2 reaction. Take the first elimination in this chapter as an example.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_386_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">With less hindered alkyl halides hydroxide would not be a good choice as a base for an elimination because it is rather small and still very good at S<sub>N</sub>2 substitutions (and even with tertiary alkyl halides, substitution outpaces elimination at low concentrations of hydroxide). So what are good alternatives?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_387" class="page">Page 387, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We have already mentioned the bulky <i>t</i>-butoxide&#x2014;ideal for promoting E2 as it&#x2019;s both bulky and a strong base (pK<sub>a</sub> of t-BuOH &#x003D; 18). Here it is at work converting a dibromide to a diene with two successive E2 eliminations. Since dibromides can be made from alkenes (you will see how in the next chapter), this is a useful two-step conversion of an alkene to a diene.</p>

There is not much chance of getting those voluminous fused rings into tight corners&#x2014;so they pick off the easy- to-reach protons rather than attacking carbon atoms in substitution reactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Substrate structure may allow E1</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first elimination of the chapter (<i>t</i>-BuBr plus hydroxide) illustrates something very important: the starting material is a tertiary alkyl halide and would therefore <i>substitute</i> only by S<sub>N</sub>1, but it can <i>eliminate</i> by either E2 (with strong bases) or E1 (with weak bases). The steric factors that disfavour S<sub>N</sub>2 at hindered centres don&#x2019;t exist for eliminations. Nonetheless, E1 can occur <i>only</i> with substrates that can ionize to give relatively stable carbocations&#x2014;tertiary, allylic, or ben- zylic alkyl halides, for example. Secondary alkyl halides may eliminate by E1, while primary alkyl halides only ever eliminate by E2 because the primary carbocation required for E1 would be too unstable. The chart below summarizes the types of substrate that can undergo E1&#x2014;but remember that any of these substrates, under the appropriate conditions (in the presence of strong bases, for example), may also undergo E2. For completeness, we have also included in this chart three alkyl halides that cannot eliminate by either mechanism simply because they do not have any hydrogens to lose from carbon atoms adjacent to the leaving group.</p>

</figure>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3"><b>Can a proton just &#x2018;fall off&#x2019; a cation?</b></h3>
<p class="c_noindent">In E1 mechanisms, once the leaving group has departed almost anything will serve as a base to remove a proton from the intermediate carbocation. Weakly basic solvent molecules (water or alcohols), for example, are quite sufficient, and you will often see the proton just &#x2018;falling off&#x2019; in reaction mechanisms, with the assumption that there is a weak base somewhere to capture it. We showed the loss of a proton like this in the last example, and in the chart on this page.</p>
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_388_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="c_noindent">In very rare cases, such as the superacid solutions we described in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_335">335</a>), the cation is stable because counterions such as BF<sup>-</sup><sub>4</sub> and SbF<sup>-</sup><sub>6</sub> are not only non-nucleophilic but also so non-basic that they won&#x2019;t even accept a proton. This fact tells us that despite this common way of writing the E1 mechanism, <i>some</i> sort of weak base is necessary even for E1.</p>
</div>

E1 eliminations from alcohols in aqueous or alcohol solution are particularly common and very useful. An acid catalyst is used to promote loss of water, and in dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, or HCl the absence of good nucleophiles ensures that substitution does not compete. With phosphoric acid, for example, the secondary alcohol cyclohexanol gives cyclohexene.</p>

<p class="indent">But the best E1 eliminations of all are with tertiary alcohols. The alcohols can be made using the methods of <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>: nucleophilic attack by an organometallic on a carbonyl compound. Nucleophilic addition, followed by E1 elimination, is an excellent way of making this substituted cyclohexene, for example. Note that the proton required in the first step is recovered in the last&#x2014;the reaction requires only catalytic amounts of acid.</p>

The bicyclic structure prevents the bridgehead carbon becoming planar so, although the cation would be tertiary, it is very high in energy and does not form. You could say that the non-planar structure forces the cation to have an empty sp<sup>3</sup> orbital instead of an empty p orbital, and we saw in <a href="chapter_4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> that it is always best to leave the orbitals with the highest possible energy empty.<a id="page_390" class="page">Page 390, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">The role of the leaving group</h2>
<p class="noindent">We haven&#x2019;t yet been very adventurous with our choice of leaving groups for eliminations: all you have seen so far are E2 from alkyl halides and E1 from protonated alcohols. This is deliberate: the vast majority of the two classes of eliminations use one of these two types of starting materials. But since the leaving group is involved in the rate-determining step of both E1 and E2, in general any good leaving group will lead to a fast elimination. You may, for example, see amines acting as leaving groups in eliminations of quaternary ammonium salts.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_390_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Both E1 and E2 are possible, and from what you have read so far you should be able to spot that there is one of each here: in the first example, a stabilized cation cannot be formed (so E1 is impossible), but a strong base is used, allowing E2. In the second, a stabilized tertiary cation could be formed (so <i>either</i> E1 or E2 might occur), but no strong base is present, so the mechanism must be E1.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_390_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You have just seen that hydroxyl groups can be turned into good leaving groups in acid, but this is only useful for substrates that can react by E1 elimination. The hydroxyl group is <i>never</i> a leaving group in E2 eliminations, since they have to be done in base. A strong base would remove the proton from the OH group instead.</p>

Here are two examples making biologically important molecules. In the first, the mesylate is isolated and then eliminated with DBU to give a synthetic analogue of uracil, one of the nucleotide bases present in RNA.

<h2 class="h2">E1 reactions can be stereoselective</h2>
<p class="noindent">For some eliminations only one product is possible. For others, there may be a choice of two (or more) alkene products that differ either in the location or stereochemistry of the double bond. We shall now move on to discuss the factors that control the stereochemistry (geome- try<i>&#x2014;cis</i> or <i>trans)</i> and regiochemistry (that is, where the double bond is) of the alkenes, starting with E1 reactions.<a id="page_392" class="page">Page 392, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a></p>

But for formal assignment of geometry, we use the stereochemical descriptors <i>E</i> and Z. For disubstituted alkenes, <i>E</i> corresponds to <i>trans</i> and <i>Z</i> corresponds to <i>cis.</i> To assign <i>E</i> or <i>Z</i> to tri-or tetrasubstituted alkenes, the groups at either end of the alkene are given an order of priority according to the same rules as those outlined for <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>. If the two higher priority groups are <i>cis,</i> the alkene is Z; if they are <i>trans</i> the alkene is E. Of course, molecules don&#x2019;t know these rules, and sometimes (as in the second example here) the <i>E</i> alkene is less stable than the Z.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>E</i> alkenes (and transition states leading to <i>E</i> alkenes) are usually lower in energy than <i>Z</i> alk- enes (and the transition states leading to them) for steric reasons: the substituents can get further apart from one another. A reaction that can choose which it forms is therefore likely to favour the formation of <i>E</i> alkenes. For alkenes formed by E1 elimination, this is exactly what happens: the less hindered <i>E</i> alkene is favoured. Here is an example.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_392_3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The geometry of the product is determined at the moment that the proton is lost from the intermediate carbocation. The new &#x03C0; bond can only form if the vacant p orbital of the carbocation and the breaking C-H bond are aligned parallel. In the example shown there are two possible conformations of the carbocation with parallel orientations, but one is more stable than the other because it suffers less steric hindrance. The same is true of the transition states on the route to the alkenes&#x2014;the one leading to the <i>E</i> alkene is lower in energy, and more <i>E</i> alkene than <i>Z</i> alkene is formed. The process is stereoselective because the reaction chooses to form predominantly one of two possible stereoisomeric products.</p>

The reason for this is related to the reason why more substituted carbocations are more stable. In <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> we said that the carbocation is stabilized when its empty p orbital can interact with the filled orbitals of parallel C&#x2013;H and C&#x2013;C bonds.

But it is also true that some E1 eliminations are reversible: the alkenes may be protonated in acid to re-form carbocations, as you will see in the next chapter. This reprotonation allows the more stable product to form preferentially under <i>thermodynamic</i> control. In any individual case, it may not be clear which is operating. However, with E2 reactions, which follow, only kinetic control applies: E2 reactions are never reversible.</p>

<p class="indent">The more substituted alkene is more stable, but this does not necessarily explain why it is the one that forms faster. To do that, we should look at the transition states leading to the two alkenes. Both form from the same carbocation, but which one we get depends on which proton is lost. Removal of the proton on the right (brown arrow) leads to a transition state in which there is a monosubstituted double bond partly formed. Removal of the proton on the left (orange arrow) leads to a partial double bond that is trisubstituted. This is more stable&#x2014;the transition state is lower in energy, and the more substituted alkene forms faster.</p>

<h2 class="h2">E2 eliminations have anti-periplanar transition states</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although E1 reactions show some stereo and regioselectivity, the level of selectivity in E2 reactions can be much higher because of the more stringent demands on the transition state for E2 elimination. In an E2 elimination, the new &#x03C0; bond is formed by overlap of the C&#x2013;H &#x03C3; bond with the C&#x2013;X &#x03C3;* antibonding orbital. The two orbitals have to lie in the same plane for best overlap, and now there are two conformations that allow this. One has H and X syn-periplanar, the other anti-periplanar. The anti-periplanar conformation is more stable because it is staggered (the syn-periplanar conformation is eclipsed) but, more importantly, only in the anti-periplanar conformation are the bonds (and therefore the orbitals) truly parallel.</p>

Whether the product is <i>E</i> or Z, the E2 reaction has only one course to follow. And the outcome depends on which diastereoisomer of the starting material is used. When the first diastereoisomer is drawn with the proton and <a id="page_396" class="page">Page 396, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>bromine anti-periplanar, as required, and in the plane of the page, the two phenyl groups have to lie one in front and one behind the plane of the paper. As the hydroxide attacks the C-H bond and eliminates Br <sup>-</sup>, this arrangement is preserved and the two phenyl groups end up <i>trans</i> (the alkene is E).

Each diastereoisomer gives a different alkene geometry, and they do so at different rates. The first reaction is about ten times as fast as the second because, although this anti-periplanar conformation is the only reactive one, it is not necessarily the most stable. The Newman projection for the second reaction shows clearly that the two phenyl groups have to lie synclinal (gauche) to one another: the steric interaction between these large groups will mean that, at any time, a relatively small proportion of molecules will adopt the right conformation for elimination, slowing the process down.</p>

<p class="indent">The key to explaining reactions like this is to draw the conformation of the molecules. Both will adopt a chair conformation, and generally the chair having the largest substituent equatorial (or the largest <i>number</i> of substituents equatorial) is the more stable. In these examples the isopropyl group is most influential&#x2014;it is branched and will have very severe 1,3-diaxial interactions if it occupies an axial position. In both diastereoisomers, an equatorial i-Pr also means an equatorial Me: the only difference is the orientation of the chlorine. For diastereo- isomer A, the chlorine is forced axial in the major conformer: there is no choice because the relative configuration is fixed in the starting material. It&#x2019;s less stable than equatorial Cl, but is ideal for E2 elimination and there are two protons that are anti-periplanar available for removal by the base. The two alkenes are formed as a result of each of the possible protons with a 3:1 preference for the more substituted alkene.</p>

A has the chlorine axial virtually all the time ready for E2, while B has an axial leaving group only in the minute proportion of the molecules that happen not to be in the lowest-energy conformation, but that have all three substituents axial. The all-axial conformer is much higher in energy, but only in this confomer can Cl<sup>-</sup> be eliminated. The concentration of reactive molecules is low, so the rate is also low.

<p class="noindent">An anti-periplanar arrangement of C&#x2013;Br and C&#x2013;H is attainable with a vinylic bromide too, provided the Br and H are <i>trans</i> to one another. E2 elimination from the <i>Z</i> isomer of a vinyl bromide gives an alkyne rather faster than elimination from the <i>E</i> isomer because in the <i>E</i> isomer the C&#x2013;H and C&#x2013;Br bonds are syn-periplanar.</p>

<p class="indent">Vinyl bromides can themselves be made by elimination reactions of 1,2-dibromoalkanes. Watch what happens when 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with three equivalents of R<sub>2</sub>NLi: first, elimination to the vinyl halide, then elimination of the vinyl halide to the alkyne. The terminal alkyne is amply acidic enough to be deprotonated by R<sub>2</sub>NLi, and this is the role of the third equivalent. Overall, the reaction makes a lithiated alkyne (ready for further reactions) from a fully saturated starting material. This may well be the first reaction you have met that makes an alkyne from a starting material that doesn&#x2019;t already contain a triple bond.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The regioselectivity of E2 eliminations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Here are two deceptively similar elimination reactions. The leaving group changes and the reaction conditions are very different but the overall process is elimination of HX to produce one of two alkenes.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_398_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the first example acid-catalysed elimination of water from a tertiary alcohol produces a trisubstitued alkene. Elimination of HCl from the corresponding tertiary alkyl chloride promoted by a very hindered alkoxide base (more hindered than <i>t</i>-BuOK because all the ethyl groups have to point away from one another) gives exclusively the less stable disubstituted alkene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_398_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The reason for the two different regioselectivities is a change in mechanism. As we have already discussed, acid-catalysed elimination of water from tertiary alcohols is usually E1, and you already know the reason why the more substituted alkene forms faster in E1 reactions (p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_394">394</a>). It should come as no surprise to you now that the second elimination, with a strong, hindered base, is an E2 reaction. But why does E2 give the less substituted product? This time, there is no problem getting C&#x2013;H bonds anti-periplanar to the leaving group: in the conformation <a id="page_399" class="page">Page 399, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>with the Cl axial there are two equivalent ring hydrogens available for elimination, and removal of either of these would lead to the trisubstituted alkene. Additionally, any of the three equivalent methyl hydrogens are in a position to undergo E2 elimination to form the disubstituted alkene whether the Cl is axial or equatorial&#x2014;and yet it is these and only these that are removed by the hindered base. The diagram summarizes two of the possibilities.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_399_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The base attacks the methyl hydrogens because they are less hindered&#x2014;they are attached to a primary carbon atom, well away from the other axial hydrogens. E2 eliminations with hindered bases typically give the less substituted double bond because the fastest E2 reaction involves deprotonation at the least-substituted site. The hydrogens attached to a less substituted carbon atom are also more acidic. Think of the conjugate bases: a t-butyl anion is more basic (because the anion is destabilized by the three electron-donating alkyl groups) than a methyl anion, so the corresponding alkane must be less acidic. Steric factors are evident in the following E2 reactions, where changing the base from ethoxide to <i>t</i>-butoxide alters the major product from the more to the less substituted alkene.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Anion-stabilizing groups allow another mechanism&#x2014;E1cB</h2>
<p class="noindent">To finish this chapter, we consider a reaction that at first sight seems to go against what we have told you so far. It&#x2019;s an elimination catalysed by a strong base (KOH), so it looks like E2. But the leaving group is hydroxide, which we categorically (and truthfully) stated cannot be a leaving group in E2 eliminations.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_399_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The key to what is going on is the carbonyl group. In <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> you met the idea that negative charges are stabilized by conjugation with carbonyl groups, and the list on p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_176">176</a> demonstrated how acidic a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group is. The proton that is removed in this elimination reaction is adjacent to the carbonyl group, and is therefore also rather acidic (pK<sub>a</sub> about 20). This means that the base can remove it without the leaving group departing at the<a id="page_400" class="page">Page 400, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>same time&#x2014;the anion that results is stable enough to exist because it can be delocalized on to the carbonyl group.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;This delocalized anion is called an enolate, and we will discuss enolates in more detail in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> and beyond.</p>
</div>
</aside>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_400_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Although the anion is stabilized by the carbonyl group, it still prefers to lose a leaving group and become an alkene. This is the next step.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_400_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This step is also the rate-determining step of the elimination&#x2014;the elimination is uni- molecular and so is some kind of E1 reaction. The leaving group is not lost from the starting molecule, but from the <i>conjugate base</i> of the starting molecule, so this sort of elimination, which starts with a deprotonation, is called E1cB (cB for conjugate base). Here is the full mechanism, generalized for other carbonyl compounds.</p>

<p class="indent">It&#x2019;s important to note that, while HO<sup>-</sup> is never a leaving group in E2 reactions, it can be a leaving group in E1cB reactions. The anion it is lost from is already an alkoxide&#x2014;the oxy- anion does not need to be created as the HO<sup>-</sup> is lost. The establishment of conjugation in the product also assists loss of HO<sup>-</sup>. As the scheme above implies, other leaving groups are possible too. Here are two examples with methanesulfonate leaving groups.</p>

<p class="indent">The first looks E1 (stabilized cation), the second E2&#x2014;but in fact both are E1cB reactions. The most reliable way to spot a likely E1cB elimination is to see whether the alkene in the product is conjugated with a carbonyl group. If it is, the mechanism is probably E1cB.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_400_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">&#x03B2;-Halocarbonyl compounds can be rather unstable: the combination of a good leaving group and an acidic proton means that E1cB elimination is extremely easy. This mixture of diastereoisomers is first of all lactonized in acid (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>), and then undergoes E1cB<a id="page_401" class="page">Page 401, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a> elimination with triethylamine to give a product known as a butenolide. Butenolides are common structures in naturally occurring compounds.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">You will have noticed that we have shown the deprotonation step in the last few mechanisms as an equilibrium. Both equilibria lie rather over to the left-hand side because neither triethylamine (pK<sub>a</sub> of Et<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>&#x002B;</sup> about 10) nor hydroxide (pK<sub>a</sub> of H<sub>2</sub>O 15.7) is basic enough to remove completely a proton next to a carbonyl group (pK<sub>a</sub> > 20). However, because the loss of the leaving group is essentially irreversible, only a small amount of deprotonated carbonyl compound is necessary to keep the reaction going. The important point about substrates that undergo E1cB is that there is some form of anion-stabilizing group next to the proton to be removed&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t have to stabilize the anion very well but, as long as it makes the proton more acidic, an E1cB mechanism has a chance. Here is an important example with two phenyl rings helping to stabilize the anion, and a carbamate anion (R<sub>2</sub>N&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) as the leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_401_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The proton to be removed has a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of about 25 because its conjugate base is an aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion (we discussed this in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>). The E1cB elimination takes place with a secondary or tertiary amine as the base. Spontaneous loss of CO<sub>2</sub> from the eliminated product gives an amine, and you will meet this class of compounds again in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, where we discuss the Fmoc protecting group.</p>

<h3 class="ch3"><b>The E1cB rate equation</b></h3>
<p class="c_noindent">The rate-determining elimination step in an E1cB reaction is unimolecular, so you might imagine it would have a firstorder rate equation. In fact, the rate is also dependent on the concentration of base. This is because the unimolecular elimination involves a species&#x2014;the anion&#x2014;whose concentration is itself determined by the concentration of base by the equilibrium we have just been discussing. Using the following general E1cB reaction, the concentration of the anion can be expressed as shown.</p>

<p class="c_noindent">The rate is proportional to the concentration of the anion, and we now have an expression for that concentration. We can simplify it further because the concentration of water is effectively constant.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/pg_402_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="c_noindent">Just because the base (hydroxide) appears in this rate equation doesn’t mean to say it is involved in the rate-determining step. Increasing the concentration of base makes the reaction go faster by increasing the amount of anion available to eliminate.</p>

<h3 class="h2">E1cB eliminations in context</h3>
<p class="noindent">We can also compare the E1cB mechanism with the other elimination reactions you have met by thinking of the relative timing of proton removal and leaving group departure. E1 is at one end of the scale: the leaving group goes first and proton removal follows in a second step. In E2 reactions, the two events happen at the same time: the proton is removed as the leaving group leaves. In E1cB the proton removal moves in front of leaving group departure.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_402_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We talked about regio- and stereoselectivity in connection with E1 and E2 reactions. With E1cB, the regioselectivity is straightforward: the location of the double bond is defined by the position of (a) the acidic proton and (b) the leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_402_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">E1cB reactions may be stereoselective&#x2014;the one above, for example, gives mainly the <i>E</i> alkene product (2:1 with Z). The intermediate anion is planar, so the stereochemistry of the starting materials is irrelevant, the less sterically hindered (usually <i>E</i>) product is preferred. This double E1cB elimination, for example, gives only the <i>E,E</i> product.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_403" class="page">Page 403, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To finish this chapter we need to tell you about two E1cB eliminations that you may meet in unexpected places. We have saved them till now because they are unusual in that the leaving group is actually part of the anion-stabilizing group itself. First of all, try spotting the E1cB elimination in this step from the first total synthesis of penicillin V.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_403_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent"></p>
<p class="indent">The reaction is deceptively simple&#x2014;formation of an amide in the presence of base&#x2014;and you would expect the mechanism to follow what we told you in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. But the acyl chloride is, in fact, set up for an E1cB elimination&#x2014;and you should expect this whenever you see an acyl chloride <i>with acidic protons next to the carbonyl group</i> used in the presence of a base such as triethylamine.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_403_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The product of the elimination is a substituted ketene&#x2014;a highly reactive species whose parent structure is the molecule CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;C&#x003D;O that you will meet in the next chapter. It is the ketene that reacts with the amine to form the amide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_403_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The second &#x2018;concealed&#x2019; E1cB elimination is disguised in the mechanism of formation of methanesulfonates (mesylates). When we introduced sulfonate esters in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, and revisited them on p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_391">391</a> of this chapter, we avoided (uncharacteristically, you may say) explaining the mechanism by which they are formed from sulfonyl chlorides. This was deliberate because, while TsCl reacts with alcohols by the mechanism you might predict, the reaction with MsCl involves an elimination step.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is the mechanism by which alkyl tosylates are formed from alcohols. The alcohol acts as a nucleophile towards the electrophilic sulfonyl chloride, and pyridine removes a proton to give the product.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_403_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Methanesulfonyl chloride by contrast has a feature it shares with the acyl chlorides just above: a relatively acidic proton that can be removed by base. This deprotonation, followed by loss of chloride, is the first step in the formation of a mesylate ester. It is an E1cB elimination and the product is called a sulfene.<a id="page_404" class="page">Page 404, Chapter 17: Elimination reactions</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_404_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The sulfene is electrophilic in a slightly odd way: the alcohol acts as a nucleophile for sulfur and generates an anion of carbon which undergoes a proton transfer to give the mesylate. It is not uncommon for anions to form adjacent to sulfur, as you will see again in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>. Notice how similar the overall mechanism is to the acylation mechanism we showed you above.</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;conjugation&#x2014;anything that can conjugate with an alkene stabilizes it, including carbonyl groups, nitriles, benzene rings, RO or RNH groups, or another alkene. This is the strongest stabilization and usually dominates.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Alkene stereochemistry: a summary of terminology</h3>
<p class="noindent">The official way of assigning alkene geometry is <i>E</i> and <i>Z. Z</i> comes from the German <i>zusammen</i> (together) and means that the two highest ranking substituents (by the same rules introduced in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> for <i>R</i> and S) are on the same side of the alkene. The letter <i>Z</i> is a particularly unfortunate choice as it looks like a <i>trans</i> alkene&#x0021; <i>E</i> comes from the German <i>entgegen</i> (opposed) and means that the two highest ranking substituents are on opposite sides (and, if anything also unfortunately looks like a <i>cis</i> alkene). The green numbers in the structures below show the relative rankings of the two substituents at each end of the alkene and the consequent assignment of geometry.</p>
