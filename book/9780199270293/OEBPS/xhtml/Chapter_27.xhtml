<h2 class="htwh2">Useful main group elements</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Organic chemists make use of most elements in the periodic table: you have already seen organic 
compounds of Li, B, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Cu, Br, and I&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s only the start. Three of the
 most important of these are sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. They all form stable organic compounds and play nearly as
 important roles in organic chemistry as oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens. They are second row elements, coming immediately
 below carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, to which they have some similarity. Electronegativity (shown in the margin) 
diminishes from right to left and downwards.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The main difference from C, N, and O is that Si, P, and S can form more bonds than the first row 
elements. This is because they have more orbitals: the five 3d orbitals added to the 3s and three 3p orbitals. Silicon
 forms tetrahedral silanes, rather like alkanes, but also forms stable five- valent anions. Phosphorus forms 
phosphines, rather like amines, but also tetrahedral phosphine oxides. Sulfur can have any coordination number from
 zero to seven, forming sulfides, like ethers, and tetrahedral sulfones with six bonds to sulfur. And it is with sulfur
 that we start.</p>

<img src="../images/page_657_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Some facts about sulfur</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Sulfur is a p-block element in group VI (or 16 if you prefer) immediately below oxygen and between
 phosphorus and chlorine. It is natural for us to compare sulfur with oxygen but we will, strangely, compare it with
 carbon as well.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Sulfur is much less electronegative than oxygen; in fact, it has the same electronegativity as 
carbon, so it is no good trying to use the polarization of the C&#x2014;S bond to explain anything&#x0021; It forms 
reasonably strong bonds to carbon&#x2014;strong enough for the compounds to be stable but weak enough for selective 
cleavage in the presence of the much stronger C&#x2014;O bonds. It also forms fairly strong bonds to itself. Elemental
 crystalline yellow sulfur consists of S<sub>8</sub> molecules&#x2014;eight-membered rings of sulfur atoms.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Because sulfur is in the second row of the periodic table it forms many types of compounds not
 available to oxygen. Compounds with S&#x2014;S and S&#x2014;halogen bonds are quite stable and can be isolated, unlike
 the unstable and often explosive O&#x2014;halogen and O&#x2014;O compounds. Sulfur&#x2019;s d orbitals allow it to
 have oxidation states of 0, 2, 4, or 6 and coordination numbers from 0 to 7. Here is a selection of compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Sulfur is a very versatile element</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">As well as this variety of oxidation states, sulfur shows a sometimes surprising versatility in 
function. Simple S(II) compounds are good nucleophiles, as you would expect from the<a id="page_658" class="page"><b>Page 658,Chapter 27 Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</b></a> high-energy non-bonding lone pairs (3sp<sup>3</sup> rather than the 2sp<sup>3</sup> of oxygen). 
A mixture of a thiol (RSH, the sulfur equivalent of an alcohol) and NaOH reacts with an alkyl halide to give the 
sulfide alone by nucleophilic attack of RS<sup>-</sup>.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_658_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Thiols (RSH) are more acidic than alcohols so the first step is a rapid proton exchange between the
 thiol and hydroxide ion. The thiolate anion then carries out a very efficient S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement on the alkyl
 bromide to give the sulfide. Notice that the thiolate anion does not attack the carbonyl group. Small basic oxyanions 
have high charge density and low- energy filled orbitals&#x2014;they are hard nucleophiles that prefer to attack 
protons and carbonyl groups. Large, less basic thiolate anions have high-energy filled orbitals and are soft 
nucleophiles. They prefer to attack saturated carbon atoms. Thiols and thiolates are good soft nucleophiles.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160; This &#x2019;hard or soft&#x2019; nature of nucleophiles is discussed with S<sub>N</sub>2 
reactions in general in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</p></aside>
<div class="htwyellow1">
<p class="htwdivi"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"/>&#160; <b>Thiols (RSH) are more acidic than alcohols (ROH) but sulfur compounds are better nucleophiles 
than oxygen compounds towards saturated carbon atoms (S<sub>N</sub>2).</b></p></div>
<p class="htwindent1">They are also good soft electrophiles. Sulfenyl chlorides (RSCl) are easily made from disulfides 
(RS&#x2014;SR) and sulfuryl chloride (SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>). This S(VI) chloride has electrophilic chlorine
 atoms and is attacked by the nucleophilic disulfide to give two molecules of RSCl and gaseous SO<sub>2</sub>. 
There&#x2019;s a lot of sulfur chemistry here&#x0021; We start with a nucleophilic attack by one sulfur atom of the
 disulfide. The intermediate contains a tricoordinate sulfur cation or sulfonium salt. The chloride ion now attacks
 the other sulfur atom of this interme-diate and two molecules of RSCl result. Each atom of the original disulfide
 has formed an S&#x2014;Cl bond. One sulfur atom was a nucleophile towards chlorine and the other an electrophile.</p>

<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>Thionyl chloride SOCl<sub>2</sub> is electrophilic at sulfur but
 sulfuryl chloride SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> is electrophilic at chlorine. Contradictory again&#x0021;</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The product of this reaction, the sulfenyl chloride, is also a good soft electrophile towards
 carbon atoms, particularly towards alkenes. The reaction is very like bromination, with a three-membered cyclic 
sulfonium ion intermediate replacing the bromonium ion of <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>. The reaction is stereospecific and the product 
is <i>anti.</i></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_658_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">At higher oxidation states the compounds become harder electrophiles as the positive charge on
 sulfur increases. We have already mentioned tosyl (para-toluenesulfonyl) chloride, TsCl, as an electrophile for 
alkoxide ions in this chapter and in earlier chapters.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">At this higher oxidation state it might seem unlikely that sulfur could also be a good nucleophile,
 but consider the result of reacting TsCl with zinc metal. Zinc provides two electrons and turns the compound into an
 anion. This anion can also be drawn in two ways.<a id="page_659" class="page"><b>Page 659,Chapter 27 Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</b></a></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_659_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Surprisingly, this anion is also a good soft nucleophile and attacks saturated carbon atoms 
through the sulfur atom. In this case attack occurs at the less substituted end of an allylic bromide to give an 
allylic sulfone, which we will use later on.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">As this chapter develops you will see other examples of the versatility of sulfur. You will see
 that it can be removed from organic compounds in either an oxidative or a reductive fashion, and you will see that it
 can stabilize anions or cations on adjacent carbon atoms. The stabilization of anions is the first main section of the
 chapter.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_27.3">
<h2 class="htwh2">Sulfur-stabilized anions</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The stabilization of anions by sulfides, sulfoxides, and sulfones is a theme that runs right 
through this chapter. Sulfur has six electrons in its outer shell. As a sulfide, therefore, the sulfur atom carries
 two lone pairs. In a sulfoxide, one of these lone pairs is used in a bond to an oxygen atom&#x2014;sulfoxides can be
 represented in at least two alternative but equivalent ways. The sulfur atom in a sulfone uses both of its lone pairs
in bonding to oxygen, and is usually represented with two S&#x003D;O double bonds.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_660_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3">Chiral sulfoxides</h3>
<p class="htwdivi">Sulfoxides have the potential for chirality&#x2014;the tetrahedral sulfur atom is surrounded by
 four different groups (here Ph, Me, O, and the lone pair) and (unlike, say, the tetrahedral nitrogen atom of an amide)
 has a stable tetrahedral configuration. We will revisit chirality in sulfoxides later in the chapter.</p>
<figure style="text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_660_2a.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></div>
<p class="htwindent1">Treatment of any of these compounds with strong base produces an anion on what was the methyl 
group. How does the sulfur stabilize the anion? This question has been the subject of many debates and we have not 
got space to go into the details of all of them. There are at least two factors involved, and the first is evident 
from this chart of pK<sub>a</sub> values for protons next to sulfone, sulfoxide, and sulfide functional groups.</p>

<p class="htwnoindenta">probable conformation of sulfone-stabilized anion</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Clearly, the oxygen atoms are important&#x2014;the best anion stabilizer is the sulfone, followed
by the sulfoxide and then the sulfide. You could compare deprotonation of a sulfone with
deprotonation of a ketone to give an enolate (<a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). Enolates have a planar carbon atom
and the anion is mainly on the oxygen atom. Sulfone-stabilized carbanions have two oxygen
atoms and the anionic carbon atom is probably planar, with the negative charge in a p orbital
aligned midway between the S&#x003D;O bonds.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<a id="page_661" class="page"><b>Page 661,Chapter 27 Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</b></a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Yet the attached oxygen atoms cannot be the sole reason for the stability of anions next to sulfur because even the sulfide functional group also acidifies an adjacent proton quite significantly. There is some controversy over exactly why this should be, but the usual explanation is that polarization of the sulfur&#x2019;s 3s and 3p electrons (which are more diffuse, and therefore more polarizable, than the 2s and 2p electrons of oxygen) contributes to the stabilization.</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3">Anion stabilization by adjacent sulfur</h3>
<p class="htwdivi" style="width:100%">It was long thought that delocalization into sulfur&#x2019;s empty 3d orbitals provided the anion stabilization required, but theo-retical work in the last 20 years or so suggests this may not be the case. Thus, <i>ab initio</i> calculations suggest that the C-S bond in -CH<sub>2</sub>SH is longer than that in CH<sub>3</sub>SH. The converse would be true if delocalization into the sulfur&#x2019;s d orbitals were important. Delocalization would shorten the bond because it would have partial double-bond character. More likely as an additional factor is delocalization into the &#x03C3;* orbital of the C-S bond on the other side of the sulfur atom&#x2014;the equatorial proton of dithiane (see page. <a href="chapter_27.xhtml#page_662">662</a> for more on dithiane) is more acidic than the axial one, and the equatorial anion is more stable because it is delocalized into the C-S bond&#x2019;s&#x03C3;* orbital.</p>

<h3 class="h3">A sulfoxide-stabilized anion in a synthesis</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">A sulfoxide alkylation formed the key step of a synthesis of the important vitamin biotin. Biotin
 contains a five-membered heterocyclic sulfide fused to a second five-membered ring, and the bicyclic skeleton was
 easy to make from a simple symmetrical ester. The vital step is a double S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction on primary carbon
 atoms.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_661_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The next step was to introduce the alkyl chain&#x2014;this was best done by first oxidizing the
 sulfide to a sulfoxide, using sodium periodate. The sulfoxide was then deprotonated with &#x00AB;-BuLi and alkylated 
with an alkyl iodide containing a carboxylic acid protected as its <i>tert-butyl</i> ester. Reduction of the sulfoxide
 and hydrolysis back to the free acid gave biotin.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/> &#160;This synthesis involves some stereochemistry, which will be

<h3 class="h3">Thioacetals</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Although sulfide deprotonations are possible, the protons adjacent to <i>two</i> sulfide sulfur
 atoms are rather more acidic and alkylation of thioacetals is straightforward.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_661_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a id="page_662" class="page"><b>Page 662,Chapter 27 Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</b></a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In general, thioacetals can be made in a similar way to &#x2019;normal&#x2019; (oxygen-based)
 acetals&#x2014;by treatment of an aldehyde or a ketone with a thiol and an acid catalyst&#x2014;although a Lewis
acid such as BF<sub>3</sub> is usually needed rather than a protic acid. The most easily made, most stable toward
 hydrolysis, and most reactive towards alkylation are cyclic thioacetals derived from 1,3-propanedithiol, known as 
dithianes.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_662_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Dithianes are extremely important compounds in organic synthesis because <i>going from carbonyl
 compound to thioacetal inverts the polarity at the functionalized carbon atom.</i> Aldehydes, as you are well aware,
 are electrophiles at the C&#x003D;O carbon atom, but dithioacetals, through deprotonation to an anion, are
 nucleophilic at this same atom.</p>

<div class="htwblue1" style="width:70%">
<h3 class="h3">Dithianes in synthesis</h3>
<p class="htwdivi" style="width:100%">An example: chemists wanted to make this compound 
(a &#x2019;metacyclophane&#x2019;) because they wanted to study the independent rotation of the two benzene rings,
 which is hindered in such a small ring. An ideal way would be to join electrophilic benzylic bromides to nucleophilic
 carbonyl groups, if that were possible.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;">
<img src="../images/page_662_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwdivi">The dibromide and dialdehyde were both available&#x2014;what they really wanted was a nucleophilic
 equivalent of the dialdehyde to react with the dibromide. So they made the dithiane. Sulfur is less basic than
oxygen, so the protonated species is lower in concentration at a given pH, and the sulfur 3p lone pairs are less able
 to form a stable <i>n</i> bond to carbon than are the oxygen 2p lone pairs.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;">
<img src="../images/page_662_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwdivi">After the dithianes have been alkylated, they can be hydrolysed to give back the carbonyl groups.
 Alternatively, hydrogenation using Raney nickel replaces the thioacetal with a CH<sub>2</sub> group and gives the

<p class="htwindent1">This reaction is an equilibrium and it may be necessary in making sulfonium salts from less

 non-nucleophilic counterions, for example Me<sub>3</sub>O&#x002B; BF&#x2014; trimethyloxonium fluoroborate

 reactions: the carbanion of the ylid attacks the carbonyl group in a nucleophilic addition reaction. The 
intermediate in the Wittig reaction cyclizes to give a four-membered ring but this does not happen with the sulfur

<h3 class="h3"><b>'Stabilized' sulfonium ylids</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">If there is a conjugating group on the carbanion carbon atom of the
 ylid, the ylid is more stable and its reactions may change. Firstly, an example where
 the ylid is stabilized by a cyanide. As you have just seen, the simple sulfonium ylid 
gives the epoxide from this &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ketone. But the 'stabilized' ylid gives the
 cyclopropane instead.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_666_2.jpg" alt="images" style="margin-left:-1em"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"></img> You saw similar reactions of 
enolates to form epoxides (the Darzens reaction) and cyclopropanes in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In the absence of the conjugated alkene, both types of ylid give
 epoxides&#x2014;the ester-stabi-lized ylid, for example, reacts with the diketone 
known as benzil to give an epoxide but with methyl vinyl ketone (but-3-en-2-one) to
 give a cyclopropane.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_666_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Why does the stabilized ylid prefer to react with the double bond? The
 enone has two electrophilic sites, but from <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>, in which we discussed the
 regioselectivity of attack of nucleophiles on Michael acceptors like this, you would
 expect that direct 1,2-attack on the ketone is the faster reaction. This step is 
irreversible, and subsequent displacement of the sulfide leaving group by the alkoxide 
produces an epoxide. Whether a cyclopropane product would have been more stable is 
irrelevant to the outcome: the epoxide forms faster and is therefore the 
kinetic product.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">With a stabilized ylid, direct addition to the carbonyl group is, in 
fact, probably still the faster reaction. But in this case, the starting materials are
 sufficiently stable that the reaction is reversible, and the sulfonium ylid is re-expelled
 before the epoxide has a chance to form. Meanwhile, some ylid adds to the ketone in a 1,4 
(Michael or conjugate) fashion. 1,4-Addition, although slower, is energetically more 
favourable because the new C&#x2014;C bond is gained at the expense of a (relatively)
 weak C&#x003D;C &#x03C0; bond rather than a (relatively) strong C&#x003D;O &#x03C0; bond, and is 
therefore irreversible. Eventually, all the ylid ends up adding in a 1,4-fashion, 
generating an enolate as it does so, which cyclizes to give the cyclopropane, which 
is the thermodynamic product. This is another classic example of kinetic versus 
thermodynamic control, and you can add it to your mental list of examples.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">There is another, very important, class of stabilized sulfur
 ylids that owe their stability not to an additional anion-stabilizing substituent
 but to a more anion-stabilizing sulfur group. These are the <b>sulfoxonium ylids</b>, 
made from dimethylsulfoxide by S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution with an alkyl halide. Note 
that the sulfur atom is the nucleophile rather than the oxygen atom in spite of the charge 
distribution. The high-energy sulfur lone pair is better at S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution at

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Silicon and carbon compared</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Silicon is immediately below carbon in the periodic table and the most
 obvious similarity is that both elements normally have a valency of four and both form
 tetrahedral compounds. There are important differences in the chemistry of carbon and 
silicon&#x2014;silicon is less important and many books are devoted solely to carbon 
chemistry but relatively few to silicon chemistry. Carbon forms many stable trigonal 
and linear compounds containing n bonds; silicon forms few. The most important difference 
is the strength of the silicon&#x2014;oxygen <i>a</i> bond (368 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and
 the relative weakness of the silicon-silicon (230 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) bond. Together these
 values account for the absence, in the oxygen-rich atmosphere of earth, of silicon analogues
 of the plethora of structures possible with a carbon skeleton.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_668_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">Several of the values in the table give insight into the reactivity
 differences between carbon
and silicon. Bonds to electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with
carbon; in particular, the silicon&#x2014;fluorine bond is one of the 
strongest single bonds known,
while bonds to electropositive elements are weaker. Silicon-hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than their carbon counterparts and can be cleaved easily. Here are a few organosilicon
compounds.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_668_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In this section we will mostly discuss compounds with four Si&#x2014;C 
bonds. Three of these
bonds will usually be the same so we will often have a Me<sub>3</sub>Si group
attached to an organic
molecule. We shall discuss reactions in which something interesting happens to the organic
molecule as one of the Si&#x2014;C bonds reacts to give a new Si&#x2014;F or Si&#x2014;O 
bond. We shall also
discuss organosilicon compounds as reagents, such as triethylsilane
 (Et<sub>3</sub>SiH), which is a reduc-
ing agent whereas Et<sub>3</sub>C&#x2014;H is not.<a id="page_669" class="page">Page 669, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a></p>
<p class="htwindent1">The carbon-silicon bond is strong enough for the trialkyl silyl group 
to survive synthetic transformations on the rest of the molecule but weak enough for it to
 be cleaved specifically when we want. In particular, fluoride ion is a poor nucleophile for 
carbon compounds but attacks silicon very readily. Another important factor is the length of
 the C&#x2014;Si bond (1.89 A)&#x2014;it is significantly longer than a typical C&#x2014;C 
bond (1.54 A). Silicon has a lower electronegativity (1.8) than carbon (2.5) and therefore 
C&#x2014;Si bonds are polarized towards the carbon. This makes the silicon susceptible to 
attack by nucleophiles. The strength of the C&#x2014;Si bond means that alkyl silanes are 
stable but the most useful chemistry arises from carbon substituents other than simple alkyl
 groups.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Silicon has an affinity for electronegative atoms</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The most effective nucleophiles for silicon are the electronegative ones
 that will form strong bonds to silicon. Those based on oxygen or halide ions (chloride and
 fluoride) are pre-eminent. You saw this in the choice of reagent for the selective cleavage
 of silyl ethers in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride is often used as this is an
 organic-soluble ionic fluoride and forms a silyl fluoride as the by-product. The mechanism
 is not a simple S<sub>N</sub>2 process and has no direct analogue in carbon chemistry. It
 looks like a substitution at a hindered tertiary centre, which ought to be virtually 
impossible. Two characteristics of silicon facilitate the process: the long silicon&#x2014;
carbon bonds relieve the steric interactions and the d orbitals of silicon provide a target
 for the nucleophile that does not have the same geometric constraints as a C&#x2014;O &#x03C3;* 
orbital.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_669_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Attack of the fluoride on the empty d orbital leads to a negatively
 charged pentacoordinate intermediate that breaks down with loss of the alkoxide. The 
discrete pentacoordinate trigonal bipyramid intermediate contrasts with the similarly 
shaped pentacoordinate transition state of a carbon-based S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. It 
is often omitted in mechanistic schemes because it is formed slowly and decomposes quickly,
 and the mechanism is still referred to as 'S<sub>N</sub>2 at silicon'.</p>
<div class="htwyellow1">
<p class="htwdivi"><b><img src="../images/dot.jpg"></img> Silicon forms strong bonds with oxygen and very strong bonds with 
fluorine.</b></p></div>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Nucleophilic substitution at silicon</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">You may wonder why trimethylsilyl chloride does not use the
 S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism familiar from the analogous carbon compound f-butyl chloride.
 There is, in fact, nothing wrong with the Me<sub>3</sub>Si&#x002B; cation&#x2014;it can
 be detected in mass spectra, for example. The reason is simply that the 
<small>'S<sub>n</sub></small>2' reaction at silicon is too good for S<sub>N</sub>1 to 
compete.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_669_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">There are some important differences between the S<sub>N</sub>2 
substitutions at Si and at C. Alkyl halides are soft electrophiles but silyl halides
 are hard electrophiles. Alkyl halides react only very slowly with fluoride ion but 
silyl halides react more rapidly with fluoride than with any other nucleophile. The 
best nucleophiles for saturated carbon are neutral or based on elements down the periodic 
table (S, Se, I) or both. The best nucleophiles for silicon are charged and based on highly 
electronegative atoms (chiefly F, Cl, and O). A familiar example is the reaction of enolates
 at carbon with alkyl halides but at oxygen with silyl chlorides (<a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>).<a id="page_670" class="page">Page 670, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_670_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">When a Me<sub>3</sub>Si group is removed from an organic molecule
 with hydroxide ion, the product is not the silanol as you might expect but the silyl 
ether 'hexamethyldisiloxane'.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_670_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The other side of the coin is that the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at carbon is <i>not</i> much affected by partial positive charge (8&#x002B;) on the carbon atom. The 'S<sub>N</sub>2' reaction at silicon <i>is</i> affected by the charge on silicon. The most electrophilic silicon compounds are the silyl triflates and it is estimated that they react some 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> times faster with oxygen nucleophiles than do silyl chlorides. Trimethylsilyl triflate is, in fact, an excellent Lewis acid and can be used to form acetals or silyl enol ethers from carbonyl compounds, and to react these two together in aldol-style reactions. In all three reactions the triflate attacks an oxygen atom. In the acetal formation, silylation occurs twice at the carbonyl oxygen atom and the final leaving group is hexamethyldisiloxane. You should compare this with the normal acid-catalysed mechanism described in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, where the carbonyl group is twice protonated and the leaving group is water.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_670_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Silyl ethers are versatile protecting groups for alcohols</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">Silicon-based protecting groups for alcohols are the best because they are the most versatile. They are removed by nucleophilic displacement with fluoride or oxygen nucleophiles and the rate of removal depends mostly on the steric bulk of the silyl group. The simplest is trimethylsilyl (Me<sub>3</sub>Si or often just TMS), which is also the most easily removed as it is the least hindered. In fact, it is removed so easily by water with a trace of base or acid that special handling is required to keep this labile group in place. These protecting groups are discussed in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>.</p>
<p class="htwdivi">Replacement of the one of the methyl groups with a much more sterically demanding tertiary butyl group gives the f-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group, which is stable to normal handling and survives aqueous work-up or column chroma-tography on silica gel. The stability to these isolation and purification conditions has made TBDMS (sometimes over-abbreviated to TBS) a very popular choice for organic synthesis. TBDMS is introduced by a substitution reaction on the corresponding silyl chloride with imidazole in DMF. Yields are usually virtually quantitative and the conditions are mild. Primary alcohols are protected in the presence of secondary alcohols. Removal relies on the strong affinity of fluoride for silicon and is usually very efficient and selective.</p>
<p class="htwdivi">However, a protecting group is useful only if it can be introduced and removed in high yield without affecting the rest of the molecule and if it can survive a wide range of conditions in the course of the synthesis. The extreme steric bulk of the f-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) group makes it useful for selective protection of unhindered primary alcohols in the presence of secondary alcohols.</p>
<p class="htwdivi">The most stable common silyl protecting group (triisopropylsilyl or TIPS) has three branched alkyl substituents to protect the central silicon from attack by nucleophiles, which would lead to cleavage. All three hindered silyl groups (TBDMS, TBDPS, and TIPS) have excellent stability but can still be removed with fluoride.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Peterson elimination</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">There are many reactions in organic chemistry in which an
 Me<sub>3</sub>Si group acts like a proton. Just as acidic protons are removed by bases, 
silicon is readily removed by hard nucleophiles, particularly F<sup>-</sup> or
 RO<sup>-</sup>, and this can promote an elimination. An example is shown here.</p>

<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img>Interactive mechanism
 for Peterson elimination</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This reaction is known as the <b>Peterson elimination</b>. It 
is rather like those we discussed in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>&#x2014;eliminations of alcohols under
 acidic conditions to give alkenes. But, unlike those reactions, it is fully regioselective
 and so is particularly useful for making double bonds where other elimination methods might
 give the wrong regioisomer or mixtures of regioisomers. In this next example only one 
product is formed, in high yield, and it has an exocyclic double bond. Just think what
 would have happened without the silicon atom (ignore the one attached to the
oxygen&#x2014;that's just a protecting group). This compound is, in fact, an 
intermediate in a synthetic route to the important anticancer compound Taxol.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_671_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The Peterson reaction is particularly useful for making terminal or
 exocyclic double bonds connectively because the starting material (the magnesium derivative 
shown above) is easily made from available Me<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>Br.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Alkynyl silanes are used for protection and activation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Terminal alkynes have an acidic proton (pK<sub>a</sub> ca. 25) that 
can be removed by very strong bases such as organometallic reagents (Grignards, RLi, etc.).
 While this is often what is intended, in other circumstances it may be an unwanted side 
reaction that would consume an organo- metallic reagent or interfere with the chosen
 reaction. Exchange of the terminal proton of an alkyne for a trimethylsilyl group exploits
 the relative acidity of the proton and provides a neat solution to these problems. The 
SiMe<sub>3</sub> group protects the terminus of the alkyne during the reaction but can then
 be removed with fluoride or sodium hydroxide. A classic case is the removal of a proton 
next door to a terminal alkyne.</p>

 but is not very convenient to handle as it is an explosive gas. Trimethylsilylacetylene
 is a distillable liquid that is a convenient substitute for acetylene in reactions involving
 the lithium derivative as it has only one acidic proton. The synthesis of this alkynyl
 ketone is an example. Deprotonation with butyl lithium provides the alkynyl lithium that
 reacted with the alkyl chloride in the presence of iodide as nucleophilic catalyst
 (see <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>). Removal of the trimethylsilyl<a id="page_672" class="page">Page 672, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a> group with potassium carbonate in methanol allowed further reaction on

<h3 class="h3"><b>Silicon stabilizes a positive charge on the &#x03B2; carbon</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">In common with ordinary alkynes, silylated alkynes are nucleophilic
 towards electrophiles. The presence of the silicon has a dramatic effect on the
 regioselectivity of this reaction: attack occurs only at the atom directly bonded to 
the silicon. This must be because the intermediate cation is stabilized.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_672_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="htwindent1">The familiar hierarchy of carbocation stability&#x2014;tertiary
 &#x003E; secondary &#x003E; primary&#x2014;is due to the stabilization of the positive 
charge by donation of electron density from adjacent C&#x2014;H or C&#x2014;C bonds 
(their filled &#x03C3; orbitals to be precise) that are aligned correctly with the
 vacant orbital. The electropositive nature of silicon makes C&#x2014;Si bonds even 
more effective donors: a silyl group &#x03B2; to a positive charge (i.e. attached to the next-door 
carbon) stabilizes a positive charge so effectively that the course of a reaction involving 
cationic intermediates is often completely controlled. This is stabilization
 by &#x03C3; donation.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_672_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The stabilization of the cation also weakens the C&#x2014;Si bond by 
delocalization so that the bond is more easily broken. Attack of a nucleophile 
(particularly a halogen or oxygen nucleophile) on silicon removes it from the organic
 fragment and the net result is electrophilic substitution in which the silicon has been 
replaced by the electrophile.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> &#160;The nucleophile does not 
need to be very powerful because of the weakening of the C&#x2014;Si bond. Many neutral
 molecules with a lone pair and almost any anion will do, even triflate 
(CF<sub>3</sub>SQ<sub>2</sub>Q-).</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This is useful for the synthesis of alkynyl ketones, which are
 difficult to make directly with conventional organometallic reagents such as
 alkynyl&#x2014;Li or &#x2014;MgBr because they add a second time to the ketone 
product. Alkynyl silanes react in a Friedel&#x2014;Crafts manner with acid chlorides 
in the presence of Lewis acids, such as aluminium chloride, to give the ketones.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Aryl silanes undergo</b> <i>ipso</i> <b>substitution with 
electrophiles</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Exactly the same sort of mechanism accounts for the reactions
 of aryl silanes with electrophiles under Friedel&#x2014;Crafts conditions. Instead of 
the usual rules governing <i>ortho, meta,</i> and <i>para</i> substitution using the 
directing effects of the substituents, there is just one rule: the silyl group is replaced
 by the electrophile at the same atom on the ring&#x2014;this is known as <i>ipso</i> <a id="page_673" class="page">Page 673, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a>substitution. Actually, this selectivity comes from the same principles 
as those used for ordinary aromatic substitution (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>): the electrophile reacts to
 produce the most stable cation&#x2014;in this case p to silicon. Cleavage of the weakened 
C&#x2014;Si bond by any nucleophile leads directly to the <i>ipso</i> product.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">There is an alternative site of attack <i>meta</i> to silicon that
 would lead to a cation p to Si. But this cation is not particularly stable because the
 vacant p orbital is orthogonal to the C&#x2014;Si bond and so cannot interact with it
 as the C&#x2014;Si bond is still in the plane of the ring. This illustrates that it is 
more important to understand the origin of the effect based on molecular orbitals rather

<h3 class="h3"><b>Vinyl silanes offer a regio- and stereoselective route to alkenes</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Vinyl silanes react with electrophiles in a similarly regioselective
 process in which the silicon is replaced by the electrophile at the <i>ipso</i> carbon atom.
 The stereochemistry of the vinyl silane is important because this exchange usually occurs
 with retention of geometry as well.<a id="page_674" class="page">Page 674, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_674_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This is a curious and interesting reaction that deserves explanation.
 Addition of the electrophile next to silicon leads to the more stable cation &#x03B2; to silicon.
 In the vinyl silane the C&#x2014;Si bond is orthogonal to the p orbitals of the &#x03C0; bond, but 
as the electrophile attacks the &#x03C0; bond, say from underneath, the Me<sub>3</sub>Si group 
starts to move upwards. As it rotates, the angle between the C&#x2014;Si bond and the 
remaining p orbital decreases from 90&#x00B0;. As the angle decreases, the interaction
 between the C&#x2014;Si bond and the empty p orbital of the cation increases. There is
 every reason for the rotation to continue in the same direction and no reason for it to
 reverse. The diagram shows that, in the resulting cation, the electrophile is in the 
position formerly occupied by the Me<sub>3</sub>Si group, <i>trans</i> to Ph. Loss of 
the group now gives retention of stereochemistry.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_674_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The intermediate cation has only a single bond and so rotation might 
be expected to lead to a mixture of geometrical isomers of the product but this is not 
observed. The bonding interaction between the C&#x2014;Si bond and the empty p orbital 
means that rotation is restricted. This stabilization weakens the C&#x2014;Si bond and
 the silyl group is quickly removed before any further rotation can occur. The stabilization
 is effective only if the C&#x2014;Si bond is correctly aligned with the vacant orbital,
 which means it must be in the same plane&#x2014;rather like a &#x03C0; bond. Here is the result
 for both <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> isomers of the vinyl silane.</p>

Protodesilylation, as the process of replacing silicon with a proton is known, is one such
 important reaction. The halogens are also useful electrophiles while organic halides,

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Allyl silanes as nucleophiles</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">If the silyl group is moved along the carbon chain by just one atom, 
an allyl silane results. Allyl silanes can be produced from allyl organometallic reagents
 but there is often a problem over which regioisomer is produced and mixtures often result.
 Better methods control the position of the double bond. Two useful examples take advantage
 of the Wittig reaction and the Peterson elimination to construct the alkene linkage. The
 reagents are prepared from tri- methylsilyl halides either by formation of the corresponding
 Grignard reagent or alkylation with a primary Wittig reagent and deprotonation to form a new
 ylid. The Grignard reagent, with added cerium trichloride, adds twice to esters to give the 
corresponding tertiary alcohol, which loses one of its Me<sub>3</sub>Si groups in a Peterson
 elimination to reveal the remaining Me<sub>3</sub>Si group as part of allyl silane.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_675_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The Wittig reagent is made by alkylation of the simplest ylid with 
the same silicon reagent. Notice that the leaving group (iodide) is on the carbon next 
to silicon, not on the silicon itself. Anion formation occurs next to phosphorus because
 Ph<sub>3</sub>P<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is much more anion-stabilizing than Me<sub>3</sub>Si. The ylid 
reacts with carbonyl compounds such as cyclohexanone in the usual way to produce the allyl
 silane with no ambiguity over which end of the allyl system is silylated.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_675_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The carbon-silicon bond has two important effects on the adjacent 
alkene. The presence of a high-energy filled &#x03C3; orbital of the correct symmetry
 to interact with the &#x03C0; system produces an alkene that is more reactive with electrophiles, 
due to the higher-energy HOMO, and the same &#x03C3; orbital stabilizes the carbocation if attack
 occurs at the remote end of the alkene. This lowers the transition state for electrophilic 
addition and makes allyl silanes much more reactive than isolated alkenes.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Allyl silanes are more reactive than vinyl silanes but also
 react through &#x03B2;-silyl cations</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Vinyl silanes have C-Si bonds orthogonal to the p orbitals of the
 alkene&#x2014;the C-Si bond is in the nodal plane of the &#x03C0; bond&#x2014;so there can be no
 interaction between the C-Si bond and the &#x03C0; bond. Allyl silanes, by contrast, have C-Si 
bonds that can be, and normally are, parallel to the p orbitals of the &#x03C0; bond so that
 interaction is possible.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_675_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
	
<p class="htwindent1">Allyl silanes react with electrophiles with even greater 
regioselectivity than that of vinyl silanes. The cation &#x03B2; to the silyl group is
 again formed but there are two important differences. Most obviously, the electrophile 
attacks at the other end of the allylic system and there is no rotation necessary as the
 C-Si bond is already in a position to overlap efficiently with the intermediate cation.
 The process is terminated by loss of silicon in the usual way to regenerate an alkene.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><a id="page_676" class="page">Page 676, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a><img src="../images/page_676_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Molecular orbitals demonstrate the smooth transition from the 
allyl silane, which has a &#x03C0; bond and a C&#x2014;Si &#x03C3; bond, to the allylic product
 with a new &#x03C0; bond and a new &#x03C3; bond to the electrophile. The intermediate cation 
is mainly stabilized by &#x03C3; donation from the C&#x2014;Si bond into the vacant p 
orbital but it has other &#x03C3;-donating groups (C&#x2014;H, C&#x2014;C, and C&#x2014;E) that 
also help. The overall process is electrophilic substitution with allylic rearrangement.
 Both the site of attachment of the electrophile and the position of the new double bond
 are dictated by the silicon.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_676_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Allyl silanes are rather like silyl enol ethers: they react with 
electrophiles, provided they are activated, for example by a Lewis acid. Titanium
 tetrachloride is widely used but other successful Lewis acids include boron trifluoride, 
aluminium chloride, and trimethylsilyl triflate. Electrophiles include acylium ions 
produced from acid chlorides, carbocations from tertiary halides or secondary benzylic
 halides, activated enones, and epoxides all in the presence of Lewis acid. In each case

halide such as TiCl<sub>4</sub> or ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, activates the carbonyl compound by 
forming an oxonium ion with a metal&#x2014;oxygen bond. The allyl silane attacks in the
 usual way and the &#x03B2;-silyl cation is desilylated with the halide ion. Hydrolysis of the 
metal alkoxide gives a homoallylic alcohol.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">A closely related reactive oxonium ion can be prepared by Lewis
 acid catalysed breakdown of the corresponding acetal. Alternatively, especially if 
the acetal is at least partly a silyl acetal, the same oxonium ion can be produced
 <i>in situ</i> using yet more silicon in the form of TMSOTf as the Lewis acid catalyst.
 All these intermediate oxonium ions act as powerful electrophiles towards allyl silanes, 
producing homoallylic alcohols or ethers.</p>

control over the geometry of the product: treating sec-butanol in acid, for example, gives
 mainly the more substituted 2-butene, but as a 3:1 mixture of geometrical isomers. But
 there are some important exceptions. If the product has the double bond inside a ring of 
less than eight members, it has to be a <i>cis</i> double bond. Examples include the simple 
dehydration of a cyclopentanol and an intramolecular aldol reaction. The six-membered ring is 
formed before the dehydration step.</p>

 have an all-carbon ring to preserve the <i>cis</i> geometry of a double bond. Lactones

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Equilibration of alkenes</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Acyclic <i>E</i> alkenes are usually more stable than acyclic
 <i>Z</i> alkenes because they are less steri- cally hindered. Yet <i>Z</i> alkenes 
do not spontaneously convert to <i>E</i> alkenes because the n bond prevents free rotation:
 the energy required to break the n bond is about 260 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (rotation about a 
<i>a</i> bond requires about 10 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). You may therefore find the following 
result surprising. Dimethyl maleate is easily made by refluxing maleic anhydride in methanol
 with an acid catalyst. If the product is isolated straight away, a liquid boiling at 
199-202&#x00B0;C is obtained. This is dimethyl maleate. However, if the product is left 
to stand, crystals of <i>dimethyl fumarate</i> (the <i>E</i> isomer of dimethyl maleate)
form. How has the geometry been inverted so easily?</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_679_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">A clue is that the process is accelerated enormously by a trace of
 amine. Michael addition of this amine, or of methanol, or any other nucleophile, provides
 a chemical mechanism by which the n bond can be broken. There is free rotation in the 
intermediate, and re-elimination of the nucleophile can give either <i>E</i> or <i>Z</i>
 alkene. The greater stability and crystallinity of the <i>E</i> alkene means that it
 dominates the equilibrium. Michael addition therefore provides a mechanism for the
 equilibration of <i>Z</i> alkenes to <i>E</i> alkenes.<a id="page_680" class="page">Page 680, Chapter 27 sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a></p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Using light to make</b> <i>Z</i> <b>alkenes from</b> <i>E</i> 
<b>alkenes</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Light allows the interconversion of the two isomers of an alkene
 by promoting a n electron into the n* orbital and transiently breaking the n bond,
 but the way light favours formation of the <i>Z</i> isomer is rather subtle. One 
difference between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> alkenes is that the <i>trans</i> alkenes 
usually absorb light better than the <i>cis</i> alkenes&#x2014;they absorb light of a higher
 wavelength and they absorb more of it, particularly when conjugated with carbonyl groups.
 Steric hindrance forces the <i>cis</i> alkene to twist about the <i>a</i> bond joining the
 alkene to the carbonyl group and conjugation is then less efficient. In a mixture of 
<i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> alkenes, the <i>E</i> alkene is more prone to isomerization by light,
 so the <i>Z</i> isomer builds up in the mixture.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Here is an example. Aldol condensation of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde 
gives pure <i>E</i> alkene for the reasons explained above. Irradiation with
 longer-wavelength UV light equilibrates this to the <i>Z</i> alkene in 
excellent yield.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">It is not possible for the benzene ring and the enone system to
 be planar in the Z-enone and so they twist, making conjugation not as good as in
 the &#x00A3;-enone. Longer-wavelength light is absorbed only by the &#x00A3;-enone,
 which is continually equilibrated back to the excited state. Eventually, all the
 &#x00A3;-enone is converted to the Z-enone, which is not as efficiently excited by
 the light. The final mixture of &#x00A3;- and Z-enone is known as a 'photostationary

<p class="htwindent1">This reaction provides a useful way of introducing a double bond next to a carbonyl group. Here it is in a synthesis of the Queen Bee Substance (the compound fed by the workers to those bee larvae destined to become queens). The compound is also a pheromone of the termite and is used to trap these destructive pests. The sulfur is introduced by reacting the enolate of the ester with the sulfur electrophile MeSSMe. Next, the protecting group is removed with acid, and the sulfide is oxidized to the sulfoxide with sodium periodate (NaIO<sub>4</sub>) ready for elimination. Heating to 110 &#x00B0;C then gives the Queen Bee Substance in 86&#x0025; yield.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">The Julia olefination is regiospecific and connective</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Sulfoxide eliminations are a valuable way of introducing a double bond to an already intact carbon skeleton. The alkene synthesis we are about to show you is also based on sulfur chemistry, but is <i>connective</i>&#x2014;the alkene is formed by joining together two separate fragments. It is called the <b>Julia olefination</b> and is probably the most important application of the sulfone- stabilized anions you saw earlier in the chapter. Only the alkene shown is formed, with the double bond joining the two carbons that carried the PhSO<sub>2</sub> and PhCO<sub>2</sub> groups. This elimination is promoted by a reducing agent, traditionally sodium amalgam (a solution of sodium metal in mercury) and works for a variety of compounds providing they have a phenylsulfonyl group adjacent to a leaving group.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Common leaving groups are carboxylates such as acetate or benzoate, and the starting materials are very easily made. The sulfone-stabilized anion adds to aldehydes and a simple esterification step, which can be done in the same reaction vessel, introduces the acetate or benzoate group. This is how the starting material for the elimination above was made.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The Julia olefination is stereoselective</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Here are the results of a few simple Julia olefinations. Notice that deprotonations can be with BuLi or EtMgBr and that the acylation step works with acetic anhydride or with benzoyl chloride. As you can see, they are all highly stereoselective for the <i>E</i> isomer, and the Julia olefination is one of the most important ways of making <i>E</i> double bonds connectively.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The reason for the <i>E</i> selectivity lies in the mechanism of the elimination. The details are not fully clear, but the first step, under the basic conditions of the reduction, appears to be the elimination of the acetate or benzoate ester to give a vinyl sulfone.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:5em">
<img src="../images/page_687_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The stereochemistry of the vinyl sulfone does not matter because it is immediately reduced by an electron from sodium to give a vinyl radical. Much as you saw above, in the Birch reduction of alkynes, the vinyl radical collects a second electron and becomes a vinyl anion, which chooses to adopt the more stable <i>E</i> configuration before being protonated to give the predominantly <i>E</i> alkene.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_687_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We know that there must be an anion intermediate because the elimination is <i>not stereo-specific</i>&#x2014;in other words, whichever diastereoisomer of the starting material you use (all of the examples in this section have been mixtures of diastereoisomers) you always get the <i>E</i> alkene product.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The one-step Julia olefination</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The Julia reaction is remarkably versatile but it does need three steps to make the alkene: addition, acylation, and reduction. A more recent version of the reaction cuts this down to one by using not a phenylsulfone but instead a sulfone carrying an electron-deficient heterocycle, for example a tetrazole. The anion of the sulfone is made with a strong base (here potassium hexamethyldisilazide, KHMDS&#x2014;see p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_635">635</a>) and is added to an aldehyde to give an alkene directly.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">You met a stereospecific elimination in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>. The requirement for the H and the Br to be anti-periplanar in the E2 transition state meant that the two diastereoisomers of this alkyl bromide eliminated to alkenes with different double bond geometries (p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_396">396</a>).</p>

<p class="htwindent1">However, reactions like this are of limited use&#x2014;their success relies on the base&#x2019;s lack of choice of protons to attack. Logic dictates that only trisubstituted double bonds can be made stereospecifically in this way: the reaction must not have a choice of hydrogen atoms or an <i>E</i> alkene will result stereoselectively (as in the example on p. <a href="chapter_27.xhtml#page_684">684</a>). The answer is, of course, to move away from eliminations involving H, and we can do this by returning to the Peterson elimination, which you met on p. <a href="chapter_27.xhtml#page_671">671</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Peterson reaction is stereospecific</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The stereospecificity of this elimination involving silicon arises because it is an E2 elimination proceeding via an anti-periplanar transition state. In principle, it can therefore be used to make single geometrical isomers of alkenes, the geometry depending on the relative stereochemistry of the starting material.

<p class="htwindent1">Conceptually, the Wittig reaction is like the base-promoted Peterson reaction: it is a <i>syn</i> elimination, driven by the strength of an oxygen&#x2014;heteroatom bond, although in this case the heteroatom is phosphorus. But the elimination step of the Wittig reaction occurs only from an intermediate and not from isolated starting materials. This intermediate is made <i>in situ</i> in the reaction and decomposes spontaneously: the Wittig reaction is therefore another connective alkene-forming reaction, but its simplicity makes it more widely used than the Julia or Peterson reactions.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">To understand the details of the reaction, we must start at the beginning. Phosphorus atoms, especially those that are positively charged or that carry electronegative substituents, can increase the acidity of protons adjacent to them on the carbon skeleton. Phosphonium salts (made in a manner analogous to the formation of ammonium salts from amines, in other words by reaction of an alkyl halide with a phosphine) can therefore be deprotonated by a moderately strong base to give a species known as an <b>ylid</b> (sometimes spelled <b>ylide</b>), carrying (formally) a positive and a negative charge on adjacent atoms. Ylids can alternatively be represented as doubly bonded species, called <b>phosphoranes</b>.</p>

Oxaphosphetanes are unstable: they undergo elimination to give an alkene (65&#x0025; yield for this particular example) with a phosphine oxide as a by-product. The phosphorus-oxygen double bond is extremely strong and it is this that drives the whole reaction forward.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The</b> <i>Z</i><b>-selective Wittig reaction</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The <i>Z</i> selectivity observed with simple alkyl R groups is nicely complementary to the <i>E</i> selectivity observed in the Julia olefination. This complementarity was exploited by some chemists who wanted to make isomers of capsaicin (the compound that gives chilli peppers<a id="page_691" class="page">Page 691, Chapter 27 Sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus in organic chemistry</a> their 'hotness') to follow up suggestions that capsaicin might be carcinogenic. The key intermediates in the synthesis of the <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> isomers of capsaicin were the <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> unsaturated esters shown below. By using a Wittig reaction with an unstabilized ylid it was possible to make the <i>Z</i> isomer selectively, whilst the Julia olefination gave the <i>E</i> isomer.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_691_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">How can the <i>Z</i> selectivity in Wittig reactions of unstabilized ylids be explained? We have a more complex situation in this reaction than we had for the other eliminations we considered because we have two separate processes to consider: formation of the oxaphosphetane and decomposition of the oxaphosphetane to the alkene. The elimination step is the easier one to explain&#x2014;it is stereospecific, with the oxygen and phosphorus departing in a syn-periplanar transition state. Addition of the ylid to the aldehyde can, in principle, produce two diastereo- isomers of the intermediate oxaphosphetane. Provided that this step is irreversible, then the stereospecificity of the elimination step means that the ratio of the final alkene geometrical isomers will reflect the stereoselectivity of this addition step.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">When R is not conjugating or anion-stabilizing, the <i>syn</i> diastereoisomer of the oxaphos- phetane is formed preferentially, and the predominantly <i>Z</i> alkene that results reflects this. The <i>Z</i>-selective Wittig reaction therefore consists of a stereoselective first step, to form the <i>syn</i> oxaphosphetane, followed by a stereospecific elimination from this intermediate to give a <i>Z</i> alkene.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_691_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Why the <i>syn</i> oxaphosphetane is favoured with unstabilized ylids is the subject of much debate because the mechanism by which the oxaphosphetane is formed is not entirely understood. One possible explanation relies on rules of orbital symmetry, which you will meet in Chapters 34 and 35&#x2014;we need not explain them in detail here but there is good reason to believe that, if the ylid and carbonyl compound react together to give the oxaphosphetane in one step, they will do so by approaching one another at right angles. Here we have drawn the ylid in its phosphorane form, adding to benzaldehyde. Keeping the large substituents apart produces a transition state like that shown below, which (correctly) predicts that the oxaphos- phetane will have <i>syn</i> stereochemistry.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">These stabilized ylids really are stable&#x2014;this one, for example, can be recrystallized from water and the ylid is more stable than the phosphonium salt from which it might be made. This stability means though that they are not very reactive, and often it is better not to use the phosphonium salt but a phosphonate instead.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_692_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Phosphonate esters can be deprotonated with sodium hydride or alkoxide anions to give enolate-type anions that react well with aldehydes or ketones to give <i>E</i> alkenes. Alkene- forming reactions with phosphonates are called <b>Horner&#x2014;Wadsworth&#x2014;Emmons</b> (or Horner<b>&#x2014;</b> Emmons, Wadsworth<b>&#x2014;</b> Emmons, or even Horner-Wittig) <b>reactions</b>.

<p class="htwindent1">The synthesis below offers a nice illustration of the contrasting selectivity of the two classes of Wittig reagent. The female silkworm moth attracts mates by producing a pheromone known as bombykol. Bombykol is an E,Z-diene, and in this synthesis two successive Wittig reactions use first a stabilized and second an unstabilized ylid to control the stereochemistry of the product.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_692_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">So why is there a change to <i>E</i> stereoselectivity when the ylid is stabilized? Again, the details are still unclear, and there are several possible explanations. Here we give one which is gaining ground, supported by recent experimental and computational evidence. It seems that, as with unstabilized ylids, the stereochemistry of the alkene product is determined by the stereochemistry of the intermediate oxaphosphetane, which with stabilized ylids must be <i>anti.</i></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_692_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">It used to be thought that the formation of the <i>anti</i> oxaphosphetane was under thermo-dynamic
 control, but it now seems likely that it too is formed stereoselectively under kinetic control. The difference from 
the alkyl-substituted unstabilized ylids lies in the repulsion experienced between the polarized C&#x003D;O bond of
 the aldehyde and the electronegative stabilizing group shown here as an ester CO<sub>2</sub>R. As the four-membered
ring flattens out, the CO<sub>2</sub>R and Ph groups end up on opposite sides of the four-membered ring.<a id="page_693" class="page"><b>Page 693,Chapter27 Sulfur, Silicon, and Phosporus in Organic Chemistry</b></a></p>
