<p class="maxcddbanoindent1">In this chapter you will revisit the heterocyclic systems you have just met and find out how to make them. You&#x0027;ll also meet some new heterocyclic systems and find out how to make those. With so many heterocycles to consider, you&#x0027;d be forgiven for feeling rather daunted by this prospect, but do not be alarmed. Making heterocycles is easy&#x2014;that&#x0027;s precisely why there are so many of them. Just reflect&#x2026;</p>
<ul>
<li>Making C&#x2013;O, C&#x2013;N, and C&#x2013;S bonds is easy.</li>
<li>Intramolecular reactions are preferred to intermolecular reactions.</li>
<li>Forming five- and six-membered rings is easy.</li>
<li>We are talking about aromatic, that is, very stable molecules.</li>
</ul>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">If we are to use these bullet points to our advantage we must think strategy before we start. When we were making benzene compounds we usually started with a preformed simple benzene derivative&#x2014;toluene, phenol, aniline&#x2014;and added side chains by electrophilic substitution. In this chapter our strategy will usually be to build the heterocyclic ring with most of its substituents already in place and add just a few others, perhaps by electrophilic substitution, but mostly by nucleophilic substitution.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">We will usually make the rings by cyclization reactions with the heteroatom (O, N, S) as a nucleophile and a suitably functionalized carbon atom as the electrophile. This electrophile <a class="page" id="page_758">Page 758, Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis</a>will almost always be a carbonyl compound of some sort and this chapter will help you revise your carbonyl chemistry from Chapters 10, 11, 20, 25, and 26 as well as the approach to synthesis described in <a href="chapter_28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>.</p>

<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Some of the syntheses we will meet will be quite surprisingly simple! It sometimes seems that we can just mix a few things together with about the right number of atoms and let thermodynamics do the rest. A commercial synthesis of pyridines combines acetaldehyde and ammonia under pressure to give a simple pyridine.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The yield is only about 50%, but what does that matter in such a simple process? By counting atoms we can guess that four molecules of aldehyde and one of ammonia react, but exactly how is a triumph of thermodynamics over mechanism. Much more complex molecules can sometimes be made very easily too. Take allopurinol, for example, which you met in the last chapter. It is not too difficult to work out where the atoms go&#x2014;the hydrazine obviously gives rise to the pair of adjacent nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring and the ester group must be the origin of the carbonyl group (the colours and numbers illustrate this)&#x2014;but would you have planned this synthesis?</p>
<figure class="maxfig5">
<img src="../images/page_758-2.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">We will see that this sort of &#x2018;witch&#x2019;s brew&#x2019; approach to heterocyclic synthesis is restricted to a few basic ring systems and that, in general, careful planning is just as important here as elsewhere. The difference is that the synthesis of aromatic heterocycles is very forgiving&#x2014;it often &#x2018;goes right&#x2019; instead of going wrong. We&#x2019;ll now look seriously at planning the synthesis of aromatic heterocycles.</p>

<p class="maxcddh1"><span class="maxcddbold">Disconnect the carbon&#x2013;heteroatom bonds first</span></p>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">The simplest synthesis for a heterocycle emerges when we remove the heteroatom and see what electrophile we need. We shall use pyrroles as examples. The nitrogen forms an enamine on each side of the ring and we know that enamines are made from carbonyl compounds and amines.</p>

<figure class="maxfig5">
<img src="../images/page_758-4.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">What we need is an amine&#x2014; ammonia in this case&#x2014;and a diketone. If the two carbonyl groups have a 1,4 relationship we will get a pyrrole out of this reaction. So hexane-2,5-dione reacts with ammonia to give a high yield of 2,5-dimethyl pyrrole. Making furans is even easier because the heteroatom (oxygen) is already there. All we have to do is to dehydrate the 1,4-diketone instead of making enamines from it. Heating with acid is enough.</p>

This too is a useful reaction but we need to know how to control it. The usual rule is:</p>
<p class="maxcddblist1"><span class="maxcddbull1">&#x2022;</span> Base gives the cyclopentenone.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent1">For thiophenes we could in theory use H<sub>2</sub>S or some other sulfur nucleophile but, in practice, an electrophilic reagent is usually used to convert the two C=O bonds to C=S bonds. Thioketones are much less stable than ketones and cyclization is swift. Reagents such as P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> or Lawesson&#x2019;s reagent are the usual choice here.</p>

</div>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">It seems a logical extension to use a 1,5-diketone to make substituted pyridines but there is a slight problem here as we will introduce only two of the required three double bonds when the two enamines are formed. To get the pyridine by enamine formation we should need a double bond somewhere in the chain between the two carbonyl groups. But here another difficulty arises&#x2014;it will have to be a <span class="maxcdditalic">cis (Z</span>) double bond or cyclization would be impossible.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_759-5.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">On the whole it is easier to use the saturated 1,5-diketone and oxidize the product to the pyridine. As we are going from a non-aromatic to an aromatic compound, oxidation is easy and we can replace the question mark above with almost any simple oxidizing agent, as we shall soon see.</p>

<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Reacting a 1,4-diketone with hydrazine (NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) makes a double enamine again and this is only an oxidation step away from a pyridazine. This is also a good synthesis.<a class="page" id="page_760">Page 760, Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis</a></p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_760-1.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">If we use a 1,3-diketone instead we will get a five-membered heterocycle and the imine and enamine formed are enough to give aromaticity without any need for oxidation. The product is a pyrazole. The two heteroatoms do not, of course, need to be joined together for this strategy to work. If an amidine is combined with the same 1,3-diketone we get a six-membered heterocycle. As the nucleophile contains one double bond already, an aromatic pyrimidine is formed directly.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_760-2.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Since diketones and other dicarbonyl compounds are easily made by enolate chemistry (Chapters 25, 26, and 28) this strategy has been very popular and we will look at some detailed examples before moving on to more specialized reactions for the different classes of aromatic heterocycles.</p>

<p class="maxcddh1"><span class="maxcddbold">Pyrroles, thiophenes, and furans from 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds</span></p>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent1">We need to make the point that pyrrole synthesis can be done with primary amines as well as with ammonia and a good example is the pyrrole needed for clopirac, a drug we discussed in <a href="chapter_29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>. The synthesis is very easy.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_760-3.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">For an example of furan synthesis we choose menthofuran, which contributes to the flavour of mint. It has a second ring, but that is no problem if we simply disconnect the enol ethers as we have been doing so far.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_760-4.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The starting material is again a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound but as there was no substituent at C1 of the furan, that atom is an aldehyde rather than a ketone. This might lead to problems in the synthesis so a few changes (using the notation you met in <a href="chapter_28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>) are made to the intermediate before further disconnection.</p>

<figure class="maxcddfig2">

</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Cyclization with acid now causes a lot to happen. The 1,4-dicarbonyl compound cyclizes to a lactone, not to a furan, and the redundant ester group is lost by hydrolysis and decarboxyla-tion. Notice that the double bond moves into conjugation with the lactone carbonyl group. Finally, the reduction gives the furan. No special precautions are necessary&#x2014;as soon as the ester is partly reduced, it loses water to give the furan whose aromaticity prevents further reduction even with LiAlH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

</div>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Now we need to take these ideas further and discuss an important pyrrole synthesis that follows this strategy but includes a cunning twist. It all starts with the porphyrin found in blood. In <a href="chapter_29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> we gave the structure of porphyrin and showed that it contains four pyrrole rings joined in a macrocycle. We are going to look at one of those pyrroles.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Porphyrins can be made by joining together the various pyrroles in the right order and what is needed for this one (and also, in fact, for another&#x2014;the one in the north-east corner of the porphyrin) is a pyrrole with the correct substituents in positions 3 and 4, a methyl group in position 5, and a hydrogen atom at position 2. Position 2 must be free. Here is the molecule drawn somewhat more conveniently, together with the disconnection we have been using so far.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_761-3.jpg" alt="images"/> 
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">No doubt such a synthesis could be carried out but it is worth looking for alternatives for a number of reasons. We would prefer not to make a pyrrole with a free position at C2 as that would be very reactive and we know from <a href="chapter_29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> that we can reversibly block such a position with a <span class="maxcdditalic">t</span>-butyl ester group.

Could we escape from that by replacing one of them with an amine? We should then have an ester of an &#x00B1; amino acid, a much more attractive starting material, and this corresponds to disconnecting just one of the C&#x2013;N bonds.</p>

The product of the reaction is actually the dihydropyridine, which has to be oxidized to the pyridine by a reagent such as HNO<sub>3</sub>, Ce(IV), or a quinone.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The reaction is very simply carried out by mixing the components in the right proportions in ethanol. The presence of water does not spoil the reaction and the ammonia, or some added amine, ensures the slightly alkaline pH necessary. Any aldehyde can be used, even formaldehyde, and yields of the crystalline dihydropyridine are usually very good.</p>

We can see that certain events have to happen, but which order they happen in is a matter of conjecture. The ammonia has to attack the ketone groups, but it would prefer to attack the more electrophilic aldehyde so this is probably not the first step. The enol or enolate of the keto-ester has to attack the aldehyde (twice!) so let us start there.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">This adduct is in equilibrium with the stable enolate from the keto-ester and elimination now gives an unsaturated carbonyl compound. Such chemistry is associated with the aldol reactions we discussed in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>. The new enone has two carbonyl groups at one end of the double bond and is therefore a very good Michael acceptor (<a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). A second molecule of enolate does a conjugate addition to complete the carbon skeleton of the molecule. Now the ammonia attacks either of the ketones and cyclizes on to the other. As ketones are more electrophilic than esters it is to be expected that ammonia will prefer to react there.</p>

It is a remarkable reaction, amazing in its mechanism, and it was discovered in 1883 by one of the greatest organic chemists of all, Emil Fischer. Fischer had earlier discovered phenylhydrazine (PhNHNH<sub>2</sub>) and, in its simplest form, the Fischer indole synthesis occurs when phenylhydrazine is heated in acidic solution with an aldehyde or ketone.</p>

<p class="maxcddhboxparablue"><span class="maxcddbold">Emil Fischer</span> (1852&#x2014;1919), discovered phenylhydrazine as a PhD student in 1875, succeeded Hofmann at Berlin in 1900 where he built the then largest chemical institute in the world, and was awarded the Nobel prize in 1902. As well as his work on indoles, he laid the foundations of carbohydrate chemistry by completing the structure and synthesis of the main sugars. If only he hadn&#x2019;t also invented Fischer projections.</p>
</aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The first step in the mechanism is formation of the phenylhydrazone (the imine) of the ketone. This can be isolated as a stable compound (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_776-1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">The hydrazone then needs to tautomerize to the enamine, and now comes the key step in the reaction. The enamine can rearrange with formation of a strong C&#x2013;C bond and cleavage of the weak N&#x2013;N single bond by moving electrons round a six-membered ring.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">This is admittedly a complicated mechanism but if you remember the central step&#x2014;the rearrangement of the enamine&#x2014;the rest should fall into place. The key point is that the C&#x2013;C bond is established at the expense of a weak N&#x2013;N bond. Naturally, Fischer had no idea of any of the steps in the mechanism. He was sharp enough to see that something remarkable had happened and skilful enough to find out what it was.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The Fischer method is the main way of making indoles, but it is not suitable for them all. We need now to consider its applicability to various substitution patterns.

The enamine will normally prefer to adopt the first configuration shown in which cyclization is not possible, and (perhaps for this reason or perhaps because it is difficult to predict which quinoline will be formed from an unsymmetrical 1,3-dicarbonyl compound) this has not proved a very important quinoline synthesis. However, the synthetic plan is sound, and we shall describe two important variants on this theme, one for quinolines and one for quinolones.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">

</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">In the synthesis of pyridines it proved advantageous to make a dihydropyridine and oxidize it to a pyridine afterwards. The same idea works well in probably the most famous quinoline synthesis, the Skraup reaction. The diketone is replaced by an unsaturated carbonyl compound so that the quinoline is formed regiospecifically. The first step is conjugate addition of the amine. Under acid catalysis the ketone now cyclizes in the way we have just described to give a dihydroquinoline after dehydration. Oxidation to the aromatic quinoline is an easy step accomplished by many possible oxidants.<a class="page" id="page_782">Page 782, Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis</a></p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_782-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Traditionally, the Skraup reaction was carried out by mixing everything together and letting it rip. A typical mixture to make a quinoline without substituents on the pyridine ring would be the aromatic amine, concentrated sulfuric acid, glycerol, and nitrobenzene all heated up in a large flask at over 100 &#x00B0;C with a wide condenser.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">

</figure>
<aside class="maxcddabcblue" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxcddhboxparablue">The ugly name of the Skraup reaction appropriately applies to the worst &#x2018;witch&#x2019;s brew&#x2019; of all the heterocyclic syntheses. Some workers have added strange oxidizing agents such as arsenic acid, iron (III) salts, tin (IV) salts, nitrobenzenes of various substitution patterns, or iodine to make it &#x2018;go better&#x2019;.</p>
</aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The glycerol was to provide acrolein (CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&#x00B1;CHO) by dehydration, the nitrobenzene was to act as oxidant, and the wide condenser&#x2026;? All too often Skraup reactions did let rip&#x2014;with destructive results. A safer approach is to prepare the conjugate adduct first, cyclize it in acid solution, and then oxidize it with one of the reagents we described for pyridine synthesis, particularly quinones such as DDQ.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_782-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The more modern style of Skraup synthesis is used to make 8-quinolinol or &#x2018;oxine&#x2019;. <span class="maxcdditalic">ortho-</span>Aminophenol has only one free position <span class="maxcdditalic">ortho</span> to the amino group and is very nucleophilic, so acrolein can be used in weak acid with only a trace of strong acid. Iron(III) is the oxidant, with a bit of boric acid for luck, and the yield is excellent.</p>

<p class="maxcddh2"><span class="maxcddbold">Quinolones also come from anilines by cyclization to an <span class="maxcdditalic">ortho</span> position</span></p>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">The usual method for making quinolone antibiotics is possible because they all have a carboxylic acid in the 3-position. The disconnection we used for quinoline suggests a rather unstable malonic ester derivative as starting material.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_782-6.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">In fact, the enol ether of this compound is easily made from diethyl malonate and ethyl orthoformate [HC(OEt)<sub>3</sub>]. The aromatic amine reacts with this compound by an addition&#x2013;elimination sequence, giving an enamine that cyclizes on heating. This time the geometry of the enamine is not a concern.<a class="page" id="page_783">Page 783, Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis</a></p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_783-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">For examples of quinolone antibiotics we can choose ofloxacin, whose synthesis was discussed in detail in <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>, and rosoxacin, whose synthesis is discussed below. Both molecules contain the same quinolone carboxylic acid framework, outlined in black, with another heterocyclic system at position 7 and various other substituents here and there.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_783-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">To make rosoxacin two heterocyclic systems must be constructed. Workers at the pharmaceutical company Sterling decided to build the pyridine in an ingenious version of the Hantzsch synthesis using acetylenic esters on 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. The ammonia was added as ammonium acetate. Oxidation with nitric acid made the pyridine, hydrolysis of the esters and decarboxylation removed the acid groups, and reduction with Fe(II) and HCl converted the nitro group into the amino group required for the quinolone synthesis.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_783-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Now the quinolone synthesis can be executed with the same reagents we used before and all that remains is ester hydrolysis and alkylation at nitrogen. Notice that the quinolone cyclization could in theory have occurred in two ways as the two positions <span class="maxcdditalic">ortho</span> to the amino group are different. In practice cyclization occurs away from the pyridine ring as the alternative quinolone would be impossibly crowded.</p>
<figure class="maxcddfig2">
<img src="../images/page_783-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Since quinolones, like pyridones, can be converted into chloro-compounds with POCl<sub>3</sub>, they can be used in nucleophilic substitution reactions to build up more complex quinolines.<a class="page" id="page_784">Page 784, Aromatic heterocycles 2: synthesis</a></p>

The synthesis of this system uses the chemistry discussed in <a href="chapter_29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> to build the pyridazine ring.

<p class="maxcddbaindent">A 2-bromo-acid derivative is the vital reagent. It reacts at the amino nitrogen atom with the carbonyl group and at the pyridazine ring nitrogen atom with the alkyl halide. This is the only way the molecule can organize itself into a ten-electron aromatic system.</p>

Its synthesis relies on ring formation by rather a curious method followed by selective nucleophilic substitution, rather in the style of the last synthesis.
