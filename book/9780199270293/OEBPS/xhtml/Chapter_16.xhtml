<h2 class="h2">Bond rotation allows chains of atoms to adopt a number of conformations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several chapters of this book have considered how to find out the structure of molecules. We have seen X-ray crystallography pictures, which reveal exactly where the atoms are in crystals; we have looked at IR spectroscopy, which gives us information about the bonds in the molecule, and at NMR spectroscopy, which gives us information about the atoms themselves and how they are joined up. Up to now, we have mainly been interested in determining which atoms are bonded to which other atoms and also the shapes of small localized groups of atoms. For example, a methyl group has three hydrogen atoms bonded to one carbon atom and the atoms around this carbon are located at the corners of a tetrahedron; a ketone consists of a carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms and doubly bonded to an oxygen atom, with all these atoms in the same plane.</p>
<p class="indent">But, on a slightly larger scale, shape is not usually so well defined. Rotation is possible about single bonds and this rotation means that, while the localized arrangement of atoms stays the same (every saturated carbon atom is still always tetrahedral), the molecule as a whole can adopt a number of different shapes. Shown on the next page are several snapshot views of one molecule&#x2014;it happens to be a pheromone used by pea moths to attract a mate. Although the structures look dissimilar, they differ from one another only by rotation about one or more single bonds. Whilst the overall shapes differ, the localized structure is still the</p>

<p class="indent">At room temperature in solution, all the single bonds in the molecule are constantly rotating&#x2014;the chances that two molecules will have exactly the same shape at any one time are quite small.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, even though no two molecules have exactly the same shape at any one time, they are still all the same chemical compound&#x2014;they have all the same atoms attached in the same way. We call the different shapes of molecules of the same compound different conformations.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Conformation and configuration</h2>
<p class="noindent">To get from one conformation to another, we can rotate about as many single bonds as we like. The one thing we can&#x0027;t do though is to break any bonds. This is why we can&#x0027;t rotate about a double bond&#x2014;to do so we would need to break the &#x03C0; bond. Below are some pairs of structures that can be interconverted by rotating about single bonds: they are all different conformations of the same molecule.</p>

<p class="noindent2">If you fi nd this hard to see, get a set of molecular models and build the fi rst one of each pair. You should be able to rotate it straightforwardly into the second without breaking your model. Our advice throughout this chapter, certainly with things that you fi nd diffi cult to understand from the two-dimensional drawings to which we are limited, is to make models.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Barriers to rotation</h2>
<p class="noindent">We saw in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> that rotation about the C-N bond in an amide is relatively slow at room temperature&#x2014;the NMR spectrum of DMF clearly shows two methyl signals (p. <a href="chapter_7.xhtml#page_156">156</a>). In <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> you learned that the rate of a chemical process is associated with an energy barrier (this holds both for reactions and simple bond rotations): the lower the rate, the higher the barrier. Rotation about single bonds is fast at room temperature, but there is nonetheless a barrier to rotation in ethane (A), for example, of about 12 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The energy barrier for rotation about the single bond in butadiene (B) is slightly larger because of the weak conjugation between the double bonds, but the barrier to rotation about the genuine double bond in but-2-ene (D) is enormous and no rotation is seen. The energy barrier to the rotation about the C-N bond in an amide such as DMF (C) is usually about 80 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, translating into a rate of about 0.1 s<sup>-1</sup> at 20 &#x00B0;C. The conjugation in amides is well developed, and the C-N bond has significant double-bond character.<a id="page_363" class="page">Page 363, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a></p>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">Rates and barriers</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">It can be useful to remember some simple guidelines to the way in which energy barriers relate to rates of rotation, as discussed in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>. For example:</p>
<p class="cbh3a2"><span class="c_blue1">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A barrier of 73 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> allows one rotation every second at 25 &#x00B0;C (that is, the rate is 1 s<sup>-1</sup>).</p>
<p class="cbh3a2"><span class="c_blue1">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Every 6 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> changes the rate at 25 &#x00B0;C by about a factor of 10.</p>
<p class="bnoindent">To see signals in an NMR spectrum for two different conformations, they must interconvert no faster than (very roughly) 1000 s<sup>-1</sup>&#x2014;a barrier of about 55 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> at 25 &#x00B0;C. This is why NMR shows two methyl signals for DMF, but only one set of signals for butadiene. See p. <a href="chapter_16.xhtml#page_374">374</a> for more on this.</p>
<p class="bnoindent">For conformations to interconvert slowly enough for them to exist as different compounds, the barrier must be over 100 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. The barrier to rotation about a C&#x003D;C double bond is 260 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>&#x2014;which is why we can separate <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> isomers.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_16.4">
<h2 class="h2">Conformations of ethane</h2>
<p class="noindent">Why should there be an energy barrier in the rotation about a single bond? In order to answer this question, we should start with the simplest C-C bond possible&#x2014;the one in ethane. Ethane has two extreme conformations called the staggered and eclipsed conformations. Three different views of these are shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_363_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can see why the conformations have these names by looking at the end-on views in the diagram. In the eclipsed case the near C-H bonds completely block the view of the far bonds, just as in a solar eclipse the Moon blocks the Sun as seen from the Earth. In the staggered conformation, the far C-H bonds appear in the gaps between the near C-H bonds&#x2014;the bonds are staggered.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_363_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Chemists often want to draw these two conformations quickly and two different methods are commonly used, each with its own merits. In the first method, shown on the right, we simply draw the side view of the molecule and use wedged and hashed lines to show bonds not in the plane of the paper (as you saw in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>). Particular attention must be paid to which of the bonds are in the plane and which go into and out of the plane.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second method we draw the end-on view, looking along the C-C bond. This view is known as a Newman projection, and Newman projections are subject to a few conventions:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The carbon atom nearer the viewer is at the junction of the front three bonds.</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The carbon further away (which can&#x0027;t in fact be seen in the end-on view) is represented by a large circle. This makes the perspective inaccurate, but this doesn&#x0027;t matter.<a id="page_364" class="page">Page 364, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a></p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Bonds attached to this further carbon join the <i>edge</i> of the circle and do not meet in the centre.</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Eclipsed bonds are drawn slightly displaced for clarity&#x2014;as though the bond were rotated by a tiny fraction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_364_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane are not identical in energy: the staggered conformation is lower in energy than the eclipsed by 12 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, the value of the rotational barrier. Of course, there are other possible conformations too with energies in between these extremes, and we can plot a graph to show the change in energy of the system as the C-C bond rotates. We define the dihedral angle, &#x03B8; (sometimes called the torsion angle), to be the angle between a C-H bond at the nearer carbon and a C-H bond at the far carbon. In the staggered conformation, &#x03B8; &#x003D; 60&#x00B0; whilst in the eclipsed conformation, &#x03B8; &#x003D; 0&#x00B0;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Picturing dihedral angles is sometimes hard&#x2014;one way to do it is to imagine the two C&#x2013;H bonds drawn on two facing pages of a book. The dihedral angle is then the angle between the pages, measured perpendicular to the spine. See <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The energy level diagram shows the staggered conformation as a potential energy mini-mum whilst the eclipsed conformation represents an energy maximum. This means that the eclipsed conformation is not a stable conformation since any slight rotation will lead to a conformation lower in energy. The molecule will actually spend the vast majority of its time in a staggered or nearly staggered conformation and only briefly pass through the eclipsed conformation <i>en route</i> to another staggered conformation.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">But <i>why</i> is the eclipsed conformation higher in energy than the staggered conformation? There are two reasons. The first is that the electrons in the bonds repel each other and this repulsion is at a maximum when the bonds are aligned in the eclipsed conformation. The second is that there may be some stabilizing interaction between the C-H &#x03C3; bonding orbital on one carbon and the C-H &#x03C3;* antibonding orbital on the other carbon, which is greatest when the two orbitals are exactly parallel: this only happens in the staggered conformation. The same effects&#x2014;repulsion between filled orbitals (a form of steric effect, see p. <a href="chapter_6.xhtml#page_129">129</a>) and stabilization by donation into antibonding orbitals&#x2014;govern the favoured conformations about all rotating bonds.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Conformations of propane</h2>
<p class="noindent">Propane is the next simplest hydrocarbon. Before we consider what conformations are possible for propane we should first look at its geometry. The C-C-C bond angle is not 109.5&#x00B0; (the tetrahedral angle, see Chapters 2 and 4) as we might expect, but 112.4&#x00B0;. Consequently, the H-C-H bond angle on the central carbon is smaller than the ideal angle of 109.5&#x00B0;, only 106.1&#x00B0;. This does not necessarily mean that the two methyl groups on the central carbon clash in some way, but instead that two C-C bonds repel each other more than two C-H bonds do.</p>

<p class="indent">The rotational barrier is now slightly higher than for ethane: 14 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> as compared to 12 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. This again reflects the greater repulsion of electrons in the coplanar bonds in the eclipsed conformation rather than any steric interactions. The energy graph for bond rotation in propane would look exactly the same as that for ethane except that the barrier is now 14 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Conformations of butane</h2>
<p class="noindent">With butane things start to get slightly more complicated. Now we have effectively replaced two hydrogen atoms in ethane by larger methyl groups. These are large enough to get in the way of each other, and steric repulsion becomes a significant contribution to the rotational energy barriers. However, the main complication is that, as we rotate about the central C-C bond, not all the staggered conformations are the same, and neither are all the eclipsed conformations. The six conformations that butane can adopt as the central C-C bond is rotated in 60&#x00B0; intervals are shown below. The green Me group and the brown hydrogens are rotating while the substituents on the other carbon atom remain still.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_365_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Look closely at these different conformations. The conformations with dihedral angles 60&#x00B0; and 300&#x00B0; are actually mirror images of each other, as are the conformations with angles 120&#x00B0; and 240&#x00B0;. This means that we really only have four different maxima or minima in energy as we rotate about the central C-C bond: two types of eclipsed conformation, which will represent maxima in the energy-rotation graph, and two types of staggered conformation, which will represent minima. These four different conformations have names, shown in the bottom row of the diagram. In the syn-periplanar and anti-periplanar conformations the two C&#x2013;Me bonds lie in the same plane; in the synclinal (or gauche) and anticlinal conformations they slope towards <i>(syn)</i> or away from <i>(anti)</i> one another.<a id="page_366" class="page">Page 366, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a></p>
<p class="indent">Before we draw the energy-rotation graph, let&#x0027;s just stop and think what it might look like. Each of the eclipsed conformations will be energy maxima but the syn-periplanar conformation (&#x03B8; &#x003D; 0&#x00B0;) will be higher in energy than the two anticlinal conformations (&#x03B8; &#x003D; 120&#x00B0; and 240&#x00B0;): in the syn-periplanar conformation two methyl groups are eclipsing each other whereas in the anticlinal conformations each methyl group is eclipsing only a hydrogen atom. The staggered conformations will be energy minima but the two methyl groups are furthest from each other in the anti-periplanar conformation so this will be a slightly lower minimum than the two synclinal (gauche) conformations.</p>

The staggered conformations are stable since they each lie in a potential energy well. The anti-periplanar conformation, with the two methyl groups opposite each other, is the most stable of all. We can therefore think of a butane molecule as rapidly interconverting between synclinal and anti-periplanar conformations, passing quickly through the eclipsed conformations on the way. The eclipsed conformations are energy maxima, and therefore represent the transition states for interconversion between conformations.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> The rotation is very rapid indeed: the barrier of 20 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to a rate at room temperature of 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

<p class="indent">These data are best presented as a graph, and the ring strain per carbon atom in planar rings for ring sizes up to 17 are shown on the next page. Whether the bonds are strained inwards or outwards is not important so only the magnitude of the strain is shown.</p>
<p class="indent">From these figures (represented in the graph on p. <a href="chapter_16.xhtml#page_368">368</a>), note:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;These are calculated data for hypothetical planar rings. As you will see, real rings are rather different.</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The calculated ring strain is largest for three-membered rings but rapidly decreases through a four-membered ring and reaches a minimum for a five-membered ring.</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The calculated ring strain increases again (although less rapidly) as the rings get larger after the minimum at 5.</p>
<p class="indent1">But what we really need is a measure of the strain in actual compounds, not just a theoretical prediction in planar rings, so that we can compare this with the theoretical angle strain. A good measure of the strain in real rings is obtained using heats of combustion. Look at the following heats of combustion for some straight-chain alkanes. What is striking is that the difference between any two in the series is very nearly constant at around -660 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent">If we assume (as is reasonable) that there is no strain in the straight-chain alkanes, then each extra methylene group, -CH<sub>2</sub>-, contributes on average an extra 658.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> to the heat of combustion for the alkane. A cycloalkane (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> is simply a number of methylene groups joined together. If the cycloalkane is strain-free, then its heat of combustion should be <i>n</i> x 658.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. If, however, there is some strain in the ring that makes the ring less stable (that is, raises its energy) then more energy is given out on combustion. Now, let&#x0027;s put all this together in a graph showing, for each ring size: (a) angle strain per CH<sub>2</sub> group and (b) heat of combustion per CH<sub>2</sub> group.</p>

<p class="indent">You might ask yourself some questions now:</p>
<p class="indent">Why are six-membered rings and large rings virtually strain-free?</p>
<p class="indent">Why is there still some strain in five-membered rings even though the bond angles in a planar structure are almost 109.5&#x00B0;?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The answer to both these questions, as you may already have guessed, is that the assumption that the rings are planar is simply not correct. It is easy to see how large rings can fold up into many different conformations as easily as acyclic compounds do. It is less clear to predict what happens in six-membered rings.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Six-membered rings</h3>
<p class="noindent">If you were to join six tetrahedral carbon atoms together, you would probably find that you ended up with a shape like this.</p>

<p class="indent">All the carbon atoms are certainly not in the same plane, and there is no strain because all the bond angles are 109.5&#x00B0;. If you squash the model against the desk, forcing the atoms to lie in the same plane, it springs back into this shape as soon as you let go. If you view the model from one side (the second picture above) you will notice that four carbon atoms lie in the same plane, with the fifth above the plane and the sixth below it (although it&#x0027;s important to realize that all six are identical&#x2014;you can check this by rotating your model). The slightly overly imaginative name for this conformation&#x2014;the chair conformation&#x2014;derives from this view.<a id="page_369" class="page">Page 369, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a></p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_369_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">This conformation is known as the boat conformation. In this conformation there are still four carbon atoms in one plane, but the other two are both above this plane. Now all the carbon atoms are not the same&#x2014;the four in the plane are different from the ones above. However, this is not a stable conformation of cyclohexane, even though there is no bond angle strain (all the angles are 109.5&#x00B0;). In order to understand why not, we must go back a few steps and answer our other question: why is cyclopentane strained even though a planar conformation has virtually no angle strain?</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_16.7.2">
<h3 class="h3">Smaller rings (three, four, and five members)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The three carbon atoms in cyclopropane must lie in a plane since it is always possible to draw a plane through any three points. All the C-C bond lengths are the same, which means that the three carbon atoms are at the corners of an equilateral triangle. From the large heat of combustion per methylene group (p. <a href="chapter_16.xhtml#page_368">368</a>) we know that there is considerable strain in this molecule. Most of this is due to the bond angles deviating so greatly from the ideal tetrahedral value of 109.5&#x00B0;. Most&#x2014;but not all. If we view along one of the C-C bonds we can see a further cause of strain&#x2014;all the C-H bonds are eclipsed.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_369_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The eclipsed conformation of ethane is an energy maximum and any rotation leads to a more stable conformation. In cyclopropane it is not possible to rotate any of the C-C bonds and so all the C-H bonds are forced to eclipse their neighbours. In fact, in any planar conformation all the C-H bonds will be eclipsed with their neighbours. In cyclobutane, the ring distorts from a planar conformation in order to reduce the eclipsing interactions, even though this reduces the bond angles further and so increases the bond angle strain. Cyclobutane adopts a puckered or &#x2018;wing-shaped&#x2019; conformation.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_369_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_370" class="page">Page 370, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This explains why cyclopentane is not entirely strain-free even though in a planar conformation the C-C-C bond angles are close to 109.5&#x00B0;. The heat of combustion data give us an indication of the total strain in the molecule, not just the contribution of angle strain. There is strain in planar cyclopentane caused by the eclipsing of adjacent C-H bonds. As in cyclobutane, the ring distorts to reduce the eclipsing interactions but this increases the angle strain. Whatever happens, there is always going to be some strain in the system. The minimum energy conformation adopted is a balance of the two opposing effects. Cyclopentane adopts a shape approximating to an &#x2018;open envelope&#x0027;, with four C atoms in a plane and one above or below it. The atoms in the ring rapidly take turns not to be in the plane, and cyclo- pentanes have much less well-defined conformational properties than cyclohexanes, to which we shall now return.</p>

<h2 class="h2">A closer look at cyclohexane</h2>
<p class="noindent">The heats of combustion data on p. <a href="chapter_16.xhtml#page_368">368</a> show that cyclohexane is virtually strain-free. This must mean that not only is there no angle strain, but there is also no strain from eclipsing interactions either. A model of the chair conformation of cyclohexane including all the hydrogen atoms looks like this.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">

</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_370_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The view along two of the C-C bonds clearly shows that there are no eclipsing C-H bonds in the chair conformation of cyclohexane&#x2014;in fact, all the bonds are fully staggered, giving the lowest energy possible. This is why cyclohexane is strain-free. Contrast this with the boat conformation. Now four pairs of C-H bonds are eclipsed, and there is a particularly bad interaction between the &#x2018;flagstaff&#x2019; C-H bonds.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_370_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This explains why the boat conformation is much less important than the chair conformation. Even though both are free from angle strain, the eclipsing interactions in the boat conformation make it approximately 25 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the chair conformation. In fact, as we shall see later, the boat conformation represents an energy maximum in cyclohex- ane whilst the chair conformation is an energy minimum. Earlier we saw how the eclipsing interactions in planar cyclobutane and cyclopentane could be reduced by distortion of the ring. The same is true for the boat conformation of cyclohexane. The eclipsing interactions can be relieved slightly if the two &#x2018;side&#x2019; C-C bonds twist relative to each other.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This twisting gives rise to a slightly different conformation of cyclohexane called the twist- boat conformation, which, although not as low in energy as the chair form, is lower in energy (by 4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) than the boat form and is a local energy minimum, as we shall see later. Cyclohexane has two stable conformers, the chair and the twist-boat. The chair form is approximately 21 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> lower in energy than the twist-boat form.</p>

As you go round the ring, notice that each of the CH<sub>2</sub> groups has one hydrogen sticking up and one sticking down.

<p class="noindent">Given that this chair conformer is the preferred conformation for cyclohexane, what would you expect its <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum to look like? All six carbon atoms are the same so there should only be one signal (and indeed there is, at 25.2 ppm). But what about the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum? The two different sorts of protons (axial and equatorial) ought to resonate at different frequencies, so two signals should be seen (each with coupling to neighbouring protons). In fact, there is only <i>one</i> resonance in the proton spectrum, at 1.40 ppm. In a monosubstituted cyclohexane there should be two isomers detectable&#x2014;one with the substituent axial, the other with the substituent equatorial. But again at room temperature only one set of signals is seen.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_373_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This changes when the NMR spectrum is run at low temperature. Now two isomers are visi ble, and this gives us a clue as to what is happening: the two isomers are conformers that inter convert&#x2014;rapidly at room temperature, but more slowly when the temperature is lowered Recall that NMR does not distinguish between the three different stable conformers of butane (two synclinal and one anti-periplanar) because they are all rapidly interconverting so fast tha only an average is seen. The same happens with cyclohexane&#x2014;just by rotating bonds (that is without breaking any&#x0021;) cyclohexane can ring invert or &#x2018;flip&#x0027;. After ring inversion has taker place, all the bonds that were axial are now equatorial and vice versa.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">It&#x0027;s clear from the diagram that the barrier to ring inversion of cyclohexane is 43 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, a rate at 25&#x00B0;C of about 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Ring inversion also interconverts the axial and equatorial protons, so these are also exchanging at a rate of 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 25 &#x00B0;C&#x2014;too fast for them to be detected individually by NMR, which is why they appear as an averaged signal.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">Rates and spectroscopy</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">NMR spectrometers behave like cameras with a shutter speed of about 1/1000 s. Anything happening faster than that, and we get a blurred picture; things happening more slowly give a sharp picture. In fact, a more exact number for the &#x2018;shutter speed&#x2019; of an NMR machine (not a real shutter speed&#x2014;just figuratively speaking&#x0021;) is given by the equation</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_374_6.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bnoindent">where <i>k</i> is the fastest exchange rate that still gives individual signals and &#x0394;&#x03BD; is the separation of those signals in the NMR spectrum measured in hertz. For example, on a 400 MHz spectrometer, two signals separated by 0.5 ppm are 100 Hz apart, so any process exchanging with a rate slower than 222 s<sup>-1</sup> will still allow the NMR machine to show two separate signals; if they exchange with a rate faster than 222 s<sup>-1</sup> only an averaged signal will be seen.</p>
<p class="bindent">The equation above holds for any spectroscopic method, provided we think in terms of differences between signals or peaks measured in hertz. So, for example, a difference between two IR absorptions of 100 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be represented as a wavelength of 0.01 cm (1 x 10<sup>-4</sup> m) or a frequency of 3 x 10<sup>12</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. IR can detect changes happening a lot faster than NMR can&#x2014;its &#x2018;shutter speed&#x2019; is of the order of one-trillionth of a second.</p>

<p class="noindent">In a monosubstituted cyclohexane, there can exist two different chair conformers: one with the substituent axial, the other with it equatorial. The two chair conformers will be in rapid equilibrium (by the process we have just described) but they will not have the same energy. In almost all cases, <i>the conformer with the substituent axial is higher in energy,</i> which means there will be less of this form present at equilibrium.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, in methylcyclohexane (X&#x003D;CH<sub>3</sub>), the conformer with the methyl group axial is 7.3 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the conformer with the methyl group equatorial.

<p class="indent">There are two reasons why the axial conformer is higher in energy than the equatorial conformer. The first is that the axial conformer is destabilized by the repulsion between the axial group X and the two axial hydrogen atoms on the same side of the ring. This interaction is known as the 1,3-diaxial interaction. As the group X gets larger, this interaction becomes more severe and there is less of the conformer with the group axial. The second reason is that<a id="page_375" class="page">Page 375, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a> in the equatorial conformer the C-X bond is anti-periplanar to two C-C bonds, while, for the axial conformer, the C-X bond is synclinal (gauche) to two C-C bonds.</p>

<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The amount of equatorial conformer present does increase in the order Me &#x003C; Et &#x003C; i-Pr &#x003C; t-Bu, but perhaps not quite as expected. The ethyl group <i>must</i> be physically larger than a methyl group but there is hardly any difference in the equilibrium constants. The increase in the proportion of equatorial conformer on going from Et to <i>i</i>-Pr is only a factor of two, but for <i>t</i>-butylcyclohexane it is estimated that there is about 3000 times more of the equatorial conformer than the axial conformer.</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The same anomaly occurs with the methoxy group&#x2014;there is a much greater proportion of the conformer with a methoxy group axial than with a methyl group axial.

<p class="blist1"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The equilibrium constant does not depend on the actual size of the substituent, but rather its interaction with the neighbouring axial hydrogens.

<h3 class="h3">What happens with more than one substituent on the ring?</h3>
<p class="noindent">When there are two or more substituents on the ring, stereoisomerism is possible. For example, there are two isomers of 1,4-cyclohexanediol&#x2014;in one (the <i>cis</i> isomer) both the substituents are either above or below the cyclohexane ring; in the other (the <i>trans</i> isomer) one hydroxyl group is above the ring whilst the second is below. For a <i>cis</i> 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane with both the substituents the same, ring inversion leads to a second identical conformation, while for the <i>trans</i> configuration there is one conformation with both groups axial and one with both groups equatorial.</p>

If an equatorial substituent starts off above the ring (that is, &#x2018;up&#x2019; relative to its partner on the same C atom) it will end up above the ring, but now axial. Axial and equatorial are <i>conformational</i> terms; which side of the ring a substituent is on depends on the compound&#x2019;s <i>configuration</i>.</p>

The former show both configuration and conformation&#x2014; they show which stereoisomer <i>(cis</i> or <i>trans)</i> we are talking about and also (for the <i>trans</i> com-pound) the conformation adopted (diaxial or the more stable diequatorial). In contrast, the simpler hexagon diagrams carry no information about the conformation&#x2014;only information about which isomer we are dealing with. This can be useful because it enables us to talk about one configuration of a compound without specifying the conformation. When you are solving a problem requiring conformational diagrams to predict the configuration of a product, always start and finish with a configurational (hexagon) drawing.</p>

In general, the favoured conformation will place the maximum number of substituents equatorial. If both conformations have the same number of equatorial substituents, the one with the larger substituent equatorial will win out, and the smaller group will be forced to be axial.

<p class="indent">In the last chapter we looked at two mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution: S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2. We saw that the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction involved an inversion at the carbon centre. Recall that the incoming nucleophile had to attack the &#x03C3;* orbital of the C-X bond. This meant that it had to approach the leaving group directly from behind, leading to inversion of configuration.<a id="page_380" class="page">Page 380, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a></p>

<p class="indent">What do you think would happen if a cyclohexane derivative underwent an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction? If the conformation of the molecule is fixed by a locking group, the inversion mechanism of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction means that, if the leaving group is axial, then the incoming nucleophile will end up equatorial and vice versa.</p>

<p class="indent">Substitution reactions are not very common for substituted cyclohexanes. The electrophilic carbon in a cyclohexane ring is a secondary centre&#x2014;in the last chapter we saw that secondary centres do not react well via either S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_347">347</a>). To encourage an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, we need a good attacking nucleophile and a good leaving group. One such example is shown&#x2014;the substitution of tosylate by PhS<sup>-</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent">The substitution of an axial substituent proceeds faster than the substitution of an equatorial substituent. There are several contributing factors making up this rate difference, but the most important is the direction of approach of the nucleophile. The nucleophile must attack the &#x03C3;* of the leaving group, that is, directly behind the C-X bond. In the case of an equatorially substituted compound, this line of attack is hindered by the (green) axial hydrogens&#x2014;it passes directly through the region of space they occupy. For an axial leaving group, the direction of attack is parallel with the (orange) axial hydrogens anti-periplanar to the leaving group, and approach is much less hindered.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_381" class="page">Page 381, Chapter 16: Conformational analysis</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We must assume that this holds even for simple unsubstituted cyclohexanes, and that substitution reactions of cyclohexyl bromide, for example, occur mainly on the minor, axial conformer. This slows down the reaction because before it can react, the prevalent equatorial conformer must first flip to the axial.</p>
<p class="indent">If this flip to an axial leaving group is not possible, it may be that the reaction just won&#x0027;t happen at all. This is exactly what happens in a <i>trans</i>-decalin. There are two diastereoisomers of this simple substituted trans-decalin: one with an equatorial and one with an axial leaving group (X could be Br, OTs, etc.).</p>

<p class="indent">Attack by a nucleophile on the compound with the axial leaving group is straightforward. The nucleophile can approach along the axis of the C-X bond and normal S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction occurs with inversion&#x2014;the product is the equatorial compound. The equatorial leaving group, on the other hand, would require the nucleophile to approach through the middle of the molecule and that cannot be achieved. A totally different reaction occurs&#x2014;a rearrangement that you will meet in <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">To conclude...</h2>
<p class="noindent">You may wonder why we have spent most of this chapter looking at six-membered rings, ignoring other ring sizes almost totally. Apart from the fact that six is the most widespread ring size in organic chemistry, the reactions of six-membered rings are also the easiest to explain and to understand. The conformational principles we have outlined for six- membered rings (relief of ring strain, staggered favoured over eclipsed, equatorial favoured over axial, direction of attack) hold, in modified form, for other ring sizes as well. These other rings are less well behaved than six-membered rings because they lack the well-defined strain- free conformations that cyclohexane is blessed with. We shall now leave stereochemistry in rings for some time, but we come back to these more difficult rings&#x2014;and how to tame them&#x2014; in two chapters on stereochemistry in cyclic compounds, Chapters 31 and 32.</p>
