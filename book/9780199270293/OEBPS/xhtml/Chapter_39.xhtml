<h3 class="maxh3">There are mechanisms and there are mechanisms</h3>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">There are two types of answer to the question &#8216;What is the mechanism of this reaction?&#8217;. If you were asked to draw the mechanism of an ester hydrolysis in basic solution you should have no trouble in giving a good answer of the first type. It wouldn&#8217;t matter if you had never seen this particular ester before or even if you knew that it had never actually been made, because you would recognize that the reaction belonged to a class of well-known reactions (carbonyl substitution reactions, <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) and you would assume that the mechanism was the same as that for other ester hydrolyses. And you would be right&#8212;nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group to form a tetrahedral intermediate is followed by loss of the alkoxide leaving group and formation of the anion of the carboxylic acid.</p>
<figure class="maxcdfig8" style="width:80%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1029.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Yet someone at some time had to determine this mechanism in full detail. That work was done in the 1940s to 1960s and it was done so well that nobody seriously challenges it.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You might also recall from <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> that, if we change the carbonyl compound to an acid chloride, the mechanism may change to an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction with an acylium ion intermediate because the leaving group is now much better: Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is more stable (less basic) than RO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. It would not be worth using hydroxide for this reaction: as the first step is the slow step, water will do just as well. Again someone had to determine this mechanism, had to show which was the slow step, and had to show that leaving group ability depended on the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of its conjugate base.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If the reaction were the hydrolysis of an amide, you might remember from <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> that third-order kinetics are often observed for the expulsion of such bad leaving groups and that this extra catalysis makes it worthwhile using concentrated base. Again, someone had to find out that: (1) the slow step is now the decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, (2) there are third-order kinetics involving two molecules of hydroxide, and (3) the first molecule acts as a nucleophile and the second as a base.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">These three mechanisms are all versions of the same reaction. For you, writing these mechanisms chiefly means recognizing the type of reaction (nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group) and evaluating how good the leaving group is. For the original chemists, determining these reaction mechanisms meant: (1) determining exactly what the product is (that may sound silly, but it is a serious point), (2) discovering how many steps there are and the structures of the intermediates, (3) finding out which is the slow (rate-determining) step, and (4) finding any catalysis. This chapter describes the methods used in this kind of work&#8212;the detailed, second type of answer to &#8216;What is the mechanism of this reaction?&#8217;.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Now, suppose you were asked what the mechanisms of the next two reactions might be. This is a rather different sort of problem as you may well not recognize any of these reagents and you probably cannot fit any of the reactions into one of the classes you have seen so far. You may not even see at once which of the three main classes of mechanism you should use: ionic, pericyclic, or radical.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You may do your best to write a mechanism based on your understanding of organic chemistry, moving the electrons from nucleophiles to electrophiles, choosing sensible intermediates, and arriving at the right products. You would not claim any authority for the result, but you would hope, as an organic chemist, to propose one or more reasonable possibilities.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This process of proposing reasonable mechanisms is actually an essential preliminary to answering the question in the second way&#8212;finding the real, experimentally verified, mechanism for the reaction. We will now look at some of the techniques used to find such answers with an old curiosity of a reaction, the Cannizzaro reaction, as an example.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Determining reaction mechanisms: the Cannizzaro reaction</h3>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">So how do we know the mechanism of a reaction? The simple answer is that we don&#8217;t for certain. Organic chemists have to face situations where the structure of a compound is initially thought to be one thing but later corrected to be something different. The same is true of mechanisms. It is the nature of science that all we can do is try to account for observations by proposing a hypothesis. We then test the hypothesis by experiment and, when the experiment does not fit the hypothesis, we must start again with a new hypothesis. This is exactly the case with mechanisms. When a new reaction is discovered, one or more mechanisms are proposed; evidence is then sought for and against these mechanisms until one emerges as the best choice. That one then remains the accepted mechanism for the reaction until fresh evidence comes along that does not fit the mechanism.</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="maxgrey" style="width:70%;">The Cannizzaro reaction first appeared in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>.</span></p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We are going to look at one reaction, the Cannizzaro reaction, and use this to introduce the different techniques used in elucidating mechanisms so that you will be able to appreciate the different information each experiment brings to light and how all the pieces fit together to leave us with a probable mechanism. Under strongly basic conditions, an aldehyde with no &#945; hydrogens undergoes disproportionation to give half alcohol and half carboxylate. Disproportionation means one half of the sample is oxidized by the other half, which is itself reduced. In this case, half the aldehyde reduces the other half to the primary alcohol and in the process is oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Before the discovery of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> in 1946, this was one of the few reliable ways to reduce aldehydes and so was of some use in synthesis.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Here is a simple mechanistic scheme of what happens&#8212;the sort of thing you might reasonably propose if you had not seen the reaction before.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1031-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It&#8217;s not the only possible mechanism by any means&#8212;and you may spot that it is slightly different from the one in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, where we showed a dianion as an intermediate. We&#8217;ll now work through some of the alternative mechanisms that have been proposed for the Cannizzaro reaction, along with the evidence for or against them. Most of these alternatives have been eliminated, leaving just the ones you have already met. Finally, we will see that even these mechanisms do not explain everything absolutely.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Proposed mechanism A: a radical mechanism</h4>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="maxgrey" style="width:70%;">For some examples of radical initiators and inhibitors, see <a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>. Radical inhibitors are usually stable radicals, such as those on p. <a href="chapter_37.xhtml#page_975">975</a>.</span></p>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Early on it was thought that the hydrogen transfer might be taking place via a radical chain reaction. If this were the case, then the reaction should go faster if radical initiators are added and it should slow down when radical inhibitors are added. When this was tried, there was no change in the rate, so this proposed mechanism was ruled out.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Kinetic evidence for an ionic mechanism</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">The first piece of evidence that must be accounted for is the rate law. For the reaction of benzaldehyde with hydroxide, the reaction is first order with respect to hydroxide ions and second order with respect to benzaldehyde (third order overall).</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_displayMaths_1031-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1031-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">For some aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and furfural, the order with respect to the concentration of hydroxide varies between one and two depending on the exact conditions. In high concentrations of base it is fourth order.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_displayMaths_1031-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;"><a class="page" id="page_1032">Page 1032, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At lower concentrations of base the rate law is a mixture of both third- and fourth-order terms.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_displayMaths_1032-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="maxgrey" style="width:70%;">See p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_261">261</a> for an explanation of this important point.</span></p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Just because the overall order of reaction is third or fourth order, it does not mean that all the species must simultaneously collide in the rate-determining step. You saw in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> that the rate law actually reveals all the species that are involved <i>up to and including</i> the rate-determining step.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Isotopic labelling</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">When the reaction is carried out in D<sub>2</sub>O instead of in H<sub>2</sub>O it is found that there are no C&#8211;D bonds in the products. This tells us that the hydrogen must come from the aldehyde and not from the solvent.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1032-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Proposed mechanism B: formation of an intermediate dimeric adduct</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">A possible mechanism that fits all the experimental evidence so far involves nucleophilic attack of the usual tetrahedral intermediate on another aldehyde to give an intermediate adduct. This adduct could then form the products directly by hydride transfer. You may not like the look of this last step, but the mechanism was proposed and evidence is needed to disprove it.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1032-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Which step would be rate determining for this mechanism? It could not be step 1 since, if this were the case, the rate law would be first order with respect to the aldehyde rather than the observed second-order relationship. Also, if the reaction is carried out in water labelled with oxygen-18, the oxygen in the benzaldehyde exchanges with the <sup>18</sup>O from the solvent much faster than the Cannizzaro reaction takes place. This can only be because of a <i>rapid</i> equilibrium in step 1 and so step 1 cannot be rate determining.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1032-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">So, for mechanism B, either step 2 or step 3 could be rate determining&#8212;either case would fit the observed rate law. Step 2 is similar to step 1: in both cases an oxyanion nucleophile attacks the aldehyde. Since the equilibrium in step 1 is very rapid, it is reasonable to suggest that the equilibrium in step 2 should also be rapid and thus that the hydride transfer in step 3 must be rate determining. So mechanism B can fit the rate equation.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">How can mechanism B be ruled out? One way is to change the attacking nucleophile. The Cannizzaro reaction works equally well if methoxide is used in a mixture of methanol and water. If mechanism B were correct, the reaction with methoxide would be as follows.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1032-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a class="page" id="page_1033">Page 1033, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>
</figure>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> <span class="maxgrey" style="width:70%;">We shall discuss this kind of technique as well as other evidence used to evaluate an intermediate towards the end of this chapter.</span></p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">One of the products would be different by this mechanism: benzyl methyl ether would be formed instead of benzyl alcohol. None is observed experimentally. Moreover, under the conditions of the experiment, benzyl methyl ether does not react to form benzyl alcohol, so it cannot be the case that the ether is formed but then reacts to form the products. Mechanism B can therefore be ruled out.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Proposed mechanism C: formation of an ester intermediate</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">This mechanism is like mechanism B but the hydride transfer in the adduct formed in step 2 displaces OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to form an ester (benzyl benzoate) that is then hydrolysed to the products. This was at one time held to be the correct mechanism for the Cannizzaro reaction. One piece of evidence for this, and at first glance a very good one, is that by cooling the reaction mixture and avoiding excess alkali, some benzyl benzoate could be isolated during the reaction. An important point is that this does not mean that the ester must be an <i>intermediate</i> in the reaction&#8212;it might be formed at the end of the reaction, for example. However, it does mean that any mechanism we propose must be able to account for its formation. For now though we want to try to establish whether the ester is an intermediate rather than a by-product in the Cannizzaro reaction.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;margin-left:-5.5em;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1033-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">An early objection to mechanism C was that the ester would not be hydrolysed fast enough. When someone actually tried it under the conditions of the experiment, they found that benzyl benzoate is very rapidly hydrolysed (the moral here is &#8216;don&#8217;t just think about it, try it!&#8217;). However, just because the ester <i>could be</i> hydrolysed, it still did not show that it actually was an intermediate in the reaction. How this was eventually shown was rather clever. The argument goes like this. We can measure the rate constant for step 4 by seeing how quickly pure benzyl benzoate is hydrolysed to benzyl alcohol and benzoate under the same conditions as those of the Cannizzaro reaction. We also know how quickly these products are formed during the Cannizzaro reaction itself. Since, if this mechanism is correct, the only way the products are formed is from this intermediate, it is possible to work out how much of the intermediate ester must be present at any time to give the observed rate of formation of the products. If we can measure the amount of ester that is actually present and it is significantly less than that which we predict, then this cannot be the correct mechanism. It turned out that there was never enough ester present to account for the formation of the products in the Cannizzaro reaction and mechanism C could be ruled out.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">The correct mechanism for the Cannizzaro reaction</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">The only mechanism that has not been ruled out and that appears to fit all the evidence is the one we have already given (p. <a href="chapter_39.xhtml#page_1031">1031</a>). The fact that the rate law for this mechanism is overall third and sometimes fourth order depending on the aldehyde and the conditions can be explained by the involvement of a second hydroxide ion deprotonating the tetrahedral intermediate to give a dianion. When methoxide is used in a methanol/water mix, some methyl ester is formed. This does not stay around for long&#8212;under the conditions of the experiment it is quickly hydrolysed to the carboxylate.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1033-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a class="page" id="page_1034">Page 1034, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>
</figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Even this mechanism does not quite fit all the evidence</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">We said earlier that we can never prove a mechanism&#8212;only disprove it. Unfortunately, just as the &#8216;correct&#8217; mechanism seems to be found, there are some observations that make us doubt this mechanism. In <a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> you saw how a technique called <b>electron spin resonance (ESR)</b> (or electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR) detects radicals and gives some information about their structure. When the Cannizzaro reaction was carried out with benzaldehyde and a number of substituted benzaldehydes in an ESR spectrometer, a radical was detected. For each aldehyde used, the ESR spectrum proved to be identical to that formed when the aldehyde was reduced using sodium metal. The radical formed was the radical anion of the aldehyde.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1034-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Our mechanism does not explain this result, but small amounts of radicals are formed in many reactions in which the products are actually formed by simple ionic processes. Detection of a species in a reaction mixture does not prove that it is an intermediate. Few chemists think that radicals are involved in the Cannizzaro reaction. Most think the mechanism we have given is correct.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Variation in the structure of the aldehyde</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Before leaving the Cannizzaro reaction, look at these rates of reactions for aromatic aldehydes with different substituents in the <i>para</i> position. These aldehydes may be divided into two classes: those that react faster than unsubstituted benzaldehyde and those that react more slowly. Those that go slower all have something in common&#8212;they all have substituents on the ring that donate electrons.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We have already seen how substituents on a benzene ring affect the rate of electrophilic substitution (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>). Electron-donating groups such as MeO and Me<sub>2</sub>N dramatically speed up the rate at which an aromatic ring is attacked by an electrophile, whereas electron-withdrawing groups, particularly nitro groups, slow the reaction down. The Cannizzaro reaction is not taking place on the benzene ring itself, but substituents on the ring still make their presence known. The fact that the Cannizzaro reaction goes much <i>slower</i> with electron-donating groups and faster with electron-withdrawing groups tells us that, for this reaction, rather than a positive charge developing, as in the case of electrophilic substitution on an aromatic ring, there must be negative charge accumulating somewhere near the ring. The accumulation of more negative charge is disfavoured by the presence of a group that is already offloading electron density into the ring. In agreement with this, our mechanism has monoand dianion intermediates, which are stabilized by electron-withdrawing groups and destabilized by electron-donating groups.<a class="page" id="page_1035">Page 1035, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The rest of the chapter is devoted to discussions of methods similar to those we have briefly surveyed for the Cannizzaro reaction, with examples of the use of each method. You can assume that the mechanisms we have discussed in this book have been verified (not, of course, proved) by these sorts of methods.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Be sure of the structure of the product</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">This seems a rather obvious point. However, there is a lot to be learned from the detailed structure of the product: its connectivity (which atom goes where) as well as its stereochemistry. You will see that it may be necessary to alter the structure of the starting material in subtle ways to make sure that we know exactly what happens to all its atoms by the time it reaches the product.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Suppose you are studying the addition of HCl to this alkene. You find that you get a good yield of a single adduct and you might be a bit surprised that you do not get a mixture of the two obvious adducts. You may wonder if there is some participation of the ether oxygen or whether perhaps the ketone enolizes during the reaction and controls the outcome.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If you are cautious you might check on the structure of the product before you start a mechanistic investigation. The NMR spectrum (above) tells you at once that the product is neither of these suggestions. It contains a (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl unit and can no longer have an eight-membered ring. A ring contraction has given a five-membered ring and a mechanistic investigation is hardly needed. Simply knowing what the product is allows us to propose a mechanism. A rearrangement has occurred and we could use the method suggested in <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>: number the atoms in the starting material and find them in the product. This is quite easy as only one numbering system makes any sense.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This numbering suggests that the carbon skeleton is unaffected by the reaction, that protonation has occurred at C5, that the ether oxygen has acted as an internal nucleophile across the ring at C4, and that the chloride ion has attacked C7. The mechanism is straightforward.<a class="page" id="page_1036">Page 1036, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It may be disappointing to find that every step in this mechanism is well known and that the reaction is exactly what we ought to have expected with an eight-membered ring as these rings are famous for their transannular (across-ring) reactions to form 5/5 fused systems. However, it is good that a prolonged investigation is not necessary.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A more subtle distinction occurred in a study of the bromination of alkynes. Bromination of benzyl alkynes in acetic acid gave the products of addition of one molecule of bromine&#8212; the 1,2-dibromoalkenes. The reaction was successful with a variety of <i>para</i> substituents and there seems at first to be no special interest in the structure of the products.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Closer investigation revealed an extraordinary difference between them, not at all obvious from their NMR spectra: the compound from X=OMe was the <i>Z</i>-dibromoalkene from <i>cis</i> addition of bromine while the product from X=CF<sub>3</sub> was the <i>E</i> alkene from <i>trans</i> addition. What mechanism could explain this difference?</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1036-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The <i>anti</i> addition is more easily explained: it is the result of formation of a bromonium ion, similar, in fact, to the normal mechanism for the bromination of alkenes. Bromine adds from one side of the alkene and the bromide ion must necessarily form the <i>E</i>-dibromo product regardless of which atom it attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">So why does the <i>p</i>-methoxy-substituted compound behave differently? It cannot react by the same mechanism and a reasonable explanation is that the much more electron-donating ring participates in the reaction to give a carbocyclic three-membered ring intermediate that is attacked in an <i>anti</i> fashion to give the <i>Z</i> alkene. Both intermediates are three-membered ring cations and both are attacked with inversion but the <i>p</i>-MeO compound undergoes double inversion by participation of the ring.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Labelling experiments reveal the fate of individual atoms</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">It often happens that the atoms in starting material and product cannot be correlated without at least one of them being labelled. The fact that many elements exist as different isotopes provides us with a perfect way of doing this: a neutron more or less in the nucleus affects the physics (and hence the spectroscopic features) of an atom, but not its chemistry.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The isomerization of <i>Z</i>-1-phenylbutadiene to the <i>E</i> diene in acid looks like a simple reaction. Protonation of the <i>Z</i> alkene would give a stabilized secondary benzylic cation that should last long enough to rotate. Loss of the proton would then give the more stable <i>E</i> diene.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">However, reaction with D<sup>+</sup> in D<sub>2</sub>O reveals that this mechanism is incorrect. The product contains substantial amounts of deuterium at C4, not at C2 as predicted by the proposed mechanism. Protonation must occur at the end of the conjugated system to produce the more stable conjugated cation, which rotates about the same bond and loses H or D from C4 to give the product. More H than D will be lost, partly because there are two Hs and only one D, but also because of the kinetic isotope effect, of which more later.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">The value of double labelling experiments</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">An altogether more modern approach to a labelling study was used in the surprising rearrangement of a hydroxy-acid in acidic solution. The structure of the product suggests a CO<sub>2</sub>H migration as the most likely mechanism. This mechanism resembles closely the cationic rearrangements of <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;margin-left:-5em;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1038-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">But there are other possibilities: received wisdom (<a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>) suggests that the best migrating group in cationic rearrangements is the one best able to bear a positive charge, by which logic the more familiar Ph and Me migrations ought to be preferred. A more elaborate mechanism can be written: it involves two methyl migrations and one phenyl migration and it also needs consideration.</p>

But when both C atoms are always <sup>13</sup>C, the coupling becomes evident.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">These mechanisms can be tested by finding out whether the CO<sub>2</sub>H group remains attached to its original position or becomes attached to the other carbon in the skeleton of the molecule. This can be done by double labelling. If a compound is prepared with two <sup>13</sup>C labels, one on the CO<sub>2</sub>H group itself and one on the benzylic carbon, the NMR spectrum of the product will show what has happened. In fact, the two <sup>13</sup>C labels end up next to each other with a coupling constant 1<i>J</i><sub>CC</sub> = 71 Hz. It is the CO<sub>2</sub>H group that has migrated.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">So why does the CO<sub>2</sub>H group migrate? It does so not because it is a good migrating group, but because it cannot bear to be left behind. The rearranged cation from CO<sub>2</sub>H migration is a stable tertiary alkyl cation. The cation from Me migration is a very unstable cation, with the positive charge next to the CO<sub>2</sub>H group. Such cations are unknown as the carbonyl group is very electron withdrawing.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">&#8216;Crossover&#8217; experiments</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">There is still one tiny doubt. Supposing the reaction is not intramolecular at all, but <i>inter</i>molecular. The CO<sub>2</sub>H group might be lost from one molecule as protonated CO<sub>2</sub> and be picked up by another molecule of alkene. No migration would be involved at all.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This mechanism can be checked by using a 50:50 mixture of doubly labelled and unl abelled starting material. The molecule of alkene that captures the roving protonated labelled CO<sub>2</sub> might happen to be labelled too but equally well it might be unlabelled. If this last mechanism is correct, we should get a mixture of unlabelled, singly labelled, and doubly labelled product in the ratio 1:2:1 as there are two types of singly labelled product. The two singly labelled compounds are called the crossover products and the experiment is called a crossover experiment as it discovers whether any parts of one molecule cross over to another.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In fact, no singly labelled compounds were found: NMR analysis showed that the product consisted entirely of unlabelled or doubly labelled molecules. The CO<sub>2</sub>H group remains attached to the same molecule (though not to the same atom) and the first mechanism is correct.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Crossover experiments demand some sort of double labelling, which does not have to be isotopic. An example where crossover products are observed is the light-initiated isomerization of allylic sulfides.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This is formally a [1,3] sigmatropic shift of sulfur (<a href="chapter_35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>) but that is an unlikely mechanism (and you should be able to suggest why). A crossover experiment was carried out in which the two molecules had either two phenyl groups or two <i>para-</i>tolyl groups. The mixture was allowed to rearrange in daylight and the products were examined by mass spectroscopy. There was a roughly 1:2:1 mixture of products having two phenyl groups, one phenyl and one <i>para</i>-tolyl group, and two <i>para</i>-tolyl groups. The diagram shows the starting materials and the two crossover products only.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Clearly, the ArS group had become separated from the rest of the molecule and the most likely explanation was a radical chain reaction (<a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>) with the light producing a small amount of ArS&#8226; to initiate the chain. The <i>para-</i>methyl group acts as a label. The whole system is in equilibrium and the more highly substituted alkene is the product.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Systematic structural variation</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In this last example, the hope is that the <i>para</i>-methyl group will have too weak an electronic or steric effect and in any case will be too far away to affect the outcome. It is intended to make nearly as slight a change in the structure as an isotopic label. Many structural investigations have exactly the opposite hope. Some systematic change is made in the structure of the molecule in the expectation of a predictable change in rate. A faster or slower reaction will lead to some definite conclusion about the charge distribution in the transition state.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Allylic compounds can react efficiently with nucleophiles by either the S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>). Here are two examples.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1040-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The carbon skeleton is the same in both reactions but the leaving groups and the nucleophiles are different. These reactions might both go by S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2 or one might go by S<sub>N</sub>1 and the other by S<sub>N</sub>2. One way to find out is to make a large change in the electronic nature of the carbon skeleton and see what happens to the rate of each reaction. In these experiments one of the methyl groups was changed for a CF<sub>3</sub> group&#8212;exchanging a weakly electron-donating group for a strongly electron-withdrawing group. If a cation is an intermediate, as in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, the fluorinated compound will react much more slowly. Here is the result in the first case.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1040-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The fluorinated compound reacts half a million times more slowly so this looks very much like an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. The slow step in an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism is the formation of a carbocation so any group that destabilizes the positive charge would have (and evidently does have) a large effect on the rate. Rate ratios of several powers of ten often are worth noticing and a rate ratio of nearly 10<sup>6</sup> is considerable. In the second case the rate difference is much less.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1040-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A rate ratio of 11 is not worth noticing. The point is not that the fluorinated compound reacts faster but that the two compounds react at about the same rate. This strongly suggests that no charge is generated in the transition state and an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism is not happening. The S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism makes good sense with its concerted bond formation and bond breaking requiring no charge on the carbon skeleton.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The CF<sub>3</sub> group works well here as a mechanistic probe because it is held well out of the way of the reaction site by a rigid &#960; system but is connected electronically by that same allylic system. Steric effects should be minimized and electronic effects clearly seen. This approach is clearly limited by the small number of groups having properties like those of the CF<sub>3</sub> group and the small number of reactions having such favourable carbon skeletons. We will now present the most important serious correlation between structure and reactivity.<a class="page" id="page_1041">Page 1041, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="maxnoindentl" style="width:70%;">Louis P. Hammett (1894&#8211;1987) invented &#8216;physical organic chemistry&#8217; and at Columbia University in 1935 derived the Hammett &#x03C3;/&#961; relationship. The impact was enormous and in the 1960s chemists were still working out more such correlations.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">The Hammett relationship</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">What we would ideally like to do is find a way to quantify the effects that electron-donating or -withdrawing groups have on the transition state or intermediate during the course of a reaction. This will then give us an idea of what the transition state is really like. The first question is: can we define exactly how efficient a given group is at donating or withdrawing electrons? Hammett took the arbitrary decision to use the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of an acid as a guide. For example, the rate of hydrolysis of esters might well correlate with the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the corresponding acid.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:50%;">When Hammett plotted the rates of ethyl ester hydrolyses (as log <i>k</i> since p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> has a log scale) against the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s of the corresponding acids, the initial results were not very encouraging as there was a random scatter of points over the whole graph.</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:50%;">Hammett had used some aliphatic acids (substituted acetic acids) and some aromatic acids (substituted benzoic acids) and he noticed that many of the points towards the top of the graph belonged to the substituted acetic acids. Removing them (brown points) made the graph a lot better. He then noticed that the remaining aromatic compounds were in two classes: the <i>ortho</i>-substituted esters reacted more slowly than their <i>meta</i>- and <i>para</i>-isomers and came towards the bottom of the graph (orange points). Removing them made the graph quite good (remaining green points).</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:50%;">It was not a perfect correlation but Hammett had removed the examples where steric hindrance was important. Aliphatic compounds can adopt a variety of conformations (<a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>) and the substituent in some of them will interfere with the reaction. Similarly, in <i>ortho</i>-substituted aromatic compounds the nearby substituent might exert steric hindrance on the reaction. Only with <i>meta</i>- and para-substituted compounds was the substituent held out of the way, on a rigid framework, and in electronic communication with the reaction site through the flat but conjugated benzene ring.</p>

If you determine a rate constant by plotting the right function of concentration against time and get an imperfect straight line, that is your fault because you haven&#8217;t done your measurements carefully enough. If you make a Hammett plot and the points are not on a straight line (and they won&#8217;t be) then that is <i>not</i> your fault. The points really don&#8217;t fit on a perfectly straight line.

</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">A quick glance at the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s of some substituted benzoic acids in the table below will show how well they correlate electron donation with p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>. The substituents at the top of the table are electron donating and the anions of the benzoic acids are correspondingly less stable so these are the weakest acids. At the bottom of the table we have the electron-withdrawing groups, which stabilize the anion and make the acid stronger. The whole range is not that great, only one pH unit or so, because the carboxylate anion is not conjugated with the ring.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Hammett decided not to use the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s themselves for his correlation but defined a new parameter, which he called &#x03C3;. This &#x03C3; shows how electron donating or withdrawing a group is relative to H as a difference between the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s of a benzoic acid derivative with the substituent and benzoic acid itself. If the acid required to determine &#x03C3; for a new substituent was not available, &#x03C3; could be determined by correlation with other reactions. Here are the equations and the table of &#x03C3; values for the most important substituents. A different value of &#x03C3; for any given substituent was needed for the <i>meta</i> and the <i>para</i> positions and these are called &#x03C3;<sub>m</sub> and &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub>, respectively.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">There is no point learning the precise figures in this table, but it will help if you form a general idea of what a &#x03C3; value means. If &#x03C3; = 0 the substituent has no effect: it is electronically the same as H. If &#x03C3; is positive, the substituent is electron withdrawing. This is unfortunate perhaps, but just remember that the comparison is with acid strength, and acids with electron-withdrawing substituents are stronger. Positive &#x03C3; means a stronger acid so the substituent is electron withdrawing. The more positive the charge induced on the ring by a substituent, the larger its &#x03C3; value. Negative &#x03C3; means weaker acid and electron donation. Inductive effects from polarization of &#x03C3; bonds are greater for &#x03C3;<sub>m</sub> than for &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub> because the substituent is nearer.<a class="page" id="page_1043">Page 1043, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Conjugation is generally more effective in the <i>para</i> position (see <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) so &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub> &#x003E; &#x03C3;<sub>m</sub> for conjugating substituents. Indeed, the NH<sub>2</sub> group has a large negative &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub> and a zero &#x03C3;<sub>m</sub>. The NH<sub>2</sub> group donates electrons strongly to the carbonyl group of benzoic acid from the <i>para</i> position but does not conjugate in the <i>meta</i> position where its donation happens just to balance the effect of electronegative nitrogen.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The OMe group has a negative &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub> but a positive &#x03C3;<sub>m</sub> because a weaker electron donation from the lone pairs is more important in the <i>para</i> position but the effect of very electronegative oxygen on the &#x03C3; framework of the ring in the <i>meta</i> position is more important than lone pair donation that doesn&#8217;t reach the carbonyl group. You do not need to learn any &#x03C3; values but you should be able to work out the sign of &#x03C3; for well-known substituents and estimate a rough value.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">The Hammett reaction constant &#961;</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Now we can return to our reaction: the alkaline hydrolysis of various <i>meta</i>- and <i>para-</i>substituted ethyl benzoates. We sketched the graph earlier (p. <a href="chapter_39.xhtml#page_1041">1041</a>) but now we can add some more quantitative detail. The rate constants for this second-order reaction have been measured and shown here is a graph of log (<i>k</i><sub>X</sub><i>/k</i><sub>H</sub>) versus &#x03C3;, where <i>k</i><sub>X</sub> is the rate constant for the reaction with the substituted benzoate and <i>k</i><sub>H</sub> is that for the unsubstituted reaction (X=H).</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We can see straight away that there is a good correlation between how fast the reaction goes and the value of &#x03C3;; in other words, the points lie more or less on a straight line. The gradient of this best-fit line, given the symbol &#961; (rho), tells us how sensitive the reaction is to substituent effects in comparison with the ionization of benzoic acids. The gradient is &#961; = +2.6. This tells us that the reaction responds to substituent effects in the same way (because it is +) as the ionization of benzoic acids but by much more (10<sup>1.6</sup> times more) because it is 2.6 instead of 1.0. We already know what the mechanism of this reaction is:</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The first step is quite like the ionization of benzoic acid.

<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">To take a simple example, let&#8217;s just see what happens to &#961; if we simply move the carboxylic acid away from the ring. The &#961; value for ionization gets less. This is just what you would expect&#8212;the further it is from the aromatic ring, the less the acid cares about how electron rich or poor the ring is. With two saturated carbons between the benzene ring and the carboxylic acid, there is almost no effect on p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>. But restore electronic communications with a double bond, and &#961; goes back up again.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If the negative charge on the anion can actually be delocalized round the ring, as it can in substituted phenols, we should expect the size of &#961; to increase. Both the phenol and the anion are delocalized but delocalization is more important for the anion. The effect is even more significant for the ionization of anilinium salts as the acid ArNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> does not have a delocalized lone pair but the conjugate base (ArNH<sub>2</sub>) does.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Reactions with positive Hammett &#961; values</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">The size and sign of the value of &#961; tell us about what is happening <i>in the rate-determining</i><a class="page" id="page_1045">Page 1045, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;"><i>step</i> of a reaction. Any reaction that involves nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group as the rate-determining step is going to have a &#961; value of about 2&#8211;3, the same as for the hydrolysis of esters, as we have already seen. Large positive &#961; values usually indicate extra electrons in the transition state delocalized into the ring itself. A classic example is nucleophilic aromatic substitution by the addition&#8211;elimination mechanism (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>). The &#961; value is +4.9, but even this large value does not mean a complete anion on the benzene ring as the nitro group, present in all cases, takes most of the negative charge. The substituent X merely helps.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1045-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We get the full value when there are no nitro groups to take the brunt of the negative charge. This vinylic substitution has a &#961; value of +9.0. It cannot be an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction or it would have a small &#961; value and it cannot be an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction or it would have a negative &#961; value (fewer electrons in the transition state). It must be an addition&#8211;elimination mechanism through a benzylic anion delocalized round both benzene rings.</p>

</figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Reactions with negative Hammett &#961; values</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Negative &#961; values mean electrons flowing away from the ring. A representative example is the S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement of iodide from EtI by phenoxide anions. This has a &#961; value of exactly &#8211;1.0. Although the transition state has a negative charge, that charge is decreasing on the aromatic ring as the starting material approaches the transition state.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1045-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">An S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction on the carbon atom next to the ring has a large negative &#961; value. In this example, a tertiary benzylic cation is the intermediate and the rate-determining step is, of course, the formation of the cation. The cation is next to the ring but delocalized round it and the &#961; value is &#8211;4.5, about the same value, though negative, as that for the nucleophilic substitution on nitrobenzenes by the addition&#8211;elimination mechanism that we saw in the last section.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The largest negative &#961; values come from electrophilic aromatic substitution (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>), where the electrons of the ring are used in the reaction, leaving a positive charge on the ring itself in the intermediate. Some of this charge is already there in the transition state. This simple nitration has &#961; = &#8211;6.4 and &#961; values for electrophilic aromatic substitution are usually in the range &#8211;5 to &#8211;9. Negative &#961; values mean electrons flowing out of the ring.<a class="page" id="page_1046">Page 1046, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Reactions with small Hammett &#961; values</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Small Hammett &#961; values arise in three ways. The aromatic ring being used as a probe for the mechanism may simply be too far away for the result to be significant. This trivial case of the alkaline hydrolysis of the 3-aryl propionate ester has a &#961; value of + 0.5 and it is surprising that it is even that large.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1046-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The second case is the informative one where the reaction is not dependent on electrons flowing into or out of the ring. Pericyclic reactions are important examples and the Diels&#8211; Alder reaction of arylbutadienes with maleic anhydride shows a small negative &#961; value of &#8211;0.6. The small value is consistent with a mechanism not involving charge accumulation or dispersal, but the sign is interesting. We explained this type of Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in <a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a> by using the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile. The negative sign of &#961;, small though it is, supports this view because the reaction is somewhat faster with electron-donating groups on Ar, which raise the energy of the HOMO of the diene.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1046-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The third case is in many ways the most interesting. We have seen that the alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl esters of benzoic acids (ArCO<sub>2</sub>Et) has a &#961; value of +2.6 and that this is a reasonable value for a reaction involving nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group conjugated with the aromatic ring. The hydrolysis of the same esters in acid solution, which also involves nucleophilic attack on the same carbonyl group, has a &#961; value of +0.1. In other words, substituted benzoic esters hydrolyse at more or less the same rate in acid solution, irrespective of their substituents. We need to look at the full mechanism to explain this remarkable result.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Steps 1, 3, and 5 cannot be slow as they are just proton transfers between oxygen atoms, and proton transfer between electronegative atoms is always fast. That leaves only steps 2 and 4 as possible rate-determining steps. The bimolecular addition of the weak nucleophile water to the low concentration of protonated ester (step 2) is the most attractive candidate, as step 4&#8212;the unimolecular loss of ethanol and re-formation of the carbonyl group&#8212;should be fast. What &#961; value would be expected for the reaction if step 2 were the rate-determining step? It would be made up of two parts. There would be an equilibrium &#961; value for the protonation step and a reaction &#961; value for the addition of water. Step 1 involves electrons flowing out of the molecule and step 2 involves electrons flowing in so the &#961; values for these two steps would have opposite charges. We know that the &#961; value for step 2 would be about +2.5 (it&#8217;s just like the step in the ester hydrolysis) and a value of about &#8211;2.5 for the equilibrium protonation is reasonable. This is indeed the explanation: step 2 is the rate-determining step and the &#961; values for steps 1 and 2 almost cancel each other out. All steps before the rate-determining step are present in the rate equation and also affect the Hammett &#961; value.<a class="page" id="page_1047">Page 1047, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You should not, of course, learn the numbers in this scheme, but you need an idea of roughly what each group of values means. You should see now why it is unimportant whether the Hammett correlation gives a good straight line or not. We just want to know whether &#961; is + or &#8211; and whether it is, say, 3 or 6. It is meaningless to debate the significance of a &#961; value of 3.4 as distinct from one of 3.8.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Using the Hammett &#961; values to uncover mechanisms</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Electrophilic attack on alkenes by bromine often goes through three-membered ring cyclic bromonium ions and we can sometimes tell that this is so by studying the stereochemistry. Here are two reactions of styrenes that look very similar&#8212;a reaction with bromine and another with PhSCl. With no further information, we might be tempted to assume that they both go by the same mechanism. However, the Hammett &#961; values for the two reactions are rather different.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The &#961; value for bromination is definitely in the &#8216;large&#8217; range and can only mean that a positive charge is formed that is delocalized round the benzene ring. Bromine evidently does not form a bromonium ion with these alkenes but prefers to form a secondary benzylic cation instead, which can be stabilized more effectively by delocalization.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1047-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The sulfenylation, on the other hand, has a moderate negative &#961; value. No cation is formed that is delocalized round the ring, but electrons flow out of the ring and we suspect some loss of conjugation. All this fits well with the formation of a three-membered ring intermediate. From experiments like this we learn that PhSCl is much more likely than bromine to react stereospecifically with alkenes through cyclic cation intermediates.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">A complete picture of the transition state from Hammett plots</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">More information can be gained on the mechanism of the reaction if two separate experiments can be carried out with the mechanistic probe inserted at two different sites on the reagents. If we are studying a reaction between a nucleophile and an electrophile, it may be possible to make Hammett plots from the variation of substituents on both reagents. The acylation of amines with acid chlorides is an example.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1048-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If we vary the structure of the acid chloride we get a &#961; value of +1.2, typical of nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. If we vary the amine we get a &#961; value of &#8211;3.2, typical of a reaction in which electrons that were conjugated round the ring move away to form a new bond. Comparing the numbers tells us the rate depends on the nucleophilicity of the amine 100 times more than on the electrophilicity of the acid chloride.</p>

<aside class="maxabc5" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindent1">The Hammett plot for hydrolysis of the acid chlorides of benzoic acids in aqueous acetone is very odd indeed. Hammett plots need not be perfectly linear to give useful information, but this one is clearly made up of two intersecting straight lines. This might look like disaster at first but, in fact, it tells us something rather important. The right-hand part of the curve, where the more electron-withdrawing substituents lie, has a slope of +2.5: just what we should expect for rate-determining attack of water on the carbonyl group. As we go to less electron-withdrawing substituents, the rate of the reaction suddenly starts to increase as we pass the <i>para-</i>chloro compound and the left-hand part of the curve has a slope of &#8211;4.4.</p>

<p class="maxindent">What can this mean? If the reaction becomes faster as we pass the discontinuity in the curve&#8212;and it gets faster whether we go from right to left or left to right&#8212;there must be a change in mechanism. If there is a choice between two mechanisms, the faster of the two will operate. Mechanism 1 is the rate-determining nucleophilic attack by water on the carbonyl group.</p>
<p class="maxindent">The new mechanism goes faster for more electron-donating substituents and has quite a large negative &#961; value, suggesting the formation of a cation in the rate-determining step. This mechanism (mechanism 2) must surely be the S<sub>N</sub>1-like preliminary formation of an acylium ion by loss of chloride ion.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">When the Hammett plot bends the other way, so that the rate of the reaction decreases as it passes the discontinuity, we have a single mechanism with a change in rate-determining step. A reaction goes by the fastest possible mechanism but its rate is limited by the slowest of the steps in that mechanism. An example is the intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of a diphenyl derivative where the alkylating agent is a diarylmethanol attached to one of the benzene rings in the <i>ortho</i> position.</p>

The cyclization puts electrons back into the carbocation and has a positive &#961; value. As the two steps have more or less the reverse electron flow to and from the same carbon atom, it is reasonable for the size of &#961; to be about the same but of opposite sign.</p>

<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> You have seen how isotopes have different <i>physical</i> properties&#8212;their nuclear spin, for example, which affects how they behave in an NMR machine.

That fact is highly relevant to the explanation we are about to give you for the origin of kinetic isotope effects.</p>

<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> The full explanation of the theory of kinetic isotope effects is beyond the scope of this book but you can read about it in any book on physical organic chemistry.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Up to now you have probably (and rightly) assumed that isotopes of an element are chemically identical. They differ only in the number of neutrons in their nuclei: chemistry generally depends on charge, orbitals, and electrons. It may come as a surprise to find that this is not quite true. Isotopes may differ chemically, because some chemical properties do depend on atomic mass. However, this difference is only significant for hydrogen&#8212;no other element has one isotope twice as massive as another! <i>Kinetic isotope effects</i> are the changes in rate observed when a (<sup>1</sup>H) hydrogen atom is replaced by a (<sup>2</sup>H) deuterium atom in the same reaction. For any reaction, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is defined as</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_displayMaths_1050.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="maxnoindent" style="width:70%;">where <i>k</i><sub>H</sub> is the rate with a <sup>1</sup>H atom in the molecule and <i>k</i><sub>D</sub> is the rate with a <sup>2</sup>H (deuterium, D) atom in the molecule.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">How do kinetic isotope effects come about? Even in its lowest energy state a covalent bond never stops vibrating. If it did it would violate a fundamental physical principle, Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle, which states that position and momentum cannot be known exactly at the same time: a non-vibrating pair of atoms have precisely zero momentum and precisely fixed locations. The minimum vibrational energy a bond can have is called the zero point energy, and the zero point energy depends on the mass of the atoms attached to the bond&#8212; heavier atoms have a lower zero point energy than lighter ones.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1050-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In order to break a covalent bond, a certain amount of energy is required to separate the nuclei from their starting position. This energy has to raise the vibrational state of the bond to the point where it breaks. For the sake of argument, imagine taking a C&#8211;H bond in its lowest energy state and breaking it&#8212;the diagram shows the amount of energy required, which we can call &#916;<i>G</i>&#8225;<sub>H</sub>. Now do the same for a C&#8211;D bond: because the zero point energy of a C&#8211;D bond is smaller than that for a C&#8211;H bond, the C&#8211;D bond needs that little bit more energy &#916;<i>G</i>&#8225;<sub>D</sub> to break: in other words a C&#8211;D bond is marginally stronger than a C&#8211;H bond. This means reactions in which C&#8211;H bonds break go faster than reactions in which C&#8211;D bonds break, <i>providing the bond to H (or D) is involved in the rate-determining step</i>. The theoretical maximum value of <a class="page" id="page_1051">Page 1051, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>the KIE is about 7 for reactions at room temperature in which a bond to H or D is being broken. For example, the rates of these two eliminations can be compared, and <i>k</i><sub>H</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>D</sub> turns out to be 7.1 at 25&#176;C.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In this case the fact that the KIE is non-zero tells us that the C&#8211;H (or C&#8211;D) bond is being broken during the rate-determining step, and so the reaction must be an E2 elimination. In E1 eliminations, the rate-determining step does not involve a breaking C&#8211;H bond.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> we told you that the rate-determining step in the nitration of benzene was the attack of the electrophile on the benzene ring. This is easily verified by replacing the hydrogen atoms round the benzene ring with deuteriums. The rate of the reaction stays the same, so the C&#8211;H (or C&#8211;D) bonds cannot be involved in the rate-determining step. If the second step, which does involve the breaking of a C&#8211;H bond, were the rate-determining step it would go more slowly if the H were replaced by D.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">By contrast, for the iodination of phenol in basic solution there is a deuterium isotope effect of <i>k</i><sub>H</sub><i>/k</i><sub>D</sub> = 4.1. Clearly, the loss of the proton from the intermediate must now be the rate-determining step&#8212;the phenolate ion reacts so rapidly that the first step is faster than the second.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The deuterium isotope effect can add to the information from Hammett plots in building up a picture of a transition state. Three separate Hammett &#961; values can be measured for the elimination reaction and this information is very valuable. In addition, a large KIE <i>k</i><sub>H</sub><i>/k</i><sub>D</sub> = 7.1 is observed for the hydrogen atom under attack.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It is no surprise that the base (ArO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) donates electrons and the leaving group (ArSO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) accepts them, as the &#961; values indicate. The large deuterium isotope effect tells us that the reaction is E2, but additional information comes from the moderate positive &#961;(Y) value for the aromatic ring adjacent to the proton being lost. It might have been expected that this ring is merely a spectator, but in fact the reaction must involve a build-up of negative charge, which can be stabilized by an electron-donating substituent Y. This can be explained if we assume <a class="page" id="page_1052">Page 1052, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>that the removal of the proton is slightly more advanced at the transition state than loss of the leaving group.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">The entropy of activation, &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225;, of a reaction tells us about the increase or decrease in order in a reaction as the starting material goes to the transition state. A positive &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225; means an increase in entropy or a decrease in order, and a negative &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225; means an increase in order.

Large negative numbers are common but only small positive numbers are found. The largest negative numbers apply to bimolecular reactions where neither reagent is in great excess. Smaller negative numbers may mean a bimolecular reaction with solvent or some other reagent in large excess. The acid-catalysed opening of styrene oxides in methanol is a good example.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">As you have seen throughout this book, acids and bases provide the most widely used ways of speeding up reactions. If you want to make an ester&#8212;add some acid. If you want to hydrolyse an ester&#8212;add some base. We explained in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> the ways in which acid and base catalysts help reactions along, and we introduced you to the terms <b>specific acid</b> and <b>specific base</b>, <b>general acid</b> and <b>general base</b>. We will now look in a little more detail at these types of catalysis and give some pointers as to how to establish which of them, if any, is operative in any given reaction.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">As a preliminary, let&#8217;s look at an example of <b>specific acid catalysis</b>. This is the kind operating in the reaction just above&#8212;epoxides don&#8217;t react with methanol but, if we protonate the epoxide first, then the reaction works. Specific acid catalysis protonates electrophiles and makes them more electrophilic.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We could, on the other hand, have reasoned that although methanol is not a good enough nucleophile, deprotonating with a base will make it into the much more nucleophilic methoxide, and the reaction will also work. This sort of base catalysis&#8212;deprotonating nucleophiles to make them more nucleophilic&#8212;is <b>specific base catalysis</b>.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Specific acid catalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Specific acid catalysis (SAC) involves a rapid protonation of the compound followed by the slow step, which is accelerated in comparison with the uncatalysed reaction because of the greater reactivity of the protonated compound. You have just seen an example with an epoxide; ester hydrolysis (or formation) is another, as you saw in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This catalysis depends only on the protonating power of the solution. The compound must be protonated to react, so the catalyst must be a strong enough acid to do the job. It is not necessary that every molecule is protonated&#8212;just enough to set the reaction going because the catalytic acid is regenerated at the end. In a specific acid catalysed reaction, the rate of the reaction depends on the pH of the reaction mixture. SAC works only if the pH is similar to, or below, the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the conjugate acid of the substrate, and the log of the rate of the reaction is proportional to the pH of the solution.</p>

<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> As you saw on p. <a href="chapter_39.xhtml#page_1050">1050</a>, the usual kinetic isotope effect has k<sub>H</sub>/k<sub>D</sub> &#x003E; 1. Reactions with k<sub>H</sub>/k<sub>D</sub> &#x003C; 1 exhibit an inverse kinetic isotope effect. We don&#8217;t need to go into details of how this might come about, but this is the reason a reaction that goes faster in D<sub>2</sub>O than in H<sub>2</sub>O (even when that is expected) is said to have an inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">There is one rather remarkable experimental indication of this mechanism. If the reaction is carried out in a deuterated solvent (D<sub>2</sub>O instead of H<sub>2</sub>O) the rate of the reaction increases. This is a <i>solvent isotope effect</i> rather than a kinetic isotope effect and needs some explanation. If you examine the three examples of SAC in the previous pages you will see that they share these characteristics: a fast proton exchange is followed by a rate-determining step that does <i>not</i> involve the making or breaking of any bonds to hydrogen. In general terms:</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1054-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent" style="width:70%;">The rate of the reaction is the rate of the rate-determining step:</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The concentration of the intermediate [XH<sup>+</sup>] is related to the pH and to the concentration of the substrate by the equilibrium constant, <i>K</i>, of the protonation. This gives us:</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_displayMaths_1054-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In the acid-catalysed reaction, the bond to H (or D) is not broken in the rate-determining step, so <i>k</i> cannot change when hydrogen is replaced by deuterium. That means that if a reaction goes faster in D<sub>2</sub>O than in H<sub>2</sub>O then it must be <i>K</i> that is different (i.e. larger) in D<sub>2</sub>O. SAC is more effective with D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> in D<sub>2</sub>O than with H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> in H<sub>2</sub>O because more of the substrate is protonated at any one time.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This is sometimes explained by saying that D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is a stronger acid than H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. This is partly true. The full truth is that D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> <i>in D<sub>2</sub>O</i> is a stronger acid than H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> <i>in H<sub>2</sub>O.</i> Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a better solvating agent for H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> than D<sub>2</sub>O is for D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> because O&#8211;H bonds are longer than O&#8211;D bonds. Look again at the potential energy curve we showed you on p. <a href="chapter_39.xhtml#page_1050">1050</a> and reproduced below, this time representing the energies of O&#8211;H and O&#8211;D bonds. The average length of a bond is the mid-point of the line in the potential energy well representing its energy level. You can easily see that the mid-point for the O&#8211;H is further out than the mid-point for the O&#8211;D bond because of the asymmetry of the well. O&#8211;H bonds are longer than O&#8211;D bonds, and can therefore make <i>stronger hydrogen bonds</i>. These hydrogen bonds are better at allowing solvation of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, making H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> in H<sub>2</sub>O less willing to protonate a substrate than D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> in D<sub>2</sub>O.<a class="page" id="page_1055">Page 1055, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Let&#8217;s illustrate all this with an example. The <i>Z</i> allylic alcohol below dehydrates in acid solution to the <i>E</i> diene.

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The Hammett &#961; value of &#8211;6.0 suggests a carbocation intermediate and the positive entropy of activation suggests a rate-determining step in which disorder increases, perhaps one molecule breaking into two. The inverse solvent deuterium isotope effect (faster reaction in D<sub>2</sub>O than in H<sub>2</sub>O) strongly suggests SAC. Putting all this together we have a mechanism&#8212;a simple example of SAC. There is no protonation at carbon.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Specific base catalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">The other side of the coin is <i>specific base catalysis</i> (SBC). SBC usually involves the removal of a proton from the substrate in a fast pre-equilibrium step followed by a rate-determining reaction of the anion. Most of the base-catalysed reactions you are familiar with work by SBC. Examples include opening of epoxides with thiols.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;"><a class="page" id="page_1056">Page 1056, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with SAC, the rate of the reaction depends on the pH of the solution. If it is around or higher than the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the thiol, thiolate anion will be formed and this opens the epoxide much faster than does the unionized thiol. The nucleophile is then regenerated by the oxyanion produced in the rate-determining step.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It is quite common for specific acid and specific base catalysis to operate on the same reaction, depending on the pH at which the reaction is carried out. In fact, you have already seen this for ester hydrolysis in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>. The pH&#8211;rate profile (<a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) for the hydrolysis of a simple ester such as ethyl acetate shows just two straight lines meeting each other (and zero rate) at about neutrality. Ethyl acetate hydrolysis occurs by SAC or SBC only.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Removal of a proton from heteroatoms by heteroatom bases is never rate determining because it is always fast, but removal of a proton from carbon <i>can</i> be the rate-determining step. A remarkably large inverse solvent deuterium isotope effect was found with this elimination of a tertiary amine in basic solution.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4a">Microscopic reversibility</h4>
<p class="maxnoindentl">There is only one least-energy pathway between two interconverting compounds such as the starting material and the intermediate here. Every microscopic detail of the back reaction is exactly the same as that for the forward reaction. This is the principle of microscopic reversibility. Here we use evidence from the back reaction (slow proton transfer from water to the carbanion) to tell us about the forward reaction.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The isotope effect observed is certainly inverse (the reaction is faster with H<sub>2</sub>O than D<sub>2</sub>O) but the magnitude of the effect is too large to be a <i>solvent</i> isotope effect and looks much more like an inverse <i>kinetic</i> isotope effect. And so it is. The tertiary amine is not a very good leaving group in spite of its positive charge (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup> is about 10) so the carbanion mostly reverts to starting materials. The isotope effect is a kinetic isotope effect on this reverse step&#8212;the protonation of the carbanion. This reaction involves a proton transfer from H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O and will be much faster (7.7 times in fact) in H<sub>2</sub>O due to an ordinary kinetic isotope effect. The <i>elimination</i> reaction goes faster in D<sub>2</sub>O because the back reaction goes more slowly and more of the carbanion goes on to product.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">General base catalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> (p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_263">263</a>) we pointed out that even weak bases&#8212;too weak to deprotonate a nucleophile by the mechanism we have just described for SBC&#8212;can still act as catalysts. Such catalysts are known as <b>general base catalysts</b>, and are the promoters of a parallel kind of acid&#8211;base catalysis called &#8216;general&#8217; rather than &#8216;specific&#8217;. General base catalysis, abbreviated GBC, depends not only on pH (i.e. the concentration of hydroxide ion) but also on the concentration of other bases too. General acid catalysis, abbreviated GAC, likewise depends not only on pH (i.e. the concentration of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) but also on the concentration of other undissociated acids HA. General acid&#8211;base catalysis is a milder kind of catalysis and is characteristic of reactions catalysed by enzymes in the metabolism of living things.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In a general base-catalysed reaction, proton transfer is not complete before the rate-determining step (as it was in SBC) but occurs <i>during</i> the rate-determining step. A simple example is the catalysis by acetate ion of the formation of esters from alcohols and acetic anhydride.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">How can this catalysis work? At first sight there seems to be no mechanism available. Acetate cannot act as a specific base&#8212;it is far too weak (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> AcOH 4.7) to remove a proton from an alcohol (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> about 15). It can&#8217;t operate as a nucleophile, as pyridine does (p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_200">200</a>), as nucleophilic attack on acetic anhydride would be a non-reaction, simply regenerating starting materials. The only thing it can do is to remove the proton from the alcohol <i>as the reaction occurs</i>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You will see at once that there is a great disadvantage in this mechanism: the rate-determining step is termolecular&#8212;three molecules have to collide. This comes out most clearly in the entropy of activation, which has an enormous negative value&#8212;around &#916;S&#8225; = &#8211;168 J mol<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 K<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 for this reaction. For this reason, GBC or GAC reactions are normally effective only if one of the three molecules is present in large excess&#8212;this reaction might be done in ROH as a solvent, for example, so that ROH is always present. We would also expect a normal kinetic isotope effect for ROD compared with ROH as a bond to hydrogen is being formed and broken in the rate-determining step: it is <i>k</i><sub>H</sub><i>/k</i><sub>D</sub> = 2.4 here.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In understanding how this GBC works it is helpful to look at the mechanism without catalysis.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1057-03.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The acetate catalyst cannot remove a proton from the starting material but it can easily remove a proton from the intermediate, which has a complete positive charge on the alcohol oxygen atom. The starting material has a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> above the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of HOAc but the product has a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> well below it. Somewhere in the middle of the rate-determining step, the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the ROH proton passes through the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of acetic acid and then acetate is a strong enough base to remove it. The GBC is effectively deprotonating the transition state.<a class="page" id="page_1058">Page 1058, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">So how do we find GAC or GBC? Well, first we must remove the more powerful &#8216;specific&#8217; style of catalysis by working at constant pH because SAC or SBC depends on pH alone. If we find that the rate of the reaction changes with the concentration of a weak base at constant pH, we have GBC. The formation of three- and five-membered cyclic ethers shows the contrast between GBC and SBC. The formation of epoxides is straightforward SBC with a simple linear dependence on pH between pH 8 and 12, and no acceleration at constant pH by carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) ions. There is an inverse solvent isotope effect and an aryl substituent at the electrophilic carbon atom gives the small positive &#961; value expected for S<sub>N</sub>2 with an anion.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1058-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Formation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also faster at higher pH but, by contrast, is additionally accelerated by various bases at constant pH. If anions of phenols (ArO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) are used as catalysts, a Hammett &#961; value of +0.8 shows that electrons are flowing away from the aromatic ring. There is a small normal kinetic isotope effect <i>k</i><sub>H</sub><i>/k</i><sub>D</sub> = 1.4. Both SBC and GBC are therefore operating in this reaction. Here is the mechanism with ArO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> as GBC.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1058-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Why are the two different? The THF is easy to form, the transition state is unstrained, and only a little help is needed to make the reaction go&#8212;GBC will do. The epoxide is very strained indeed and the starting material needs to be raised in energy before cyclization will occur. Only the most powerful form of catalysis&#8212;SBC&#8212;is good enough.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">General acid catalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">GAC involves transfer of a proton from a weak acid (too weak to protonate the substrate completely) <i>during</i> the rate-determining step. A few examples will demonstrate to you how this works. They are all examples where GAC occurs because of a modification to a familiar reaction involving SAC.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In the first one, the termolecular problem (i.e. the fact that in GAC and GBC three molecules have to come together in the transition state) is avoided by making a reaction intramolecular. Normally, ester formation and hydrolysis are specific-acid-catalysed only, but here there is catalysis by a weak acid: acetic acid. A normal kinetic isotope effect <i>k</i>(HOAc)/<i>k</i>(DOAc) = 2.3 shows that proton transfer occurs in the rate-determining step and there is a large negative &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225; = &#8211;156 J mol<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 K<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1. This is GAC of nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group, admittedly in a rather special molecule.<a class="page" id="page_1059">Page 1059, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="maxbluea">
<p class="maxnoindentl" style="width:100%;">Nature often makes use of GAC and GBC since the catalysts required are compatible with the need to work at pH close to neutral. As in this example, enzymes manage to reduce the number of molecules required for GAC and GBC to operate by building the catalytic functional groups into their active sites.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> we emphasized the importance of the mechanism for the formation and hydrolysis of acetals. These are SAC reactions: alcohols are bad leaving groups and usually need to be fully protonated by strong acids before they will go, even with the help of the lone pair of another oxygen atom.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If we speed up the slow step by adding to the molecule some feature that stabilizes the cation intermediate, GAC may be found. One example is the aromatic cation formed in the hydrolysis of cycloheptatrienone acetals. The normal kinetic isotope effect announces the appearance of GAC.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Even adding one extra alkoxy group so that we have an orthoester instead of an acetal is enough. These compounds show catalysis with a variety of weak acids at not very acidic pH (5&#8211;6). As one OMe group is protonated, two others help in pushing it out, and they both help to stabilize the intermediate cation. Nature prefers these milder methods of catalysis, as we will see in <a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">For another contrast between SAC and GAC we need only refer you back to the two <i>Z/E</i> isomerizations earlier in the chapter. Isomerization of the diene is GAC&#8212;protonation at carbon is the slow step&#8212;and isomerization of the allylic alcohol is SAC. What we didn&#8217;t tell you earlier was that the GAC reaction has a normal kinetic isotope effect of <i>k</i>(H)/<i>k</i>(D) = 2.5 and a negative entropy of activation &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225; = &#8211;36 J mol<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 K<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1&#8212;just what we should expect for a bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining proton transfer from oxygen to carbon. Notice that the intermediate cation is the same whichever the route; only the ways of getting there, including the rate-determining steps, are different.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">The detection of intermediates</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In earlier chapters we revealed how some reactive intermediates can be prepared, usually under special conditions rather different from those of the reaction under study, as a reassurance that some of these unlikely looking species can have real existence. Intermediates of this kind include the carbocation in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>), the cations and anions in electrophilic (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) and nucleophilic (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>) aromatic substitutions, and the enols and enolates in various reactions of carbonyl compounds (Chapters 20, 25, and 26). We have also used labelling in this chapter to show that symmetrical intermediates are probably involved in, for example, nucleophilic aromatic substitution with a benzyne intermediate (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1060-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We have hedged this evidence around with caution since the fact that an intermediate can be prepared does not by any means prove that it is involved in a reaction mechanism. In this section we are going to consider other and better evidence for intermediates and at the same time revise some of the earlier material.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Trapping reactions</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">A more impressive piece of evidence is the design of a molecule that has built into it a functional group that could react with the intermediate in a predictable way but could not reasonably react with other species that might be present. For example, aromatic ethers react with nitrating agents in the <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> positions (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>). The intermediate has a positive charge delocalized over three of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring. If a nucleophilic group is built into the structure in the right way, it might trap this intermediate and stop it reacting further.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1060-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If we try drawing a mechanism for the formation of this remarkable compound, we discover that a necessary intermediate is also an intermediate in our preferred mechanism for aromatic nitration. The amide has trapped the cation we would propose as an intermediate in aromatic<a class="page" id="page_1061">Page 1061, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a> nitration, so we feel more confident about that mechanism. The product is an enol ether that will hydrolyse to the observed enone.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1061-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This mechanism explains everything, including the stereochemistry. The NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> attacks the aromatic ring <i>para</i> to the OMe group and on the opposite side to the amide. The amide is now in the perfect position to capture the cation at the <i>meta</i> position and, because the tether is short, it must form a <i>cis</i> bridge.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">To be convincing, evidence for an intermediate should include:</p>
<ul class="disc1" style="width:65%;text-align:left;">
<li><span class="maxblue2">&#8226;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;detection of the intermediate in the reaction mixture, perhaps by a trapping reaction</li>
<li><span class="maxblue2">&#8226;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;a demonstration that the intermediate gives the product when added to the reaction mixture (this also means that it must be prepared as an at least reasonably stable compound)</li>
<li><span class="maxblue2">&#8226;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;kinetic evidence that the rate of formation and rate of disappearance are adequate</li>
<li><span class="maxblue2">&#8226;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;other suitable evidence of the kind that we have been discussing in this chapter.</li>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A neat intramolecular trap for a benzyne works in this way. A standard benzyne-generating reaction, the diazotization of an <i>ortho-</i>amino benzoic acid (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>), gives a zwitterion that loses nitrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> to release the benzyne. A furan tethered to the next <i>ortho</i> position traps the benzyne in an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The yield is impressive and the trap is very efficient.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This reaction cannot really be explained without a benzyne intermediate. This same method of making benzyne is used on other <i>o</i>-amino benzoic acids and so we deduce that they presumably create benzynes too.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Particularly convincing evidence can develop when a number of chemists suggest the same intermediate for a number of different reactions and show that it is possible to trap the intermediate from one reaction, put it into the others, and get the normal products. We are going to describe one such set of related reactions. In <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> we suggested a mechanism for the Favorskii rearrangement involving a series of remarkable intermediates. Here is an example.</p>

If the reaction is run in MeOD instead of MeOH, the starting material becomes deuterated at the site of enolate formation, suggesting that this is a fast and reversible step. The entropy of activation for the reaction is &#916;<i>S</i>&#8225; = +64 J mol<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 K<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1, suggesting that the slow step is one molecule breaking into two. There is only one such step&#8212;the second, ionization step. If various substituted phenyl groups are used, the Hammett &#961; value is &#8211;5. This large negative value also suggests that the ionization is the slow step as the cation is delocalized into the benzene ring.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1062-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">There is evidence for the first intermediate&#8212;the exchange of deuterium from the solvent. In fact formation of the enolate can even become the rate-determining step. If we merely add an extra methyl group to the chloroketone the reaction becomes 220 times faster and the rate-determining step changes. There is no longer any exchange of deuterium from the solvent and the Hammett &#961; value changes from &#8211;5 to +1.4. This small positive value, showing some modest increase in electron density near the ring, matches typical known &#961; values for enolate formation.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">However, it&#8217;s not too surprising that an enolate ion is formed from a ketone in basic solution. The oxyallyl cation is a much more unusual species. How can we be convinced that it really is an intermediate? One way is to make it by an alternative route. If basic nucleophiles such as the methoxide ion are avoided and reaction of zinc with an &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-dibromoketone in a non-nucleophilic solvent like diglyme is used instead, the oxyallyl cation can be trapped in a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This is the basis for a good synthesis of seven-membered rings.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">But does the oxyallyl cation go on to give cyclopropanones? In fact, there is good evidence that the two are in equilibrium. If the same method is used to create the diphenyl oxyallyl cation in methanol instead of in diglyme, the normal Favorskii product is produced. Evidently, methoxide is needed only to produce the enolate&#8212;methanol alone is enough to decompose the cyclopropanone.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Further information comes from another reaction. If a suitable (1,3-di-<i>t</i>-butyl) allene is epoxidized with <i>m</i>-CPBA the unstable allene oxide can actually be isolated. On heating, this <a class="page" id="page_1063">Page 1063, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>epoxide gives a stable <i>trans</i>-di-<i>t</i>-butylcyclopropanone. It is very difficult to see how this reaction could happen except via the oxyallyl cation intermediate.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1063-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">But can the same cyclopropanone be an intermediate in the Favorskii reaction? If the bromoketone is treated with methoxide in methanol, it gives the Favorskii product, but if it is treated with a much more hindered base, such as the potassium phenoxide shown, it gives the same cyclopropanone.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1063-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Other, less stable, cyclopropanones&#8212;such as this 2,2-dimethyl compound&#8212;can be made by carbene addition (<a href="chapter_38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a>) to ketenes. This compound did the Favorskii reaction with methoxide in methanol: the only product came from the expected loss of the less unstable carbanion. This will, of course, be general acid catalysed by methanol as no free carbanion can be released into an alcoholic solvent.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1063-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The same cyclopropanone gives a cycloadduct with furans&#8212;this must surely be a reaction of the oxyallyl cation and we can conclude that the isomeric reactive intermediates are in equilibrium, and react to give products according to the conditions they find themselves in.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1063-04.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Although it is never possible to prove a mechanism, this interlocking network of intermediates, all known to be formed under the reaction conditions, all being trapped in various ways, and all known to give the products, is very convincing. If any part of the mechanism were not correct, that would throw doubt on all the other reactions as well.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Stereochemistry and mechanism</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Although we have left stereochemistry to the last, it is one of the most important tools in unravelling complex mechanisms. You have already seen how inversion of configuration is a vital piece of evidence for an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>) while retention of configuration is the best evidence for participation (<a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>). You have seen the array of stereo-chemical evidence for pericyclic mechanisms (Chapters 34 and 35). The chapters devoted to diastereoselectivity (32 and 33) give many examples where information about the mechanism follows from the stereochemistry. We shall not go over that material again, but summarize the types of evidence with new examples. The first example looks too trivial to mention.<a class="page" id="page_1064">Page 1064, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Retention or inversion?</h4>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1064-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Although this reaction looks like a simple S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement by the naphthyloxide anion on the primary alkyl chloride, there is, in fact, a reasonable alternative&#8212;the opening of the epoxide at the less hindered primary centre followed by closure of the epoxide the other way round. The electrophile is known as epichlorohydrin and has two reasonable sites for nucleophilic attack.</p>

</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It looks difficult to tell these mechanisms apart since both involve the same kind of reaction. Stereochemistry is the answer. If enantiomerically pure epichlorohydrin is used, the two mechanisms give different enantiomers of the product. Although each S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction takes place at a primary centre and the stereogenic centre remains the same, the products shown in orange and in brown are obviously enantiomers.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mechanism of this reaction also looks straightforward: normal ester hydrolysis followed by hydrolysis of the CCl<sub>3</sub> group to CO<sub>2</sub>H. Caution suggests investigation, particularly as four-membered lactones sometimes hydrolyse by S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement at the saturated ester carbon rather than by attack on the carbonyl group, like the three-membered lactones discussed in <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> (p. <a href="chapter_36.xhtml#page_934">934</a>). The solution was urgently needed when it was found that enantiomerically pure lactone could be prepared as a single enantiomer. The sequence was repeated with enantiomerically pure lactone: lactone hydrolysis occurred with retention of configuration and must be normal ester hydrolysis by attack of water at the carbonyl group. But the hydrolysis of the CCl<sub>3</sub> group surprisingly occurred with inversion of configuration.<a class="page" id="page_1065">Page 1065, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The answer must be a mechanism related to the one we have just seen for epichlorohydrin. Attack by hydroxide on CCl<sub>3</sub> is almost unknown and it is much more likely that intramolecular attack by alkoxide to give an epoxide should occur. The carboxylate anion can then invert the stereogenic centre by intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement. Notice that the tether ensures attack at the nearer end of the epoxide. The second four-membered lactone also hydrolyses by attack at the carbonyl group.</p>

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Another collection of related intermediates occurs in the Ritter reaction and the Beckmann fragmentation. The Ritter reaction involves the combination of a tertiary alcohol and a nitrile in acid solution and the proposed mechanism involves a series of intermediates.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The Beckmann fragmentation also occurs in acid solution on the fragmentation of an oxime with a tertiary alkyl group <i>anti</i> to the OH of the oxime. The fragmentation step gives the same cation and the same nitrile together with a molecule of water and these three combine in the same way to give the same amide. We need evidence that the carbocation and the nitrilium ion are genuine intermediates and that the same sequence is found in both reactions.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Evidence that the two reactions are intimately related comes from the formation of the same amide from two different starting materials: a tertiary alcohol and an oxime, both based on the decalin skeleton. The oxime has its OH group <i>anti</i> to the ring junction to minimize steric hindrance as oxime formation is under thermodynamic control (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1065-06.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The experiments also provide stereochemical evidence that a carbocation is an intermediate in both reactions. Both starting materials are <i>cis</i>-decalins but the product is a <i>trans-</i>decalin. The carbocation intermediate has no stereochemistry and can react with the nitrile from either face: since axial attack is preferred the product is the more stable <i>trans-</i>decalin. Here&#8217;s the mechanism for the Beckmann fragmentation:<a class="page" id="page_1066">Page 1066, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1066-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It is also possible to trap the carbocation in other ways. The Beckmann fragmentation of this oxime of an aryl seven-membered ring ketone gives a tertiary carbocation that might be expected to cyclize to give an amide. However, this reaction would give an unfavourable eight-membered ring (see <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>) and does not happen. Instead, the chain twists round the other way and forms a much more stable six-membered ring by intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In the Ritter reaction a rather different kind of evidence for the cation is the fact that families of isomeric alcohols all give the same product. In all these cases, rearrangements of the first-formed carbocation can easily account for the products. An example in the decalin series is this Ritter reaction with KCN as the nitrile in acidic solution so that HCN is the reagent. The starting material is a spirocyclic tertiary alcohol but the product is a <i>trans</i>-decalin formed by rearrangement.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Trapping the nitrilium cation is also possible. A famous example is the heterocycle (an oxazine, <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>) produced by intramolecular capture of the nitrilium ion with a hydroxyl group. Note that the tertiary alcohol reacts to give the cation while the secondary alcohol acts as the nucleophilic trap.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">An important example in which the diastereoisomer produced was critical in determining the mechanism is the synthesis of <i>cis</i>-aminoindanol, a part of Merck&#8217;s anti-HIV drug Crixivan (indinavir). The reaction involves treatment of indene epoxide with acetonitrile (MeCN) in acidic solution. The product is a <i>cis</i> fused heterocycle. It is easy to see which atoms have come from the nitrile (green) but the substitution of nitrogen for oxygen at one end of the epoxide has occurred with retention of configuration as the <i>cis</i>-epoxide has given the <i>cis</i> product. Clearly, we have some sort of Ritter reaction and the nitrilium ion has been trapped with an OH group.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;"><a class="page" id="page_1067">Page 1067, Chapter 39 Determining reaction mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the regioselectivity? The obvious explanation is that a cation is formed from the epoxide by a specific acid-catalysed ring opening. But why should the nitrile attack the bottom face of the cation? We should expect it to attack the top face preferentially as the hydroxyl group partly blocks the bottom face.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1067-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A reasonable suggestion is that the nitrile adds <i>reversibly</i> to the cation. Every time it adds to the top face, it drops off again as the OH group cannot reach round to form the heterocycle. But every time it adds to the bottom face (which may well be less often), it is quickly captured by the OH group because 5,5 fused rings are favourable when the ring junction is <i>cis.</i> Eventually, all the compound is converted to the heterocycle.</p>
