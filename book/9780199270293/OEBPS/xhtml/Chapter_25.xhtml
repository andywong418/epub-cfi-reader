<h2 class="h2">Carbonyl groups show diverse reactivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">In earlier chapters we discussed the two types of reactivity displayed by the carbonyl group. We first described reactions that involve nucleophilic attack on the carbon of the carbonyl, and in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> we showed you that these are among the best ways of making new C&#x2013;C bonds. In this chapter we shall again be making new C&#x2013;C bonds, but using <i>electrophilic</i> attack on carbonyl compounds: in other words, the carbonyl compound will be reacting as the nucleophile in the reaction. We introduced the nucleophilic forms of carbonyl compounds&#x2014; enols and enolates&#x2014;in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>. There you saw them reacting with electrophiles based on elements other than carbon, but they will also react well with carbon electrophiles provided the reaction is thoughtfully devised. Much of this chapter will concern that phrase, &#x2018;thought-fully devised&#x2019;.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg584_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Thought is needed to ensure that the carbonyl compound exhibits the right sort of reactivity. In particular, the carbonyl compound must not act as an electrophile when it is intended to be a nucleophile. If it does, it may react with itself to give some sort of dimer&#x2014;or even a polymer&#x2014;rather than neatly attacking the desired electrophile. This chapter will consider ways of avoiding unwanted nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl C=O bond.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, over the last four decades lots of thought has <i>already</i> gone into the problem of controlling the reactions of enolates with carbon electrophiles. This means that there are many excellent solutions to the problem: our task in this chapter is to help you understand which to use, and when to use them, in order to design useful reactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Some important considerations that affect all alkylations</h2>
<p class="noindent">The alkylations in this chapter will each consist of two steps. The first is the formation of a stabilized anion&#x2014;usually (but not always) an enolate&#x2014;by deprotonation with base.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_585" class="page">Page 585, Chapter 25: Alkylation of enolates</a>The second is a substitution reaction: attack of the nucleophilic anion on an electrophilic alkyl halide. All the factors controlling S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, which we discussed at length in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, are applicable here.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg585_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In each case, we shall take one of two approaches to the choice of base.</p>
<p class="blist" style="width:65%;margin-left:2em;"><span class="bbull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A strong base (with a conjugate acid of p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> greater than that of the carbonyl compound) can be chosen to <i>deprotonate the starting material completely.</i> There is complete conversion of the starting material to the anion before addition of the electrophile, which is added in a subsequent step.</p>
<p class="blist" style="width:65%;margin-left:2em;"><span class="bbull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Alternatively, a weaker base may be used <i>in the presence of the electrophile.</i> The weaker base will not deprotonate the starting material completely because its conjugate acid has a lower p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> than the carbonyl compound: only a small amount of anion will be formed, but that small amount will react with the electrophile. More anion is formed as alkylation uses it up.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-25em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg585_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure></aside>
<p class="indent1">The second approach is easier practically (just mix the starting material, base, and electrophile), but works only if the base and the electrophile are compatible and don&#x2019;t react together. With the first approach, which is practically more demanding, the electrophile and base never meet each other, so their compatibility is not a concern. We shall start with some compounds that avoid the problem of competing aldol reactions completely because they are not electrophilic enough to react with their own nucleophilic derivatives.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Nitriles and nitroalkanes can be alkylated</h2>
<p class="noindent">Problems that arise from the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group can be avoided by replacing C=O by functional groups that are much less electrophilic but are still able to stabilize an adjacent anion. We shall consider two examples, both of which you met in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Alkylation of nitriles</h3>
<p class="noindent">The nitrile group, which mirrors the carbonyl group in general reactivity, is much less easily attacked by nucleophiles (N is less electronegative than O). The anion formed by deprotonating a nitrile using strong base will not react with other molecules of nitrile but will react very efficiently with alkyl halides. The slim, linear structure of the anions makes them good nucleophiles for S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Phase transfer catalysis</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">This reaction is carried out in a two-phase mixture (water &#x002B; an immiscible organic solvent) to prevent the hydroxide and propyl bromide reacting together to give propanol. The hydroxide stays in the aqueous layer, and the other reagents stay in the organic layer. A tetraalkylammonium chloride (benzyltriethylammonium chloride BnEt<sub>3</sub>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) is needed as a <i>phase transfer catalyst to</i> allow sufficient hydroxide to enter the organic layer to deprotonate the nitrile.</p>

<p class="indent">The nitrile does not have to be deprotonated completely for alkylation: with sodium hydroxide only a small amount of anion is formed. In the example below, such an anion reacts with propyl bromide to give 2-phenylpentanenitrile.</p>

In this example the strong base, sodium hydride, was used to deprotonate the branched nitrile completely and benzyl chloride was the electrophile. The greater reactivity of benzylic electrophiles compensates for the poorer leaving group. In DMF, the anion is particularly reactive because it is not solvated (as you saw in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_255">255</a>, DMF solvates only the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation).</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Multiple alkylation</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">Multiple alkylation is not always desirable, and one of the side reactions in alkylations that are intended to go only once is the formation of doubly alkylated products. These arise when the first alkylation product still has acidic protons and can be deproto nated to form another anion, which may in turn react further. Clearly, this is more likely to be a problem if the base is present in excess and can usually be restricted by using only one equivalent of the electrophile.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg586_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">With two nitrile groups, the delocalized anion is so stable that even a weak, neutral amine (triethylamine) is sufficiently basic to deprotonate the starting material. Here double alkylation again takes place, in 100% yield: note that the electrophile is good at S<sub>N</sub>2, and the dipolar aprotic solvent DMSO (like DMF) cannot solvate the &#x2018;enolate&#x2019; anion, making it more reactive.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg586_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the electrophile and the nitrile are in the same molecule and the spacing between them is appropriate, then intramolecular alkylation entails cyclization to form rings. The preparation of a cyclopropane is shown using sodium hydroxide as the base and chloride as a leaving group. With an intramolecular alkylation, the base and the electrophile necessarily have to be present together, but the cyclization is so fast that competing S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution of Cl<sup>&#x2012;</sup> by HO<sup>&#x2012;</sup> is not a problem.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_587" class="page">Page 587, Chapter 25: Alkylation of enolates</a>Protons adjacent to a nitro group are in fact about as acidic as the same proton adjacent to two carbonyl groups; you can think of a nitro group as having double the electron-withdrawing power of a carbonyl group. Nitro-stabilized anions (&#x2018;nitronate anions&#x2019;) react with carbon electrophiles and a wide variety of nitro-containing products can be produced. The anions are not, of course, enolates, but replacing the nitrogen with a carbon should help you to recognize the close similarity of these alkylations with the enolate alkylations described later.</p>

<p class="indent">Surprisingly few simple nitroalkanes are commercially available but more complex examples can be prepared readily by alkylation of the anions derived from nitromethane, nitro-ethane, and 2-nitropropane. For example, deprotonation of nitropropane with butyllithium followed by the addition of butyl iodide gives 3-nitroheptane in good yield. This reaction really does have to be done in two steps: BuLi is not compatible with alkyl halides&#x0021;</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg587_3.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">Nitroalkanes can be alkylated in a single step with hydroxide as a base: phase transfer conditions (see p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_585">585</a>) keep the HO<sup>&#x2012;</sup> and the electrophile apart, preventing alcohol formation. The reaction below on the left works despite the quaternary carbon atom in the product. The reaction on the right gives a cyclic nitroalkane: now there really is no alternative: the base and electrophile must cohabit in the reaction mixture, so a weaker base such as potassium carbonate must be used&#x2014;hydroxide or amines are no good here because they would undergo substitution reactions with the halide.</p>

<p class="indent">The best base for making lithium enolates is usually LDA, made from diisopropylamine (<i>i</i>-Pr<sub>2</sub>NH) and BuLi. LDA will deprotonate virtually all ketones and esters that have an acidic proton to form the corresponding lithium enolates rapidly, completely, and irreversibly even at the low temperatures (about &#x2012;78&#x00B0;C) required for some of these reactive species to survive. Deprotonation occurs through a cyclic mechanism, which is illustrated below for ketones and esters. The basic nitrogen anion removes the proton as the lithium is delivered to the forming oxyanion.</p>

<p class="indent">Typical experimental conditions for reactions of kinetic enolates involve formation of the enolate at very low temperature (&#x2012;78&#x00B0;C) in THF. The strong base LDA is used to avoid self-condensation of the carbonyl compound but, while the enolate is forming, there is always a chance that self-condensation will occur. The lower the temperature, the slower the self-condensation reaction, and the fewer by-products there are. Once enolate formation is complete, the electrophile is added (still at &#x2012;78&#x00B0;C: the lithium enolates may not be stable at higher temperatures). The reaction mixture is then usually allowed to warm up to room temperature to speed up the rate of the S<sub>N</sub>2 alkylation.</p>

The increased separation of the metal cation from the enolate anion with the larger alkali metals leads to more reactive but less stable enolates. Typical very strong Na and K bases include the hydrides (NaH, KH) or amide anions derived from ammonia (NaNH<sub>2</sub>, KNH<sub>2</sub>) or hexamethyldisilazane (NaHMDS, KHMDS). The instability of the enolates means that they are usually made and reacted in a single step, so the base and electrophile need to be compatible. Here are two examples of cyclohexanone alkylation: the high reactivity of the potassium enolate is demonstrated by the efficient tetramethylation with excess potassium hydride and methyl iodide.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Alkylation of esters</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> you will meet the reaction of an ester with its own enolate: the Claisen condensation. This reaction can be an irritating side reaction in the chemistry of lithium ester enolates when alkylation is desired, and again it can be avoided only if the ester is converted entirely to its enolate under conditions where the Claisen condensation is slow. A good way of stopping this happening is to add the ester <i>to the solution of LDA</i> (and not the LDA to the ester) so that there is never excess ester for the enolate to react with. Another successful tactic is to make the group R as large as possible to discourage attack at the carbonyl group. Tertiary butyl esters are particularly useful in this regard because they are readily made, <i>t</i>-butyl is extremely bulky, and yet they can still be hydrolysed in aqueous acid under mild conditions by the method discussed on p. <a href="chapter_23.xhtml#page_556">556</a>.

<h3 class="h3">Alkylation of carboxylic acids</h3>
<p class="noindent">The lithium enolates of carboxylic acids can be formed if two equivalents of base are used: one to make the carboxylate anion and one to make the enolate. It is not necessary to use a strong base to remove the first proton but, since the second deprotonation requires a strong base such as LDA, it is often convenient to use two equivalents of LDA to form the dianion. With carboxylic acids, even BuLi can be used on occasion because the intermediate lithium carboxylate is much less electrophilic than an aldehyde or a ketone.</p>

Presumably in this case the aromatic ring helps acidify the benzylic protons to tip the balance towards deprotonation. Even with carboxylic acids, LDA would normally be the first base you would try.</p>

<p class="indent">The next alkylation of an acid enolate is of a carbamate-protected amino acid, glycine. As you saw in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, carbamate protecting groups are stable to basic reaction conditions. Three acidic protons are removed by LDA, but alkylation takes place only at carbon&#x2014;the site of the last proton to be removed. Alkylation gets rid of one of the negative charges, so that, if the molecule gets a choice, it alkylates to get rid of the least stable anion, keeping the two more<a id="page_590" class="page">Page 590, Chapter 25: Alkylation of enolates</a> stabilized charges. A good alternative to using the dianion is to alkylate the ester or nitrile and then hydrolyse to the acid.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Using specific enol equivalents to alkylate aldehydes and ketones</h2>
<p class="noindent">These side reactions mean that aldehyde enolates are not generally useful reactive intermediates. Instead, there are a number of aldehyde enol and enolate equivalents in which the aldehyde is present only in masked form during the enolization and alkylation step. The three most important of these specific enol equivalents are:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="bbull" style="margin-left:0.7em;">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;enamines</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;">You met these enolate equivalents briefly in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, and we shall discuss how to use them to alkylate aldehydes shortly. All three types of specific enol equivalent are useful not just with aldehydes, but with ketones as well, and we shall introduce each class with examples for both types of carbonyl compound.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_25.7.1">
<h3 class="h3">Enamines are alkylated by reactive electrophiles</h3>
<p class="noindent">Enamines are formed when aldehydes or ketones react with secondary amines. The mechanism is given in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>. The mechanism below shows how they react with alkylating agents to form new carbon&#x2012;carbon bonds: the enamine here is the one derived from cyclohex-anone and pyrrolidine. The product is at first not a carbonyl compound: it&#x2019;s an iminium ion or an enamine (depending on whether an appropriate proton can be lost). But a mild acidic hydrolysis converts the iminium ion or enamine into the corresponding alkylated carbonyl compound.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg591_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The overall process, from carbonyl compound to carbonyl compound, amounts to an enolate alkylation, but no strong base or enolates are involved so there is no danger of self-condensation. The example below shows two specific examples of cyclohexanone alkylation using an enamine. Note the relatively high temperatures and long reaction times: enamines are among the most reactive of neutral nucleophiles, but they are still a lot less nucleophilic than enolates.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg591_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_592" class="page">Page 592, Chapter 25: Alkylation of enolates</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The choice of the secondary amine for formation of the enamine is not completely arbitrary even though it does not end up in the final alkylated product. Simple dialkyl amines can be used but cyclic amines such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine are popular choices as the ring structure makes both the starting amine and the enamine more nucleophilic (the alkyl groups are &#x2018;tied back&#x2019; and can&#x2019;t get in the way). The higher boiling points of these amines allow the enamine to be formed by heating.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x03B1;-Bromo carbonyl compounds are excellent electrophiles for S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions because of the rate-enhancing effect of the carbonyl group (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>). The protons between the halogen and the carbonyl are significantly more acidic than those adjacent to just a carbonyl group and there can be a serious risk of an enolate nucleophile acting as a base. Enamines are only very weakly basic, but react well as nucleophiles with &#x03B1;-bromo carbonyl compounds, and so are a good choice.</p>

<p class="indent">The starting ketone here is unsymmetrical, so two enamines are possible. However, the formation of solely the <i>less</i> substituted enamine is typical. The outcome may be explained as the result of thermodynamic control: enamine formation is reversible so the less hindered enamine predominates. For the more substituted enamine, steric hindrance forces the enamine to lose planarity, and destabilizes it. The less substituted enamine, on the other hand, is rather more stable.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Note how the preference for the less substituted enamine is opposite to the preference for a <i>more</i> substituted enol: see p. <a href="chapter_20.xhtml#page_465">465</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">There is, however, a major problem with enamines: reaction at nitrogen. Less reactive alkylating agents&#x2014;simple alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, for example&#x2014;react to a significant degree at N rather than at C. The product is a quaternary ammonium salt, which hydrolyses back to the starting material and leads to low yields.</p>

<p class="indent">That said, enamines are a good solution to the aldehyde enolate problem. Aldehydes form enamines very easily (one of the advantages of the electrophilic aldehyde) and these are immune to attack by nucleophiles&#x2014;including, most importantly, the enamines themselves. Below are two examples of aldehyde alkylation using the enamine method. Both again use highly S<sub>N</sub>2-reactive electrophiles, and this is the main limitation of enamines.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Aza-enolates react with a wider range of S<sub>N</sub>2-reactive electrophiles</h2>
<p class="noindent">Enamines are the nitrogen analogues of enols and provide one solution to the aldehyde enolate problem when the electrophile is reactive. Imines are the corresponding nitrogen analogues of aldehydes and ketones: a little lateral thinking should therefore lead you to expect some useful reactivity from the nitrogen equivalents of enolates, known as aza-enolates. Aza-enolates are formed when imines are treated with LDA or other strong bases.</p>
<p class="indent">In basic or neutral solution, imines are less electrophilic than aldehydes: they react with organolithiums, but not with many weaker nucleophiles (they are more electrophilic in acid when they are protonated). So, as the aza-enolate forms, there is no danger at all of self-condensation.</p>

<p class="indent">Aza-enolate alkylation is so successful that it has been extended from aldehydes, where it is essential, to ketones, where it can be a useful option. Cyclohexanones are among the most electrophilic simple ketones and can suffer from undesirable side reactions. The imine from cyclohexanone and cyclohexylamine can be deprotonated with LDA to give a lithium aza-enolate.

The solution to this problem is to use silyl enol ethers, which are less reactive and so require a more potent electrophile to initiate reaction.

<p class="indent">These doubly stabilized anions are alkylated so well that it is common to carry out an alkylation between two carbonyl groups, only to remove one of them at a later stage. This is made possible by the fact that carboxylic acids with a &#x03B2;-carbonyl group decarboxylate (lose carbon dioxide) on heating. The mechanism below shows how. After alkylation of the dicarbonyl compound the unwanted ester is first hydrolysed in base. Acidification and heating lead to <a id="page_597" class="page">Page 597, Chapter 25: Alkylation of enolates</a>decarboxylation via a six-membered cyclic transition state in which the acid proton is transferred to the carbonyl group as the key bond breaks, liberating a molecule of carbon dioxide. The initial product is the enol form of a carbonyl compound that rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable keto form&#x2014;now with only one carbonyl group. Using this technique, &#x03B2;-keto-esters give ketones while malonate esters give simple carboxylic acids (both ester groups hydrolyse but only one can be lost by decarboxylation). Decarboxylation can occur only with a second carbonyl group appropriately placed &#x03B2; to the acid, because the decarboxylated product must be formed as an enol.</p>

The malonate ester is heated in a polar aprotic solvent&#x2014;usually DMSO&#x2014;in the presence of sodium chloride and a little water. No acid or base is required and, apart from the high temperature, the conditions are fairly mild. The scheme below shows a dimethyl malonate alkylation (note that NaOMe is used with the dimethyl ester) and removal of the methyl ester.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ketones are unique because they can have enolizable protons on both sides of the carbonyl group. Unless the ketone is symmetrical, or unless one side of the ketone happens to have no enolizable protons, two regioisomers of the enolate are possible and alkylation can occur on either side to give regioisomeric products.

<h3 class="h3">Thermodynamically controlled enolate formation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Selective enolate formation is straightforward if the protons on one side of the ketone are significantly more acidic than those on the other. This is what you have just seen with ethyl acetoacetate: it is a ketone, but with weak bases (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the conjugate acid &#x003C; 18) it only ever enolizes on the side where the protons are acidified by the second electron-withdrawing group. If two new substituents are introduced, in the manner you have just seen, they will always both be joined to the same carbon atom. This is an example of thermodynamic control: only the more stable of the two possible enolates is formed.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg599_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This principle can be extended to ketones whose enolates have less dramatic differences in stability. Since enols and enolates are alkenes, the more substituents they carry the more stable they are. So, in principle, even additional alkyl groups can control enolate formation under thermodynamic control. Formation of the more stable enolate requires a mechanism for equilibration between the two enolates, and this must be proton transfer. If a proton source is available&#x2014;and this can even be just excess ketone&#x2014;an equilibrium mixture of the two enolates will form. The composition of this equilibrium mixture depends very much on the ketone but, with 2-phenylcyclohexanone, conjugation ensures that only one enolate forms. The base is potassium hydride: it&#x2019;s strong, but small (and so has no difficulty removing the more hindered proton) and can be used under conditions that permit enolate equilibration.</p>

The value of this reaction now becomes clear because the usual way of making silyl enol ethers (Me<sub>3</sub>SiCl, Et<sub>3</sub>N) typically produces, from unsymmetrical ketones, the more substituted of the two possible ethers. Because the silyl enol ether (unlike the enolate itself) can be purified, fully regio-chemically pure enolates can be formed in this way.</p>

<p class="indent">One possible explanation for the thermodynamic regioselectivity in the enol ether-forming step is related to our rationalization of the regioselectivity of bromination of ketones in acid on p. <a href="chapter_20.xhtml#page_464">464</a>. Triethylamine is too weak a base (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of Et<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is about 10) to deprotonate the starting carbonyl compound (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> ca. 20), and the first stage of the reaction is probably an oxygen&#x2012;silicon interaction. Loss of a proton now takes place through a cationic transition state, and this is stabilized rather more if the proton being lost is next to the methyl group: methyl groups stabilize partial cations just as they stabilize cations.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">An alternative view is that reaction takes place through the enol: the Si&#x2013;O bond is so strong that even neutral enols react with Me<sub>3</sub>SiCl, on oxygen, of course. The predominant enol is the more substituted, leading to the more substituted silyl enol ether.</p>

The required <i>trans</i> stereochemistry is assembled in the key step, which gives a 78% yield of a product requiring only removal of the silyl ether and ester protecting groups. The organometallic nucleophile was prepared from a vinyl iodide by halogen-metal exchange (<a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). In the presence of copper iodide this vinyllithium adds to the cyclopentenone in a conjugate sense to give an intermediate enolate. Because in this case the starting enone already has a stereogenic centre, this step is also stereoselective: attack on the less hindered face (opposite the silyl ether) gives the <i>trans</i> product. The resulting enolate was alkylated with the allylic iodide containing the terminal ester: once again the <i>trans</i> product was formed. It is particularly vital that enolate equilibration is avoided in this reaction to prevent the inevitable E1cB elimination of the silyloxy group that would occur from the other enolate.

An additional consequence of adding a second electron-withdrawing group such as CO<sub>2</sub>Et is that the direct addition product is more hindered (and therefore less stable) than the conjugate addition product.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Enamines are convenient stable enol equivalents for conjugate addition</h2>
<p class="noindent">If you want a more reliable way of doing a conjugate addition of an aldehyde or ketone without having a second anion-stabilizing group, you need some stable and relatively unreactive enol equivalent. On p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_591">591</a> you saw how enamines, particularly those derived from cyclic secondary amines, are useful in alkylation reactions. These neutral species are also perfect for conjugate addition as they are soft nucleophiles but are more reactive than enols and can be prepared quantitatively in advance. The reactivity of enamines is such that heating the reactants together, sometimes neat, is all that is required. Acid catalysis can also be used to catalyse the reaction at lower temperature.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg608_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The mechanism is rather like enol addition. The differences are that the enamine is more nucleophilic because of the nitrogen atom and that the product is also an enamine, which can be converted into the corresponding carbonyl by mild acidic hydrolysis. This is usually performed during the work-up and so does not really constitute an extra step. The amine is washed out as the hydrochloride salt so isolation is straightforward. After conjugate addition the resulting enolate-iminium ion undergoes proton transfer rapidly to produce the more stable carbonyl-enamine tautomer. This is shown as an intramolecular process but it could just as easily be drawn with an external base and source of protons. The resulting enamine is then stable until aqueous acid is added at the end of the reaction. Hydrolysis occurs via the iminium ion to reveal the second carbonyl group and release the secondary amine.</p>

<p class="noindent">The best alternatives to enamines for conjugate addition of enols of aldehyde, ketone, and carboxylic acid derivatives are silyl enol ethers. These stable neutral nucleophiles react very well with Michael acceptors either spontaneously or with Lewis acid catalysts such as TiCl<sub>4</sub> at low temperature. If the 1,5-dicarbonyl compound is required, then an aqueous work-up with either acid or base cleaves the silicon&#x2013;oxygen bond in the product.</p>

<p class="indent">Addition of the silyl enol ether derived from acetophenone (PhCOMe) to a disubstituted enone promoted by titanium tetrachloride is very rapid and gives the diketone product in good yield even though a quaternary carbon atom is created in the conjugate addition.

<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">It is even possible to use a silyl enol ether to create a new C&#x2013;C bond that joins two new quaternary centres. Silyl ketene acetals (the silyl enol ethers of esters) are more nucleophilic than ordinary silyl enol ethers, and in this example the silyl ketene acetal undergoes conjugate addition to an unsaturated ketone catalysed by the usual Lewis acid (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) for such reactions.</p>

In many cases the anion liberated from the Lewis acid (Cl<sup>&#x2012;</sup>, RO<sup>&#x2012;</sup>, Br<sup>&#x2012;</sup>) is a good nucleophile for silicon so it is reasonable to assume that there is a free trimethylsilyl species (Me<sub>3</sub>SiX) that captures the titanium enolate:</p>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter so far you have seen that highly stabilized anions, such as those derived from &#x03B2;-dicarbonyl compounds, are particularly good at nucleophilic addition because their stability helps to reverse the unwanted alternative direct C=O addition (aldol) pathway and facilitates proton transfer in the catalytic version of the reaction. The nitro group is so powerfully electron-withdrawing that just one is equivalent to two carbonyls in p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> terms (p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_586">586</a>).
