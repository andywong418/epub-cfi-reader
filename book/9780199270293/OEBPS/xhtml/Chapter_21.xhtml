<h2 class="h2">Introduction: enols and phenols</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the last chapter you saw that many ketones have a nucleophilic &#x2018;alter ego&#x2019; known as an enol tautomer. Formation of the enol tautomer is catalysed by acid or by base, and because the ketone and enol are in equilibrium, enolization in the presence of D<sub>2</sub>O can lead to replacement of the protons in the &#x03B1; positions of ketones by deuterium atoms. This is what happens to pentan-3-one in acidic D<sub>2</sub>O:</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Because the enolization and deuteration process can be repeated, eventually all of the &#x03B1;-protons are replaced by deuterium.</p>
<p class="indent">The way this ketone is deuterated provides evidence that its enol form exists, even though the keto/enol equilibrium greatly favours the ketone form at equilibrium. In this chapter we shall be discussing similar reactions of a compound that exists entirely in its enol form. That very stable enol is phenol and its stability is a consequence of the aromaticity of its benzene ring.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg472-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The next spectrum is the proton NMR after shaking phenol with acidic D<sub>2</sub>O. Most of the peaks have almost disappeared because the H atoms have been replaced with D. Only one signal remains the same size, and even that is simplified because it has lost any coupling to adjacent protons it may have had previously.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg472-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The signal that remains is the 2H signal for the protons in the 3 and 5 positions of the aromatic ring, so the product must be the one shown in the margin. We can explain why by using the same mechanism we used with the ketone on the previous page. Phenol is deuterated in the same way as other enols, except that the final product remains in the very stable, aromatic, enol form rather than reverting to the keto form. The first step (after initial replacement of the OH with OD) is addition of D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to the enol.</p>

<p class="indent">Now this cation could lose the D from oxygen to leave a ketone (brown arrow below), or it could lose the proton from carbon to leave the phenol (orange arrows below).

It&#x2019;s not hard to see how the same process on the other side of the OH group replaces the proton at C-6. But how does the D at position 4 get there? The enol of phenol is conjugated, and we can push the curly arrows one stage further, like this:</p>

<h2 class="h2">Benzene and its reactions with electrophiles</h2>
<p class="noindent">We&#x2019;ll start with the most straightforward aromatic compound: benzene. Benzene is a planar symmetrical hexagon with six trigonal (sp<sup>2</sup>) carbon atoms, each having one hydrogen atom in the plane of the ring. All the bond lengths are 1.39 &#x00C5; (compare C&#x2013;C 1.47 &#x00C5; and C=C 1.33 &#x00C5;). All the <sup>13</sup>C shifts are the same (&#x03B4;<sub>C</sub> 128.5).</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The special stability of benzene (aromaticity) comes from the six &#x03C0; electrons in three molecular orbitals formed by the overlap of the six atomic p orbitals on the carbon atoms. The energy levels of these orbitals are arranged so that there is exceptional stability in the molecule (a notional 140 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> over a molecule with three conjugated double bonds), and the shift of the six identical hydrogen atoms in the NMR spectrum (&#x03B4;<sub>H</sub> 7.2) is evidence of a ring current in the delocalized &#x03C0; system.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Drawing benzene rings</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">Benzene is symmetrical and the structure with a circle in the middle best represents this. However, it is impossible to draw curly arrow mechanisms using this representation so we shall usually make use of the Kekul&#x00E9; form with three double bonds. This does not mean that we think the double bonds are localized&#x0021; It makes no difference which Kekul&#x00E9; structure you draw&#x2014;any mechanism can be equally well drawn using either.</p>

<a id="page_474" class="page">Page 474, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>
<p class="bindent">In substituted aromatic molecules such as phenol, the C&#x2013;C bond lengths in the ring are no longer exactly the same. However, it is still all right to use either representation, depending on the purpose of the drawing. With some aromatic compounds, such as naphthalene, it <i>does</i> matter which Kekul&#x00E9; structure you use as there is some alternation of bond lengths. Only the first Kekul&#x00E9; representation shows that the central bond is the strongest and shortest in the molecule and that the C1&#x2013;C2 bond is shorter than the C2&#x2013;C3 bond. And if a circle in a ring indicates six &#x03C0; electrons, then two circles suggests 12, even though naphthalene has only 10, making this representation less satisfactory too.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Electrophilic attack on benzene and on cyclohexene</h3>
<p class="noindent">Simple alkenes, including cyclohexene, react rapidly with electrophiles such as bromine or peroxy-acids (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). Bromine gives the product of <i>trans</i> addition, peracids give epoxides by <i>cis</i> addition. Under the same conditions benzene reacts with neither reagent.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg474-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Benzene can, however, be persuaded to react with bromine if a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl<sub>3</sub> is added. The product contains bromine but is not from either <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> addition.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> Lewis acids were described on p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_180">180</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg474-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The bromine atom has replaced an atom of hydrogen, so this is a substitution reaction. The reagent (Br<sub>2</sub>) is electrophilic and benzene is aromatic so the reaction is <b>electrophilic aromatic substitution</b>, the subject of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">We can compare the bromination of cyclohexene and of benzene directly.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg474-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The intermediate in both reactions is a cation but the first (from cyclohexene) adds an anion while the second (from benzene) loses a proton so that the aromatic system can be restored. Notice also that neutral bromine reacts with the alkene but the cationic AlCl<sub>3</sub> complex is needed to get reaction with benzene. Bromine itself is a very reactive electrophile. It is indeed a dangerous compound and should be handled only with special precautions. Even so it does not react with benzene. It is difficult to get benzene to react with anything.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">The intermediate in electrophilic aromatic substitution is a delocalized cation</h3>
<p class="noindent">We will return again and again to this mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution during this chapter. In its most general form the mechanism has two stages: attack by an electrophile to give an intermediate cation and loss of a proton from the cation to restore the aromaticity.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<a id="page_475" class="page" style="width:107%;">Page 475, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>
<img src="../images/pg475-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The cationic intermediate is, of course, unstable compared with the starting materials or the product. But it is nonetheless stabilized by delocalization. The arrows below show how the positive charge can be delocalized to the two <i>ortho</i> positions and to the <i>para</i> position, or can be drawn as a single delocalized structure with partial (dotted) bonds and about one-third of a positive charge (&#x002B;) at three atoms.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg475-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">It&#x2019;s very important to note that although it is delocalized, this cation is not aromatic: there is no cyclic array of p orbitals because the ring contains a single tetrahedral (sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized) carbon atom. We have emphasized this tetrahedral atom by drawing in the hydrogen atom at the point of substitution&#x2014;the one that will be lost when aromaticity is regained. We suggest that when you write mechanisms for electrophilic aromatic substitution you do the same. Given this loss of aromaticity, it is not surprising that formation of the cationic intermediate is the rate-determining step of an electrophilic aromatic substitution.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">How do we know the cationic intermediate exists?</h3>
<p class="noindent2">In strong acid, the electrophile is a proton and it is actually possible to observe this cationic intermediate. The trick is to pick a non-nucleophilic and non-basic counterion X<sup>-</sup>, such as SbF<sub>6</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>. In this octahedral anion, the central antimony atom is surrounded by the fluorine atoms with the negative charge spread over all seven atoms. The protonation is carried out using FSO<sub>3</sub>H and SbF<sub>5</sub> at &#x2013;120 &#x00B0;C. A similar trick was described in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> as a means to show the existence of simple carbocations as intermediates in the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/pg475-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bindent">Under these conditions it is possible to record the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of the cation. The shifts show that the positive charge is spread over the ring but is greatest (i.e. the electron density is least) at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions. Using the data for the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR shifts (&#x03B4;<sub>H</sub> and benzene &#x03B4;<sub>C</sub>, respectively), a charge distribution can be calculated that closely matches the predictions of the curly arrrows.</p>

In <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> you learned that any nucleophile, however weak, will react with a carbocation in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction: benzene rings are no exception.

<h2 class="h2">Electrophilic substitution on phenols</h2>
<p class="noindent">We started this chapter by comparing phenols with enols and now we return to phenols and look at electrophilic substitution in full detail. You will find that the reaction is much easier than it was with benzene itself because phenols are like enols and the same reactions (bromination, nitration, sulfonation, and Friedel&#x2013;Crafts reactions) occur more easily. There is a new question too: the positions round the phenol ring are no longer equivalent&#x2014;so where does substitution take place?</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Phenols react rapidly with bromine</h3>
<p class="noindent">Benzene does not react with bromine except with Lewis acid catalysis. Phenols react in a very different manner: no Lewis acid is needed, the reaction occurs very rapidly, and the product contains three atoms of bromine in specific positions. All that needs to be done is to add bromine dropwise to a solution of phenol in ethanol. Initially, the yellow colour of the bromine disappears but if, when the colour just remains, water is added, a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">Why do we use numbers for some descriptions, such as 2,4-dibromophenol, but also use <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> in others? The numbers are best in naming compounds but we need <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to describe the relationship between substituents. Phenol brominates in both <i>ortho</i> positions. In this molecule they happen to be positions 2 and 6. In other molecules, where the OH group is not at C1, they will have other numbers, but they will still <i>be ortho</i> to the OH group. Use whichever description suits the point you are making.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">The product shows that bromination has occurred at the <i>para</i> position and at both <i>ortho</i> positions. What a contrast to benzene&#x0021; Phenol reacts three times, without catalysis, at room temperature. Benzene reacts once, and needs a Lewis acid to make the reaction go at all. The difference is, of course, the enol nature of phenol. The non-bonding lone pair of electrons at oxygen contribute to a much higher-energy HOMO than the low-energy bonding electrons in a benzene ring. We should let our mechanism show this. Starting in the <i>para</i> position:</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Notice that we start the chain of arrows with the lone pair electrons on the OH group and push them through the ring so that they emerge at the <i>para</i> position to attack the bromine molecule. The benzene ring is acting as a conductor, allowing electrons to flow from the OH group to the bromine molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">Now the reaction is repeated, but this time at one of the two equivalent <i>ortho</i> positions:</p>

<p class="noindent2">A similar reaction with chlorine is used to make the well-known antiseptic TCP (2,4,6-trichlorophenol). The characteristic smell of TCP is typical of the smell of many other phenols.</p>

<img src="../images/pg479-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Again the lone pair electrons on the OH group are fed through the benzene ring to emerge at the <i>ortho</i> position. A third bromination in the remaining <i>ortho</i> position&#x2014;you could draw the mechanisms for this as practice&#x2014;gives the final product 2,4,6-tribromophenol.<a id="page_480" class="page">Page 480, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a></p>
<p class="indent">If you want to put just one bromine atom into a phenol, you must work at low temperature (&#x003C;5 &#x00B0;C) and use just one equivalent of bromine. The best solvent is the rather dangerously inflammable carbon disulfide (CS<sub>2</sub>), the sulfur analogue of CO<sub>2</sub>. Under these conditions, <i>para</i>-bromophenol is formed in good yield as the main product (which is why we started the mechanism for bromination of phenol in the <i>para</i> position). The minor product is <i>ortho</i>-bromophenol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg480-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The OH group is said to be <b><i>ortho, para</i>-directing</b> towards electrophiles. No substitution occurs in either <i>meta</i> position. We can understand this by looking at the curly arrow mechanisms or by looking at the molecular orbitals. In <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> (p. <a href="chapter_20.xhtml#page_453">453</a>) we looked at the &#x03C0; system of an enolate and saw how the electron density is located mainly on the end atoms (the oxygen and the carbon). In phenol it is the <i>ortho and para</i> positions that are electron-rich (and, of course, the oxygen itself). We can show this using curly arrows.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg480-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The curly arrows actually give an indication of the electron distribution in the HOMO of the molecule. The reason is that the HOMO has large coefficients at <i>alternate atoms,</i> just as the allyl anion had large coefficients at its ends but not in the middle (<a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">NMR can give us some confirmation of the electron distribution</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <sup>1</sup>H NMR shifts of phenol give us an indication of the electron distribution in the &#x03C0; system. The more electron density that surrounds a nucleus, the more shielded it is and so the smaller the shift (see <a href="chapter_13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>). All the chemical shifts for the ring protons in phenol are smaller than those for benzene (7.26 ppm), which means that overall there is greater electron density in the ring. There is little difference between the <i>ortho</i> and the <i>para</i> positions: these are where the electron density is greatest and hence these are the sites for electrophilic attack. The chemical shift at the <i>meta</i> positions is not significantly different from those in benzene&#x2014;this is where the electron density is lowest.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Making aromatic amines less reactive</h3>
<p class="noindent">The high reactivity of aniline can actually be a problem. Suppose we wanted to put just one bromine atom onto the ring. With phenol, this is possible (p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_480">480</a>)&#x2014;if bromine is added slowly to a solution of phenol in carbon disulfide solution and the temperature is kept below 5 &#x00B0;C, the main product is <i>para</i>-bromophenol.

<p class="indent">How then could we prevent oversubstitution from occurring? What we need is a way to make aniline less reactive by preventing the nitrogen lone pair from interacting so strongly with the &#x03C0; system of the ring. Fortunately, it is very simple to do this. In <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> (p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_175">175</a>) we saw how the nitrogen atom in an amide is much less basic than a normal amine because it is conjugated with the carbonyl group. This is the strategy that we will use here&#x2014;simply acylate the amine to form an amide. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of the amide are conjugated with the carbonyl group as usual but their delocalization into the benzene ring is weaker than in the amine. The amide nitrogen donates less electron density into the ring, so the electrophilic aromatic substitution is more controlled. The lone pair is still there, but its power is tamed. Reaction still occurs in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions (mainly <i>para)</i> but it occurs once only.</p>

<p class="noindent">Phenols and anilines react in the <i>ortho</i> and/or <i>para</i> positions for electronic reasons. These are the most important effects in deciding where an electrophilic substitution will occur on a benzene ring. When it comes to choosing between <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions we need to consider steric effects as well. You will have noticed that we have seen one <i>ortho</i> selective reaction&#x2014;the formation of salicylic acid from phenol&#x2014;and several <i>para</i> selective reactions such as the bromination of an amide just discussed.</p>
<p class="indent">If the reactions occurred merely statistically, we should expect twice as much <i>ortho</i> as <i>para</i> product because there are two <i>ortho</i> positions. However, we should also expect more steric hindrance in <i>ortho</i> substitution since the new substituent must sit closely beside the one already there. With large substituents, such as the amide, steric hindrance will be significant and it is not surprising that we get more <i>para</i> product.</p>

At the same time, the C&#x2013;O or C&#x2013;N &#x03C3; bond is polarized back towards the O or N atom&#x2014;in other words, they <i>donate</i> electron density to the &#x03C0; system but <i>withdraw</i> electron density from the &#x03C3; framework.

<h2 class="h2">Alkyl benzenes also react at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is what happens when toluene (methylbenzene) meets bromine:</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Toluene reacts 4000 times faster than benzene (this may sound like a lot, but the rate constant for <i>N,N</i>-dimethylaniline is 10<sup>14</sup> times greater), and the electrophile attacks mostly the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions. These two observations together suggest that the methyl groups may be increasing the electron density in the &#x03C0; system of the benzene ring, specifically in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions, rather like a weaker version of an OR group. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shifts for toluene (see margin) do suggest that there is slightly more electron density in the <i>para</i> position than in the <i>meta</i> positions. All the shifts are smaller than those of benzene (but not by much) and the shielding is much less than it is in phenols or anilines.</p>

<p class="indent">The methyl group donates electrons weakly by conjugation. In phenol, a lone pair on oxygen is conjugated with the &#x03C0; system. In toluene there is no lone pair but one of the C&#x2013;H &#x03C3; bonds can still interact with the &#x03C0; system in a similar way. This interaction is known as &#x03C3; <b>conjugation</b>. Just as the conjugation of the oxygen lone pair increases the electron density at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions, so too does &#x03C3; conjugation, but far less so.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x03C3; conjugation also means toluene&#x2019;s &#x03C0; electrons&#x2014;its HOMO&#x2014;become slightly higher in energy than those of benzene. It is best to regard alkyl benzenes as rather reactive benzenes, and to draw mechanisms using their &#x03C0; electrons as the nucleophile, like this:</p>

<p class="indent">Electrophilic attack occurs on alkyl benzenes so that the positive charge ends up on the carbon bearing the alkyl group. This carbon is tertiary, making the cation there more stable. This condition is fulfilled if toluene is attacked at the <i>ortho</i> position, as shown above, but also at the <i>para</i> position, because in both cases the positive charge is delocalized onto the same three carbons atoms.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;You are familiar with the idea that more substituted cations are more stable (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_335">335</a>) and that more substituted alkenes are more stable (<a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_394">394</a>). The effect we are discussing here is the same.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg484-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If, on the other hand, the electrophile were to attack at the <i>meta</i> position, the charge would end up delocalized over three carbon atoms, none of which are tertiary, so no stabilization by the alkyl group is possible. The situation is no worse than that of benzene, but given that toluene reacts some 10<sup>3</sup> times faster than benzene at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions these reactions win out. Nonetheless, unlike phenol, toluene does give trace amounts of <i>meta</i>-substituted products.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Electron-withdrawing substituents give <i>meta</i> products</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, all of the substituted benzene rings we have considered have carried substituents capable of donating electron density to the ring: despite being electronegative atoms, oxygen and nitrogen have lone pairs which conjugate with the ring&#x2019;s &#x03C0; system; a similar but weaker effect results from &#x03C3; conjugation from a methyl group. Two consequences arise from these substituents: the ring becomes more reactive than benzene, and substitution takes place in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions.</p>
<p class="indent">So what happens with groups which pull electron density away from the ring? Such a group is the trimethylammonium substituent: the nitrogen is electronegative but unlike in aniline this electronegativity is not offset by donation of a lone pair&#x2014;the nitrogen is tetrahedral and no longer has one to donate. Nitration of the phenyltrimethyl ammonium ion yields mainly <a id="page_487" class="page">Page 487, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>the <i>meta</i> product. And it does so slowly too&#x2014;this nitration proceeds about 10<sup>7</sup> times more slowly than that of benzene.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg487-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The same thing happens with the CF<sub>3</sub> group. The three very electronegative fluorine atoms polarize the C&#x2013;F bonds so much that the Ar&#x2013;C bond is polarized too. Nitration of trifluoro-methylbenzene gives a nearly quantitative yield of <i>meta</i> nitro compound.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg487-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Draw the mechanism for this reaction and you see the reason for the switch to <i>meta</i> selectivity.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg487-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The intermediate cation is again delocalized over three carbons, but importantly none of these carbons is the one next to the CF<sub>3</sub> group.</p>

<p class="indent">If, on the other hand, the electrophile were to attack the <i>ortho or para</i> position (the hypothetical reaction <i>para</i> to CF<sub>3</sub> is shown below) then the carbon next to CF<sub>3</sub> would <i>have</i> to carry a positive charge, which would be destabilized by the electron withdrawal, making this a high-energy intermediate.</p>

<p class="indent">Think of it this way: the electron-deficient ring would really rather not react with an electrophile (hence the slower rate) but if it has to (because the electrophile is so reactive) then it takes the least bad course of keeping the positive charge away from the electron-withdrawing groups&#x2014;and that means <i>meta</i> substitution.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.6.1">
<h3 class="h3">Some substituents withdraw electrons by conjugation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Aromatic nitration is important because it is a convenient way of adding a nitrogen substituent to the ring and because it stops cleanly after one nitro group has been added. Double nitration of benzene is possible but stronger conditions must be used&#x2014;fuming nitric acid instead of normal concentrated nitric acid&#x2014;and the mixture must be refluxed at around 100 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<p class="indent">The second nitro group is introduced <i>meta</i> to the first: evidently the nitro group is deactivating and <i>meta</i>-directing.</p>
<p class="indent">The nitro group is conjugated with the &#x03C0; system of the benzene ring and is strongly electron <i>withdrawing</i>&#x2014;and it withdraws electrons specifically from the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions. We can use curly arrows to show this:</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The nitro group withdraws electron density from the &#x03C0; system of the ring thereby making the ring less reactive towards an electrophile. Since more electron density is removed from the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions, the least electron-deficient position is the <i>meta</i> position. Hence the nitro group is <i>meta</i> directing. In the nitration of benzene, it is much harder to nitrate a second time and, if we insist, the second nitro group goes in <i>meta</i> to the first.</p>
<p class="indent">Other reactions go the same way: bromination of nitrobenzene gives <i>meta</i>-bromonitrobenzene in good yield. The combination of bromine and iron powder provides the necessary Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr<sub>3</sub>) while the high temperature needed for this unfavourable reaction is easily achieved as the boiling point of nitrobenzene is over 200 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<p class="indent">We&#x2019;ll come back to this table a few times in the next page or so, but the first thing to note is that <b>all the halobenzenes react more slowly than benzene itself</b>. Evidently, electron withdrawal by the electronegative halogen deactivates the ring towards attack. But the second thing that should strike you is that, unlike the deactivating groups we have just been discussing, <b>halogens are</b> <b>ortho, para</b> <b>directing</b>&#x2014;very few <i>meta</i>-nitrated products are formed.</p>
<p class="indent">The only way this makes sense is if there are two opposing effects: electron donation by conjugation and electron withdrawal by induction. The halogen has three lone pairs, one of which may conjugate with the ring just like in phenol or aniline. Yet the conjugation is much less good than in phenol or aniline, for one of two reasons. When Cl, Br, or I is the substituent, the problem is size: the 2p orbitals from the carbon atoms overlap poorly with the bigger p orbitals from the halogen (3p for chlorine, 4p for bromine, and 5p for iodine). This size mismatch is clearly illustrated by comparing the reactivities of aniline and chlorobenzene: <a id="page_490" class="page">Page 490, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>chlorine and nitrogen have approximately the same electronegativity, but aniline is much more reactive than chlorobenzene because of the better overlap between the carbon and nitrogen 2p orbitals. Fluorine 2p orbitals are the right size to overlap well with the carbon 2p orbitals, but now there is another problem: the orbitals of fluorine are much lower in energy than the orbitals of carbon since fluorine is so electronegative.</p>
<p class="indent">So, all four halogens are less good at donating electrons to the ring than an OH or NH<sub>2 </sub>group, but not only are the halobenzenes less reactive than phenol or aniline, they are even less reactive than benzene itself. Now, when we looked at aniline and phenol, we didn&#x2019;t worry about any electron withdrawal by induction, even though both oxygen and nitrogen are of course rather electronegative. Electron donation from their N and O lone pairs is evidently much more important. But with the conjugation in the halobenzenes already weak, inductive electron withdrawal takes over as the dominant factor in determining reactivity.</p>

<figure class="fig1">

</aside>
<p class="indent">With all this in mind, how would you expect fluorobenzene to react? Most electron density is removed first from the <i>ortho</i> positions by induction, then from the <i>meta</i> positions, and then from the <i>para</i> position. Any conjugation of the lone pairs on fluorine with the &#x03C0; system would increase the electron density in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions. Both effects favour the <i>para</i> position and this is where most substitution occurs. But is the ring more or less reactive than benzene? This is hard to say and the honest answer is that sometimes fluorobenzene is more reactive in the <i>para</i> position than benzene (for example, in proton exchange and in acetylation&#x2014;see later) and sometimes it is less reactive than benzene (for example, in nitration, as shown by the table above). In all cases, fluorobenzene is significantly more reactive than the other halobenzenes. We appreciate that this is a rather surprising conclusion, but the evidence supports it. For example, fluorobenzene reacts with bromine and an iron catalyst (it does need a catalyst: it is not as reactive as phenol) at only &#x2013;20 &#x00B0;C to give the <i>para-b</i>ro<i>mo</i> derivative.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#x2019;s now look back in bit more detail at the table above. We can now also explain two other features of the results:</p>
<p class="blist" style="width:67%;"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The percentage of the <i>ortho</i> product increases from fluorobenzene to iodobenzene. We might have expected the amount to decrease as the size of the halide increases because of increased steric hindrance at the <i>ortho</i> position but this is clearly not the case. Instead the greater inductive effect of the more electronegative atoms (F, Cl) withdraws electron density mostly from the <i>ortho</i> positions, lessening their reactivity.</p>
<p class="blist" style="width:67%;"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The rates of the reactions fall into two pairs and follow a &#x2018;U-shaped&#x2019; sequence: fluorobenzene nitrates most quickly, followed closely by iodobenzene; chloro-, and bromobenzene nitrate at around half these rates. Chlorine and bromine suffer because both are quite electronegative and neither has good lone pair overlap: in fluorine, overlap is good; in iodine, electronegativity is much less.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> We mentioned inductive effects as a factor controlling <i>ortho</i> vs <i>para</i> reactivity on p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_483">483</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent1">In practical terms, it is usually possible to get high yields <i>of para</i> products from electrophilic substitution reactions of halobenzenes. Both nitration and sulfonation of bromobenzene give enough material to make the synthesis worthwhile. Although mixtures of products are always bad in a synthesis, electrophilic aromatic substitution is usually simple to carry out on a large enough scale to make separation of the major product, ideally by crystallization, a workable method. A 68% yield of sodium <i>p</i>-bromobenzenesulfonate can be achieved by recrystallization of the sodium salt from water and a 70% yield of <i>p</i>-bromonitrobenzene by separation from the <i>ortho</i> isomer by recrystallization from EtOH.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Two or more substituents may cooperate or compete</h2>
<p class="noindent">The directing effects of two or more substituents can work with or against one another. Bromoxynil and ioxynil are contact herbicides especially used in spring cereals to control weeds resistant to other weedkillers, and both are synthesized from <i>p-</i>hydroxybenzaldehyde by double halogenation. The aldehyde directs <i>meta</i> and the OH group directs <i>ortho:</i> both effects work together to promote bromination or iodination at the same two positions.</p>

<p class="indent">In other cases substituents compete by directing to different positions. The antioxidant BHT (p. <a href="chapter_3.xhtml#page_58">58</a>) is made from 4-methylphenol (known as <i>p</i>-cresol) by a Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylation. Usually, both the methyl and OH groups are <i>ortho, para</i> directors. The <i>para</i> positions are obviously both blocked, but the positions <i>ortho</i> to each of the groups are different. Since the &#x2013;OH group is much more powerfully directing than the methyl group it &#x2018;wins&#x2019; and directs the electrophile (a <i>t</i>-butyl cation) <i>ortho</i> to itself.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">In this case the <i>t</i>-butyl cation is made from the alkene and protic acid; alternative reagents would be <i>t</i>-butanol with protic acid or <i>t</i>-butyl chloride with AlCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">When looking at any compound where competition is an issue it is sensible to consider electronic effects first and then steric effects. For electronic effects, in general, any activating effects are more important than deactivating ones. For example, the aldehyde below has three groups&#x2014;two methoxy groups that direct <i>ortho and para</i> and an aldehyde that directs <i>meta.</i></p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Despite the fact that the aldehyde group withdraws electron density from positions 2 and 6, C6 is still the position for nitration. The activating methoxy groups dominate electronically and the choice is really between C2, C5, and C6. Now consider steric factors: reaction at C2 or C5 would lead to three adjacent substituents. Substitution occurs at position 6.</p>

<p class="indent">We will consider some answers to these questions in this last section of this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.10">
<h2 class="h2">A closer look at Friedel&#x2013;Crafts chemistry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Reactions such as nitration and sulfonation add a very deactivating substituent. They usually stop cleanly after a single substitution unless there is also a strongly activating substituent. Even then it may be possible to stop after a single substitution. Weakly electron-withdrawing substituents like the halogens can be added once, but multiple substitution is common when the starting arene carries strongly activating substituents like OH and NH<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.10.1">
<h3 class="h3">Two reasons to avoid a Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylation</h3>
<p class="noindent">When electron-donating substituents are added, multiple substitution is always a threat. The principal reaction where multiple substitution is a genuine problem is the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylation reaction. Here&#x2019;s an example: preparation of diphenylmethane from benzene and benzyl chloride is a useful reaction but the product has two benzene rings, each more reactive than benzene itself. A 50% yield is the best we can do and that requires a large excess of benzene to ensure that it competes successfully for the reagent with the reactive, electron-rich product.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<a id="page_493" class="page" style="width:107%;">Page 493, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>
<img src="../images/pg493-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Multiple substitution is just one of the potential pitfalls of Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylations. The other is important to be aware of too: <b>Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylations work well only with stable cations</b>. This is what happens when we try a Friedel&#x2013;Crafts reaction with <i>n</i>-propyl chloride.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg493-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Recall from <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> that primary halides don&#x2019;t form cations easily, so the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts reaction with <i>n</i>-propyl chloride has to go via an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg493-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">So where does the major product of the reaction come from? The three carbons are arranged not as an <i>n</i>-propyl group but as an <i>iso</i>-propyl group: a <i>rearrangement has</i> occurred. This is the mechanism:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> We&#x2019;ll deal with rearrangements in much greater detail in <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg493-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The green hydrogen migrates to allow a secondary rather than a primary alkyl cation to be formed, and <i>iso</i>-propylbenzene results. This leaves us with a problem: how can you add primary alkyl groups to benzene rings?</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_21.10.2">
<h3 class="h3">The solution: use Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation instead</h3>
<p class="noindent">We can kill two birds with one stone here: both problems common to the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts alkylation are solved when the acylation is used instead. Firstly, the product of the acylation is a ketone: the reaction introduces a deactivating, electron-withdrawing, conjugating carbonyl group to the ring, so the product is <i>less</i> reactive than the starting material. Reaction will stop cleanly after one acylation. Here&#x2019;s benzene reacting with propionyl chloride.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> We introduced the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation on p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_477">477</a>.</p>

<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">If we want the ketone then all well and good. But a simple reduction also allows us to get the alkylated product&#x2014;this compound (trivially called propiophenone) is reduced to<a id="page_494" class="page">Page 494, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a> propylbenzene using any of a number of reduction methods, for example zinc amalgam in hydrochloric acid.</p>

In an acylation, however, the Lewis acid can also complex to any oxygen atoms present, to the carbonyl in the product, for example. As a result, in acylation reactions more Lewis acid is required&#x2014;just over one equivalent per carbonyl group.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Reduction of the ketone can give a simpler carboxylic acid, but we can go one step further and do another acylation&#x2014;because the reaction is intramolecular, it goes even with just a strong acid (phosphoric acid): the strong acid makes the OH into a good leaving group (water) and the acylium ion is again an intermediate.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Exploiting the chemistry of the nitro group</h2>
<p class="noindent">The nitro group is remarkably useful in a number of ways:</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;It is easy to introduce by nitration chemistry (p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_476">476</a>).</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Unlike most N- or O-based functional groups, it is a <i>meta</i> director (p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_488">488</a>).</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;It can be reduced to an amino group.</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;It can be replaced with other substituents using diazonium chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_495" class="page">Page 495, Chapter 21: Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You have met the first two of these features, but the last two may be new to you. An aromatic nitro group is easy to turn into an amino group&#x2014;a number of reagents will do this, but the most common are tin in dilute HCl or hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst supported on charcoal (written as Pd/C).</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This simple transformation is extremely important because it turns the <i>meta</i>-directing nitro group into an <i>ortho, para</i>-directing amino group (although as you saw on p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_483">483</a>, the amino group may need &#x2018;taming&#x2019; to make its reactivity useful). The sequence of nitration&#x2013;reduction allows us to introduce a useful NH2 equivalent into an aromatic molecule, and can let us make otherwise difficult-to-form <i>meta</i>-substituted amino compounds.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg495-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reduction to an amino group also opens up the possibility of replacing the nitrogen substituent completely, by converting it first to a diazonium group. Treatment of an amine with nitrous acid converts it to an unstable diazonium salt, whose mechanism of formation and chemistry we will discuss in the next chapter. Not surprisingly, diazonium salts very readily lose nitrogen gas, and this substitution of N<sub>2</sub> by a nucleophile opens yet more opportunities to compounds derived from nitrobenzene derivatives. It also involves <i>nucleophilic</i> substitution at the aromatic ring, which forms the subject of the next chapter.</p>
