<h2 class="h2">Alkenes react with bromine</h2>
<p class="noindent">Bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>) is brown, and one of the classic tests for alkenes is that they turn a brown aqueous solution of bromine colourless. Alkenes decolourize bromine water: alkenes react with bromine. The product of the reaction is a dibromoalkane, and the reaction on the right shows what happens with the simplest alkene, ethylene (ethene).</p>

<p class="indent">In order to understand this reaction, and the other similar ones you will meet in this chapter, you need to think back to <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, where we started talking about reactivity in terms of nucleophiles and electrophiles. As soon as you see a new reaction, you should immediately think to yourself, &#x2018;Which reagent is the nucleophile; which reagent is the electrophile?&#x2019; Evidently, neither the alkene nor bromine is charged, but Br<sub>2</sub> has a low-energy empty orbital (the Br&#x2212;Br &#x03C3;*), and is therefore an electrophile. The Br&#x2212;Br bond is exceptionally weak, and bromine reacts with many nucleophiles like this.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_427_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the reaction with ethylene, the alkene must be the nucleophile, and its HOMO is the C&#x003D;C &#x03C0; bond. Other simple alkenes are similarly electron-rich and they typically act as <i>nucleophiles</i> and attack <i>electrophiles</i>.</p>

But what will that product be? Look at the orbitals involved.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_428_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The highest electron density in the &#x03C0; orbital is right in the middle, between the two carbon atoms, so this is where we expect the bromine to attack. The only way the &#x03C0; HOMO can interact in a bonding manner with the &#x03C3;* LUMO is if the Br<sub>2</sub> approaches end-on&#x2014;and this is how the product forms. The symmetrical three-membered ring product is called a bromo- nium ion.</p>

<h3 class="ch4">Chloramines</h3>
<p class="noindent2">Have you ever wondered why conventional wisdom (and manu facturers&#x2019; labels) warns against mixing different types of cleaning agent? The danger arises from nucleophilic attack on another electrophilic halogen, chlorine. Some cleaning solutions contain chlorine (bleach, to kill moulds and bacteria, usually for the bathroom) while others contain ammonia (to dissolve fatty deposits, usually for the kitchen). Ammonia is nucleophilic, chlorine electrophilic, and the products of their reaction are the highly toxic and explosive chloramines NH<sub>2</sub>Cl, NHCl<sub>2</sub>, and NCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is a problem with this representation: because only one pair of electrons is moving, we can&#x2019;t form two new C&#x2013;Br bonds. We should really then represent the C&#x2013;Br bonds as partial bonds. Yet the bromonium ion is a real intermediate with two proper C&#x2013;Br bonds (the box in the margin presents evidence of this). So an alternative way of drawing the arrows is to involve a lone pair on bromine.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_428_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We think the first way represents more accurately the key orbital interaction involved, and we shall use that one, but the second is acceptable too.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the <i>final</i> product of the reaction isn&#x2019;t the bromonium ion. The second step of the reaction follows on at once: the bromonium ion is itself an electrophile, and it reacts with the bromide ion lost from the bromine in the addition step. We can now draw the correct mechanism for the whole reaction, which is termed electrophilic addition to the double bond, because bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>) is an electrophile. Overall, the molecule of bromine <i>adds across</i> the double bond of the alkene.</p>

<p class="indent">Attack of Br on a bromonium ion is a normal S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution&#x2014;the key orbitals involved are the HOMO of the bromide and the &#x03C3;* of one of the two carbon&#x2013;bromine bonds in the strained three-membered ring. As with all S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, the nucleophile maintains maximal overlap with the &#x03C3;* by approaching in line with the leaving group but from the opposite side, result-ing in inversion at the carbon that is attacked. The stereochemical outcome of more complicated reactions (discussed below) is important evidence for this overall reaction mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">You may wonder why the bromine attacks a carbon atom in the bromonium ion rather than the positively charged bromine atom. Well, in fact, it can do this as well, but the result is just regeneration of bromine and the alkene: the first step of the reaction is reversible.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Another way of thinking about bromonium ions</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the bromonium ion as a carbocation that has been stabilized by interaction with a nearby bromine atom. You have seen a similar effect with oxygen&#x2014;this &#x2018;oxonium ion&#x2019; was an intermediate, for example, in the S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution of MOM chloride on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_338">338</a> of <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The bromine is one atom further away but, with bromine being lower in the periodic table and having more diffuse lone pairs, it can have a similar stabilizing effect, despite the angle strain in a three-membered ring.</p>
<p class="indent">The two types of stabilization are not equivalent: the cation and the bromonium ion are different molecules with different shapes, while the two representations of the oxonium ion are just that&#x2014;they aren&#x2019;t different molecules. This stabilization of an adjacent cationic centre by a heteroatom with at least one lone pair to form a three-membered ring intermediate is not restricted to bromine or the other halogens, but is also an important aspect of the chemistry of compounds containing oxygen, sulfur, or selenium, as you will see in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Oxidation of alkenes to form epoxides</h2>
<p class="noindent">The electrophilic addition of bromine to alkenes is an oxidation. The starting alkene is equivalent in oxidation level to an alcohol, but the product has two carbons at the alcohol oxidation level&#x2014;the elimination reactions of dibromides to give alkynes that you met in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a> (p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_398">398</a>) should convince you of this. There are a number of other oxidants containing electro- philic oxygen atoms that react with nucleophilic alkenes to produce epoxides (oxiranes). You can view epoxides as the oxygen analogues of bromonium ions, but unlike most bromonium ions they are quite stable.</p>

<p class="indent">The simplest epoxide, ethylene oxide (or oxirane itself), can be produced on the tonne scale by the direct oxidation of ethene with oxygen at high temperature over a silver catalyst. These conditions are hardly suitable for general laboratory use, and the most commonly used epoxi- dizing agents are peroxy-carboxylic acids. These peroxy-acids (or peracids) have an extra oxygen atom between the carbonyl group and their acidic hydrogen&#x2014;they are esters of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). They are rather less acidic than carboxylic acids because their conjugate base is no longer stabilized by delocalization into the carbonyl group. But they are electrophilic at the oxygen shown here in green because attack there by a nucleophile displaces carboxylate, a good leaving group. The LUMO of a peroxy-carboxylic acid is the &#x03C3;* orbital of the weak O&#x2013;O bond.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Making peroxy-acids</h3>
<p class="c_noindent">Peroxy-acids are prepared from the corresponding acid anhydride and high-concentration hydrogen peroxide. In general, the stronger the parent acid, the more powerful the oxidant (because the carboxylate is a better leaving group): one of the most powerfully oxidizing peroxy-acids is peroxy-trifluoroacetic acid. Hydrogen peroxide, at very high concentrations (&#x003E; 80&#x0025;), is potentially explosive and difficult to transport.</p>

The essence of the mechanism is attack by the &#x03C0; orbital of the alkene on the weak, polarized, electrophilic O&#x2013;O bond, which we can represent most simply as shown in the margin. But, in the real reaction, a proton (shown in brown in this mechanism) has transferred from the epoxide oxygen to the carboxylic acid by-product. You can represent this all in one step if you draw the arrows carefully. Start with the nucleo- philic &#x03C0; bond: send the electrons on to oxygen, breaking O&#x2013;O and forming a new carbonyl bond. Use those electrons to pick up the proton, and use the old C&#x2013;H bond&#x2019;s electrons to make the second new C&#x2013;O bond. Don&#x2019;t be put off by the spaghetti effect&#x2014;each arrow is quite logical when you think the mechanism through.

<h3 class="h2">More substituted alkenes epoxidize faster</h3>
<p class="noindent">Peracids give epoxides from alkenes with any substitution pattern (except ones conjugated with electron-withdrawing groups, for which a different reagent is required: see <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>), but the chart below shows how the rate varies according to the number of substituents on the double bond.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent">Not only are more substituted double bonds more stable (as you saw in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>), but they are more nucleophilic. We showed you in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> that alkyl groups are electron-donating because they stabilize carbocations. This same electron-donating effect raises the energy of the HOMO of a double bond and makes it more nucleophilic. You can think of it this way: every C&#x2013;C or C&#x2013;H bond that can allow its &#x03C3; orbital to interact with the &#x03C0; orbital of the alkene will raise the HOMO of the alkene slightly, as shown by the energy level diagram. The more substituents the alkene has, the more the energy is raised.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_431_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The differences in reactivity between alkenes of different substitution patterns can be exploited to produce the epoxide only of the more reactive alkene of a pair, provided the supply of oxidant is limited. In the first example below, a tetrasubstituted alkene reacts in preference to a cis disubstituted one. Even when two alkenes are equally substituted, the effect of epoxidizing one of them is to reduce the nucleophilicity of the second (the new oxygen atom is electron-withdrawing, and dienes are in general more nucleophilic than alkenes: see below). The monoepoxide of cyclopentadiene is a useful intermediate and can be prepared by direct epoxidation of the diene under buffered conditions.</p>

Some chemists in the USA decided to synthesize this epoxide to investigate its reaction with DNA, hoping to discover exactly how it causes cancer.

But in the addition reactions of other electrophiles, H&#x2013;Br for example, there is a choice: which carbon gets the H and which gets the Br? You will need to be able to predict, and to explain, reactions of unsymmetrical alkenes with HBr, but we should start by looking at the reaction with a symmetrical alkene&#x2014;cyclohexene. This is what happens. When H&#x2013;Br reacts as an electrophile, it is attacked at H, losing Br<sup>-</sup>. Unlike a bromine atom, a hydrogen atom can&#x2019;t form a three-membered ring cation&#x2014;it has no lone pairs to use. So electrophilic addition of a proton (which is what this is) to an alkene gives a product best represented as a carbocation. This carbocation rapidly reacts with the bromide ion just formed. Overall, H&#x2013;Br adds across the alkene. This is a useful way of making simple alkyl bromides.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_433_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Here are two more syntheses of alkyl bromides, but this time we need to ask our question about which end of the alkene is attacked because the alkenes are unsymmetrical (they have different substituents at each end). First, the results.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_433_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In each case, the bromine atom ends up on the more substituted carbon, and the mecha-nism explains why. There are two possible outcomes for protonation of styrene by HBr, but you should immediately be able to spot which is preferred, even if you don&#x2019;t know the outcome of the reaction. Protonation at one end gives a stabilized benzylic cation, with its positive charge delocalized into the benzene ring.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_433_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Protonation at the other end would give a highly unstable primary cation, and therefore does not take place.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_433_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You get the same result with isobutene (2-methylpropene): the more stable tertiary cation leads to the product; the alternative primary cation is not formed.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Markovnikov&#x2019;s rule</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">There is a traditional guideline called Markovnikov&#x2019;s rule for electrophilic additions of H&#x2013;X to alkenes, which can be stated as: &#x2018;The hydrogen ends up attached to the carbon of the double bond that had more hydrogens to start with.&#x2019; We don&#x2019;t suggest you learn this rule, although you may hear it referred to. As with all &#x2018;rules&#x2019; it is much more important to understand the reason behind it. For example, <i>you</i> can now predict the product of the reaction below. With all due respect, Markovnikov couldn&#x2019;t.</p>
<figure class="fig2">

</div>
<p class="indent">The protonation of alkenes to give carbocations is quite general. The carbocations may trap a nucleophile, as you have just seen, or they may simply lose a proton to give back an alkene. This is just the same as saying the protonation is reversible, but it needn&#x2019;t be the same proton that is lost. A more stable alkene may be formed by losing a different proton, which means that acid can catalyse the isomerization of alkenes&#x2014;both between <i>Z</i> and <i>E</i> geometrical isomers and between regioisomers.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_434_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">E1 and isomerization</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">The isomerization of alkenes in acid is probably a good part of the reason why E1 eliminations in acid generally give <i>E</i> alkenes. In <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a> we explained how <i>kinetic</i> control could lead to <i>E</i> <i>Z</i> alkenes: interconversion of E and Zalkenes under the conditions of the reaction allows the <i>thermodynamic</i> product to prevail.

<h2 class="h2">Electrophilic addition to dienes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Earlier in the chapter you saw the epoxidation of a diene to give a monoepoxide: only one of the double bonds reacted. This is quite a usual observation: dienes are more nucleophilic than isolated alkenes. This is easy to explain by looking at the relative energy of the HOMO of an alkene and a diene&#x2014;this discussion is on p. <a href="chapter_6.xhtml#page_138">138</a> of <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. Dienes are therefore very susceptible to protonation by acid to give a cation. This is what happens when 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is treated with acid. Protonation gives a stable delocalized allylic cation.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_435_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Why protonate this double bond and not the other one? The cation you get by protonating the other double bond is also allylic, but it cannot benefit from the additional stabilization from the methyl group because the positive charge is not delocalized on to the carbon carry-ing the methyl.</p>
<p class="indent">If the acid is HBr, then nucleophilic attack by Br on the cation follows. The cation is attacked at the less hindered end to give the important compound prenyl bromide. This is very much the sort of reaction you met in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>&#x2014;it is the second half of an S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution reaction on an allylic compound.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_435_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Overall, the atoms H and Br are added to the ends of the diene system. The same appears to be the case when dienes are brominated with Br<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_435_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Changing the conditions slightly gives a different outcome. If the reaction is done at lower temperatures, the bromine just adds across one of the double bonds to give a 1,2-dibromide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_435_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This compound turns out to be the kinetic product of the bromination reaction. The 1,4-dibromide is formed only when the reaction is heated, and is the thermodynamic product. The mechanism is electrophilic attack on the diene to give a bromonium ion, which bromide opens to give the dibromide. We have shown the bromide attacking the more substituted end of the bromonium ion&#x2014;although we can&#x2019;t know this for sure (attack at either end gives the same product), you are about to see (in the next section) evidence that this is the usual course of reactions of unsymmetrical bromonium ions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<a id="page_436" class="page" style="width:107%;">Page 436, Chapter 19: Electrophilic addition to alkenes</a>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This 1,2-dibromide can still react further because it can undergo nucleophilic substitution. Bromide is a good nucleophile and a good leaving group and, with an allylic system like this, an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction can take place in which both the nucleophile and the leaving group are bro-mide. The intermediate is a cation, but here the carbocation is disguised as the bromonium ion because bromine&#x2019;s lone pair can help stabilize the positive charge. Bromide can attack where it left, returning to starting material, but it can also attack the far end of the allylic system, giving the 1,4-dibromide. The steps are all reversible at higher temperatures, so the fact that the 1,4-dibromide is formed under these conditions must mean it is more stable than the 1,2-dibromide. It is not hard to see why: it has a more substituted double bond and the two large bromine atoms are further apart.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:2em;">
<img src="../images/pg_436_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">But when a bromination is done in a nucleophilic solvent&#x2014;water or methanol, for example&#x2014;solvent molecules compete with the bromide to open the bromonium ion. As you know, alcohols are much worse nucleophiles than bromide but, because the concentration of solvent is so high (remember&#x2014;the concentration of water in water is 55 M), the solvent gets there first most of the time. This is what happens when isobutene is treated with bromine in methanol. An ether is formed by attack of methanol only at the <i>more substituted</i> end of the bromonium ion. When a functional group can react in more than one position, the choice is known as the <i>regioselectivity</i> of the reaction. We will return to the concept of regioselectivity in <a href="chapter_24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Methanol is attacking the bromonium ion where it is most hindered, so there must be some effect at work more powerful than steric hindrance. One way of looking at this is to reconsider our assumption that bromonium ion opening is an S<sub>N</sub>2 process. Here, it hardly looks S<sub>N</sub>2. We have a tertiary centre, so naturally you expect S<sub>N</sub>1, via the cation below. But we have already said that cations like this can be stabilized by formation of the three-membered bromonium ion and, if we let this happen, we have to attack the bromonium ion, which gets us back to where we started: an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism&#x0021;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer to the conundrum is that substitution reactions don&#x2019;t always go by pure S<sub>N</sub>1 or pure S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms: sometimes the mechanism is somewhere in between. Perhaps the leaving group starts to leave, creating a partial positive charge at carbon, which is intercepted by the nucleophile. This provides a good explanation of what is going on here. The bromine begins to leave and a partial positive charge builds up at carbon. The departure of bromine can get to a more advanced state at the tertiary end than at the primary end because the substituents stabilize the build-up of positive charge. A more accurate representation of this bromonium ion is shown in the margin, with one C&#x2013;Br bond longer than the other and more polarized than the other.</p>

<p class="indent">The nucleophile now has a choice: does it attack the more accessible, primary end of the bromonium ion, or does it attack the more charged end with the weaker C&#x2013;Br bond? Here, the latter is clearly the faster reaction. The transition state has considerable positive charge on carbon and is known as a loose S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state.</p>

<p class="indent">The products of bromination in water are called bromohydrins. They can be treated with base, which deprotonates the alcohol.

<p class="bnoindent">The pattern you saw for epoxidation with peracids (more substituted alkenes react faster) is followed by bromination reactions too. The bromonium ion is a reactive intermediate, so the rate-determining step of the brominations is attack of bromine. The scale below shows the effect on the rate of reaction with bromine in methanol of increasing the number of alkyl substituents from none (ethylene) to four. Each additional alkene substituent produces an enormous increase in rate. The degree of branching (Me versus <i>n</i>-Bu versus <i>t</i>-Bu) within the substituents has a much smaller, negative effect (probably of steric origin) as does the geometry (<i>E</i> versus <i>Z</i>) and substitution pattern (1,1-disubstituted versus 1,2-disubstituted) of the alkene.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although epoxides, like bromonium ions, contain strained three-membered rings, they require either acid catalysis or a powerful nucleophile to react well. Compare these two reac-tions of a 1,1,2-trisubstituted epoxide. They are nucleophilic substitutions related to those we introduced in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_352">352</a>) but in that chapter we carefully avoided discussing epoxides of the unsymmetrical variety. In this example, the regiochemistry reverses with the reaction conditions. Why?</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Alkoxides are never leaving groups in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions: it&#x2019;s the strain alone which makes epoxides reactive.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">We&#x2019;ll start with the acid-catalysed reaction because it is more similar to the examples we have just been discussing&#x2014;opening happens at the more substituted end. Protonation by acid produces a positively charged intermediate that bears a passing resemblance to the corresponding bromonium ion. The two alkyl groups make possible a build-up of charge on the carbon at the tertiary end of the protonated epoxide, and methanol attacks here, just as it does in the bromonium ion. You could think of the protonated leaving group &#x2018;pulling&#x2019; the otherwise unreactive methanol in towards the reactive centre.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_438_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In base there can be no protonation of the epoxide and no build-up of positive charge. Without protonation, the epoxide oxygen is a poor leaving group, and leaves only if &#x2018;pushed&#x2019; by a strong nucleophile: the reaction becomes pure S<sub>N</sub>2. Steric hindrance becomes the controlling factor and methoxide attacks only the primary end of the epoxide.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="bnoindent">This example makes the matter look deceptively clear cut. But with epoxides, regioselectivity is not as simple as this because, even with acid catalysts, S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution at a primary centre is fast. For example, Br<sup>-</sup> in acid attacks the epoxide below mainly at the less substituted end, and only 24&#x0025; of the product is produced by the &#x2018;cation-stabilized&#x2019; pathway. It is very difficult to override the preference of epoxides unsubstituted at one end to react at that end.</p>
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_438_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bnoindent">For most substitution reactions of epoxides, then, regioselectivity is much higher if you give in to the epoxide&#x2019;s desire to open at the less substituted end and enhance it with a strong nucleophile under basic conditions.</p>

<h3 class="ch3"><i>N</i>-Bromosuccinimide, NBS</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">The reagent used to form the bromonium ion here is called <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide, or NBS for short. Unlike the noxious brown liquid bromine, NBS is an easily handled crystalline solid and is perfect for electrophilic addition of bromine to alkenes when the bromonium ion is not intended to be opened by Br<sup>-</sup>. It works by providing a very small concentration of Br<sub>2</sub> in solution: a small amount of HBr is enough to get the reaction going and thereafter every addition reaction produces another molecule of HBr, which liberates more Br<sub>2</sub> from NBS. In a sense, NBS is a source of &#x2018;Br<sup>&#x002B;</sup>&#x2019;. NBS is known to act as a source of Br<sub>2</sub> because the results of reactions of NBS and of Br<sub>2</sub> in low concentration are identical.</p>
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_441_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">The reagent NBS generates only a low concentration of Br<sub>2</sub>, so the concentration of Br<sup>-</sup> is always low and alcohols compete with Br<sup>-</sup> to open the epoxide even if they are not the sol-vent. In the next example, the alcohol is &#x2018;propargyl alcohol&#x2019;, prop-2-yn-1-ol. It gives the expected <i>anti</i>-disubstituted product with cyclohexene and NBS.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">When 1-methylcyclohexene is used as the starting material, there is additionally a question of regioselectivity. The alcohol attacks the more hindered end of the bromonium ion&#x2014;the end where there can be greatest stabilization of the partial positive charge in the &#x2018;loose S<sub>N</sub>2&#x2019; transition state (see p. <a href="chapter_19.xhtml#page_437">437</a>). This reaction really does illustrate the way in which a mechanism can lie in between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2. Configurational inversion, indicative of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, happens at a tertiary centre, where you would usually expect S<sub>N</sub>1.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Adding two hydroxyl groups: dihydroxylation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many important compounds&#x2014;the carbohydrates, for example&#x2014;have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbon atoms. They are called 1,2-diols. A good way of making a 1,2-diol is to add two hydroxyl groups across a double bond. This can be done in two ways, each of which can give a different diastereoisomer of the product.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_442_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The first way uses chemistry you have already met. When a nucleophile opens an epoxide, it generates an alcohol. If the nucleophile is water, the product is the diol. The epoxide open-ing in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction goes with stereochemical inversion, so in this example the two hydroxyl groups end up on opposite sides of the six-membered ring: the product is an <i>anti</i> diol. The epoxide opening reaction can be done in acid or in base.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_442_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">To get the <i>syn</i> diol, a completely different method is used, involving the reagent osmium tetroxide, OsO<sub>4</sub>. OsO<sub>4</sub> reacts with alkenes to deliver two hydroxyl groups&#x2014;one to each end of the double bond&#x2014;in a single step. Because both groups are delivered at the same time, they are always <i>syn</i> to one another: OsO4 carries out a <i>syn</i> dihydroxylation of the double bond.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig2">
<img src="../images/pg_442_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the reaction is different from ones you have met before and goes like this: the Os starts as tetrahedral osmium(VIII) and ends up as osmium(VI). The immediate product of the reaction is an osmate ester, but these reactions are carried out in the presence of water, and hydrolysis always follows on fast, giving the diol.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Because Os(VI) is produced in the reaction, and a simple oxidation will restore it to Os(VIII), the most effective version of this reaction makes use of just a catalytic amount of Os(VIII) and a stoichiometric amount of a reoxidant, often the compound NMO, or <i>N</i>-methylmorpholine- <i>N</i>-oxide. In the example below there is only one new chiral centre, so no possibility of diastereoisomers.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_442_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Because OsO<sub>4</sub> adds two hydroxyl groups to an alkene in a <i>syn</i> fashion, the overall product depends on the geometry of the alkene starting material: it is stereospecific. It is similar to bromination (p. <a href="chapter_19.xhtml#page_439">439</a>) in that respect, although of course bromination is an <i>anti</i> addition. You can see how two different diastereoisomers are produced from different alkenes in these two examples: both dihydroxylations are mechanistically <i>syn</i>, but redrawing the product from the <i>Z</i> alkene in its more extended form reveals <i>anti</i> stereochemistry.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">

It is worthwhile thinking about the chirality of these two products too: the fi rst is chiral, with no plane of symmetry (we have included the symbol (&#x00B1;) to remind you that although we have necessarily drawn just one enantiomer here, it must be racemic); the second is achiral, with a plane of symmetry in the first conformation shown and a centre of symmetry in the second.

<h2 class="h2">Breaking a double bond completely: periodate cleavage and ozonolysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes it can be necessary to cleave a double bond completely, in other words to oxidize not just its &#x03C0; bond (as you have seen with Br<sub>2</sub> and OsO<sub>4</sub>) but its &#x03C3; bond too, as shown in the margin. This can be done in two steps using OsO<sub>4</sub> in conjunction with the reagent sodium periodate, NaIO<sub>4</sub>. The diol product forms a periodate ester, which decomposes to give two molecules of aldehyde by a cyclic mechanism similar to that for the OsO<sub>4</sub> step. The NaIO<sub>4</sub> also reoxidizes the Os(VI) to Os(VIII) so only a catalytic amount of Os is required.</p>

But there is another reagent that will achieve double oxidation in one step: ozone.</p>
<p class="indent">Ozone is a symmetrical bent molecule with a central positively charged oxygen atom and two terminal oxygen atoms that share a negative charge. Ozone is unstable, and is generated immediately before use from oxygen (using a device called an &#x2018;ozonizer&#x2019;) and bubbled into the reaction mixture. Like OsO<sub>4</sub>, it adds to alkenes by a cyclic mechanism: the product is a five- membered ring with three oxygen atoms. It is extremely unstable and collapses by breaking a weak O&#x2013;O bond and a C&#x2013;C &#x03C3; bond, but gains two strong C&#x003D;O bonds in the process.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a> you saw alkenes being made from alcohols by E1 elimination&#x2014;dehydration&#x2014; under acid catalysis. The question we are going to answer in this section is: how can you make this elimination run backwards&#x2014;in other words, how can you hydrate a double bond?</p>

<p class="indent">It is possible on occasion simply to use aqueous acid to do this. The reaction works only if protonation of the alkene can give a stable, tertiary cation. The cation is then trapped by the aqueous solvent.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent">In general, though, it is difficult to predict whether aqueous acid will hydrate the alkene or dehydrate the alcohol. The method we are about to show you is much more reliable. The key is to use a transition metal to help you out. Alkenes are soft nucleophiles (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_357">357</a>) and interact well with soft electrophiles such as transition metal cations. In the margin, for example, is the complex formed between an alkene and mercury(II) cation. The complex should remind you of a bromonium ion, and rightly so because its reactions are similar. Even relatively feeble nucleophiles such as water and alcohols, when used as the solvent, open the &#x2018;mercurinium&#x2019; ion and give alcohols and ethers. In the next scheme, the mercury(II) is supplied as mercury(II) acetate, Hg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, which we shall represent with two covalent Hg&#x2013;O bonds. Unsurprisingly, water attacks at the more substituted end of the positively charged mercurinium ion.</p>

Boranes, including both BH3 itself and analogues with one or two alkyl groups, HBr<sub>2</sub> (an important example is shown in the margin), add to alkenes to make a new C&#x2013;H bond and a new C&#x2013;B bond by a mechanism we can write like this.

<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Importantly, if the alkene is unsymmetrical, the boron tends to end up on the less substituted carbon atom. This reaction can happen several times so, for example, if you start with an alkene and BH3, you will typically end up with a trialkylborane:</p>

<p class="indent">So far so good, if you want to make boranes, but we started out this section posing ourselves the problem of adding water across a double bond. This is where a quirk of boron chemistry helps us out. The C&#x2013;B bond(s) we have just created can be oxidized to C&#x2013;O bonds by using a mixture of NaOH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The mixture generates the hydroperoxide anion HO&#x2013;O<sup>-</sup>, which adds to that important empty p orbital on boron. The product is a negatively charged structure, shown below.</p>

As it does so, one of the alkyl groups on boron can migrate from B to O, relieving the boron atom of its negative charge, to give the structure shown below.</p>

Well, if we use BH3 we will get a trialkyborane, where all three groups on boron are the same, and all three C&#x2013;B bonds can be oxidized one after another.
