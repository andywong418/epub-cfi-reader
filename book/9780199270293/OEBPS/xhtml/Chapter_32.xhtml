<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the last chapter we looked at how the NMR spectra of cyclic molecules tell us a lot about their shape&#x2014;both their conformation and their configuration. We are now going to go beyond simply studying stereochemistry and start to explain how to control stereochemistry. We have already, in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, spent some time looking at controlling one aspect of stereo-chemistry&#x2014;double bond geometry. But stereochemistry is about much more than this, and in this chapter and the next we will explain how to make single diastereoisomers and single enantiomers.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">We start with stereochemistry in rings. Not only is stereochemistry easier to understand in cyclic compounds, it is also <i>better behaved</i> in cyclic compounds. Suppose you were to reduce this ketone to one of the corresponding alcohols.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_825_2.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">To achieve a stereoselective reaction at the new stereogenic centre (shown in black) the green stereogenic centre would somehow have to influence the direction of attack of the nucleophile on the C&#x003D;O group. Separated from it by three bonds, in a molecule with a high degree of flexibility, makes this a very tall order. A more or less 50:50 mixture of the two dias- tereoisomers would be expected.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent"><a class="page" id="page_826">Page 826, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a>However, if we join up the molecule into a ring, as shown in the margin, things are suddenly quite different. (This is not, of course, a chemical reaction&#x2014;just a thought process&#x0021;) The cyclic ketone has a fixed conformation controlled by the determination of the <i>tert-butyl</i> group to be equatorial. The two faces of the carbonyl group are therefore clearly quite different, and in fact by careful choice of reducing agent it is possible to attack either at will, giving almost exclusively either the axial or the equatorial alcohol. As we will explain shortly (p. <a href="chapter_32.xhtml#page_828">828</a>) large reagents prefer to approach equatorially while small reagents prefer to approach axially, putting the new OH group into an equatorial position. These are <i>stereoselective</i> reactions and, because the two different outcomes are diastereoisomers, we can call them <i>diastereoselective.</i></p>

<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;If your memory of <a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>'s discussion of the effect of substituents on the conformation of six-membered rings is dim, you should refresh it now. Conformational analysis underpins much of this chapter and you need to be fully familiar with its concepts and terminology.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The key to the difference between these two compounds is in their conformations. The six- membered ring of the cyclic ketone has one conformation and the two approaches to the faces of the ketone are very different. In the open-chain compound rotation about all the C-C bonds is possible and very many conformations will be populated. In any one conformation, attack on one face of the ketone or the other may happen to be preferred, but summed over all of them the average selectivity will be close to 1:1. There is all the difference in the world between cyclic and open-chain compounds when it comes to stereoselective reactions.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">In this chapter we shall look at reactions happening to cyclic compounds, reactions with cyclic intermediates, and reactions with cyclic transition states. We shall investigate what happens to stereochemistry when two (or even more) rings are joined together at a bond or at an atom. You have already looked in detail at reactions which close rings (<a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>, p. <a href="chapter_31.xhtml#page_805">805</a>), and many of the <i>reactions</i> in this chapter you will have met earlier in the book. Our task is to reveal new features and subtleties, and to show you how to use these reactions to control stereochemistry.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Stereochemical control in six-membered rings</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">As you saw in <a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>, cyclohexanes benefit from very well defined conformational prefer-ences. Substituents are orientated either axially or equatorially, and usually prefer the equatorial orientation, especially when they are large. The strong preference for substituents to adopt the equatorial position means that when diastereoisomeric cyclohexanes equilibrate by processes such as enolization they may give high selectivity for the all-equatorial compound. For example, this fine perfumery material is made worthless by enolization.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_826_3.jpg"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Although a disadvantage here, in other cases equilibration to the more stable all-equatorial conformation can be a useful source of stereochemical control. For an example, see p. <a href="chapter_32.xhtml#page_829">829</a>.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The reason the equilibrium favours the worthless <i>trans</i> isomer (it forms 92&#x0025; of the equilibrium mixture) is that the two substituents are both in the more stable equatorial positions.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Six-membered rings containing one sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atom: cyclohexanone</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">If we&#x2019;re interested in the reactions of six-membered rings, then we are going to have to consider what happens to their conformation when they contain reactive functional groups such as carbonyl groups and alkenes&#x2014;in other words, the effect of introducing sp<sup>2</sup> C atoms into the ring. For just one sp<sup>2</sup> carbon atom the simple answer is that nothing changes&#x2014;the conformation is not significantly altered by the presence of just one sp<sup>2</sup> centre in a ring. The conformations of methylenecyclohexene and cyclohexanone are shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_827_01.jpg"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwblue">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Drawing cyclohexanones</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindenta">Make sure you point the ketone in the right direction&#x0021; It should bisect the angle there would be between the axial and equatorial substituents, if the carbon atom were tetrahedral. It&#x2019;s always best to put the carbonyl group at one of the &#x2018;end&#x2019; carbons of the ring: it&#x2019;s much harder to get it right if you join it to one of the middle ones.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_827_2.jpg"/></figure></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Six-membered rings with <i>more than one</i> sp<sup>2</sup> C atom do lose their chair conformation&#x2014;they become flattened to some degree when there are one or more double bonds included in the ring and we shall come on to those in the next section.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Axial or equatorial attack is possible on a cyclohexanone</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">So, what happens when a cyclohexanone is attacked by a nucleophile? For cyclohexanone itself, the reaction below gives a product which can adopt either of the two conformations shown, with Nu axial or equatorial, depending on the relative size of Nu and OH. This reaction does not tell us much about the attack on the C&#x003D;O group itself&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t tell, for example, whether Nu<sup>-</sup> attacked the axial or the equatorial face of the C&#x003D;O group.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_827_3.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now think of a nucleophile attacking 4-t-butylcyclohexanone. Since the t-butyl group locks the ring (<i>t</i>-Bu can never be axial), whether Nu is axial or equatorial will depend only on which face of the C&#x003D;O group it attacks. Attack on the same face as the t-butyl group leaves the nucleophile axial and the hydroxyl group equatorial; attack on the opposite face leaves the nucleophile equatorial and the hydroxyl group axial. The nucleophile is said to attack either in an axial or equatorial manner, depending on where it ends up. It&#x2019;s easier to see this in a diagram.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_827_4.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now for an observation&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll try and explain it shortly. In general, large nucleophiles attack equatorially and small nucleophiles attack axially. For example, reduction of 4-<i>t</i>-butyl- cyclohexanone with lithium aluminium hydride in Et<sub>2</sub>O gives 90&#x0025; of the <i>trans</i> alcohol: 90&#x0025; <a class="page" id="page_828">Page 828, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a>of the hydride has added axially. AlH<sup>-</sup> is quite small as nucleophiles go: to make more of the <i>cis</i> alcohol we need a larger nucleophile&#x2014;lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride, for example, sold under the name of L-selectride&#x00AE;. This is so large that it attacks only equatorially, yielding typically 95&#x0025; of the <i>cis</i> alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_828_1.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Carbon-centred nucleophiles follow the same trend&#x2014;the table shows that, as size increases from the slender ethynyl anion through primary and secondary organometallics to f-BuMgBr, the axial selectivity drops off correspondingly. PhLi behaves as though it were quite small because it is flat.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_828_2.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now the difficult part&#x2014;why? This is a question to which the answer really is not known for certain. It&#x2019;s certainly true that the direction of approach for axial attack is more hindered than for equatorial attack, and this is certainly the reason large nucleophiles prefer to attack equatorially.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">But if this is the case, why do small ones actually <i>prefer</i> to attack axially? There must be another factor that favours axial attack for those nucleophiles small enough to avoid the bad interactions with the other axial hydrogens. At the transition state, the forming &#x2013;O<sup>&#x2212;</sup> oxygen substituent is moving in either an axial or an equatorial direction. Just as the axial substituent is less favourable than an equatorial one, so is the transition state leading there, and the route leading to the equatorial hydroxyl group is favoured.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">When chemists made the drug alphaprodine using the reaction shown below, they found that the combination of the equatorial preference of a methyl group adjacent to C&#x003D;O and an equatorial preference for attack on the C&#x003D;O group were enough to favour the formation of one diastereoisomer. Here is the reaction, with the starting material and product represented as a conformational diagram.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Other reasons have been proposed for this selectivity, but they are beyond the scope of this book.</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_828_3.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We can also represent the reaction in configurational terms. This is less good for explaining the stereoselectivity, but you should always be prepared to turn conformational diagrams into standard configurational ones.<a class="page" id="page_829">Page 829, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_829_1.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In the next reaction, stereoselectivity is not so good. Zeneca (now AstraZeneca) announced the manufacture of a drug by the addition of a lithiated thiophene to another heterocyclic ketone, which initially gave a mixture of diastereoisomers.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_829_2.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Such a mixture is no good for manufacture of a pure drug, but the compound can be equili-brated in dilute acid by repeated S<sub>N</sub>1 formation of a tertiary cation and recapture by water so that the required product (which is more stable as it has both Me and the thiophene equatorial) dominates by 92:8 and can be purified by crystallization. The unwanted isomer can be recycled in the next batch.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Compare this strategy with the equilibration of the perfumery compound via its enolate, described on p. <a href="chapter_32.xhtml#page_826">826</a>.</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_829_3.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In these reactions the molecule has a free choice whether to place a substituent in an axial or equatorial position and this is the only consideration because the starting materials in the reactions&#x2014;ketones or carbocations&#x2014;have six-membered rings that are already in the chair conformation even though they have one trigonal (sp<sup>2</sup>) atom in the ring.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Six-membered rings with two or more sp<sup>2</sup> carbons: cyclohexenes</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">With more than two trigonal carbon atoms in the ring, a cyclohexene can no longer adopt a chair conformation. At least four of the atoms in the ring must now be in a plane, and the best way to represent this is in the diagrams shown below. The four atoms in the plane are nearest you, with the remaining two placed one above and one below that plane.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_829_4.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Cyclohexene itself flips rapidly between these two conformations, with a barrier of about 22 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, about half that of cyclohexane. As in cyclohexane, hydrogen atoms on the saturated carbons of the cyclohexene structure adopt two types of positions, but as they are not quite orientated in the same way as in cyclohexane, we call the two orientations &#x2018;pseudoaxial&#x2019; and &#x2018;pseudoequatorial&#x2019;.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Only axial attack is possible with cyclohexenes</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">These conformations of six-membered rings with more than one trigonal carbon are quite plainly not chairs, and are much less stable than chairs. Anything which allows them to become a chair is likely to be highly favoured, and the stereoselectivity of a reaction is likely <a class="page" id="page_830">Page 830, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a>to be driven by the need for the transition state and product to have a chair rather than a boat conformation. This can override the preference for substituents to go into equatorial positions. The choice of axial attack controls the stereoselectivity of reactions of cyclohexenes (and, as you will see, their epoxides), six-membered cyclic enolates, and six-membered cyclic enones.</p>
<div class="htwyellow">

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"/>&#160;&#160; Interactive mechanism for axial</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Alkylations of enolates, enamines, and silyl enol ethers of cyclohexanone usually show
substantial preference for axial attack. The enamine of 4-f-butylcyclohexanone, which has a
fixed conformation because of the f-butyl group, gives 90&#x0025; axial alkylation and only 10&#x0025;
equatorial alkylation with n-PrI.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_830_1.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">To get at the reason for this result we need to look at the conformation of the enamine inter-mediate. At this point we shall generalize a bit more and write a structure that represents any enol derivative where X may be OH, O<sup>-</sup>, OSiMe<sub>3</sub>, NR<sub>2</sub>, and so on. The double bond (2 X sp<sup>2</sup> centres) in the ring means the conformation is a partially flattened chair, as described above. We place the <i>f</i>-butyl group in an equatorial position because, as with cyclohexanes, it is so bulky it cannot go axial. This means that there is only one conformation to consider&#x2014;the one shown in the margin.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Enolate equivalents were
discussed in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, the electrophile must attack the &#x03C0; system of this conformation, and to do so it has to attack from more or less directly above or below because only then can it interact with one of the lobes of the p orbital at the enol position shown in orange. The need to interact with the system is the reason cyclohexenes and related compounds react in an axial direction. The
top of the molecule looks to be more open to attack so we shall try that approach first.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_830_3.jpg"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">As the electrophile forms a bond to the trigonal carbon atom, that atom must become tetra hedral and it does so by forming a vertical bond upwards. The result is shown in the diagram&#x2014;the ring turns into a twist-boat conformation. Now, of course, after the reaction is over, the ring can flip into a chair conformation and the new substituent will then be equatorial, but that information is not present in the transition state for the reaction. We could say that, at the time of reaction, the molecule doesn&#x2019;t &#x2018;know&#x2019; it can later be better off and get thesubstituent equatorial: all it sees is the formation of an unstable twist boat with a high-energy transition state leading to it.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_830_4.jpg"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Attack from the apparently more hindered bottom face makes the trigonal carbon atom turn tetrahedral in the opposite sense by forming a vertical bond to the electrophile <i>down-</i><i>wards.</i> The ring goes directly to a chair form with the electrophile in the axial position.<a class="page" id="page_831">Page 831, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_831_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">When the carbonyl group is restored by hydrolysis (if necessary&#x2014;with an enolate X is already O) the ring need not flip: it's already a chair with the f-butyl equatorial, and the new substituent is axial on the chair. This is the observed product of the reaction.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">It's important that you understand what is going on here. The reagent <i>has</i> to attack from an axial direction to interact with the p orbital. If it attacks from above, the new substituent is axial on an unstable twist boat. If it attacks from below, the new substituent is axial on a chair&#x2014; granted, this is not as good as equatorial on a chair, but that's not an option&#x2014;it has to be axial on something, and a chair is better than a twist boat. So this is the product that forms.It's just hard luck for the substituent that it can't know that <i>if if did</i> weather it out on the twist boat it could later get equatorial&#x2014;it plumps for life on the chair and so has to be content with ending up axial.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Here is an example with an unsaturated carbonyl compound as an electrophile: the reaction is a Michael addition. The ketone here is slightly different&#x2014;it has the f-butyl group in the 3- rather than the 4-position, and the reacting centre becomes quaternary during the Michael reaction. But the result is still axial attack.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_831_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Such reactions were discussed in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This result is more impressive because the large electrophile ends up on the <i>same</i> side of the ring as the <i>f</i>-butyl group, so the stereoselectivity cannot be based on any simple idea of reac-tion on the less hindered side of the ring. It is genuine axial attack, as the conformational diagram of the product confirms.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em">
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_831_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Cyclohexenones are even flatter than cyclohexenes, but it is convenient to draw them in a similar conformation. Conjugate addition to the substituted cyclohexenone in the margin gives the <i>frans</i> product.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">This is also axial addition to form a chair directly (rather than a twist boat) with the nucleophile approaching from the bottom. We must draw the ring as a flattened chair.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_831_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The 5-alkyl cyclohexenone that we have chosen as our example gives the best results. The mechanism suggests that the enolate intermediate is protonated on the top face (axial addition again), although we cannot tell this because the product has no stereogenic centre there. But, if we carry out a tandem reaction with the enolate trapped by a different electrophile, it becomes clear that the product is again that of axial attack.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em">
<div class="htwgreen"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Beware: you also get the same answer but for the wrong reason by saying that the nucleophile approaches from the less hindered side.</div></aside>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_832_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now thermodynamic control can be brought into play. The position next to the ketone can be epimerized via the enolate to give the more stable isomer with both substituents equatorial. This improves the ratio of diastereoisomers from 55:45 to 87:13.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_832_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Reactions on small rings</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The conformational principles which apply to rings other than six-membered ones are rather more sketchy because only six-membered rings adopt well-defined chair (or, for cyclohexenes, half-chair) conformations. But we can still give you some general guidelines and principles, and illustrate them with some important examples. We will look in detail at four- and five- membered rings.<a class="page" id="page_833">Page 833, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a></p>
 
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Four-membered rings can be flat</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Saturated four-membered rings have a slightly bent conformation but four-membered lactones are flat. The enolates of these lactones can be made in the usual way with LDA at -78 &#x00B0;C and are stable at that temperature, and they react with electrophiles just as you saw in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>. If the P-lactone has a substituent already then there may be a choice as to which face of the enolate is attacked by an electrophile. In the example below, simple alkylation with a variety of alkyl halides gives essentially only one diastereoisomer of the product.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_833_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The enolate, as we have seen, is planar, and the phenyl group is in the plane (which is why it doesn't matter which of the two possible diastereoisomers of the starting material is used). The isopropyl group is the only thing out of the plane. The electrophile simply adds to the face of the enolate not blocked by the isopropyl group. This is a very simple case of a diastereo- selective reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Lactone enolates</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent" style="width:100%">This lithium enolate works well even though it might be expected to be unstable because of a simple elimination reaction.

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_833_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1" style="width:100%">But, in the four-membered ring, the p orbitals of the enolate and the C-O single bond are orthogonal (see diagram below) so that no interaction between them, and no elimination, can occur. In the terminology of Baldwin's rules (<a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>, p. <a href="chapter_31.xhtml#page_810">810</a>) it would be a disfavoured <i>4-endo-trig</i> reaction.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Reduction of substituted four-membered ring ketones is usually reasonably stereoselective. If the substituent is in the 3-position and small reagents like NaBH<sub>4</sub> are used, the <i>cis</i> isomer is favoured. Like saturated four-membered rings, cyclobutanones are slightly puckered to reduce eclipsing interactions between hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms, but attack of the reducing agent still occurs from the direction away from the other substituent to give the <i>cis</i> product.</p>

</aside>
<p class="htwnoindent">A saturated five-membered ring has a conformation often called an 'envelope'. It looks a bit like an opened envelope with one atom at the point of the flap. The arrangement closely matches what you get if you cut one atom out of a cyclohexane ring. At any one moment, one of the carbon atoms is at the point of the envelope but rapid ring flipping equilibrates all these conformers so that all five atoms are, on average, the same.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Substituted cyclopentanes can have substituents in pseudoaxial or pseudoequatorial positions (in other words, they are somewhat like the axial and equatorial positions in a cyclohexane), but rapid equilibration means that overall we have a very flexible and labile system. As a result, reduction of 2-substituted cyclopentanones may not be very stereoselective. What selectivity there is (about 3:1) in the reduction of 2-methylpentanone with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> favours pseudoaxial attack in the conformation drawn, as is reasonable for a small nucleophile.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_834_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The use of a much more bulky reducing agent such as LiBH(s-Bu)<sub>3</sub> dramatically reverses and increases the stereoselectivity. Essentially only the <i>cis</i> compound is formed.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Regard five-membered rings with two or more sp</b><sup>3</sup> <b>carbons as flat</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">When there are two or three trigonal carbons in the ring, the ring is flatter and reactions such as enolate alkylation and conjugate addition give excellent stereoselectivity even with a simple cyclopentane ring. Unsaturated five-membered lactones (known as 'butenolides') give a very clear illustration of stereochemically controlled conjugate addition. There is only one possible stereogenic centre and the ring is almost planar so we expect nucleophilic attack to occur from the less hindered face. Cuprates are good nucleophiles for this reaction and here Me<sub>2</sub>CuLi adds to the unsaturated lactone.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em">
<div class="htwgreen"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;This would be a good point at which to remind you of what we stressed in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>. If all the starting materials and reagents are achiral or racemic the products must be too. That has been the case in many of the reactions so far in this chapter: we haven't put in (&#x00B1;) under every compound but we could have done. But here we do have a single enantiomer of starting material so we get a single enantiomer of product. Diastereoselectivity is the same whether the starting material is enantiomerically pure or racemic.</div></aside>

<p class="htwindent1">It is not even necessary to have a stereogenic centre in an unsaturated ring if we want to create stereochemistry. A tandem conjugate addition and alkylation creates two new stereogenic centres in one operation. The conjugate addition of a lithium cuprate makes a lithium enolate, which will react in turn with an alkyl halide. The product is usually <i>trans.</i></p>

Enolates in five-membered rings are almost flat and the incoming orange allyl bromide prefers the less hindered face away from the recently added green vinyl group.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Our main example of enolate reactions in five-membered rings is one of some general importance. It illustrates how stereochemical information can be transmitted across a ring even though the original source of that information may be lost during the reaction. That may sound mysterious, but all will become clear. The first reaction is to make a five-membered cyclic acetal from an optically active hydroxy-acid. Our example shows (S)-(&#x002B;)-mandelic acid reacting with f-BuCHO.</p>

</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Acetal formation involves nucleophilic attack of the OH group on the aldehyde so there is no change at the stereogenic centre. The stereochemistry of the new (acetal) centre may surprise you&#x2014;why should the <i>cis</i> isomer be so favoured? This is a conformational effect as both substituents can occupy pseudoequatorial positions.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, if we make the lithium enolate with LDA, the original stereogenic centre is destroyed as that carbon becomes trigonal and planar. The only stereogenic centre left is the newly introduced one at the acetal position.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_835_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The ring is now essentially flat, owing to the C&#x003D;C bond within it, and reaction of the eno-late with an electrophile is again a simple matter of addition to the face of the enolate opposite to the <i>f</i>-butyl group.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_835_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">If the acetal is now hydrolysed, the new stereogenic centre is revealed as an alkylated version of the starting material. It may appear that the alkylation has happened stereospecifically with retention, but what has really happened is that the new stereogenic centre in the acetal intermediate has relayed the stereochemical information through the reaction.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Five-membered rings also allow us to explore electrophilic attack on alkenes. A simple 4-substituted cyclopentene has two different faces&#x2014;one on the same side as the substituent and one on the opposite side.

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_837_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<p class="htwindent1">You saw above that the epoxide-forming reaction is essentially the reverse of the epoxideopening reaction.

In other words, the transition state is the same for both reactions.<a class="page" id="page_838">Page 838, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a></p>
 <figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_838_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Since ring closure is possible only when the starting material is diaxially substituted, this has to mean that ring opening is similarly possible only if the <i>product</i> is diaxial. This is a general principle: <i>ring opening of cyclohexene oxides always leads directly to diaxial products.</i> The diaxially substituted product may then subsequently flip to the diequatorial one, but it is always the one that is initially formed.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_838_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">How do we know this to be true? If the ring bears a bulky substituent, ring flipping is impossible and the diaxial product has to stay diaxial. An example is nucleophilic attack of halide on the two epoxides shown below. The fact that the ring is a piperidine, rather than a cyclohexane, does not matter. The equatorial phenyl group fixes the conformation, and the regio- chemistry of the epoxide opening with azide depends only on the relative stereochemistry of the starting material.</p>

We're now going to look more generally at bicyclic compounds and their reactivity, and consider some features of their stereoselective reactions.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Bridged bicyclic rings</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">There are broadly three kinds of bicyclic compounds. If we imagine adding a second five- membered ring to one already there, we could do this in a bridged, fused, or <i>spiro</i> fashion, as you see in the margin. Bridged bicyclic compounds are just what the name implies&#x2014;a bridge of atom(s) is thrown across from one side of the ring to the other. Fused bicyclic compounds have one <i>bond</i> common to both rings, while <i>spiro</i> compounds have one <i>atom</i> common to both rings.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">You will notice that these three types of bicyclic compounds with five-membered rings have different numbers of atoms added to a 'parent' five-membered ring. The bridged compound has two extra atoms, the fused compound three, and the spiro compound four. These are marked in green with the original five-membered ring in red. We shall consider stereoselectivity in each of these types of bicyclic ring systems, starting with bridged structures.</p>

The instructions in the box overleaf tell you how&#x0021; Another way of looking at norbornane is as a six-membered ring held in a boat conformation by a one-carbon bridge. The bridge has to be axial at both bridgehead positions (or it wouldn't be able to form a ring) so the cyclohexane has no choice but to be a boat.</p>

The 'bicyclo' and &#x2019;heptane' parts are self explanatory. The numbers (always separated by dots) refer to the lengths of the bridges linking the two bridgehead carbons.

<p class="htwdivi">The easiest way to draw a convincing norbornane is to start with the bridge: draw a sort of skewed upwards chevron as shown in <b>1</b>. Then join the ends of the chevron with three bonds, as in <b>2</b>, making sure to break one of them as it passes behind the chevron, to give an impression of the three-dimensional shape of the molecule.

<p class="htwindent1">A selection of important bridged bicyclic compounds is shown in the margin. Bridged
structures (sometimes called cage structures) are generally very rigid, spending most of
their time in a single, well-defi ned conformation, and this rigidity is refl ected in the stereochemistry
of their reactions. For example, attack on norbornanone occurs predominantly

<p class="htwindent1">The two methyl groups on the bridge of the camphor molecule are key features in stereoselective reactions&#x2014;take them away and the result often changes dramatically. This bicyclic system, with and without methyl groups, has been so widely used to establish stereochemical principles that the two faces of, say, the ketone group in camphor, or the C&#x003D;C double bond in norbornene (the alkene derivative of norbornane) have been given the names <i>endo</i> and <i>exo.</i> These refer to inside <i>(endo)</i> and outside <i>(exo)</i> the boat-shaped six-membered ring shown in black. In general, reactions of norbornane-type structures occur from the less hindered <i>exo</i> face, but the methyl groups of camphor reverse this selectivity to favour <i>endo</i> attack:</p>

concentrated nitric acid cleaves a C-C bond adjacent to the C&#x003D;O group and produces a diacid
known as camphoric acid. The usual reagent is nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and oxidation goes via cam-

<p class="htwnoindent">The ring junction of a fused 6,5-membered ring system can have <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> stereo-chemistry, and so can any pair of larger rings.

<p class="htwindent1">The trans-fused 6,6 systems&#x2014;trans-decalins&#x2014;have been very widely studied because they form an important part of the structure of steroids. Their conformation was discussed in <a href="chapter_16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>: they prefer a <i>trans</i> ring junction as trans-decalins have all-chair structures with every bond staggered from every other bond. We can show this by giving a 6,6 system the choice: reducing this enone with lithium metal gives a lithium enolate (<a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). Protonation of this anion with the solvent (liquid ammonia) gives a <i>trans</i> ring junction.</p>

</aside>
<p class="htwnoindent">The two new hydrogen atoms (shown in black) must, of course, add <i>cis</i> to one another: this is a consequence of the stereospecificity of the reaction. What is interesting is that they have also added <i>cis</i> to the green hydrogen atom that was already there. This approach does give the more stable <i>cis</i> ring junction but the stereochemistry really arises because the other ring hin-ders approach to the other face of the alkene. Think of it in the way illustrated below: the alkene has two different faces. On one side there is the green hydrogen atom, and on the other the orange parts of the second ring. To get hydrogenated, the alkene must lie more or less flat on the catalyst surface and that is easier on the top face as drawn.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_842_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You can think of c/s-fused rings as looking like a butterfly or an open book. The key to stereo-selectivity in their reactions is that everything happens on the outside (on the cover of the book&#x2014;the <i>exo</i> face). Nucleophiles add to carbonyl groups from the outside, enolates react with alkyl halides or Michael acceptors on the outside, and alkenes react with peroxyacids on the<a class="page" id="page_843">Page 843, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a> outside. Notice that this means the same side as the substituents at the ring junction. The rings are folded away from these ring-junction substituents, which that are also on the outside.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_843_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">A real example comes in the acylation (<a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>) of the enolate from the keto-acetal below. The molecule is folded downwards and the enolate is essentially planar, so the outside face is the top face as drawn. Addition presumably occurs entirely from the outside, although the final stereochemistry of the product is controlled thermodynamically because of reversible enoliza- tion of the product, allowing the black ester group to adopt the less hindered outside position.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_843_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Reduction of the ketone product also occurs exclusively from the outside and this has the sur-prising effect of pushing the new OH group into the inside position. Attack from the inside is very hindered in this molecule because one of the acetal oxygen atoms is right on the flight path.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_843_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The important metabolite biotin has a <i>cis</i> bicyclic structure in which an alkyl chain lies on the more hindered face of the molecule, and any successful synthesis has to address this particular problem. You saw in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> that sulfur stabilizes an adjacent anion, but the direct alkylation of the sulfide below is no good because the new alkyl group will go <i>exo.</i> Instead, the sulfide was oxidized to a sulfoxide from the <i>exo</i> face, giving an 8:1 ratio of <i>exo:endo</i> sulfoxides. Alkylation of the cyclic sulfoxide results in <i>trans</i> stereochemistry between the new alkyl group and the sulfoxide oxygen atom, forcing formation of the desired (<i>endo</i>) product. The synthesis is diastereoselective&#x2014;but not enantioselective since there is no way of distinguishing the left and right sides of the symmetrical sulfoxide.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">After protection of the OH group, treatment with base closes a three-membered ring to give a remarkably strained molecule.

<p class="htwindent1">Inside/outside selectivity may allow the distinction between two otherwise similar functional groups.

<p class="htwindent1">Only the outside ester&#x2014;on the same side as the ring junction hydrogens&#x2014;is hydrolysed. In the mechanism for ester hydrolysis, the rate-determining step is the attack by the hydroxide ion so the functional group <i>increases</i> in size in the rate-determining step. This will be much easier for the ester in the outside than for the one inside the half-open book.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_844_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The end result is again that the larger of the two groups is on the inside&#x0021; There are other ways to do this too. If we alkylate the enolate of a bicyclic lactone, the alkyl group (black) goes on <a class="page" id="page_845">Page 845, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a>the outside as expected. But what will happen if we repeat the alkylation with a different alkyl group? The new enolate will be flat and the stereochemistry at the enolate carbon will be lost. When the new alkyl halide comes in, it will approach from the outside (green) and push the alkyl group already there into the inside.</p>

 or reduced to break the ring at the C-O bond and reveal new stereogenic centres on the old
 structure. In this sequence the lactone ring controls all the subsequent stereochemistry of
 the molecule in two ways: it fixes the conformation rigidly in one chair form&#x2014;hence 
forcing the iodide to be axial&#x2014;and it blocks one face of the ring. From the lactone 
above, an alkene is introduced by E2 reaction on the iodide. This stereospecific reaction
 requires an anti-periplanar H atom so it has to take the only available neighbouring axial
 hydrogen atom, shown in green. The brown and orange hydrogens are not anti-periplanar and 
anyway elimination with the brown one would produce a bridgehead alkene.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_848_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">The resulting alkene has its top face blocked by the lactone bridge so
 epoxidation occurs entirely from the bottom face.</p>

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now the epoxide is opened with HBr. Only the <i>trans</i> diaxial opening product is possible, so the bromide ion is forced to attack from the top face.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;This is an epoxide of the type we discussed on p. <a href="chapter_32.xhtml#page_836">836</a>: it has no choice but to open to the <i>trans</i> diaxial product.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Do you see how the functional groups are being pushed round the ring? This process is extended further by a second elimination, after protection, which again seeks out the only neighbouring axial hydrogen.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_849_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The protecting silyl group is removed in acid, ready for the next important reaction: a Michael addition requiring the alcohol to be oxidized to a ketone. Allylic (or benzylic) alcohols can be oxidized by manganese dioxide, and with three atoms now trigonal the ring becomes even further flattened. But-3-enyl Grignard reagent is added with Cu(I) catalysis to make sure that conjugate addition occurs. Conjugate addition normally gives the axial product, as we saw earlier, and fortunately this is not the direction blocked by the bridge.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_849_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The bridge has now done its work and is removed by zinc metal reduction. This reaction removes leaving groups on the atoms next to carbonyl groups. In this case it is the axial carb- oxylate that is driven out by the zinc. The released carboxyl group is esterified.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_849_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The last stages are shown below. The ketone is protected, and the alkene oxidized to a carbonyl group by ozonolysis (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). The diester can be cyclized by a Claisen ester condensation (<a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>). The stereogenic centres in the ring are not affected by any of these reactions so a <i>trans</i> ring junction must result from this reaction. After ester hydrolysis, HCl decarboxylates the product and removes the protecting group.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_849_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;This may look like a new reaction but think back to the Reformatsky reaction (<a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, p 631). Both form zinc enolates from carbonyl compounds with adjacent leaving groups.</p></div>

<p class="htwindent1"><a class="page" id="page_850">Page 850, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not easy to set up a <i>transfused</i> 5,6 system. In this sequence the molecule is effectively tricked into making the <i>trans</i> ring junction by the work done with the lactone tether.</p>
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Cyclic transition states can reverse normal stereoselectivity</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Formation of a ring in an intermediate is a means of enforcing a certain stereochemistry&#x2014;the example you have seen made use of a lactone. But even transient formation of a ring in a cyclic transition state can be enough to control stereochemistry highly effectively. You will see further examples in the next chapter, but here we just present one type of reaction with this property epoxidation.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Of course epoxidation reactions <i>form</i> rings, and you have seen examples of epoxidations with m-CPBA even in this chapter (p. <a href="chapter_32.xhtml#page_848">848</a>) of alkenes such as cyclohexene. We pointed out in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> that epoxidation is stereospecific because both new C-O bonds form to the same face of the alkene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>
See p. <a href="chapter_19.xhtml#page_430">430</a> for this discussion.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">If we block one face of the ring with a substituent&#x2014;even quite a small one, such as an acetate group&#x2014;epoxidation becomes stereoselective for the face <i>anti</i> to the substituent already there.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_850_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">But there is one important exception to this rule, when the substituent is a hydroxyl group. When an allylic alcohol is epoxidized, the peroxy-acid attacks the face of the alkene <i>syn</i> to the hydroxyl group, even when that face is more crowded. For cyclohexenol the ratio of <i>syn</i> epox-ide to <i>anti</i> epoxide is 24:1 with m-CPBA and it rises to 50:1 with CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>H.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_850_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reason is shown in the transition state: the OH group can hydrogen bond, through the H of the alcohol, to the peroxy-acid, stabilizing the transition state when the epoxidation is occurring <i>syn.</i> This hydrogen bond means that peroxy-acid epoxidations of alkenes with adjacent hydroxyl groups are much faster than epoxidations of simple alkenes, even when no stereochemistry is involved.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Peroxy-acids work for epoxidizing allylic alcohols <i>syn</i> to the OH group, but another reagent is better when the OH group is further from the alkene. 4-Hydroxycyclopentene, for example, can be converted into either diastereomer of the epoxide. If the alcohol is protected with a large group such as TBDMS (t-butyl-dimethylsilyl), it becomes a simple blocking group and the epoxide is formed on the opposite face of the alkene. The selectivity is reasonable (83:17) given that the blocking group is quite distant. But if the OH group is not blocked at all but left free, and the epoxidation reagent is the vanadium complex VO(acac)<sub>2</sub> combined with <i>t</i>-BuOOH, the <i>syn</i> epoxide is formed instead. The vanadyl group chelates reagent and alcohol, and delivers the reactive oxygen atom to the same face of the alkene as shown.<a class="page" id="page_851">Page 851, Chapter 32 Stereoselectivity in cyclic molecules</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_851_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In both epoxidation examples, the stereoselectivity is due to the cyclic nature of the transition state: the fact that there is a hydrogen bond or O-metal bond 'delivering' the reagent to one face of the alkene. Effectively we have moved on from the tethered <i>nucleophiles</i> of the last section to (transiently) tethered <i>reagents.</i> This is a very important concept, and we revisit it in the next chapter: cyclic transition states are the key to getting good stereoselectivity in reactions of acyclic compounds.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em">
<div class="htwblue">
<h2 class="htwh2">VO(acac)<sub>2</sub></h2>
<p class="htwnoindenta">Vanadyl (acac)<sub>2</sub> is a square pyramidal complex of two molecules of the enolate of &#x2019;acac' (acetyl acetone, pentan- 2,4-dione) and the vanadyl (V&#x002D;O) dication. It can easily accept another ligand to form an octahedral complex so there is plenty of room for the alcohol to add and for the f-BuOOH to displace one of the &#x2019;acac' ligands to give some complex with the essential ingredients for the reaction here.</p></div></aside>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>To summarize...</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Diastereoselectivity in rings generally follows a few simple principles:</p>
<ul style="width:65%;color:#034694">
<li><span style="color:#000000">Flattened three-, four-, or five-membered rings, especially ones with two or more
trigonal carbons in the ring, are generally attacked from the less hindered face.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">Flattened six-membered rings with two or more trigonal carbons in the ring (that is,
which are not already a chair&#x2014;so six-membered rings with one trigonal C atom don't
count here) react in such a way that the product becomes an axially substituted chair.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">Bicyclic compounds react on the outside face.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">Reaction on the more hindered face can be encouraged by: (1) tethered nucleophiles or (2) cyclic transition states (tethered reagents).</span></li></ul>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em">
<div class="htwgreen">
<img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Another reaction in which an allylic alcohol is extremely effective at delivering a reagent via a cyclic transition state is the cyclopropanation reaction known as the Simmons-Smith reaction, described on p. <a href="chapter_38.xhtml#page_1017">1017</a>.</div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Diastereoselectivity in compounds without rings is different: it is less well controlled because there are many more conformations available to the molecule. But even in acyclic compounds rings can still be important, and some of the best diastereoselectivities arise when there is a ring formed temporarily in the transition state of the reaction. With or without cyclic transition states, in some cases we have good prospects of predicting which diastereo- isomer will be the maj or reaction product, or explaining the diastereoselectivity if we already know this. That is the subject of the next chapter.</p>
