<p class="maxcddbanoindent">You have had two chapters in a row about stereochemistry: this is the third, and it is time for us to bring together some ideas from earlier in the book.

But, first, some revision.</p>

A common misapprehension is that stereospecific means merely very stereoselective. It doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;the two terms describe quite different properties of the stereochemistry of a reaction. For the purposes of making a single diastereoisomer, you can think of stereospecific reactions as ones which simply exchange different forms of stereochemical &#x2018;currency&#x2019; (double bond geometry and three-dimensional relative stereochemistry, for example) while stereoselective reactions create additional new stereochemical value.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch33-1.1">
<h3 class="maxcddh3">Making single diastereoisomers using stereospecific reactions of alkenes</h3>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">The essence of the definition we have just stated is much easier to grasp with some familiar examples. Here are two.</p>
<p class="maxcddli"><span class="maxcddbullb">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are stereospecific: they proceed with inversion so that the absolute stereochemistry of the starting material determines the absolute stereochemistry of the product.</p>
<aside class="maxcddabca" style="margin-top:-2.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxcddnoindent2b"><img src="../images/ar.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> This is discussed in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_344">344</a>.</p></aside>

</figure>
<p class="maxcddli"><span class="maxcddbullb">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;E2 reactions are stereospecific: they proceed through an anti-periplanar transition state, with the relative stereochemistry of the starting material determining the geometry of the product.</p>
<aside class="maxcddabca" style="margin-top:-2.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxcddnoindent2b"><img src="../images/ar.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> This is discussed in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_395">395</a>.</p></aside>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent">
 <img src="../images/page853-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Both of these examples are interesting because they show how, once we have some stereochemistry in a molecule, we can change the functional groups but keep the stereochemistry&#x2014;this is the essence of a stereospecific reaction. In the second example, we change the bromide to a double bond, but we keep the stereochemistry (or &#x2018;stereochemical information&#x2019;) because
the geometry of the double bond tells us which bromide we started with.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">This is a good place to begin if we want to make single diastereoisomers because we can reverse this type of reaction: instead of making a single geometry of alkene from a single diastereoisomer, we make a single diastereoisomer from a single geometry of double bond. Here is an example of this&#x2014; again, one you have already met (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). Electrophilic addition of bromine to alkenes is stereospecific and leads to anti addition across a double bond. So if we ant the <i>anti</i> dibromide we choose to start with the trans double bond; if we want the <i>syn</i> ibromide we start with the cis double bond. The geometry of the starting material determines the relative stereochemistry of the product.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">For a stereospecific alkene transformation, choose the right geometry of the starting material to get the right diastereoisomer of the product. Don&#x2019;t try to follow any &#x2018;rules&#x2019; over this&#x2014;just work through the mechanism.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Now for some examples with epoxides. Epoxides are very important because they can be formed stereospecifically from alkenes: cis alkenes give cis (or <i>syn</i>) epoxides and trans alkenes give <i>trans</i> (or <i>anti</i>) epoxides.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">Leukotrienes are important molecules that regulate cell and tissue biology. Leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> (LTC<sub>4</sub>) is a single diastereoisomer with an <i>anti</i> 1, 2S, O functional group relationship. In nature, this single diastereoisomer is made by an epoxide opening: since the opening is S<sub>N</sub>2 the epoxide must start off <i>anti</i> and, indeed, the epoxide precursor is another leukotriene, LTA<sub>4</sub>.</p>

The alkyne is introduced as its lithium derivative with the alcohol protected as a THP acetal. Hydrolysis of the acetal with <a class="page" id="page_855">Page 855, Diastereoselectivity</a>aqueous acid gives the hydroxy-alkyne needed for reduction to the <i>E</i> double bond, which is then epoxidized.</p>

<p class="maxcddnoin">In the two reactions just above, a racemic starting material gives a racemic product as a single diastereoisomer. It is easy to draw a racemic compound with just one stereogenic centre&#x2014;we just avoid showing stereochemistry. But in the products we have to show relative stereochemistry because we need to indicate which diastereoisomer is formed. There is no way of doing this except by arbitrarily choosing one enantiomer and drawing that. If there is a danger of confusion, we might sometimes write &#x2018;(&#x000B1;)&#x2019; under the structure.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_33.2">
<h2 class="maxcddh2">Prochirality</h2>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Take another look at the reactions in the chapter so far&#x2014;in particular those that give single diastereoisomers (rather than single enantiomers or geometrical isomers), in other words, those that are diastereoselective. They all involve the creation of a new, tetrahedral stereogenic centre at a carbon that was planar and trigonal. This leads us to our first new definition. Trigonal carbons that aren&#x2019;t stereogenic (or chiral) centres but can be made into them are called <i>prochiral</i>.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent">
 <img src="../images/page856-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">At the very start of <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> we introduced stereochemistry by thinking about the reactions of two sorts of carbonyl compounds. They are shown again here: the first has a prochiral carbonyl group. The second, on the other hand, is not prochiral because no stereogenic centre is created when the compound reacts.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent">
 <img src="../images/page856-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">A tetrahedral carbon atom can be prochiral too&#x2014;if it carries two identical groups (and so is not a chiral centre) but replacement of one of them leads to a new chiral centre, then the carbon is prochiral.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent">
 <img src="../images/page856-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure><aside class="maxcddabc1" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxcddnoindent2b"><img src="../images/ar.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> Enantiotopic and diastereotopic protons and groups are discussed in <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>, p. <a href="chapter_31.xhtml#page_820">820</a>.</p></aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Glycine is the only common <i>&#x03B1;</i> amino acid without a chiral centre, but replacing one of the two protons on the central carbon with, say, deuterium creates one: the CH<sub>2</sub> carbon is prochiral. Similarly, converting a malonate derivate into its monoester makes a chiral centre where there was none: the central C is prochiral. Now, does this ring any bells? It should remind you very much of the definitions in <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> of <i>enantiotopic</i> and <i>diastereotopic</i> in connection with NMR spectra. Replacing one of two enantiotopic groups with another group leads to one of two enantiomers; replacing one of two diastereotopic groups with another group leads to<a class="page" id="page_857">Page 857, Diastereoselectivity</a> one of two diastereoisomers. Diastereotopic groups are chemically different; enantiotopic groups are chemically identical.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Exactly the same things are true for the faces of a prochiral carbonyl group or double bond. If reaction on one of two faces of the prochiral group generates one of two enantiomers, the faces are enantiotopic; if the reaction generates one of two diastereoisomers, the faces are diastereotopic. We will now apply this thinking to the first few reactions in this chapter: they are shown again below. The two examples in the top row have prochiral C=C or C=O bonds with diastereotopic faces: choosing which face of the double bond or carbonyl group to react on amounts to choosing which diastereoisomer to form. In the third example, the faces of the prochiral carbonyl group are enantiotopic: choosing which face to attack amounts to choosing which enantiomer to form. In the fourth example, the two faces of C=O are <b>homotopic:</b> an identical product is formed whichever face is attacked.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent">
 <img src="../images/page857-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Knowing this throws some new light on the last chapter. Almost without exception, every stereoselective reaction there involved a double bond (usually C=C, sometimes C=O) with diastereotopic faces. The diastereotopic faces were distinguished by steric hindrance, or by a nearby hydrogen-bonding group, and so were able to react differently with an incoming reagent.</p>

</figure>
<div class="maxcddbbox">
<h4 class="cddh32">Using an R/S-type system to name prochiral faces and groups</h4>
<p class="maxcddnoin">Just as stereogenic centres can be described as <i>R</i> or <i>S</i>, it is possible to assign labels to the enantiotopic groups at prochiral tetrahedral carbon atoms or the enantiotopic faces of prochiral trigonal carbon atoms. The basis of the system is the usual <i>R,S</i> system for stereogenic centres, but <i>pro-R</i> and <i>pro-S</i> are used for groups and <i>Re</i> and <i>Si</i> for faces. <i>Pro-R</i> and <i>pro-S</i> can be assigned to a pair of enantiotopic groups simply by using the usual rules to assign <i>R</i> or <i>S</i> to the centre created if the group in question is artificially elevated to higher priority than its enantiotopic twin. We&#x2019;ll use <i>G</i> to replace <i>H</i> as we did in <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>: just assume that <i>G</i> has priority immediately higher than <i>H</i>. The method is illustrated for glycine.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<div class="maxcddbbox">
<a class="page" id="page_858">Page 858, Diastereoselectivity</a>
<p class="maxcddnoin">Faces of a prochiral trigonal carbon atom are assigned <i>Re</i> and <i>Si</i> by viewing the carbon from that side and counting down the groups in priority 1&#x2013;3. Counting round to the right (clockwise) means the face is <i>Re</i>; counting round to the left (anticlockwise) means it&#x2019;s <i>Si</i>. Remember our advice from <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>: think of turning a steering wheel in the direction of the numbers: does the car go to the right or the left?</p>
<p class="maxcddn-in">Like <i>R</i> and <i>S</i>, these stereochemical terms are merely labels: they are of no consequence chemically.</p>

<p class="maxcddnoindent2"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> In <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a> we showed that homotopic and enantiotopic protons are identical by NMR. Similarly homotopic faces or groups are always chemically identical. Enantiotopic faces are also chemically identical provided that all the reagents in the reaction in question are achiral or racemic. In <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> we will consider what happens to enantiotopic faces when <i>enantiomerically pure</i> reagents are used.</p></div></aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Just like diastereotopic signals in an NMR spectrum, diastereotopic faces are always different in principle, but sometimes not so in practice. The very first reaction of <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a> is a case in point: this C=O group has two diastereotopic faces, which, due to free rotation about single bonds, average out to about the same reactivity, so we cannot expect any reasonable level of diastereoselectivity.</p>

<p class="maxcddnoin">Which is the best?

The first structure here is drawn like that. But this is only a guideline, and the second structure here is a bit more informative regarding the reaction because, when it is drawn like this, you can clearly see from which direction the ethyl group has attacked the carbonyl. Our advice would be that you first of all draw the product of any reaction in more or less the same conformation as the starting material to ensure you make no mistakes, and then rotate about a single bond to place the longest chain in the plane of the paper.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">By rotating about the central bond of the aldehyde (the one represented by a circle in the Newman projection) we can suggest a series of possible conformations.

<h2 class="maxcddh2"><b>Stereoselective reactions of acyclic alkenes</b></h2>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Earlier in the chapter we discussed how to make single diastereoisomers by stereospecific additions to double bonds of fixed geometry. But if the alkene also contains a chiral centre there will be a stereoselective aspect to its reactions too: its faces will be diastereotopic, and there will be two possible outcomes even if the reaction is fully stereospecific. Here is an example where the reaction is an epoxidation.</p>

<h3 class="maxcddh3">The Houk model</h3>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">In order to explain reactions of chiral alkenes like this, we need to assess which conformations are important and consider how they will react, just as we have done for chiral car- bonyl compounds. Much of the work on alkene conformations was done by K. N. Houk using theoretical computer models, and we will summarize the most important conclusions of these studies. The theoretical studies looked at two model alkenes, shown in the margin.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The calculations found that the low-energy conformations in each case were those in which a substituent eclipses the double bond. For the simple model alkene<b> 1,</b> the lowest-energy conformation is the one that has the proton in the plane of the alkene. Another low-energy conformation&#x2014;only 3.1 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher&#x2014;has one of the methyl groups eclipsing the double bond, so that when we start looking at reactions of this type of alkene, we shall have to consider both conformations.<a class="page" id="page_866">Page 866, Diastereoselectivity</a></p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent"> For the model alkene<b> 2,</b> with a<i> cis</i> substituent, the conformation is more predictable and the only low-energy conformer is the one with the hydrogen eclipsing the double bond. There is no room for a methyl group to eclipse the double bond because if it did it would get too close to the<i> cis</i> substituent at the other end of the double bond.</p>
 <p class="maxcddbaindent">The message from the calculations is this:</p>
<p class="maxcddli"><span class="maxcddbullb">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;The lowest-energy conformation of a chiral alkene will have H eclipsing the double bond.</p>
<p class="maxcddli"><span class="maxcddbullb">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;If there is a<i> cis</i> substituent on the alkene, this will be the only important conformation; if there is no<i> cis</i> substituent, other conformations may be important too.</p>

<h2 class="maxcddh3">Stereoselective epoxidation</h2>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">We started this section with a diastereoselective epoxidation of an alkene. The alkene was this one, and it has a substituent<i> cis</i> to the stereogenic centre. We can therefore expect it to have one important conformation, with H eclipsing the double bond.

<h2 class="maxcddh2"><b>Stereoselective enolate alkylation</b></h2>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Chiral enolates can be made from compounds with a stereogenic centre &#x03B2; to a carbonyl group. Once the carbonyl is deprotonated to form the enolate, the stereogenic centre is next to the double bond and in a position to control the stereoselectivity of its reactions. The scheme below shows stereoselectivity in the reactions of some chiral enolates with methyl iodide.<a class="page" id="page_868">Page 868, Diastereoselectivity</a></p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page868-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The enolate is a<i> cis</i>-substituted alkene because either O or OEt must be<i> cis</i> to the stereogenic centre, so that to explain the stereoselectivity we need consider only the conformation with H eclipsing the double bond. Notice how the diastereoselectivity increases as the group R gets bigger because there is then more contrast between the size of Me and R. In each case, the electrophile adds to the less hindered face, opposite R.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent"> Only one new stereogenic centre is created, so there is no question of diastereoselectivity.

</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent"> The important point about substituted enolates is that they can exist as two geometrical isomers,<i> cis</i> or<i> trans.</i> Which enolate is formed is an important factor controlling the diastereo- selectivity because it turns out that, in many examples of the aldol reaction,<i> cis</i> enolates give <i>syn</i> aldols preferentially and<i> trans</i> enolates give<i> anti</i> aldols preferentially.<a class="page" id="page_869">Page 869, Diastereoselectivity</a></p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Let&#x2019;s start by showing some examples and demonstrating how we know this to be the case.

<h4 class="cddh32"><b><i>cis</i></b> and<b><i> trans, E</i></b> and<b><i> Z, syn</i></b> and<b><i> anti</i></b></h4>
<p class="maxcddnoin">Before going further, there are two points we must clarify. The first is a problem of nomenclature, and concerns the enolates of esters. Here are two closely related ester enolate equivalents, drawn with the same double bond geometry. Is it<i> E</i> or<i> Z</i> ?</p>
<figure class="maxcddbacenter"><img src="../images/page869-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p>The answer is both&#x0021; For the Li enolate, the usual rule makes OLi of lower priority than OMe (because Li has a smaller atomic number than C), so it&apos;s E, while the silyl enol ether (or &apos;silyl ketene acetal&apos;) has OSi of higher priority than OMe (Si has a larger atomic number than C), so it&apos;s Z. This is merely a nomenclature problem, but it would be irritating to have to reverse all our arguments for lithium and boron enolates (as opposed to, say, tin or silicon ones). So, for the sake of consistency, it is much better to avoid the use of<i> E</i> and<i> Z</i>with enolates and instead use<i> cis</i> and<i> trans,</i> which then always refer to the relationship between the substituent and the anionic oxygen (bearing the metal).</p>
 <p> The other point concerns<i> syn</i> and<i> anti.</i> We said earlier that there is no precise definition of these terms: they are a useful way of distinguishing two diastereoisomers provided the structure of at least one of them is presented in diagrammatic form. For aldol products the convention is that<i> syn</i> or<i> anti</i> refers to the enolate substituent (the green Me in the last example) and the new hydroxyl group, provided the main chain is in the plane of the paper, the way we have encouraged you to draw molecules.</p>

<h3 class="maxcddh3"><b>The aldol reaction has a chair-like transition state</b></h3>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">These are the experimental facts: how can we explain them? Aldol reactions are another class of stereoselective process with a cyclic transition state. During the reaction, the lithium is transferred from the enolate oxygen to the oxygen of the carbonyl electrophile. This is represented in the margin both in curly arrow terms and as a transition state structure. A six-membered ring is involved, and we can expect this ring to adopt more or less a chair <a class="page" id="page_870">Page 870, Diastereoselectivity</a>conformation. The easiest way to draw this is first to draw the chair, and then convert atoms to O or Li as necessary. Here it is.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">In drawing this chair, we have one choice: do we allow the aldehyde to place R equatorial or axial? Both are possible but, as you should now expect, there are fewer steric interactions if R is equatorial. Note that the enolate doesn&#x2019;t have the luxury of choice. If it is to have three atoms in the six-membered ring, as it must, it can do nothing but place the methyl group pseudoequatorial. The aldol formed from the favoured transition state structure, with R pseudoequatorial, is shown below&#x2014;first in the conformation of the transition state, and then flattened out on to the page, and it is<i> anti.</i></p>

<h2 class="maxcddh2">Stereoselective enolization is needed for stereoselective aldols</h2>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The cyclic transition state explains how enolate geometry controls the stereochemical outcome of the aldol reaction. But what controls the geometry of the enolate? For lithium enolates of ketones the most important factor is the size of the group that is not enolized. Large groups force the enolate to adopt the<i> cis</i> geometry; small groups allow the<i> trans</i> enolate to form. Because we can&apos;t separate the lithium enolates, we just have to accept that the reactions of ketones with small R will be less diastereoselective.</p>

 <p class="maxcddbaindent">With<i> boron</i> enolates, we don&#x2019;t have to rely on the structure of the substrate&#x2014;we choose the groups on boron&#x2014;and we can get either<i> cis</i> or<i> trans</i> depending on which groups these are. Boron enolates are made by treating the ketone with an amine base (often Et<sup>3</sup>N or <i>i</i>-PrNEt<sup>2</sup>) and R<sub>2</sub>B-X, where X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is a good leaving group such as chloride or triflate (CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>).

<h2 class="maxcddh2">Single enantiomers from diastereoselective reactions</h2>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">The aldol reactions in the last section made single diastereoisomers from two achiral compounds. No enantiomerically pure reagents were used, so the reaction had no choice but to give the product diastereoisomer as a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">In all the other diastereoselective reactions in this chapter, the starting material has been chiral, with the formation of new chiral centres controlled by the confi guration of the starting material. Whatever the diastereoselectivity of the reaction, if the starting material is racemic, so will be the product; if the starting material is enantiomerically pure, so will be the product. The epoxidation of the allylic alcohol in the margin illustrates this point.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The reaction starts with racemic material (no stereochemistry is shown at the chiral centre) and makes a racemic product. Of course we have only <i>drawn</i> one enantiomer&#x2014;the only way to draw one diastereoisomer is to choose one enantiomer and draw that&#x2014;but the indication &#x2018; &#x000B1; &#x2018; underneath tells you to expect an equal amount of the other enantiomer as well. Even without this indication, you should be able to work out, in any given case, whether a compound is racemic or not, providing you know where it comes from. Here the starting material is racemic and the reagent is achiral so the product must be racemic.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The example of this reaction earlier in the chapter (p. <a href="chapter_33.xhtml#page_856">856</a>) was this type of reaction. The starting alcohol was racemic and the product was just one racemic diastereoisomer&#x2014;the all <i>cis</i> compound. But if the starting material <i>had</i> been enantiomerically pure, so would the product. One enantiomer gives one enantiomer of the product: the other enantiomer of the alcohol <a class="page" id="page_872">Page 872, Diastereoselectivity</a>gives the other. Both products are the same diastereoisomer (all <i>cis</i>) but they are mirror images of each other. If you start with enantiomerically pure compounds, the products will be enantio merically pure as well.</p>

<figure class="maxcddbacenter"><img src="../images/page872-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside><p class="maxcddbaindent">We gave an example of this during the discussion of the Felkin&#x2013;Anh model. The starting material was the natural amino acid isoleucine and was the enantiomer shown. The product of the aldol reaction was therefore also a single enantiomer. The original chiral centre in both these examples is not affected by the reaction and remains unchanged.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page872-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">It is much more useful to make enantiomerically pure as well as diastereoisomerically pure compounds, particularly in the synthesis of a drug. The strategy used here is to make the starting material from an enantiomerically pure compound available from nature: in this case an amino acid. These available enantiomerically pure compounds are known collectively as the chiral pool. You can read more about this in <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> on asymmetric synthesis.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">If you are making an enantiomerically pure compound with more than one stereogenic centre, only one needs be borrowed from the chiral pool, provided diastereoselective reactions can be used to introduce the others with control over relative stereochemistry. Because the first chiral centre has defi ned absolute configuration, any diastereoselective reaction that controls the relative stereochemistry of a new chiral centre also defines its absolute configuration.</p>

The naturally derived, enantiomerically pure compound used as the starting material is (<i>S</i>)-lactic acid. The starting chiral centre, preserved right through the sequence, is ringed in green.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The ring was built up using familiar chemistry from acetylated (<i>S</i>)-lactic acid, and a cyclization step introduced the second chiral centre in the final step of the scheme below. The methyl group goes pseudoequatorial on the newly formed ring, while the anomeric effect, which was explained on <a href="chapter_31.xhtml#page_801">p. 801</a> of <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>, induces the the methoxy group to prefer the pseudoaxial position.</p>

The conformational drawing shows that all substituents are equatorial except the MeO group, which prefers to be axial because of the anomeric effect.

<h3 class="maxcddh3">The structure and synthesis of penaresidin</h3>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Our last example is a natural product called penaresidin A. It was isolated from a Japanese sponge in 1991, and is now known to have the structure shown below. When it was first discovered,it proved difficult to find out the stereochemistry and, in particular, the relative stereochemistry between the two remotely related groups of chiral centres was not initially known.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page873-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">What is sure is the relative stereochemistry around the four-membered azetidine ring: the NMR methods described in <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> give that. What is also certain is that natural penarisidin A is enantiomerically pure. What Mori and his co-workers set out to do was to make, using unambiguous stereoselective methods, the possible diastereoisomers of penaresidin A to discover which was the same as the natural product.</p>
<aside class="maxcddabca" style="margin-top:0.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxcddnoindent2b"><img src="../images/ar.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> The Boc protecting group was introduced on p. <a href="chapter_23.xhtml#page_557">557</a>; the Swern oxidation is on p. <a href="chapter_27.xhtml#page_667">667</a>.</p></aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The challenge of constructing the three chiral centres at the left-hand end of the molecule can be solved by taking just one of them from a natural source&#x2014;in this case the amino acid <small>L</small>-serine. The amino group of serine was protected as the Boc derivative, and the hydroxyl and amino groups condensed with the dimethoxyacetal of acetone to form a five-membered ring. Now the free ester could be reduced with LiBH<sub>4</sub> and oxidized to the aldehyde by the Swern method (<a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page873-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">How will this aldehyde react with nucleophiles such as lithiated alkynes? Consider a Felkin&#x2013;Anh transition state: again, we know that the substituted nitrogen atom, being electronegative and bulky, will lie perpendicular to the carbonyl group in the most reactive conformation. Looking at the two alternatives shown below, it&#x2019;s easy to see that the one on the right allows unhindered attack, and in the synthesis an alkynyl anion was used to make the product shown.<a class="page" id="page_874">Page 874, Diastereoselectivity</a></p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">The alkyne was then reduced to an <i>E</i> alkene by a dissolving metal reduction, a step which also hydrolysed the five-membered heterocycle. The next step, an epoxidation, is needed to install the third of the chiral centres at the left-hand end of penarisidine. However, hydrogenbond directed epoxidation of this allylic alcohol would be expected to give the <i>syn</i> product shown, which has the wrong relative stereochemistry between the brown OH group and the epoxide.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page874-2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="maxcddnoindent2"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="images" style="vertical-align:middle"/> The selectivity of the epoxidation of the <i>E</i> double bond was still only moderate (about 60:40). From the discussion on p. <a href="chapter_33.xhtml#page_866">866</a> you should be able to deduce why.</p></div></aside>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The solution is to use a large blocking group to prevent this brown OH group hydrogen bonding to the <i>m</i>-CPBA. The <i>t</i>-butyldimethylsilyl group (TBDMS) is the best, and when both OH groups are protected, some of the right diastereoisomer is formed by attack of <i>m</i>-CPBA on the top face of the alkene. Reduction of the epoxide with DIBAL (<i>i</i>-Bu<sub>2</sub>AlH) now gives the correct diastereoisomer.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page874-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">To close the ring, the green hydroxyl group was converted to a good leaving group, mesylate (MeSO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>), ready for an attack by the nitrogen with inversion on treatment with base. Make sure you can see how inversion at this centre gives the stereochemistry shown! The chemists knew at this stage they were on the right track with regard to relative stereochemistry because the NMR spectrum of structures containing any long alkyl chain R were very similar to that of the natural compound.</p>

<h3 class="maxcddh3">Confirming the stereochemistry by synthesis</h3>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">The other two chiral centres at the right-hand end of the chain are so far removed from the ring (by 10 CH<sub>2</sub> groups) that there is no simple way to determine their stereochemistry relative to the three at the left-hand end by NMR. The solution to problems of assignment like this is often to make the various isomers by unambiguous synthesis and compare the NMR spectra of the natural and synthetic compounds. This is what Mori did in this case.</p>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The chiral pool can again be called into play by using another amino acid, <small>L</small>-isoleucine, as starting material. First the amino group must be converted to a leaving group by diazotization with nitrous acid (sodium nitrite in dilute HCl) and substituted by water to give a hydroxy acid. The acid is esterifi ed and reduced to a diol.<a class="page" id="page_875">Page 875, Diastereoselectivity</a></p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">Conversion of the diol&#x2019;s primary hydroxyl group to a leaving group (here a tosylate) allows the epoxide to be formed with retention of the two stereogenic centres of the starting material. Cyclization in base gives an epoxide. Overall, the enantiomerically pure starting material is converted stereospecifically into a single enantiomer of a single diastereoisomer of the epoxide.</p>

<p class="maxcddbaindent">Before we go on, look back at the first reaction of this sequence&#x2014;the conversion of <small>L</small>-leucine to the hydroxy acid. The stereochemistry may surprise you: look carefully and you will see that the amino group has been displaced with <i>retention</i> of stereochemistry. Retentive substitutions usually indicate double inversions, and here the carboxylic acid gets involved in the displacement to give (with inversion) a very unstable compound called an <i>&#x03b1;</i>-lactone whose strained ring is opened by water, also with inversion.</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page875-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">The epoxide may now be opened with a nucleophile to give the right-hand half of the target molecule. The alkyne shown below, which has an <i>anti</i> relationship between the hydoxyl and methyl groups, was made and linked to the left-hand half of penaresidin A by using it to attack the aldehyde the method described above. However, the final product was not the same as natural penarisidin A!</p>
<figure class="maxcddimagecent"><img src="../images/page875-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="maxcddbaindent">Clearly, some aspect of relative stereochemistry was wrong. So the synthesis was repeated, this time using the syn diastereosiomer of the substituted alkyne obtained using one of the methods we will describe in <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>. With this isomer the final compound had spectroscopic data identical with the natural product, and the question of its stereochemistry was solved. It is not uncommon for synthesis to be the only reliable way of proving the detailed structure of a compound.</p>

<h2 class="maxcddh2">Looking forward</h2>
<p class="maxcddbanoindent">Once you have got hold of a molecule as a single enantiomer, however simple that molecule may be, you can always use reliably diastereoselective reactions of the type described in this chapter and the one before to decorate it with further chiral centres. This is a very important point that underlies the field of asymmetric synthesis, which we will cover in <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>. There you will see developments of the ideas we have just been describing, where chiral centres derived from nature are used to introduce new stereochemistry even though they themselves need not appear in the final product. But before we move on to such reactions, we need to cover a handful of important new reaction mechanisms, many of which provide further ways of introducing new stereochemical features into molecules. The first of these new classes of reactions is <i>cycloadditions</i>.</p>
