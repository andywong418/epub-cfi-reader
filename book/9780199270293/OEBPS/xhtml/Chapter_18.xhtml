<p class="indent">This is the first of two review chapters on spectroscopic methods taken as a whole. In <a href="chapter_31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> we shall tackle the complete identification of organic compounds, including the vital aspect of stereochemistry, introduced in Chapters 14 and 17. In this chapter we gather together some of the ideas introduced in previous chapters on spectroscopy and mechanism, and show how they are related. We shall explain the structure of the chapter as we go along.</p>

<h2 class="h2">There are three reasons for this chapter</h2>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>1.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;To review the methods of structure determination we met in Chapters 3 and 13, to extend them a little further, and to consider the relationships between them.</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>2.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;To show how these methods may be combined to determine the structure of unknown molecules.</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>3.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;To provide useful tables of data for you to use when you are attempting to determine unknown structures.</p>
<p class="indent">The main tables of data appear at the end of the chapter (pp. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_423">423</a>-<a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_425">425</a>) so that they are easy to refer to when you are working on problems. You may also wish to look at them, along with the tables in the text, as you work through this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall deal with points 1 and 2 together, looking first at the interplay between the chemistry of the carbonyl group (as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11) and spectroscopy, solving some structural problems, then moving on to discuss, for example, NMR of more <a id="page_408" class="page">Page 408, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a>than one element in the same compound, doing some more problems, and so on. We hope that the lessons from each section will help in your overall understanding of structure solving.

<h2 class="h2">Spectroscopy and carbonyl chemistry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Chapters 10 and 11 completed our systematic survey of carbonyl chemistry, and we can now put together chemistry and spectroscopy on this most important of all functional groups.</p>
<p class="indent">We have divided carbonyl compounds into two main groups:</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>1.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<b>aldehydes</b> (RCHO) and ketones (R<sup>1</sup>COR<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>2.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<b>acids</b> (RCO<sub>2</sub>H) and their derivatives (in order of reactivity):</p>
<p class="nlist1"><b>acid chlorides</b> (RCOCl)</p>
<p class="nlist1"><b>anhydrides</b> (RCO<sub>2</sub>COR)</p>
<p class="nlist1"><b>esters</b> (R<sup>1</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>R<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p class="nlist1"><b>amides</b> (RCONH<sub>2</sub>, R<sup>1</sup>CONMe<sub>2</sub>, etc.).</p>
<p class="indent1">Which spectroscopic methods most reliably distinguish these two groups? Which help us to separate aldehydes from ketones? Which allow us to distinguish the various acid derivatives? Which offer the most reliable evidence on the chemistry of the carbonyl group? These are the questions we tackle in this section.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_18.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Distinguishing aldehydes and ketones from acid derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most consistently reliable method for doing this is <sup>13</sup>C NMR. It doesn&#x0027;t much matter whether the compounds are cyclic or unsaturated or have aromatic substituents, they all give carbonyl <sup>13</sup>C shifts in about the same regions. There is a selection of examples on the facing page which we now discuss. First, look at the shifts arrowed into the carbonyl group on each structure. All the aldehydes and ketones fall between 191 and 208 ppm regardless of structure, whereas all the acid derivatives (and these are very varied indeed&#x0021;) fall between 164 and 180 ppm. These two sets do not overlap and the distinction is easily made. Assigning the spectrum of the ketoacid in the margin, for example, is easy.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">More on these structures</h3>
<p class="ch4">Aldehydes and ketones</p>
<p class="bnoindent">The first aldehyde is vanillin, which comes from the vanilla pod and gives the characteristic vanilla flavour in, for example, ice cream. Vanilla is the seed pod of a South American orchid. &#x2018;Vanilla essence&#x2019; is made with synthetic vanillin and tastes slightly different because the vanilla pod contains other flavour components in small quantities. The second aldehyde is retinal. As you look at this structure your eyes use the light reaching them to interconvert <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> retinal in your retina to create nervous impulses (see also <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<p class="bindent">The two ketones are all flavour compounds too. The first, (-)-carvone, is the chief component (70&#x0025;) of spearmint oil. Carvone is an interesting compound: in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> you met the mirror-image isomers known as enantiomers, and (-)-carvone&#x0027;s mirror image, (&#x002B;)-carvone, is the chief component (35&#x0025;) of dill oil. Our taste can tell the difference, although an NMR machine can&#x0027;t and both carvones have <i>identicalNMRspectra.</i> See <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> for more detail&#x0021; The second ketone is &#x2018;raspberry ketone&#x0027;, which is largely responsible for the flavour of raspberries. It is entirely responsible for the flavour of some &#x2018;raspberry&#x2019; foods. The signal for the aromatic carbon joined to OH is at 154.3 ppm (in the 100-150 ppm region because it is an unsaturated carbon atom joined to oxygen) and cannot possibly be confused with the ketone signal at 208.8 ppm. Both ketones have C&#x003D;O shifts at about 200 ppm, and both lack any signals in the proton NMR of <b>&#x03B4; ></b> 8.</p>
<p class="ch4">Acid derivatives</p>
<p class="bnoindent">Lipoic acid uses its S-S bond in redox reactions (<a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>), while shikimic acid is an intermediate in the formation of compounds with benzene rings, such as phenylalanine, in living things (<a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>). Salicylic acid&#x0027;s acetate ester is aspirin, which is, of course, like the last example ibuprofen, a painkiller.</p>
<p class="bindent">The first acid chloride is a popular reagent for the synthesis of acetate esters and you have seen its reactions in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. We have chosen three cyclic anhydrides as examples because they are all related to an important reaction (the Diels-Alder reaction), which you will meet in <a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a>.</p>
<p class="bindent">The first ester, methyl methacrylate, is a bulk chemical. It is the monomer whose polymerization gives Perspex, the rigid transparent plastic used in windows and roofs. The second ester is an important local anaesthetic used for minor operations.</p>
<p class="bindent">One amide is the now-familiar DMF, but the other is a tetrapeptide and so contains one carboxylic acid group at the end and three amide groups. Although the four amino acids in this peptide are identical (alanine, Ala for short), the carbon NMR faithfully picks up four different C&#x003D;O signals, all made different by being different distances from the end of the chain.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_410" class="page">Page 410, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The distinction can be vital in structural problems. The symmetrical alkyne diol below cyclizes in acid with Hg(II) catalysis to a compound having, by proton NMR, the structural fragments shown. The product is unsymmetrical in that the two CMe<sub>2</sub> groups are still present, but they are now different. In addition, the chemical shift of the CH<sub>2</sub> group shows that it is next to C&#x003D;O but not next to oxygen. This leaves us with two possible structures. One is an ester and one a ketone. The C&#x003D;O shift is 218.8 ppm and so there is no doubt that the second structure is correct.</p>

It is more important that you realize how spectroscopy enables us to work out what has happened even before we have any idea how. Nonetheless, it is true that the second structure here also makes more sense chemically as the carbon skeleton is the same as in the starting material.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Distinguishing aldehydes from ketones is simple by proton NMR</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now look at the first two groups, the aldehydes and ketones. The two aldehydes have smaller carbonyl shifts than the two ketones, but they are too similar for this distinction to be reliable. What distinguishes the aldehydes very clearly is the characteristic proton signal for CHO at 9-10 ppm. So you should identify aldehydes and ketones by C&#x003D;O shifts in carbon NMR and then separate the two by proton NMR.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_18.2.3">
<h3 class="h3">Distinguishing acid derivatives by carbon NMR is difficult</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now examine the other panels on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_409">409</a>. The four carboxylic acids are all important biologically or medicinally. Their C&#x003D;O shifts are very different <i>from each other</i> as well as from those of the aldehydes or ketones.</p>
<p class="indent">The next five compounds (two acid chlorides and three anhydrides) are all reactive acid derivatives, and the five esters and amides below them are all unreactive acid derivatives and yet the C&#x003D;O shifts of all ten compounds fall in the same range. The C&#x003D;O chemical shift is obviously <i>not</i> a good way to check on chemical reactivity.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">What the carbon NMR fails to do is distinguish these types of acid derivative. There is more variation between the carboxylic acids on display than between the different classes of acid derivatives. This should be obvious if we show you some compounds containing two acid derivatives. Would you care to assign these signals?</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_410_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">No, neither would we. In each case the difference between the carbonyl signals is only a few ppm. Although acid chlorides are extremely reactive in comparison with esters or amides, the electron deficiency at the carbon nucleus as measured by deshielding in the NMR spectrum evidently does not reflect this. Carbon NMR reliably distinguishes acid derivatives as a group from aldehydes and ketones as another group but it fails to distinguish even very reactive (for <a id="page_411" class="page">Page 411, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a>example, acid chlorides) fromexample, acid chlorides) from very unreactive (for example, amides) acid derivatives. So how do we distinguish acid derivatives?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_18.3">
<h2 class="h2">Acid derivatives are best distinguished by infrared</h2>
<p class="noindent">A much better measure is the difference in IR stretching frequency of the C&#x003D;O group. We discussed this in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> (p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_206">206</a>), where we noted a competition between conjugation by lone-pair electron donation <i>into</i> the carbonyl from OCOR, OR, or NH<sub>2</sub> and inductive withdrawal <i>from</i> the C&#x003D;O group because of the electronegativity of the substituent. Conjugation donates electrons into the <i>&#x03C0;*</i> orbital of the &#x03C0; bond and so lengthens and weakens it. The C&#x003D;O bond becomes more like a single bond and its stretching frequency moves towards the singlebond region, that is, it goes <i>down.</i> The inductive effect removes electrons from the &#x03C0; orbital and so shortens and strengthens the &#x03C0; bond. It becomes more like a full double bond and moves <i>up</i> in frequency.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> For a reminder of the distinction between conjugation and inductive effects, see <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_176">176</a>.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_411_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">These effects are balanced in different ways according to the substituent. Chlorine is poor at lone-pair electron donation (its lone pair is in a large 3p orbital and overlaps badly with the 2p orbital on carbon) but strongly electron-withdrawing so acid chlorides absorb at high frequency, almost in the triple-bond region. Anhydrides have an oxygen atom between two carbonyl groups. Inductive withdrawal is still strong but conjugation is weak because the lone pairs are pulled both ways. Esters have a well-balanced combination with the inductive effect slightly stronger (oxygen donates from a compatible 2p orbital but is very electronegative and so withdraws electrons strongly as well). Finally, amides are dominated by conjugation as nitrogen is a much stronger electron donor than oxygen because it is less electronegative.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Conjugation with &#x03C0; electrons or lone pairs affects IR C&#x003D;O stretches</h3>
<p class="noindent">We need to see how conjugation works when it is with a &#x03C0; bond rather than with a lone pair. This will make the concept more general as it will apply to aldehydes and ketones as well as to acid groups. How can we detect whether an unsaturated carbonyl compound is conjugated or not? Well, compare these two unsaturated aldehydes.</p>

<p class="indent">The key differences are the frequency of the C&#x003D;O stretch (lowered by 40 cm<sup>-1</sup> by conjugation) and the strength (that is, the intensity) of the C&#x003D;C stretch (increased by conjugation) in the IR. In the <sup>13</sup>C NMR, C3 in the conjugated enal is moved out of the alkene region just into the carbonyl region, showing how electron-deficient this carbon atom must be. In the proton NMR there are many effects but the downfield shift of the protons on the alkene, especially C3 (again&#x0021;), is probably the most helpful.</p>

In a six-membered ring, the sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals forming the &#x03C3; framework around the carbonyl group can overlap perfectly with the sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals on neighbouring carbon atoms because the orbital angle and the bond angle are the same. In a four-membered ring the orbitals do not point towards those on the neighbouring carbon atoms, but point too far out, effectively forcing the bonds to be bent and lowering the degree of overlap.</p>

<p class="noindent2">A further good example is the difference between C&#x003D;O stretching frequencies in cyclic amides, or lactams. The penicillin class of antibiotics all contain a four-membered ring amide known as a &#x03B2;-lactam. The carbonyl stretching frequency in these compounds is way above the 1680 cm<sup>-1</sup> of the sixmembered lactam, which is what you might expect for an unstrained amide.</p>

<p class="indent">Ideally, we should like the orbitals to have an angle of 90&#x00B0; as this would make the orbital angle the same as the bond angle. In theory it <i>would</i> be possible to have a bond angle of 90&#x00B0; if we used pure p orbitals instead of sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals. The diagram in the margin shows this hypothetical situation. If we did this, we should leave a pure s orbital for the &#x03C3; bond to oxy-gen. This extreme is not possible, but a compromise is. <i>Some</i> more p character goes into the ring bonds&#x2014;maybe they become s<sup>0.8</sup>p<sup>3.2</sup>&#x2014;so that they can approach the 90&#x00B0; angle needed, and the same amount of extra s character goes into the &#x03C3; bond to oxygen.

<h3 class="h3">NMR spectra of alkynes and small rings</h3>
<p class="noindent">This idea that small rings have more p character in the ring and more s character outside the ring also explains the effects of small rings on proton NMR shifts. These hydrogens, particularly on three-membered rings, resonate at unusually high fields, between 0 and 1 ppm in cyclopropanes instead of the 1.3 ppm expected for CH<sub>2</sub> groups, and may even appear at negative &#x03B4; values. High p character in the framework of small rings also means high s character in C-H bonds outside the ring and this will mean shorter bonds, greater shielding, and small &#x03B4; values.</p>
<div class="bbox1">
<h3 class="ch3">Three-membered rings and alkynes</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">You have also seen the same argument used in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> to justify the unusual acidity of C-H protons on triple bonds (such as alkynes and HCN), and alluded to in <a href="chapter_3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> to explain the stretching frequency of the same C-H bonds. Like alkynes, three-membered rings are also unusually easy to deprotonate in base.</p>
<p class="bindent">Here is an example where deprotonation occurs at a different site in two compounds identical except for a C-C bond closing a three-membered ring. The first is an ortholithiation of the type discussed in <a href="chapter_24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/pg_414_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now what about the NMR spectra of alkynes? By the same argument, protons on alkynes ought to appear in the NMR at quite high field because the C atom is sp hybridized, so it makes its &#x03C3; bonds with sp orbitals (i.e. 50&#x0025; s character). Protons on a typical alkene have &#x03B4;<sub>&#x03BA;</sub> about 5.5 ppm, while the proton on an alkyne comes right in the middle of the protons on saturated carbons at about &#x03B4;<sub>&#x03BA;</sub> 2-2.5 ppm This is rather a large effect just for increased s character and some of it is probably due to better shielding by the triple bond, which surrounds the linear alkyne with &#x03C0; bonds without a nodal plane.</p>

<figure class="fig1">

</aside>
<p class="indent">This means that the carbon atoms also appear at higher field than expected, not in the alkene region but from about &#x03B4;,^ 60-80 ppm. The s character argument is important, however, because shielding can&#x0027;t affect IR stretching frequencies, yet C&#x003D;C-H stretches are strong and at about 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup>, just right for a strong C-H bond.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Interactions between different nuclei can give enormous coupling constants</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have looked at coupling between hydrogen atoms and you may have wondered why we have ignored coupling between other NMR active nuclei. Why does <sup>13</sup>C not cause similar couplings? In this section we are going to consider not only couplings between the same kind of nuclei, <a id="page_416" class="page">Page 416, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a>such as two protons, called homonuclear coupling, but also coupling between different nuclei, such as a proton and a fluorine atom or <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>31</sup>P, called heteronuclear coupling.</p>
<p class="indent">Two nuclei are particularly important, <sup>19</sup>F and <sup>31</sup>P, since many organic compounds contain these elements and both are at essentially 100&#x0025; natural abundance and have spin <i>I</i> &#x003D; 1/2. We shall start with organic compounds that have just one of these nuclei and see what hap-pens to both the <sup>1</sup>H and the <sup>13</sup>C spectra. In fact, it is easy to find a <sup>19</sup>F or a <sup>31</sup>P atom in a molecule because these elements couple to all nearby carbon and hydrogen atoms. Since they can be directly bonded to either, <sup>1</sup><i>J</i> coupling constants such as <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>CF</sub> or <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>PH</sub> become possible, as well as the more &#x2018;normal&#x2019; couplings such as <sup>2</sup><i>J</i><sub>CF</sub> or <sup>3</sup><i>J</i><sub>PH</sub>, and these <sup>1</sup>J coupling constants can be enormous.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Note that these spectra with heteronuclear couplings provide the only cases where we can see one doublet in the proton NMR. Normally, if there is one doublet, there must be another signal with at least this complexity as all coupling appears twice (A couples to B and so B also couples to A!). If the coupling is to another element (here phosphorus) then the coupling appears once in each spectrum. The Wittig reagent has an A<sub>3</sub>P (CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;P) system: proton A appears as a doublet, while the phosphorus atom appears as a quartet in the phosphorus spectrum at a completely different frequency, but with the same coupling constant measured in Hz.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We shall start with a simple phosphorus compound, the dimethyl ester of phosphorous acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>). There is an uncertainty about the structure of both the acid and its esters. They could exist as P(III) compounds with a lone pair of electrons on phosphorus, or as P(V) compounds with a P&#x003D; O double bond.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_416_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In fact, dimethyl phosphite has a 1H doublet with the amazing coupling constant of 693 Hz: on a 250 MHz machine the two lines are over 2 ppm apart and it is easy to miss that they are two halves of the same doublet. This can only be a <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PH</sub> as it is so enormous. The compound has to have a P-H bond and the P(V) structure is correct. The coupling to the protons of the methyl group is much smaller but still large for a three-bond coupling (<sup>3</sup><i>J</i><sub>PC</sub> of 18 Hz).</p>
<p class="indent">Next, consider the phosphonium salt you met at the end of <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for use in the Wittig reaction, turning aldehydes and ketones to alkenes. It has a <sup>2</sup><i>J</i><sub>PH</sub> of 18 Hz. There is no doubt about this structure&#x2014;it is just an illustration of coupling to phosphorus. There is coupling to phosphorus in the carbon spectrum too: the methyl group appears at 6<sub>C</sub> 10.6 ppm with a <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PC</sub> of 57 Hz, somewhat smaller than typical <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PH</sub>.

<h3 class="h3">Coupling between protons and <sup>13</sup>C</h3>
<p class="noindent">In view of all this, you may ask why we don&#x0027;t apparently see couplings between <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H in either carbon or proton spectra. In proton spectra the answer is simple: we don&#x0027;t see coupling to <sup>13</sup>C because of the low abundance (1.1&#x0025;) of <sup>13</sup>C. Most protons are bonded to <sup>12</sup>C: only 1.1&#x0025; of protons are bonded to <sup>13</sup>C. If you look closely at proton spectra with very flat baselines, you may see small peaks either side of strong peaks at about 0.5&#x0025; peak height. These are the <sup>13</sup>C &#x2018;satellites&#x2019; for those protons that are bonded to <sup>13</sup>C atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">As an example, look again at the 500 MHz <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of heptan-2-one that we saw on p. <a href="chapter_13.xhtml#page_294">294</a>. When the baseline of this spectrum is vertically expanded, the <sup>13</sup>C satellites may be seen. The singlet due to the methyl protons is actually in the centre of a tiny doublet due to the 1&#x0025; of protons coupling to <sup>13</sup>C. Similarly, each of the triplets in the spectrum is flanked by two tiny triplets. The two tiny triplets on either side make up a doublet of triplets with a large <sup>1</sup>J coupling constant to the <sup>13</sup>C (around 130 Hz) and smaller <sup>3</sup>J coupling to the two equivalent protons.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_417_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><sup>13</sup>C satellites are usually lost in the background noise of the spectrum and need concern us no further. You do, however, see coupling in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum with compounds deliberately labelled with <sup>13</sup>C because the <sup>13</sup>C abundance can then approach 100%. The same Wittig reagent we saw a moment ago shows a 3H doublet of doublets with the typically enormous <sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub> of 135 Hz when labelled with pure <sup>13</sup>C in the methyl group.<a id="page_418" class="page">Page 418, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_417_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">But this begs the question&#x2014;where is the 135 Hz coupling in the <sup>13</sup>C NMR? Surely we should see this coupling to the protons in the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum too?</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_18.8.3">
<h3 class="h3">Why is there no coupling to protons in normal <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra?</h3>
<p class="noindent">We get the singlets consistently seen in carbon spectra because of the way we record the spectra. The values of <sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub> are so large that, if we recorded <sup>13</sup>C spectra with all the coupling constants, we would get a mass of overlapping peaks. When run on the same spectrometer, the frequency at which <sup>13</sup>C nuclei resonate turns out to be about a quarter of that of the protons. Thus a &#x2018;400 MHz machine&#x2019; (remember that the magnet strength is usually described by the frequency at which the protons resonate) gives <sup>13</sup>C spectra at 100 MHz. Coupling constants (<sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub>) of 100-250 Hz would cover 2-5 ppm and a CH<sub>3</sub> group with <sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub> of about 125 Hz would give a quartet covering nearly 8 ppm (see the example on the previous page).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_418_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Since the proton-coupled <sup>13</sup>C spectrum can so easily help us to distinguish CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>, CH, and quaternary carbons, you might wonder why they are not used more. The above example was chosen very carefully to illustrate proton-coupled spectra at their best. Unfortunately, this is not a typical example. More usually, the confusion from overlapping peaks makes this just not worthwhile. So <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra are recorded while the whole 10 ppm proton spectrum is being irradiated with a secondary radio frequency source. The proton energy levels are equalized by this process and all coupling disappears. Hence the singlets we are used to seeing.</p>
<p class="indent">For the rest of this chapter we shall not be introducing new theory or new concepts; we shall be applying what we have told you to a series of examples where spectroscopy enables chemists to identify compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reactive intermediates can be detected by spectroscopy</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some intermediates proposed in reaction mechanisms look so unlikely that it is comforting if they can be isolated and their structure determined. We feel more confident in proposing an intermediate if we are sure that it can really be made. Of course, this is not necessarily evidence that the intermediate is actually formed during reactions and it certainly does <i>not</i> follow that the failure to isolate a given intermediate disproves its involvement in a reaction. We shall use ketene as an example.</p>

<p class="indent">Ketene looks pretty unlikely&#x0021; It is CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;C&#x003D;O with two &#x03C0; bonds (C&#x003D;C and C&#x003D;O) to the same carbon atom. The orbitals for these &#x03C0; bonds must be orthogonal because the central carbon atom is sp hybridized with two linear &#x03C3; bonds and two p orbitals at right angles both to the &#x03C3; bonds and to each other. Can such a molecule exist? When acetone vapour is heated to very high temperatures (700-750 &#x00B0;C) methane is given off and ketene is supposed to be the other product. What is isolated is a ketene dimer (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and even the structure of this is in doubt as two reasonable structures can be written.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Squares and cubes: molecules with unusual structures</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some structures are interesting because we believe they can tell us something fundamental about the nature of bonding while others are a challenge because many people argue that they cannot be made. What do you think are the prospects of making cyclobutadiene, a conjugated four-membered ring, or the hydrocarbons tetrahedrane and cubane, which have, respectively, the shapes of the perfectly symmetrical Euclidean solids, the tetrahedron and the cube?</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</aside>
<p class="indent">With four electrons, cyclobutadiene is anti-aromatic&#x2014;it has <i>4n</i> instead of <i>4n</i> &#x002B; 2 electrons. You saw in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> that cyclic conjugated systems with 4n electrons (cyclooctatetraene, for example) avoid being conjugated by puckering into a tub shape. Cyclobutadiene cannot do this: it must be more or less planar, and so we expect it to be very unstable. Tetrahedrane has four fused three-membered rings. Although the molecule is tetrahedral in shape, each carbon atom is nowhere near a tetrahedron, with three bond angles of 60&#x00B0;. Cubane has six fused four- membered rings and is again highly strained.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, cubane has been made, cyclobutadiene has a fleeting existence but can be isolated as an iron complex, and a few substituted versions of tetrahedrane have been made. The most convincing evidence that you have made any of these three compounds would be the extreme simplicity of the spectra. Each has only one kind of hydrogen and only one kind of carbon. They all belong to the family (CH)<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Cubane has a molecular ion in the mass spectrum at 104, correct for C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, only CH stretches in the IR at 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, a singlet in the proton NMR at 4.0 ppm, and a single line in the carbon <a id="page_421" class="page">Page 421, Chapter 18: Review of spectroscopic methods</a>NMR at 47.3 ppm. It is a very symmetrical molecule and a stable one in spite of all those four- membered rings.</p>
<p class="indent">Stable compounds with a cyclobutadiene and a tetrahedrane core can be made if each hydrogen atom is replaced by a t-butyl group. The very large groups round the edge of the molecule repel each other and hold the inner core tightly together. Now another difficulty arises&#x2014;it is rather hard to tell the compounds apart. They both have four identical carbon atoms in the core and four identical <i>t</i>-butyl groups round the edge. The starting material for a successful synthesis of both was the tricyclic ketone below identified by its strained C&#x003D;O stretch and partly symmetrical NMR spectra. When this ketone was irradiated with UV light (indicated by &#x2018;hv&#x2019; in the scheme), carbon monoxide was evolved and a highly symmetrical compound (t-BuC)<sub>4</sub> was formed. But which compound was it?</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The story is made more complicated (but in the end easier&#x0021;) by the discovery that this compound on heating turned into another very similar compound. There are only two possible structures for (t-BuC)<sub>4</sub>, so clearly one compound must be the tetrahedrane and one the cyclo- butadiene. The problem simplifies with this discovery because it is easier to distinguish two possibilities when you can make comparisons between two sets of spectra. Here both compounds gave a molecular ion in the mass spectrum, neither had any interesting absorptions in the IR, and the proton NMRs could belong to either compound as they simply showed four identical t-Bu groups. So did the carbon NMR, of course, but it showed the core too. The first product had only saturated carbon atoms, while the second had a signal at 152.7 ppm for the unsaturated carbons. The tetrahedrane is formed from the tricyclic ketone on irradiation but it isomerizes to the cyclobutadiene on heating.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Identifying compounds from nature</h3>
<p class="noindent">The next molecules we need to know how to identify are those discovered from nature&#x2014; natural products. These often have biological activity and many useful medicines have been discovered this way. We shall look at a few examples from different fields. The first is the sex pheromone of the Trinidad butterfly <i>Lycorea ceres ceres.</i> The male butterflies start courtship by emitting a tiny quantity of a volatile compound. Identification of this type of compound is very difficult because of the minute amounts available but this compound was crystallized and gave enough for a mass spectrum and an IR. The highest peak in the mass spectrum was at 135. This is an odd number so we might have one nitrogen atom and a possible composition of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>9</sub>ON. The IR showed a carbonyl peak at 1680 cm<sup>-1</sup>. With only this meagre information, the first proposals were for a pyridine aldehyde.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_421_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Eventually a little more compound (6 mg&#x0021;) was available and a proton NMR spectrum was run. This showed at once that this structure was wrong. There was no aldehyde proton and only one methyl group. More positive information was the pair of triplets showing a -CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>- unit between two electron-withdrawing groups (N and C&#x003D;O?) and the pair of doublets for neighbouring protons on an aromatic ring, although the chemical shift and the coupling constant are both rather small for a benzene ring.</p>
<p class="indent">If we look at what we have got so far, we see that we have accounted for four carbon atoms in the methyl and carbonyl groups and the -CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>- unit. This leaves only four carbon atoms for the aromatic ring. We must use nitrogen too as the only possibility is a pyrrole ring. Our fragments are now those shown below (the black dotted lines show joins to another fragment). These account for all the atoms in the molecule and suggest structures such as these.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> Pyrrole was introduced in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, p. <a href="chapter_7.xhtml#page_162">162</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Now we need to use the known chemical shifts and coupling constants for these sorts of molecules. An N-Me group would normally have a larger chemical shift than 2.2 ppm so we prefer the methyl group on a carbon atom of the pyrrole ring. Typical shifts and coupling constants around pyrroles are shown below. Chemists do not, of course, remember these numbers; we look them up in tables. Our data, with chemical shifts of 6.09 and 6.69 ppm and a coupling constant of 2.5 Hz, clearly favour hydrogen atoms in the 2 and 3 positions, and suggest this structure for the sex pheromone, which was confirmed by synthesis and is now accepted as correct.</p>

We need to look at all the common substituents and see what shifts they cause relative to the CH skeleton of the molecule.

All the electron-withdrawing groups based on carbonyl and cyanide have about the same effect (1.1-1.3 ppm downfield shift from 0.9 ppm). Groups based on nitrogen (Me-N bond) show a similar progression through amine, ammonium salt, amide, and nitro compound (entries 15-18). Finally, all the oxygen-based groups (Me-O bond) show large shifts (entries 19-22).</p>

<p class="noindent">It is more difficult to give a definitive list for CH<sub>2</sub> groups as they have two substituents. In the table below we set one substituent as phenyl (Ph) just because so many compounds of this kind are available, and give the actual shifts relative to PhCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> for protons (2.64 ppm) and PhCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> for carbon (28.9 ppm), again comparing the substituent with the CH skeleton.</p>
<p class="indent">If you compare the shifts caused on a CH<sub>2</sub> group by each functional group in the table below with the shifts caused on a CH<sub>3</sub> group by the same functional group in the table on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_423">423</a> you will see that they are broadly the same.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Shifts in proton NMR are easier to calculate and more informative than those in carbon NMR</h3>
<p class="noindent">This final table, on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_426">426</a>, helps to explain something we have avoided so far. Correlations of shifts caused by substituents in proton NMR really work very well. Those in <sup>13</sup>C NMR work much less well and more complicated equations are needed. More strikingly, the proton shifts often seem to fit better with our understanding of the chemistry of the compounds. There are two main reasons for this.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the carbon atom is much closer to the substituent than the proton. In the compounds in the table on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_423">423</a> the methyl carbon atom is directly bonded to the substituent, while the protons are separated from it by the carbon atom of the methyl group. If the functional group is based on a large electron-withdrawing atom like sulfur, the protons will experience a simple inductive electron withdrawal and have a proportional downfield shift. The carbon atom is close enough to the sulfur atom to be shielded as well by the lone-pair electrons in the large 3sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. The proton shift caused by S in Me<sub>2</sub>S is about the same (1.23 ppm) as that caused by a set of more or less equally strong electron-withdrawing groups like CN (1.14 ppm) or ester (1.18 ppm). The carbon shift (9.7 ppm) is less than that caused by an ester (11.2 ppm) but much <i>more</i> than that caused by CN, which actually shifts the carbon upfield (-6.6 ppm) relative to the effect of a methyl group.</p>

<p class="indent">Second, the carbon shift is strongly affected not only by what is directly joined to that atom (&#x03B1; position), but also by what comes next (&#x03B2; position). The right-hand half of the table on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_424">424</a> shows what happens to methyl shifts when substituents are placed on the next carbon atom. There is very little effect on the proton spectrum: all the values are much less than the shifts caused by the same substituent on a methyl group in the table on p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_423">423</a>. Carbonyls give a downfield shift of about 1.2 ppm when directly joined to a methyl group, but only of about 0.2 ppm when one atom further away. By contrast, the shifts in the carbon spectrum are of the same order of magnitude in the two tables, and the &#x03B2; shift may even be greater than the &#x03B1; shift&#x0021; The CN group shifts a directly bonded methyl group upfield (-6.6 ppm) when directly bonded, but downfield (14.4 ppm) when one atom further away. This is an exaggerated example, but the point is that these carbon shifts must <i>not</i> be used to suggest that the CN group is electron-donating in the &#x03B1; position and electron- withdrawing in the &#x03B2; position. The carbon shifts are erratic but the proton shifts give us useful information and are worth understanding as a guide to both structure determination and the chemistry of the compound.</p>
<p class="indent">When you use this table and are trying to interpret, say, a methyl group at 4.0 ppm then you have no problem. Only one group is attached to a methyl group so you need a single shift value&#x2014;it might be a methyl ester, for example. But when you have a CH<sub>2</sub> group at 4.5 ppm and you are inter-preting a downfield shift of 3.2 ppm you must beware. There are <i>two</i> groups attached to each CH<sub>2</sub> group and you might need a single shift of about 3 ppm (say, an ester again) or two shifts of 1.5 ppm, and so on. The shifts are additive.</p>
