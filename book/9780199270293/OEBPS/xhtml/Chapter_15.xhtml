<h2 class="h2">Mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution</h2>
<p class="noindent">Substitution is the replacement of one group by another. You met such reactions in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, and an example is shown in the margin. This reaction is a substitution because the Cl group is replaced by the NH<sub>2</sub> group. You learnt to call the molecule of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) the <b>nucleophile</b> and the chloride you called the <b>leaving group</b>. In <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, the substitution reactions always took place at the <i>trigonal</i> (sp<sup>2</sup>) carbon atom of a carbonyl group.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In this chapter we shall be looking at reactions such as the second reaction in the margin. These are substitution reactions, because the Cl group is replaced by the PhS group. But the CH<sub>2</sub> group at which the reaction takes place is a <i>tetrahedral</i> (sp<sup>3</sup>), or <i>saturated,</i> carbon atom, rather than a C&#x003D;O group. This reaction and the one above may look superficially the same but they are quite different in mechanism. The requirements of good reagents are also different in substitutions at carbonyl groups and at saturated carbon&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why we changed the nucleophile from NH<sub>3</sub> to PhS<sup>-</sup>: ammonia would not give a good yield of PhCH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> in the second reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#x2019;s have a look at why the mechanisms of the two substitutions must be different. Here&#x2019;s a summary of the mechanism of the first reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">In the first step the nucleophile attacks the C&#x003D;O &#x03C0; bond. It&#x2019;s immediately obvious that the first step is no longer possible at a saturated carbon atom. The electrons cannot be added to a &#x03C0; bond as the CH<sub>2</sub> group is fully saturated. In fact there is no way for the nucleophile to add before the leaving group departs (as it did in the reaction above) because this would give an impossible five-valent carbon atom.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, two new and different mechanisms become possible. Either the leaving group goes first and the nucleophile comes in later, or the two events happen at the same time. The first of these possibilities you will learn to call the <b>S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism</b>. The second mechanism, which shows how the neutral carbon atom can accept electrons provided it loses some at the same time, you will learn to call the <b>S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism</b>. You will see later that both mechanisms are possible with this molecule, benzyl chloride.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Why is it important to know about the two mechanisms for substitution?</h3>
<p class="noindent2">If we know which mechanism a compound reacts by, we know what sort of conditions to use to get good yields in substitutions. For example, if you look at a commonly used nucleophilic substitution, the replacement of OH by Br, you&#x2019;ll find that two quite different reaction conditions are used depending on the structure of the alcohol. <i>Tertiary</i> alcohols react rapidly with HBr to give tertiary alkyl bromides. <i>Primary</i> alcohols, on the other hand, react only very slowly with HBr and are usually converted to primary alkyl bromides with PBr<sub>3</sub>. The reason is that the first example is an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction while the second is an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction: by the end of this chapter you will have a clear picture of how to predict which mechanism will apply and how to choose appropriate reaction conditions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Kinetic evidence for the S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we go any further we are going to look in a bit more detail at these two mechanisms because they allow us to explain and predict many aspects of substitution reactions. The evidence that convinced chemists that there are two different mechanisms for substitution at saturated carbon is kinetic: it relates to the rate of reactions such as the displacement of bromide by hydroxide, as shown in the margin.</p>
<p class="indent">It was discovered, chiefly by Hughes and Ingold in the 1930s, that some nucleophilic substitutions are first order (that is, the rate depends only on the concentration of the alkyl halide<a id="page_330" class="page">Page 330, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a> and does not depend on the concentration of the nucleophile), while others are second order (the rate depends on the concentrations of both the alkyl halide and the nucleophile). How can we explain this result? In what we called the &#x2018;S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism&#x2019; on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_329">329</a> there is just one step. Here&#x2019;s the one-step S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism for substitution of n-butyl bromide by hydroxide:</p>

<p class="noindent2">Edward David Hughes (1906&#x2013;63) and Sir Christopher Ingold (1893&#x2013;1970) worked at University College, London in the 1930s. They fi rst thought of many of the mechanistic ideas that chemists now take for granted.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">With only one step, that step must be the <b>rate-determining step</b>. The rate of the overall reaction depends only on the rate of this step, and kinetic theory tells us that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reacting species:</p>

<p class="fig1">rate of reaction &#x003D; <i>k</i>[n-BuBr][HO<sup>-</sup>]</p>
<p class="indent">If this mechanism is right, then the rate of the reaction will be simply and linearly proportional to both [n-BuBr] and [HO<sup>-</sup>]. And it is. Ingold measured the rates of reactions like these and found that they were proportional to the concentration of each reactant&#x2014;in other words they were second order. He called this mechanism Substitution, Nucleophilic, 2nd order; S<sub>N</sub>2 for short. The rate equation is usually given like this, with <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> representing the second-order rate constant.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Significance of the S<sub>N</sub>2 rate equation</h3>
<p class="noindent">This equation is useful for two reasons. Firstly, it gives us a test for the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. Let&#x2019;s illustrate this with another example: the reaction between NaSMe (an ionic solid&#x2014;the nucleophile will be the anion MeS<sup>-</sup>) and MeI to give Me<sub>2</sub>S, dimethyl sulfide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_330_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">To study the rate equation, first, we keep the concentration of NaSMe constant and in a series of experiments vary that of MeI and see what happens to the rate. Then in another set of experiments we keep the concentration of MeI constant and vary that of MeSNa and see what happened to the rate. If the reaction is indeed S<sub>N</sub>2 we should get a linear relationship in both cases: the graphs in the margin show a typical set of results.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_330_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The first graph tells us that the rate is proportional to [MeI], that is, rate &#x003D; k<sub>a</sub>[MeI] and the second graph that it is proportional to [MeSNa], that is, rate &#x003D; k<sub>b</sub>[MeSNa]. But why are the slopes different? If you look at the rate equation for the reaction, you will see that we have incorporated a constant concentration of one of the reagents into what appears to be the rate constant for the reaction. The true rate equation is</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[MeSNa][MeI]</p>
<p class="indent">If [MeSNa] is constant, the equation becomes</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>a</sub>[MeI], where <i>k</i><sub>a</sub> &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[MeSNa]</p>
<p class="indent">If [MeI] is constant, the equation becomes</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>b</sub>[MeSNa], where <i>k</i><sub>b</sub> &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[MeI]</p>
<p class="indent">If you examine the graphs you will see that the slopes are different because</p>
<p class="fig1">slope 1 &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>a</sub> &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[MeSNa], but slope 2 &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>b</sub> &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[MeI]</p>
<p class="indent">We can easily measure the true rate constant <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> from these slopes because we know the constant values for [MeSNa] in the first experiment and for [MeI] in the second. The value of k<sub>2</sub> <a id="page_331" class="page">Page 331, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>from both experiments should be the same. The mechanism for this reaction is indeed S<sub>N</sub>2: the nucleophile MeS<sup>-</sup> attacks as the leaving group I<sup>-</sup> leaves.</p>
<p class="indent">The second reason that the S<sub>N</sub>2 rate equation is useful is that it confirms that the performance of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction depends <b>both on the nucleophile and on the carbon electrophile</b>. We can therefore make a reaction go better (speed it up or improve its yield) by changing either. For example, if we want to displace I<sup>-</sup> from MeI using an oxygen nucleophile we might consider using any of those in the table below.</p>

<p class="indent">The same reasons that made hydroxide ion basic (chiefly that it is unstable as an anion and therefore reactive) make it a good nucleophile. Basicity can be viewed as nucleophilicity towards a proton, and nucleophilicity towards carbon must be related. So if we want a fast reaction, we should use NaOH rather than, say, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to provide the nucleophile. Even at the same concentration, the rate constant <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> with HO<sup>-</sup> as the nucleophile is much greater than the <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> with SO<sub>4</sub>-as the nucleophile.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">You saw in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> that nucleophilicity towards the carbonyl group is closely related to basicity. The same is not quite so true for nucleophilic attack on the saturated carbon atom, as we shall see, but there is a relationship nonetheless.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">But that is not our only option. The reactivity and hence the structure of the carbon electrophile matter too. If we want reaction at a methyl group we can&#x2019;t change the carbon skeleton, but we can change the leaving group. The table below shows what happens if we use the various methyl halides in reaction with NaOH. The best choice for a fast reaction (greatest value of <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) will be to use MeI and NaOH to give methanol.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Significance of the S<sub>N</sub>1 rate equation</h3>
<p class="noindent">If we replace the substitution of n-butyl bromide with a substitution of t-butyl bromide, we get the reaction shown in the margin. It turns out that, kinetically, this reaction is first order: its rate depends only on the concentration of <i>tert</i>-BuBr&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t matter how much hydroxide you add: the rate equation is simply</p>

<p class="indent">The reason for this is that the reaction happens in two steps: first the bromide leaves, to generate a carbocation, and only then does the hydroxide ion move in to attack, forming the alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_332_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism, the formation of the cation is the rate-determining step. This makes good sense: a carbocation is an unstable species and so it will be formed slowly from a stable neutral organic molecule. But once formed, being very reactive, all its reactions will be fast, regardless of the nucleophile. The rate of disappearance of <i>t</i>-BuBr is therefore simply the rate of the slow first step: the hydroxide nucleophile is not involved in this step and therefore does not appear in the rate equation and hence cannot affect the rate. If this is not clear to you, think of a crowd of people trying to leave a railway station or a football match through some turnstiles. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how fast they walk, run, or are driven away in taxis afterwards, it is only the rate of struggling through the turnstiles that determines how fast the station or stadium empties.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, this rate equation is useful because we can determine whether a reaction is S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2. We can plot the same graphs as we plotted before. If the reaction is S<sub>N</sub>2, the graphs look like those we have just seen. But if it is S<sub>N</sub>1, the graphs in the margin show what happens when we vary [<i>t</i>-BuBr] at constant [NaOH] and then vary [NaOH] at constant [<i>t</i>-BuBr].</p>
<p class="indent">The slope of the first graph is simply the first-order rate constant because rate &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>[<i>t</i>-BuBr]. But the slope of the second graph is zero. The rate-determining step does not involve NaOH so adding more of it does not speed up the reaction. The reaction shows first-order kinetics (the rate is proportional to one concentration only) and the mechanism is called S<sub>N</sub>1, that is, Substitution, Nucleophilic, 1st order.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_332_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

</aside>
<p class="indent">This observation is very significant. The fact that the nucleophile does not appear in the rate equation means that not only does its <i>concentration</i> not matter&#x2014;its <i>reactivity</i> doesn&#x2019;t matter either&#x0021; We are wasting our time opening a tub of NaOH to add to this reaction&#x2014;water will do just as well. All the oxygen nucleophiles in the table above react at the <i>same</i> rate with <i>t</i>-BuBr although they react at very different rates with MeI.

<h2 class="h2">How can we decide which mechanism (S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2) will apply to a given organic compound?</h2>
<p class="noindent">So, substitution reactions at saturated C go via one of two alternative mechanisms, each with a very different dependence on the nature of the nucleophile. It&#x2019;s important to be able to predict which mechanism is likely to apply to any reaction, and rather than doing the kinetic experiments to find out, we can give you a few simple pointers to predict which will operate <a id="page_333" class="page">Page 333, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>in which case. The factors that affect the mechanism of the reaction also help to explain why that mechanism operates.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important factor is <b>the structure of the carbon skeleton</b>. A helpful generalization is that compounds that can form relatively stable carbocations generally do so and react by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism, while the others have no choice but to react by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. As you will see in a moment, the most stable carbocations are the ones that have the most substituents, so the more carbon substituents at the reaction centre, the more likely the compound is to react by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">As it happens, the structural factors that make cations stable usually also lead to slower S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions. Heavily substituted compounds are good in S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions, but bad in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction because the nucleophile would have to squeeze its way into the reaction centre past the substituents. It is better for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction if there are only hydrogen atoms at the reaction centre&#x2014;methyl groups react fastest by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. The effects of the simplest structural variations are summarized in the table below (where R is a simple alkyl group like methyl or ethyl).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The only doubtful case is the secondary alkyl derivative, which can react by either mechanism, although it is not very good at either. The first question you should ask when faced with a new nucleophilic substitution is this &#x2018;Is the carbon electrophile methyl, primary, secondary, or tertiary?&#x2019; This will start you off on the right foot, which is why we introduced these important structural terms in <a href="chapter_2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Later in this chapter we will look in more detail at the differences between the two mechanisms and the structures that favour each, but all of what we say will build on the table above.</p>

<h2 class="h2">A closer look at the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In our discussion of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction above, we proposed the t-butyl carbocation as a reasonable intermediate formed by loss of bromide from <i>t</i>-butyl bromide. We now need to explain the evidence we have that carbocations can indeed exist, and the reasons why the <i>t</i>-butyl carbocation is much more stable than, for example, the <i>n</i>-butyl cation.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> we introduced the idea of using a reaction energy profile diagram to follow the progress of a reaction from starting materials to products, via transition states and any intermediates. The energy profile diagram for the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction between <i>t</i>-butyl bromide and water looks something like this:<a id="page_334" class="page">Page 334, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_334_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The carbocation is shown as an intermediate&#x2014;a species with a finite (if short) lifetime for reasons we shall describe shortly. And because we know that the first step, the formation of the carbocation, is slow, that must be the step with the higher energy transition state. The energy of that transition state, which determines the overall rate of the reaction, is closely linked to the stability of the carbocation intermediate, and it is for this reason that the most important factor in determining the efficiency of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is the stability or otherwise of any carbocation that might be formed as an intermediate.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_15.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Shape and stability of carbocations</h3>
<p class="noindent">We discussed the planar shape of the methyl cation in <a href="chapter_4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> (p. <a href="chapter_4.xhtml#page_103">103</a>), and the tert-butyl cation is similar in structure: the electron-deficient central carbon atom has only six electrons, which it uses to form three &#x03C3; bonds, and therefore also carries an empty p orbital. Any carbocation will have a planar carbon atom with an empty p orbital. Think of it this way: only filled orbitals contribute to the energy of a molecule, so if you have to have an unfilled orbital (which a carbocation always does) it is best to make that unfilled orbital as high in energy as possible to keep the filled orbitals low in energy. p orbitals are higher in energy than s orbitals (or hybrid sp, sp<sup>2</sup>, or sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals for that matter) so the carbocation always keeps the p orbital empty.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<h3 class="ch3">Carbocation stability</h3>
<p class="noindent2">The <i>t</i>-butyl carbocation is <i>relatively</i> stable as far as carbocations go, but you would not be able to keep it in a bottle on the shelf! The concept of more and less stable carbocations is important in understanding the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, but it is important to realize that these terms are all relative: even &#x2018;stable&#x2019; carbocations are highly reactive electron-defi cient species.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">We know that the t-butyl cation is stable enough to observe because of the work of George Olah, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1994. The challenge is that carbocations are very reactive electrophiles, so Olah&#x2019;s idea was to have a solution containing no nucleophiles. Any cation must have an anion to balance the charge, so the important advance was to find anions, consisting of a negatively charged atom surrounded by tightly held halogen atoms, which are just too stable to be nucleophilic. Examples include BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>,PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>, and Sb<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>. The first is small and tetrahedral and the others are larger and octahedral.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In these anions, the negative charge does not correspond to a lone pair of electrons (they are like BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in this respect) and there is no orbital high enough in energy to act as a nucleophile. By using a non-nucleophilic solvent, liquid SO<sub>2</sub>, at low temperature, Olah was able to turn alcohols into carbocations with these counterions. This is what happens when <i>tert</i>-butanol is treated with SbF<sub>5</sub> and HF in liquid SO<sub>2</sub>. The acid protonates the hydroxyl group, allowing it to<a id="page_335" class="page">Page 335, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a> leave as water, while the SbF<sub>5</sub> grabs the fluoride ion, preventing it from acting as a nucleophile. The cation is left high and dry.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_335_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The proton NMR of this cation showed just one signal for the three methyl groups at 4.15 ppm, quite far downfield for C&#x2013;Me groups. The <sup>13</sup>C spectrum also showed downfield Me groups at 47.5 ppm, but the key evidence that the cation was formed was the shift of the central carbon atom, which came at an amazing 320.6 ppm, way downfield from anything you have met before. This carbon is very deshielded&#x2014;it is positively charged and extremely electron deficient.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<p class="noindent2">From Olah&#x2019;s work we know what the t-butyl cation looks like by NMR, so can we use NMR to try to detect it as an intermediate in substitution reactions? If we mix t-BuBr and NaOH in an NMR tube and let the reaction run inside the NMR machine, we see no signals belonging to the cation. But this proves nothing. We would not expect a reactive intermediate to be present in any significant concentration. There is a simple reason for this. If the cation is unstable, it will react very quickly with any nucleophile around and there will never be any appreciable amount of cation in solution. Its rate of formation will be much slower than its rate of reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Any charged organic intermediate is inherently unstable because of the charge. A carbocation can be formed only if it has some extra stabilization, and extra stabilization can come to the planar carbocation structure from weak donation of &#x03C3; bond electrons into the empty p orbital of the cation. In the t-butyl cation, three of these donations occur at any one time: it doesn&#x2019;t matter if the C&#x2013;H bonds point up or down; one C&#x2013;H bond of each methyl group must be parallel to one lobe of the empty p orbital at any one time. The first diagram shows one overlap in orbital terms and the second and third diagrams, three as dotted lines.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">There is nothing special about the C&#x2013;H bond donating electrons into an empty orbital: a C&#x2013;C bond is just as good and some bonds are better (C&#x2013;Si, for example). But there must be a bond of some sort&#x2014;a hydrogen atom by itself has no lone pairs and no &#x03C3; bonds so it cannot stabilize a cation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Tertiary carbocations are more stable than primary ones, but powerful stabilization is also provided when there is genuine conjugation between the empty p orbital and adjacent &#x03C0; or lone pair electrons. The allyl cation has a filled (bonding) orbital containing two electrons delocalized over all three atoms and an important empty orbital with coefficients on the end atoms only.

You will notice that pyridine is used as solvent for the reaction. Pyridine (a weak base: the pK<sub>a</sub> of its conjugate acid is 5.5&#x2014;see <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>) is not strong enough to remove the proton from the primary alcohol (pK<sub>a</sub> about 15), and there would be no point in using a base strong enough to make RCH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>-</sup> as the nucleophile makes no difference to an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.

<p class="noindent">The alkyl chloride known as methyl chloromethyl ether, MeOCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, reacts very well with alcohols to form ethers. Being a primary alkyl chloride, you might think that its reactions would follow an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, but in fact it has characteristic S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity. As usual, the reason for its preference for the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism is its ability to form a stabilized carbocation. Loss of the chloride ion is assisted by the adjacent lone pair, and we can draw the resulting cation either as an oxonium ion or as a carbocation.</p>

If the alkyl halide is a methyl compound, we can be sure that the reaction will go by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.

It is worth using a strong base to make the alcohol into a better nucleophile because as we discussed on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_331">331</a> the rate equation for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction tells us that the strength and concentration of the nucleophile affects the rate of the reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">Another way to put this would be to say that the nucleophile, the methyl group, and the leaving group are all present in the transition state for the reaction. The transition state is the highest energy point on the reaction pathway. In the case of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction it will be the point where the new bond from the nucleophile is partly formed while the old bond to the leaving group is not yet completely broken. It will look something like this:</p>

<p class="indent">Another way to look at this situation is to consider the orbitals. The nucleophile must have lone-pair electrons, which will interact with the &#x03C3;* orbital of the C&#x2013;X bond.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have already established that methyl and primary alkyl compounds react well by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, while secondary alkyl compounds undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions only reluctantly. But there are other important structural features that also encourage the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. Two of these, allyl and benzyl groups, also encourage the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">Allyl bromide reacts well with alkoxides to make ethers, and shown below is the typical S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism for this reaction. Also shown is the transition state for this reaction. Allyl compounds react rapidly by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism because the &#x03C0; system of the adjacent double bond can stabilize the transition state by conjugation. The p orbital at the reaction centre (shown in brown, and corresponding to the brown orbital in the diagram on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_340">340</a>) has to make two partial bonds with only two electrons&#x2014;it is electron deficient, and so any additional electron density it can gather from an adjacent &#x03C0; system will stabilize the transition state and increase the rate of the reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_341_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The benzyl group acts in much the same way using the &#x03C0; system of the benzene ring for conjugation with the p orbital in the transition state. Benzyl bromide reacts very well with alkoxides to make benzyl ethers.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the fastest of all S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are those where the leaving group is adjacent to a carbonyl group. With &#x03B1;-bromo carbonyl compounds, two neighbouring carbon atoms are both powerfully electrophilic sites. Each has a low-energy empty orbital&#x2014;&#x03C0;* from C&#x003D;O and &#x03C3;* from C&#x2013;Br (this is what makes them electrophilic)&#x2014;and these can combine to form a new LUMO (&#x03C0;* &#x002B; &#x03C3;*) lower in energy than either. Nucleophilic attack will occur easily where this new orbital has its largest coefficient, shown in orange on the diagram.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_341_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The effect of this interaction between antibonding orbitals is that each group becomes more electrophilic because of the presence of the other&#x2014;the C&#x003D;O group makes the C&#x2013;Br bond more reactive and the Br makes the C&#x003D;O group more reactive. In fact, it may well be that the nucleophile will attack the carbonyl group, but this will be reversible whereas displacement of bromide is irreversible.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many examples of this type of reaction. Reactions with amines go well and the aminoketone products are widely used in the synthesis of drugs.<a id="page_342" class="page">Page 342, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">Contrasts between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2</h2>
<p class="noindent">You have now met the key features of both important mechanisms for substitution. You should at this stage in the chapter have a grasp of the kinetics, the nature of the intermediates and transition states, and the simple steric and electronic factors that control reactivity in S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction pathways.</p>
<p class="indent">We are now going to look in more detail at some other aspects where there are significant contrasts between the mechanisms, either because they lead to different outcomes or because they lead to a change in reactivity towards one or the other of the two pathways.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_15.5.1">
<h3 class="h3">A closer look at steric effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already pointed out that having more alkyl substituents at the reaction centre makes a compound more likely to react by S<sub>N</sub>1 than by S<sub>N</sub>2 for two reasons: firstly they make a carbocation more stable, so favouring S<sub>N</sub>1, and secondly they make it hard for a nucleophile to get close to the reaction centre in the rate-determining step, disfavouring S<sub>N</sub>2. Let&#x2019;s look in more detail at the transition state for the slow steps of the two reactions and see how steric hindrance affects both.<a id="page_343" class="page">Page 343, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>
<p class="indent">In the approach to the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state, the carbon atom under attack gathers in another substituent and becomes (transiently) five-coordinate. The angles between the substituents decrease from tetrahedral to about 90&#x00B0;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.7em;font-size:75%;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">You may hear it said that <i>tert</i>-alkyl compounds do not react by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism because the steric hindrance would be too great. In fact <i>t</i>-alkyl compounds react so fast by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism that the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism wouldn&#x2019;t get a chance even <i>if it went as fast as it goes with methyl compounds</i>. You can see the fi gures that show this in the box on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_338">338</a>. Some tertiary alkyl compounds will react by slow S<sub>N</sub>2 if, for example, S<sub>N</sub>1 is prevented by an adjacent electronwithdrawing carbonyl group.</p>
<p class="bindent">Likewise, primary alkyl halides that experience steric hindrance for other reasons react neither by S<sub>N</sub>1 (because they are primary) nor S<sub>N</sub>2 (because they are hindered)&#x2014;a notorious example is the unreactivity of &#x2018;neopentyl halides&#x2019;.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In the starting material there are four angles of about 109&#x00B0;. In the transition state (enclosed in square brackets and marked &#x2021; as usual) there are three angles of 120&#x00B0; and six angles of 90&#x00B0;, a significant increase in crowding. The larger the substituents R, the more serious this is, and the greater the increase in energy of the transition state. We can easily see the effects of steric hindrance if we compare these three structural types:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="bbull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;methyl: CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;X: very fast S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="bbull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;primary alkyl: RCH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;X: fast S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="bbull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;secondary alkyl: R<sub>2</sub>CH&#x2013;X: slow S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The opposite is true of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. The rate-determining step is simply the loss of the leaving group, and the transition state for this step will look something like the structure shown below&#x2014;with a longer, weaker, and more polarized C&#x2013;X bond than the starting material. The starting material is again tetrahedral (four angles of about 109&#x00B0;) and in the intermediate cation there are just three angles of 120&#x00B0;&#x2014;fewer and less serious interactions. The transition state will be on the way towards the cation, and because the R groups are further apart in the transition state than in the starting material, large R groups will actually <i>decrease</i> the energy of the transition state relative to the starting material. S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions are therefore accelerated by alkyl substituents both for this reason and because they stabilize the cation.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Notice how the transition state for the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is really very close in structure to the carbocation, and you can see that they also lie very close to one another in the energy profile diagram on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_334">334</a>. When we say that the rate of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is increased by stabilization of the carbocation, what we really mean of course is that the rate is increased by stabilization of <i>the transition state leading to</i> the carbocation. However, they are so similar in structure that you can assume that steric and electronic effects on the carbocation will be very similar to those on the carbocation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Look back at the scheme we showed you for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_340">340</a>. It shows the nucleophile attacking the carbon atom on the opposite side from the leaving group. Look carefully at the carbon atom it is attacking and you see that its substituents end up turning inside out as the reaction goes along, just like an umbrella in a high wind. If the carbon atom under attack is a stereogenic centre (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>), the result will be inversion of configuration. Something very different happens in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, and we will now illustrate the difference with a simple sequence of reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">Starting with the optically active secondary alcohol <i>sec</i>-butanol (or butan-2-ol, but we want to emphasize that it is <i>secondary</i>), the secondary cation can be made by the method described on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_338">338</a>. Quenching this cation with water regenerates the alcohol but without any optical<a id="page_344" class="page">Page 344, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a> activity.

<p class="indent">Alternatively, we can first make the hydroxyl group into a good enough leaving group to take part in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. The leaving group we shall use, a sulfonate ester, will be introduced to you in a few pages&#x2019; time, but for now you just need to accept that nucleophilic attack of the OH group on a sulfonyl chloride in pyridine solution gives the sulfonate ester shown below in orange: no bonds have been formed or broken at the chiral carbon atom, which still has (S) stereochemistry.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_344_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now we can carry out an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction on the sulfonate with an acetate anion. A tetra-alkyl ammonium salt is used in the solvent DMF to avoid solvating the acetate, making it as powerful a nucleophile as possible and getting a clean S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. This is the key step and we don&#x2019;t want any doubt about the outcome. The sulfonate is an excellent leaving group&#x2014;the charge is delocalized across all three oxygen atoms.</p>

Unless we know the true rotation for pure sec-butyl acetate, we don&#x2019;t yet know whether it is optically pure nor even whether it really is inverted. We expect it to have (R) stereochemistry, but we can easily find out for sure. All we have to do is to hydrolyse the ester and get the original alcohol back again. We know the true rotation of the alcohol&#x2014;it was our starting material&#x2014;and we know that ester hydrolysis (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) proceeds by attack at the carbonyl carbon&#x2014;it can&#x2019;t affect the stereochemistry of the chiral centre.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The effect of solvent</h3>
<p class="noindent">Why was the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction we have just shown you carried out in DMF? You will generally find S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are carried out in aprotic, and often less polar, solvents. S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions are <a id="page_345" class="page">Page 345, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>typically carried out in polar, protic solvents. A common solvent for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is acetone&#x2014;just polar enough to dissolve the ionic reagents, but not as polar as, say, acetic acid, a common solvent for the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">It is fairly obvious why the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction needs a polar solvent: the rate-determining step involves the formation of ions (usually a negatively charged leaving group and a positively charged carbocation) and the rate of this process will be increased by a polar solvent that can solvate these ions. More precisely, the transition state is more polar than the starting materials (note the charges in brackets in the scheme above) and so is stabilized by the polar solvent. Hence solvents like water or carboxylic acids (RCO<sub>2</sub>H) are ideal.</p>
<p class="indent">It is less obvious why a less polar solvent is better for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. The most common S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions use an anion as the nucleophile. The transition state is then less polar than the localized anion as the charge is spread between two atoms. Here&#x2019;s an example: the formation of an alkyl iodide from an alkyl bromide. Acetone fails to solvate the iodide well, making it more reactive; the transition state is less in need of solvation, so overall the reaction is faster.</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Acetone also assists this reaction because it dissolves sodium iodide but not the sodium bromide product, which precipitates from solution and prevents bromide acting as a competing nucleophile.</p>

<p class="indent">DMF and DMSO, the polar aprotic solvents we discussed in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> (p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_255">255</a>) are also good solvents for S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions because they dissolve ionic compounds well but fail to solvate anions well, making them more reactive.

<h3 class="h3">A closer look at electronic effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">We mentioned above that adjacent &#x03C0; systems increase the rate of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction by stabilizing the transition state, and likewise increase the rate of S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions by stabilizing the carbocation. The effect on the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction applies to both C&#x003D;C (electron-rich) and C&#x003D;O (electron-deficient) &#x03C0; systems, but only C&#x003D;C &#x03C0; systems increase the rate of S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions. Adjacent C&#x003D;O groups in fact significantly decrease the reactivity of alkyl halides towards S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions because the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group greatly destabilizes the carbocation.</p>
<p class="indent">Electron-withdrawing or -donating groups can also tip finely balanced cases from one mechanism to another. For example, benzylic compounds react well by either S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2, and a change of solvent, as just discussed, might switch them from one mechanism to another. Alternatively, a benzylic compound that has a well-placed electron-donating group able to stabilize the cation will also favour the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. Thus 4-methoxybenzyl chloride reacts by S<sub>N</sub>1 for this reason: here we show the methoxy group stabilizing the cation intermediate by assisting departure of the chloride.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_346_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, an electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitro group, within the benzylic compound will decrease the rate of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction and allow the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism to take over.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">Rate measurements for benzylic chlorides illustrate the importance of this effect. We can force them all to react by S<sub>N</sub>1 by using methanol as the solvent (methanol is a poor nucleophile and a polar solvent: both disfavour S<sub>N</sub>2). Comparing with the rate of substitution of benzyl chloride itself, PhCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, 4-methoxybenzyl chloride reacts with methanol about 2500 times faster and the 4-nitrobenzyl chloride about 3000 times more slowly.</p>

Leaving groups involving halides or oxygen atoms are by far the most important, and now we need to establish the principles that make for good and bad leaving groups. As a chemist, we want leaving groups to have some staying power, so that our compounds are not too unstable, but we also don&#x2019;t want them to outstay their welcome&#x2014;they must have just the right level of reactivity.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Halides as leaving groups</h3>
<p class="noindent">With halide leaving groups two main factors are at work: the strength of the C&#x2013;halide bond and the stability of the halide ion. The strengths of the C&#x2013;X bonds can be measured easily, but how can we measure anion stability? One way, which you met in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, was to use the pK<sub>a</sub> values of the acids HX. p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> quantifies the stability of an anion relative to its conjugate acid. We want to know about the stability of an anion relative to that anion bonded to C, not H, but p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> will do as a guide.<a id="page_348" class="page">Page 348, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>
<p class="indent">The table in the margin shows both bond strengths and p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>. It is clearly easiest to break a C&#x2013;I bond and most difficult to break a C&#x2013;F bond. Iodide sounds like the best leaving group. We get the same message from the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values: HI is the strongest acid, so it must ionize easily to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and I<sup>-</sup>. This result is quite correct&#x2014;iodide is an excellent leaving group and fluoride a very bad one, with the other halogens in between.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Nucleophilic substitutions on alcohols: how to get an OH group to leave</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now what about leaving groups joined to the carbon atom by a C&#x2013;O bond? There are many of these but the most important are OH itself, the carboxylic esters, and the sulfonate esters. First we must make one thing clear: alcohols themselves do <i>not</i> react with nucleophiles. In other words, OH<sup>-</sup> is never a leaving group. Why not? For a start hydroxide ion is very basic, and if the nucleophile were strong enough to displace hydroxide ion it would be more than strong enough to remove the proton from the alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_348_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But we do want to use alcohols in nucleophilic substitution reactions because they are easily made (by the reactions in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, for example). The simplest solution is to protonate the OH group with strong acid. This will work only if the nucleophile is compatible with strong acid, but many are. The preparation of t-BuCl from t-BuOH simply by shaking it with concentrated HCl is a good example. This is obviously an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction with the t-butyl cation as intermediate.</p>

<p class="noindent">Rather than use two steps to convert the OH group first to a sulfonate ester, and then displace it, it is possible to use a method that allows us to put an alcohol straight into a reaction mixture and get an S<sub>N</sub>2 product in one operation. This is the Mitsunobu reaction. In this reaction, the alcohol becomes the electrophile, the nucleophile is usually relatively weak (the conjugate base of a carboxylic acid, for example), and there are two other reagents.</p>

Many dyestuffs have an azo group in them&#x2014;you saw some in <a href="chapter_1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.

<p class="indent">So how does the Mitsunobu reaction work? It&#x2019;s a long mechanism, but don&#x2019;t be discouraged: there is a logic to each step and we will guide you through it gently. The first stage involves neither the alcohol nor the added nucleophile. The phosphine adds to the weak N&#x003D;N &#x03C0; bond to give an anion stabilized by one of the ester groups.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_350_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You will note that the nucleophile has been added as its conjugate acid &#x2018;HNu&#x2019;&#x2014;often this might be a carboxylic acid, for example benzoic acid. The anion produced by this first stage is basic enough to remove a proton from this acid, generating Nu<sup>-</sup> ready for reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_350_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Oxygen and phosphorus have a strong affinity, as we saw in the conversion of alcohols to bromides with PBr<sub>3</sub> (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_348">348</a>) and in the Wittig reaction (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, pp. <a href="chapter_11.xhtml#page_237">237</a>&#x2013;8), and the positively charged phosphorus is now attacked by the alcohol, displacing a second nitrogen anion in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at phosphorus. The nitrogen anion generated in this step is stabilized by conjugation with the ester, but rapidly removes the proton from the alcohol to give an electro-philic R-O-PPh<sup>&#x002B;</sup><sub>3</sub> species and a by-product, the reduced form of DEAD.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_350_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Finally, the anion of the nucleophile can now attack this phosphorus derivative of the alcohol in a normal S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at carbon with the phosphine oxide as the leaving group. We have arrived at the products.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_350_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The whole process takes place in one operation. The four reagents are all added to one flask and the products are the phosphine oxide, the reduced azo diester with two NH bonds replacing the N&#x003D;N double bond, and the product of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction on the alcohol. Another way to look at this reaction is that a molecule of water must formally be lost: OH must be removed from the alcohol and H from the nucleophile. These atoms end up in very stable molecules&#x2014; the P&#x003D;O and N&#x2013;H bonds are strong where the N&#x003D;N bond was weak, compensating for the sacrifice of the strong C&#x2013;O bond in the starting alcohol.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ethers are stable molecules that do not react with nucleophiles: THF and Et<sub>2</sub>O are widely used as solvents for this reason. To make them react, we need to make the oxygen positively charged so that it can accept electrons more readily, and we also need to use a very good nucleophile. A good way of doing both is to treat with HBr or HI, which protonate the oxygen. Iodide and bromide are excellent nucleophiles in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions (see below), and attack will occur preferentially at the carbon atom more susceptible to S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions (usually the less hindered one).

Nitriles, for example, are very poorly basic and nucleophilic because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is in a low-energy sp orbital. However, if <i>t</i>-butanol is dissolved in a nitrile as solvent and strong acid is added, a reaction does take place. The acid does not protonate the nitrile, but does protonate the alcohol to produce the <i>t</i>-butyl cation in the usual first step of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. This cation is reactive enough to combine with even such a weak nucleophile as the nitrile.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_353_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The resulting cation is captured by the water molecule released in the first step and an exchange of protons leads to a secondary amide. The overall process is called the Ritter reaction and it is one of the few reliable ways to make a C&#x2013;N bond to a tertiary centre.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The nucleophile in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, a good nucleophile is essential. We finish this chapter with a survey of effective choices for forming new bonds to sp<sup>3</sup> by S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, and a description of the factors that determine how good a nucleophile will be.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_15.8.1">
<h3 class="h3">Nitrogen nucleophiles: a problem and a solution</h3>
<p class="noindent">Amines are good nucleophiles, but reactions between ammonia and alkyl halides rarely lead cleanly to single products. The problem is that the product of the substitution is at least as nucleophilic as the starting material, so it competes for reaction with the alkyl halide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_353_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Even this is not all&#x0021; The alkylation steps keep going, forming the secondary and tertiary amines, and stopping only when the non-nucleophilic tetra-alkylammonium ion R<sub>4</sub>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is formed. The problem is that the extra alkyl groups push more and more electron density onto N, making each product more reactive than the previous. The quaternary ammonium salt could probably be made cleanly if a large excess of alkyl halide RX is used, but other more controlled methods are needed for the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines.</p>
<p class="indent">One solution for primary amines is to replace ammonia with azide ion N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. This linear triatomic species, nucleophilic at both ends, is a slender rod of electrons able to insert itself into almost any electrophilic site. It is available as the water-soluble sodium salt NaN<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">Sometimes these alkylations can work, but usually only if the alkylating agent or the amine is very hindered, or the alkylating agent contains an inductive electron-withdrawing group (such as the hydroxyl group generated when an epoxide is opened: epoxides are reliable alkylating agents for amines). With amine alkylations, you should nonetheless always expect the worst.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Azide reacts only once with alkyl halides because the product, an alkyl azide, is no longer nucleophilic. However, rarely is the azide product required: it is usually reduced to a primary amine by catalytic hydrogenation (H<sub>2</sub> over a Pd catalyst&#x2014;see <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>), LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, or triphenylphosphine.</p>

<p class="indent">Sulfur is plainly a better nucleophile than oxygen for saturated carbon. Why should this be? As we discussed back in <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, there are two main factors controlling bimolecular reactions: (1) electrostatic attraction (simple attraction of opposite charges or partial charges) and (2) bonding interactions between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the electrophile.<a id="page_356" class="page">Page 356, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>
<p class="indent">A proton is, of course, positively charged, so electrostatic attraction is the more important factor in nucleophilicity towards H&#x002B;, or pK<sub>a</sub>. The carbonyl group too has a substantial positive charge on the carbon atom, arising from the uneven distribution of electrons in the C&#x003D;O &#x03C0; bond, and reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl groups are also heavily influenced by electrostatic attraction, with HOMO&#x2013;LUMO interactions playing a smaller role.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to saturated carbon atoms carrying leaving groups, polarization is typically much less important. There is, of course, some polarity in the bond between a saturated carbon atom and, say, a bromine atom, but the electronegativity difference between C and Br is less than half that between C and O. In alkyl iodides, one of the best classes of electrophiles in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, there is in fact almost no dipole at all&#x2014;the electronegativity of C is 2.55 and that of I is 2.66.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">What does matter is the strength of the HOMO&#x2013;LUMO interaction. In a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, the nucleophile adds in to the low-energy &#x03C0;* orbital. In a nucleophilic attack on a saturated carbon atom, the nucleophile must donate its electrons to the &#x03C3;* orbital of the C&#x2013;X bond, as illustrated in the margin for an alkyl bromide reacting with the nonbonding lone pair of a nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x03C3;* antibonding orbitals are, of course, higher in energy than non-bonding lone pairs, but the higher the energy of the nucleophile&#x2019;s lone pair, the better the overlap. The 3sp<sup>3</sup> lone-pair electrons of sulfur overlap better with the high-energy &#x03C3;* orbital of the C&#x2013;X bond than do the lower energy 2sp<sup>3</sup> lone-pair electrons on oxygen because the higher energy of the sulfur electrons brings them closer in energy to the C&#x2013;X &#x03C3;* orbital. The conclusion is that nucleophiles from lower down the periodic table are more effective in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions than those from the top rows.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Hard and soft nucleophiles</h3>
<p class="noindent">The fact that some nucleophiles, like R<sub>3</sub>P: and RS<sup>-</sup>, react very fast at saturated C atoms (they have high-energy lone pairs), but very poorly at C&#x003D;O groups (they are either uncharged or have charge spread diffusely over large orbitals) gives them a different type of character from strongly basic nucleophiles like HO<sup>-</sup> that attack C&#x003D;O groups rapidly. We call nucleophiles that react well at saturated carbon <b>soft</b> nucleophiles; those that are more basic and react well with carbonyl groups are referred to as <b>hard</b> nucleophiles. These are useful and evocative terms because the soft nucleophiles are indeed rather large and flabby with diffuse high-energy electrons while the hard nucleophiles are small and spiky with closely held electrons and high charge density.</p>
<p class="indent">When we say &#x2018;hard&#x2019; (nucleophile or electrophile) we refer to species whose reactions are dominated by electrostatic attraction and when we say &#x2018;soft&#x2019; (nucleophile or electrophile) we refer to species whose reactions are dominated by HOMO&#x2013;LUMO interactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Nucleophiles and leaving groups compared</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> we explained that, in a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, a good nucleophile is a bad leaving group and vice versa. We set you the challenge of predicting which way the following reaction would go.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_357_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You should by now understand well that the reaction goes from ester to amide rather than the other way round, because NH<sub>3</sub> is a better nucleophile than MeOH and NH<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> is a worse leaving group than MeO<sup>-</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">The S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is different: some of the best nucleophiles are also the best leaving groups. The most important examples of this are bromide and iodide. As the table on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_356">356</a> showed, iodide ion is one of the best nucleophiles towards saturated carbon because it is at the bottom of its group in the periodic table and its lone-pair electrons are very high in energy. Alkyl iodides are readily formed from alkyl chlorides or tosylates. Here are two examples. The first is assisted by the solvent, acetone, which allows NaCl to precipitate and drives the reaction forward.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_357_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_358" class="page">Page 358, Chapter 15: Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second example is from the preparation of a phosphonium salt used in a synthesis of terpenes. An unsaturated primary alcohol was first made into its tosylate, the tosylate was converted into the iodide, and the iodide into the phosphonium salt.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;We explained on p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_347">347</a> why I&#x2212; is such a good leaving group: the C&#x2013;I bond is particularly weak. The poor overlap between the atomic orbitals on C and on I also mean that the &#x03C3;* is low lying and easily accessible to the nucleophile&#x2019;s HOMO.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_358_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But why this roundabout route via the iodide? The answer is that as well as being an excellent nucleophile, iodide is such a good leaving group that alkyl iodides are often used as intermediates to encourage substitution with other nucleophiles. Yields are often higher if the alkyl iodide is prepared than if the eventual nucleophile is reacted directly with the alkyl tosylate or chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">However, iodine is expensive, and a way round that problem is to use a catalytic amount of iodide. The phosphonium salt below is formed slowly from benzyl bromide but the addition of a small amount of LiI speeds up the reaction considerably.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_358_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The iodide reacts both as a better nucleophile than Ph<sub>3</sub>P and then as a better leaving group than Br<sup>-</sup>. Each iodide ion goes round the cycle many times as a <b>nucleophilic catalyst</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The solvent &#x2018;xylene&#x2019; needs some explanation. Xylene is the trivial name for dimethyl benzene and there are three isomers. Mixed xylenes are isolated cheaply from oil and often used as a relatively high boiling solvent (b.p. about 140 &#x00B0;C) for reactions at high temperature. In this case, the starting materials are soluble in xylene but the product is a salt and conveniently precipitates out during the reaction. Non-polar xylene favours the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (p. <a href="chapter_15.xhtml#page_345">345</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Looking forward: elimination and rearrangement reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Simple nucleophilic substitutions at saturated carbon atoms are fundamental reactions found wherever organic chemistry is practised. They are used in industry on an enormous scale and in pharmaceutical laboratories to make important drugs. They are worth studying for their importance and relevance.</p>
<p class="indent">There is another side to this simple picture. These were among the first reactions whose mechanisms were thoroughly investigated by Ingold in the 1930s and since then they have probably been studied more than any other reactions. All our understanding of organic mechanisms begins with S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, and you need to understand these basic mechanisms properly.</p>
