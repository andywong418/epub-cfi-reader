<p class="noindent">We met <i>chemo</i>selectivity&#x2014;<i>which</i> group reacts&#x2014;in the last chapter. Chemoselectivity means that there are two separate functional groups and that a reagent must choose between them. By contrast, <i>regio</i>selectivity implies that there is one functional group that can react in two different places and a reagent must choose where to react. Simple examples include addition of HX to an alkene (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) and nucleophilic attack on the epoxide derived from that alkene (<a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">It might also mean that two functional groups are combined in a single conjugated system that can again react in two (or more) places. Examples include the addition of bromine to dienes (two conjugated alkenes) and addition of a nucleophile to a conjugated carbonyl compound (carbonyl group conjugated to an alkene).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Regioselectivity in electrophilic aromatic substitution</h2>
<p class="noindent">We start with electrophilic aromatic substitution. It was established in <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> that an electron-donating substituent favours <i>ortho/para</i> and an electron-withdrawing substituent favours <i>meta</i> substitution. Although <i>meta</i> substitution is usually slower than <i>ortho/para</i> substitution (because electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring), it usually gives the <i>meta</i> product alone.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg563-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Most reactions of benzene rings with electron-donating substituents give <i>ortho/para</i> mixtures and, if the substituent is very electron-donating, may lead to both <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> substitution in the same molecule. Control in favour of the <i>para</i> product can usually be achieved by reducing the reactivity of the substituent and increasing its size.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg563-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Of course, if the <i>para</i> position is blocked, <i>ortho</i> substitution is the only option, and we will come back to the idea of blocking substituents shortly. But there is a general way of directing electrophiles to the <i>ortho</i> position using activation by metallation.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Making organometallics by deprotonating aromatic rings: ortholithiation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Look at the reaction below: butyllithium deprotonates an sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atom to give an aryllithium. It works because the protons attached to sp<sup>2</sup> carbons are more acidic than protons attached to sp<sup>3</sup> carbons (although they are a lot less acidic than alkyne protons).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg563-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But there must be another factor involved to account for exclusive <i>ortho</i> substitution, which is after all the most hindered site. The functional group containing oxygen (sometimes nitrogen) is next to the proton to be removed. This functional group &#x2018;guides&#x2019; the butyllithium, so that it attacks the adjacent protons. It does this by forming a complex with the Lewis acidic lithium atom, much as ether solvents dissolve Grignard reagents by complexing <a id="page_564" class="page">Page 564, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a>their Lewis-acidic metal ions. This mechanism means that it is only the protons <i>ortho</i> to the functional group that can be removed, and the reaction is known as an ortholithiation.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg564-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The example below shows ortholithiation, activated by the nitrogen atom of a tertiary amine, being used to make a new C&#x2013;C bond. Here it is the nitrogen atom that directs attack of the butyllithium, again by complexation with the Li atom.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg564-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Ortholithiation is a useful way of making reactive organometallics because the starting material does not need to contain a halogen atom. But it is much less general than the other ways we have told you about for making organolithiums, as there are rather tight restrictions on what sorts of groups the aromatic ring must carry. The best ortholithiation-directing substituents have lone pairs to donate electrons to Li and are also electronegative so they withdraw electrons from the benzene ring and help stabilize the anion forming at the <i>ortho</i> position.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Fredericamycin</h3>
<p class="noindent2">Fredericamycin is a curious aromatic compound extracted in 1981 from the soil bacterium <i>Streptomyces griseus.</i> It is a powerful antibiotic and antitumour agent, and its structure is shown below. The fi rst time it was made in the laboratory, in 1988, the chemists in Boston started their synthesis with three consecutive lithiation reactions: two are ortholithiations, and the third is slightly different. You needn&#x2019;t be concerned about the reagents that react with the organolithiums; just look at the lithiation reactions themselves. In each one, one or more oxygen atoms (colour-coded green) directs a strongly basic reagent to remove a nearby proton (colour-coded black). As it happens, none of the steps uses n-BuLi itself, but instead its more reactive cousins, sec-BuLi and tert-BuLi (see the table on p. <a href="chapter_9.xhtml#page_186">186</a>). The third lithiation step uses a different kind of base related to LDA, made by deprotonating an amine (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> about 35). The black proton removed in this third lithiation is more acidic because it is next to an aromatic ring.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Sulfonation may lead to ortho selectivity without lithiation</h3>
<p class="noindent">We introduced sulfonation in <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> but have left detailed discussion until now because sulfonation has some features that make it more interesting than first meets the eye. One important difference between sulfonation and other examples of electrophilic substitution is that sulfonation is <i>reversible.</i> Heating an arenesulfonic acid causes it to decompose with loss of gaseous SO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Here&#x2019;s an example of how we can exploit this to gain control of regioselectivity without resorting to lithiation. In stage 1 the phenol is sulfonated twice&#x2014;the first sulfonic acid group (which adds <i>para</i> to the OH group) is electron-withdrawing and deactivates the ring, making the introduction of the second group (which goes <i>ortho</i> to the OH and <i>meta</i> to the first sulfonic acid) harder and that of the third group harder still, which is why we can isolate the disulfonated phenol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg565-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<h3 class="ch4">The sulfonating agent</h3>
<p class="noindent2">The exact nature of the electrophile in sulfonation reactions seems to vary with the amount of water present. Certainly for oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, that is concentrated sulfuric acid with added sulfur trioxide) and solutions of sulfur trioxide in organic solvents, the electrophile is sulfur trioxide itself, SO<sub>3</sub>. With more water around, H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and even H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> have been suggested.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the second stage, the bromination, the OH directs to the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions, but only one <i>ortho</i> position is vacant, so the bromine attacks there. Sodium hydroxide is needed to deprotonate the sulfonic acid groups to make them less deactivating. The sulfonation reaction is reversible, and in the third stage it is possible to drive the reaction over to the products by distilling out the relatively volatile 2-bromophenol at high temperature. The loss of SO<sub>3</sub> involves attack of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> on the aromatic ring.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Overall, we have succeeded in making 2-bromophenol where direct bromination of phenol itself would have given (at low temperatures) mainly <i>p</i>-bromophenol and at higher temperatures, 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The sulfonic acid groups are useful reversible blocking groups.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> The reversibility of sulfonation with sulfuric acid may also account for the higher yield of para product in the sulfonation of toluene with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as compared with ClSO<sub>2</sub>OH (p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_485">485</a>).</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The same method can be used with anilines because <i>para</i>-sulfonation of aromatic amines is possible. This seems surprising because in sulfuric acid essentially all the amine will be proton ated. You might expect the resulting ammonium ion to react in the <i>meta</i> position (because NH<sub>3</sub> is no longer electron-rich) but instead the <i>para</i>-sulfonic acid (sulfanilic acid) is formed. At the high temperature of the reaction, it is probable that any <i>meta</i>-substituted product reverts to the starting material, while the <i>para</i>-sulfonic acid accumulates because it is stabilized by delocalization and is less hindered.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Regioselective reactions of naphthalene</h3>
<p class="noindent">We introduced you to the 10-electron aromatic system of naphthalene in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. As you would expect, it undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with the same reagents you met in <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>, but the regioselectivity of its reactions is of a different type to the <i>ortho, meta,</i> <a id="page_566" class="page">Page 566, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a><i>para</i> selectivity we have been talking about. Naphthalene has 10 carbons: two form the ring junction, and aren&#x2019;t available for substitution reactions, and the other eight are of just two types &#x03B1; (the 1-position, next to the ring junction) and &#x03B2; (the 2-position).</p>
<p class="indent">Electrophilic substitution on naphthalene normally occurs at a site next to the ring junction (&#x03B1;). This is because the HOMO has its largest coefficient at this atom, but you can rationalize the result by looking at the long, linear delocalization in the resulting cation, which can be represented by a single train of arrows. This extended conjugation makes naphthalene more nucleophilic than benzene. So, bromination occurs at the a-position in good yield even without a Lewis acid.</p>

The &#x03B2;-product is formed more slowly but it is more stable as there is less steric hindrance between the large sulfonic acid group and the orange hydrogen on the other ring.

<h3 class="h3">Regiocontrol by choice of route</h3>
<p class="noindent">Choosing the right route to an aromatic product is essential if you want to get one particular isomer. We can illustrate this with the synthesis of the isomers of bromonitrobenzene. Because the bromo substituent is <i>ortho, para</i>-directing and the nitro group <i>meta</i>-directing, it&#x2019;s possible to make all three isomers, providing we exploit the regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution. Nitration of bromobenzene would give the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> isomers while bromination of nitrobenzene would give the <i>meta</i> isomer. The selectivity of the fi rst reaction is not good: bromine is small and not very electronegative, so steric hindrance is weak and the <i>ortho</i> positions are not deactivated. Furthermore there are two <i>ortho</i> positions but only one <i>para:</i> a typical result is about 37% <i>ortho,</i> 1% <i>meta,</i> and 62% <i>para.</i> Both compounds are industrial products, made by nitration and separated.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_567" class="page">Page 567, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;Bromination of nitrobenzene is remarkably good, considering the unreactivity of nitrobenzene in electrophilic aromatic substitution. One recipe uses iron powder and bromine at 140&#x00B0;C and gives 74% of the <i>meta</i> product. We shall need these reactions in the next section.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg567-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Before we move on, consider why this selectivity works: we can get all three isomers because we have one <i>ortho/para</i> director and one <i>meta</i> director. But what if we had two <i>ortho/para</i> directors&#x2014;say, amino and bromo&#x2014;and wanted the <i>meta</i> isomer?</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg567-2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The solution in these cases is often to make use of the transformation of the nitro group (a <i>meta</i> director) into an amino group (a <i>para</i> director) by reduction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Since the amino group can be substituted by diazotization (p. <a href="chapter_22.xhtml#page_520">520</a>), many problems of regioselectivity can be solved by using nitro compounds as intermediates.

<h3 class="h3">Regioselectivity of intramolecular reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">A cunning way to get unusual regioselectivity is to make the reaction intramolecular. The synthesis from benzene of the cyclic ketone known as tetralone may look difficult as we must get an <i>ortho</i> relationship on the benzene ring. But if we make the final bond in the ring by a Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation there is no problem. The alkyl group is <i>ortho,para-directing</i> and the acid cannot reach the <i>para</i> position.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg568-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Notice the use of a cyclic anhydride in the fi rst Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation. It doesn&#x2019;t matter where the acylation occurs and the reaction stops there as the ring is deactivated by the ketone and the carboxylic acid released in the reaction is much less electrophilic than the anhydride. The ketone is then reduced to a CH<sub>2</sub> group by the Clemmensen method (see <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>) and polyphosphoric acid is used to carry out the intramolecular acylation step.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Usually a more powerful catalyst (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is needed, but intramolecular acylations are fast enough without this.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A more subtle approach is to use a &#x2018;tether&#x2019;&#x2014;something that holds two reagents together and is afterwards cleaved. An example is halolactonization. The idea is simple. A halogen, say bromine, attacks an alkene and the bromonium ion intermediate is captured intramolecularly by the anion of a carboxylic acid. The reaction therefore uses bromine and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;a weak base, but one strong enough to deprotonate a carboxylic acid. The anion attacks the more highly substituted end of the bromonium ion, as explained in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, and forms a five-membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent"><a id="page_569" class="page">Page 569, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although any halogen might be used in this reaction, iodine is the most versatile and the reaction is commonly called iodolactonization. The tether is the C&#x2013;O bond of the lactone and this can be cleaved with an alkoxide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg569-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reaction with methoxide needs some explanation. Attack on the carbonyl group cleaves the lactone, releasing an alkoxide that cyclizes to form an epoxide. A second molecule of methoxide now attacks the epoxide, opening it from the less hindered end as we should expect in an anionic reaction (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg569-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Another example shows that reaction may occur at the other end of the iodonium ion. Attack at the tertiary carbon would be difficult sterically and, in any case, would give an unstable four-membered ring. The lactone formed has the iodine &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group and so eliminates easily in base (pyridine works well) by the E1cB mechanism (<a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>) to give the unsaturated lactone. Although the relative stereochemistry of the iodolactone is controlled by the inversion in the opening of the iodonium ion, it is irrelevant as it disappears in the elimination step.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Regioselectivity in elimination reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">This question was discussed in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a> but we can return to it here with more sophisticated examples. The regioselectivity in the last reaction of the sequence above dictates the position of the alkene in the product. Of all of the protons adjacent to the iodo group, only a black one is lost:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg569-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The orange hydrogen cannot be lost by E2 as it is <i>cis</i> to the iodine and E2 reactions prefer a <i>trans</i> (anti-periplanar) arrangement. The green hydrogens are not lost because they are less acidic than the black hydrogens. In fact, this is not an E2 elimination at all. Because one of the black hydrogens can be lost in enolate formation, this is an E1cB elimination.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg569-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_570" class="page">Page 570, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now another regioselectivity question arises: if elimination occurs preferably towards the carbonyl group, how can we make the starting material for the iodolactonization sequence, which has the alkene not in conjugation with the carboxylic acid? It turns out that it is better to make the ester with the &#x2018;wrong&#x2019; regioselectivity. This is easily done by a Horner&#x2013;Wadsworth&#x2013;Emmons reaction using a phosphonate ester. This Wittig-style reaction is explained in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg570-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now comes the remarkable regioselectivity. The ester is hydrolysed, as usual, in aqueous NaOH. On acidification to pH 3, the free acid is released and the double bond has moved into the ring.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg570-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Alkenes like to be conjugated with carbonyl groups but they also prefer to be <i>inside</i> six-membered rings rather than outside&#x2014;in this case presumably because the ester group otherwise has to eclipse a ring carbon. Conjugation with an ester group pulls the alkene out of the six-membered ring in the lactone we made above, but when the carbonyl group is a carboxylate anion, conjugation is very weak and the double bond moves into the ring.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Electrophilic attack on alkenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">You met electrophilic attack on alkenes in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> and we shall just briefly revisit its regioselectivity. Unsymmetrical alkenes add HBr to give the more stable of the two possible cations. If R is alkyl or aryl, this means the more substituted cation.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg570-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If you want to get the other regioisomer, with the heteroatom at the end, you can use hydroboration (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) or the radical reactions described in the next section. Here is a brief reminder of hydroboration. Reaction between a borane having at least one B&#x2013;H bond with an alkene gives an alkyl borane in which all the hydrogens are replaced by alkyl groups. Oxidation gives the terminal alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg570-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The regioselectivity comes from the first step. The boron&#x2019;s empty p orbital bonds to the more nucleophilic end of the alkene and hydride is transferred to give a borane. Reaction with alkaline H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to migration of an alkyl group from boron to oxygen and eventually to the alcohol.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Regioselectivity in radical reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Almost every reaction we have discussed so far has been ionic, but in this short section we need to give you a preview of another group of reactions we return to in <a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>&#x2014;those of <i>radicals.</i> When HBr adds to an unsymmetrical alkene we use arrows that represent the movement of two electrons to give charged intermediates that combine in a second step to give a neutral product. The strong H&#x2013;Br bond breaks to give a bromide ion and a stable alkyl cation. This bond breaks <i>heterolytically</i>&#x2014;that is, unsymmetrically&#x2014;as does the alkene bond. We can predict the regiochemistry of these reactions by making the most stable anions and cations as intermediates, in this case a tertiary alkyl cation and a bromide anion.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Radical addition</h3>
<p class="noindent">The regioselectivity in the reaction below is opposite: a primary alkyl bromide is formed, by a different mechanism involving radicals.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg571-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In radical reactions, bonds break <i>homolytically</i> with one electron going one way and one the other. The radicals that are formed have an odd number of electrons, one of which must be unpaired. This makes them very reactive and they are not usually isolated. Even strong bonds can break into ions provided they are polarized, but to make radicals we need weak symmetrical bonds such as O&#x2013;O, Br&#x2013;Br or I&#x2013;I. Dibenzoyl peroxide, the Ph(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> catalyst in this reaction, readily undergoes homolysis like this&#x2014;the one-electron movements are represented by &#x2018;fish-hook&#x2019; arrows having one barb and odd electrons on atoms are represented by dots.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg571-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now we can use the new radicals we have just made to cleave the strong HBr bond homolytically because a new and very strong OH bond will be formed. As we start with one radical intermediate that must have an unpaired electron, we must finish with another radical with an unpaired electron. In this case, it is a bromine radical.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg571-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we do this reaction in the presence of the alkene we have just reacted with HBr, the bromine radical adds to the alkene in one of the two possible ways. Although radicals are neutral,<a id="page_572" class="page">Page 572, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a> they are electron-deficient (the C atom is one electron short) and, rather like cations, are more stable the more substituents they have. So the tertiary radical is formed rather than the primary radical, and the bromine ends up at the primary position.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg572-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We have still not reached the end of the reaction as our product is still a radical. How can it become a molecule with only paired electrons? The answer is simple. It reacts with another HBr molecule to produce more bromine radicals. Now you see something important to all radical reactions: only a small amount of the radical is needed as more radicals are produced every time the reaction gives product. The overall process is a <i>radical chain reaction.</i></p>

<h3 class="h3">Radical abstraction</h3>
<p class="noindent">We sneaked a new reaction into that sequence. The removal of a hydrogen atom (note: not a proton) from HBr by the peroxide radical is an <i>abstraction</i> reaction. The bromine radical will also abstract hydrogen atoms and will do so from the same alkene we have just used but with yet another different outcome, as you see in the margin.</p>

<p class="indent">Radicals are very unstable and reactive, and these bromine radicals may simply recombine or they may react with other compounds. You already know that bromide anions are good nucleophiles in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, but bromine radicals do two quite different reactions: abstraction and addition. The Br radical may abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkene or it may add to the &#x03C0; bond. Notice that each reaction produces a new carbon-centred radical and, in the first case, a molecule of HBr. Whereas the Br&#x2013;Br bond is weak, the H&#x2013;Br bond is much stronger (366 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) and, unlike ionic reactions, radical reactions are dominated by bond strength.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg572-6.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The first reaction introduces another important aspect of regioselectivity: why does the radical abstract that H atom, and not one from the alkene?<a id="page_573" class="page">Page 573, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg573-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Removal of an alkene H gives a carbon-centred radical localized on the sp<sup>2</sup> atom but the removal of an H from a methyl group gives a much more stable delocalized allylic radical. In addition there are six such H atoms but only two alkene H atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The reaction obviously cannot end there with the formation of another radical, however stable, and this allylic radical collects a bromine atom from a bromine molecule. Note that the allylic radical doesn&#x2019;t react with a bromine <i>radical</i> in this step: radicals are very unstable and the concentration of radicals at any one time is so low that it is rare for two of them to meet.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">This step also produces a new bromine radical that can start a new series of reactions. Like the addition of HBr above, the reaction is a radical chain reaction, and only a small amount of Br<sub>2</sub> needs to break down to Br&#x2022; to get the reaction going. This is important as you already know what happens when bromine molecules react with alkenes: addition occurs by an ionic mechanism. Add too much Br<sub>2</sub> and the bromine molecules attack the alkene directly and do not abstract H atoms.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg573-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we want to make the dibromide, we use plenty of bromine, but if we want to use a radical process to make the allylic bromide we must take advantage of the greater reactivity of the radical and keep the bromine concentration low. A good way to do this is to use the compound NBS (<i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide), which you met in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>. NBS acts as a sort of turnstile which only lets a molecule of Br<sub>2</sub> out when a molecule of HBr is formed (and of course HBr is the by-product in the radical bromination).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg573-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Br<sub>2</sub> is slowly released into the reaction as it proceeds, and the concentration never builds up enough to generate the dibromide. In this example, dibenzoyl peroxide is the initiator and allylic bromination gives the useful cyclohexenyl bromide.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Nucleophilic attack on allylic compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">The allylic bromides that can be made by these radical reactions display interesting regioselectivity. We shall start with some substitution reactions with which you are familiar from <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>. There we said that allyl bromide is about 100 times more reactive towards simple S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions than is propyl bromide or other saturated alkyl halides.</p>
<p class="indent">The double bond stabilizes the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state by conjugation with the p orbital at the carbon atom under attack. This full p orbital (shown in orange in the diagram below) forms a partial bond with the nucleophile and with the leaving group in the transition state. Any stabilization of the transition state will, of course, accelerate the reaction by lowering the energy barrier.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg574-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">There is an alternative mechanism for this reaction that involves nucleophilic attack on the alkene instead of on the saturated carbon atom. This mechanism leads to the same product and is often called the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; (pronounced &#x2018;S-N-two-prime&#x2019;) mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent">We can explain both mechanisms in a unified way if we look at the frontier orbitals involved. The nucleophile must attack an empty orbital (the LUMO), which we might expect to be simply &#x03C3;* (C&#x2013;Br) for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. But this ignores the alkene. The interaction between &#x03C0;* (C=C) and the adjacent &#x03C3;* (C&#x2013;Br) will as usual produce two new orbitals, one higher and one lower in energy. The lower-energy orbital, &#x03C0;* &#x002B; &#x03C3;*, will now be the LUMO. To construct this orbital we must put all the atomic orbitals parallel and make the contact between &#x03C0;* &#x002B; &#x03C3;* a bonding interaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The two ends of the allylic system are contrasted sterically: direct (S<sub>N</sub>2) attack is at a primary carbon while allylic (S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027;) attack is at a tertiary carbon atom so that steric hindrance favours the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. In addition, the number of substituents on the alkene product means that the S<sub>N</sub>2 product is nearly always preferred&#x2014;S<sub>N</sub>2 gives a trisubstituted alkene while the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; product has a less stable monosubstituted alkene.</p>
<p class="indent">An important example is the reaction of prenyl bromide with phenols. This is simply carried out with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in acetone as phenols are acidic enough <i> (</i>p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x007E; 10) to be substantially deprotonated by carbonate.

How do we know that these reactions really take place by S<sub>N</sub>2 and S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; mechanisms and not by an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism via the stable allyl cation? Well in the case of prenyl bromide, we don&#x2019;t&#x0021; In fact, we suspect that the cation probably <i>is</i> an intermediate because prenyl bromide and its allylic isomer are in rapid equilibrium in solution at room temperature.</p>

<p class="indent">The equilibrium is entirely in favour of prenyl bromide because of its more highly substituted double bond. Reactions on the tertiary allylic isomer are very likely to take place by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism: the cation is stable because it is tertiary and allylic and the equilibration tells us it is already there. Even if the reactions were bimolecular, no S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; mechanism would be necessary for the tertiary bromide because it can equilibrate to the primary isomer more rapidly than the S<sub>N</sub>2 or S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reaction takes place.</p>
<p class="indent">Even the secondary system we also considered is in rapid equilibrium when the leaving group is bromide. This time both allylic isomers are present, and the primary allylic isomer (known as crotyl bromide) is an <i>E/Z</i> mixture. The bromides can be made from either alcohol with HBr and the same ratio of products results, indicating a common intermediate in the two mechanisms. You saw at the beginning of <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> that this reaction is restricted to alcohols that can react by S<sub>N</sub>1.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg576-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Displacement of the bromide by cyanide ion, using the copper(I) salt as the reagent, gives a mixture of nitriles in which the more stable primary nitrile predominates even more. These can be separated by a clever device. Hydrolysis in concentrated HCl is successful with the predominant primary nitrile but the more hindered secondary nitrile does not hydrolyse. Separation of compounds having two different functional groups is easy: in this case the acid can be extracted into aqueous base, leaving the neutral nitrile in the organic layer.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg576-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Once again, we do not know for sure whether this displacement by cyanide goes by the S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; mechanism, as the reagents equilibrate under the reaction conditions. However, the<a id="page_577" class="page">Page 577, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a> chlorides do <i>not</i> equilibrate and so, if we want a clear-cut result on a single well-defined starting material, the chlorides are the compounds to use. But you already see that regioslectivity with allylic compounds may depend on steric hindrance, rates of reaction, and stability of the product.</p>

<p class="noindent">Allylic alcohols are good starting materials for making allylic compounds with control over where the double bond and the leaving group will be. Allylic alcohols are easily made by addition of Grignard reagents or organolithium compounds to enals or enones (<a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) or by reduction of enals or enones (<a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). More to the point, they do not equilibrate except in strongly acidic solution, so we know which allylic isomer we have.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Conversion of the alcohols into the chlorides is easier with the primary than with the secondary alcohols. We need to convert OH into a leaving group and provide a source of chloride ion to act as a nucleophile. One way to do this is with methanesulfonyl chloride (MeSO<sub>2</sub>Cl) and LiCl.</p>

<p class="indent">This result hardly looks worth reporting and, anyway, how do we know that equilibration or S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions aren&#x2019;t happening? Well, here the mechanism must be S<sub>N</sub>2 because the corresponding <i>Z</i>-allylic alcohol preserves its alkene configuration. If there were equilibration of any sort, the <i>Z</i>-alkene would give the <i>E-</i>alkene because <i>E-</i> and <i>Z</i>-allylic cations are not geometrically stable.</p>

<p class="indent">The next step is a true S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at carbon as the very good leaving group is displaced.

<h3 class="h3">The S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reaction of carbon nucleophiles on allylic chlorides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ordinary carbon nucleophiles such as cyanide or Grignard reagents or organolithium compounds fit the patterns we have described already. They usually give the more stable product by S<sub>N</sub>2 or S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reactions depending on the starting material. If we use copper compounds, there is a tendency&#x2014;no more than that&#x2014;to favour the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reaction. You will recall that copper(I) was the metal we used to ensure conjugate addition to enones (<a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>) and its use in S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reactions is obviously related. Simple alkyl copper reagents (RCu, known as Gilman reagents) generally favour the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; reaction but we can do much better by using RCu complexed with BF<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">The secondary allylic isomer also gives almost entirely the rearranged product. This is perhaps less surprising, as the major product is the more stable isomer, but it means that either product can be formed in high yield simply by choosing the right (or should we say <i>wrong,</i> since there is complete allylic rearrangement during the reaction) isomer. The reaction is <i>regiospecifi c.</i></p>

<h2 class="h2">Electrophilic attack on conjugated dienes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Another way to make allylic chlorides is by treating dienes with HCl. Electrophiles attack conjugated dienes more readily than they do isolated alkenes. There was some discussion of this in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, establishing the main point that the terminal carbon atoms are the most nucleophilic and that the initial attack produces an allylic cation. A simple example is the addition of HCl to cyclopentadiene.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg579-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Although there is a question of regioselectivity in the initial protonation, the allylic cation is symmetrical and attack by chloride at either end produces the same product. However, if the electrophile is a halogen rather than HCl or HBr then the reaction becomes regioselective as the cationic intermediate is no longer symmetrical. What happens is this:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg579-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The alternative is direct attack on the bromonium ion intermediate, which we assume would occur at the allylic site (black arrows) and not at the other (green arrows). Although this 1,2-dibromide product is not observed, it is still possible that this reaction happens because the 1,2-product can rearrange by bromide shift to the observed 1,4-dibromide.</p>

<p class="indent">The final product of this reaction could in fact be either of two compounds as the two bromine atoms may be <i>cis</i> or <i>trans.</i> Bromination in chloroform at &#x2013;20 &#x00B0;C gives mostly a liquid <i>cis</i> dibromide while reaction in hydrocarbon solvents gives the crystalline <i>trans</i> isomer. On standing the <i>cis</i> isomer slowly turns into the <i>trans.</i></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg580-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This suggests that the <i>cis</i> bromide is the kinetic product and the more stable <i>trans</i> compound is the thermodynamic product, formed by reversible loss of bromide and reformation of the bromonium ion.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg580-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Similar questions arise when nucleophilic substitution occurs on the dibromides. Reaction of either the <i>cis</i> or the <i>trans</i> dibromide with dimethylamine gives the <i>trans</i> isomer of a diamine. But look at the regioselectivity&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not the diamine you might expect. The only explanation is one S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement and one S<sub>N</sub>2&#x0027; displacement.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg580-6.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The reaction with the <i>trans</i> isomer is almost identical: the same three-membered ring is an intermediate in both sequences so the products are bound to be the same.</p>

<p class="indent">If the nucleophile is different from the electrophile we can get a bit more information about the course of the reaction. When butadiene is treated with bromine in methanol as solvent, two adducts are formed in a 15:1 ratio along with some dibromide. Methanol is a weak nucleophile and adds to the bromonium ion mainly at the allylic position (black arrow below); only a small amount of product is formed by attack at the far end of the allylic system. Note that no attack occurs at the other end of the bromonium ion (green dotted arrow).<a id="page_581" class="page">Page 581, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">Conjugate addition</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> we devoted considerable space to discussing conjugate addition and the reasons why some reactions occur by direct attack on the carbonyl group of an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound and why others occur by conjugate addition. We shall briefl y revise the regioselectivity aspects of these reactions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg581-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Direct (or 1,2) addition means that the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl group directly. An addition compound is formed which may lose X<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, if it is a leaving group, or become protonated to give an alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg581-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Conjugate (or 1,4) addition means that the nucleophile adds to the end of the alkene furthest from the carbonyl group. The electrons move through into the carbonyl group to produce an enolate anion that usually becomes protonated to give a ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg581-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The first difference between the two routes is that the product from direct addition keeps the alkene but loses the carbonyl group while conjugate addition keeps the carbonyl group but loses the alkene. As a C=O&#x03C0; bond is stronger than a C=C&#x03C0; bond, <b>conjugate addition gives the thermodynamic product</b>. But as the carbonyl group is more electrophilic than the far end of the alkene, especially to charged, hard nucleophiles, <b>direct addition gives the kinetic product</b>. So direct addition is favoured by low temperatures and short reaction times while conjugate addition is favoured by higher temperatures and longer reaction times, provided the 1,2 addition is reversible.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg581-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The second difference depends on how electrophilic is the &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The more electrophilic such as aldehydes and acid chlorides tend to prefer direct addition while the less electrophilic such as ketones or esters tend to prefer conjugate addition.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_582" class="page">Page 582, Chapter 24: Regioselectivity</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is similar with the choice of nucleophile: more nucleophilic species, such as MeLi or Grignard reagents, prefer direct addition, particularly as they react irreversibly, while less nucleophilic species like amines and thiols prefer conjugate addition. These nucleophiles add reversibly to the C=O group, giving an opportunity for any direct addition product to revert to starting materials and react again.</p>
