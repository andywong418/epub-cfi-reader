<h3 class="maxh3">Transition metals extend the range of organic reactions</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Some of the most exciting reactions in organic chemistry make use of transition metals, and in recent years three Nobel prizes have been awarded for work in this area. How about this example? It is a <b>Heck reaction</b>, which allows nucleophilic addition to an unactivated alkene. Just a catalytic amount of palladium is needed to make the reaction go: the most useful organometallic reactions are those in which the metal acts catalytically.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1069.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Reagents and complexes containing transition metals are important in modern organic synthesis because they allow apparently impossible reactions to occur easily. Their chemistry complements traditional functional group chemistry and significantly broadens the range of <a class="page" id="page_1070">Page 1070, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a> reactions a chemist can expect to use to make molecules. This chapter introduces the concepts of metal&#8211;ligand interaction, describes the most important reactions that can occur while ligands are bound to the metal, and demonstrates the power of organometallic chemistry in synthesis. The efficiency of transition metal-catalysed reactions means that they are routinely used in industrial synthesis. It is important that you understand the rules by which organometallic chemistry works.</p>

You should understand that it is much more difficult to be certain about these mechanisms than in some other areas of chemistry: a great deal of work goes into establishing mechanisms for important organometallic transformations, but many remain speculative. The mechanisms we give are meant to help you understand what is going on and may well turn out not to be correct in every detail.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">The 18 electron rule</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">There is a contradiction in what is required of a metal complex for it to be useful to us. Initially, it will need to be stable and have a long enough lifetime to enable study and, ideally, storage. But once it enters the reaction vessel, stability is a disadvantage: instead we want reactivity. Our ideal catalyst is a complex that is stable in the resting state, but quickly becomes activated in solution&#8212;perhaps by loss of a ligand&#8212;so that it can interact with the substrate. Fortunately, there is a simple guide to the stability of transition metal complexes: <b>the 18 electron rule</b>. If a complex satisfies the 18-electron rule it means that the metal at the centre of the complex has the noble gas configuration of 18 electrons in the valence shell, and the complex is likely to be stable. The requirement for 18 electrons comes from the need to fill one &#8216;s&#8217; orbital, five &#8216;d&#8217; orbitals, and three &#8216;p&#8217; orbitals with two electrons in each. The 18 electrons we need can come from those the metal already possesses plus those donated by any coordinating ligands.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The table below gives you the number of valence electrons each metal starts with before it acquires any ligands. Notice that the &#8216;new&#8217; group numbers 1&#8211;18 give you the answer without any calculation. The most important are highlighted.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Metals to the left-hand side of this list obviously need many more electrons to make up the magic 18. Chromium, for example, forms stable complexes with a benzene ring, giving it six electrons, and three molecules of carbon monoxide, giving it two each: 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18. Palladium is happy with just four triphenylphosphines (Ph<sub>3</sub>P:) giving it two each: 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You may already know from your study of inorganic chemistry that there are exceptions to the 18-electron rule, particularly among complexes of Ti, Zr, Ni, Pd, and Pt, which can all form stable 16-electron complexes. The important 16-electron Pd(II) complex with two chlorides and two acetonitriles (MeCN) will feature heavily in this chapter. The so-called platinum metals Ni, Pd, and Pt are extremely important in catalytic processes, as you will see later on. Their stable 16-electron configuration results from a high-energy vacant orbital caused by the complex adopting a square planar geometry.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxnoindent" style="width:70%;">Transition metals can have a number of ligands attached to them and each ligand can be attached in more than one place. This affects the reactivity of the ligand and the metal because each additional point of attachment means the donation of more electrons. We can show the number of atoms involved in bonding to the metal by a <b>hapto number</b> &#951;. A simple Grignard reagent is &#951;1 (pronounced &#8216;eta-one&#8217;) as the magnesium is attached only to one carbon atom. A metal&#8211;alkene complex is &#951;2 because both carbon atoms of the alkene are equally involved in bonding to the metal. In these cases the &#951; designation is not very informative as there are no alternatives, and it is usually omitted.<a class="page" id="page_1071">Page 1071, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The bonding in these two complexes is very different. In the first there is a simple &#963; bond between the metal and the alkyl group as in a Grignard reagent R&#8211;MgBr and this type of complex is called a &#963; <b>complex</b>. In the alkene complex, bonding is to the p orbitals only. There are no &#963; bonds to the metal, which sits in the middle of the &#960; bond in between the two p orbitals. This type of complex is called a &#960; <b>complex</b>.</p>
<div class="maxbluea" style="width:68%;">
<h4 class="maxh4a">Representing bonds in transition metal complexes</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent">It is difficult to know exactly how to draw the bonding in metal complexes and there are often several different acceptable representations. There is no problem when the metal forms a &#963; bond to atoms such as Cl or C as the simple line we normally use for covalent bonds means exactly what it says. The problems arise with ligands that form &#963; bonds by donating both their electrons, and with &#960; complexes. Everyone writes phosphine&#8211;borane complexes with two charges but we normally draw the same sort of bond between a phosphine and, say, Pd as a simple line with no charges.</p>
<figure class="maxcdfig8"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1071-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent1">You will sometimes see &#960; complexes drawn with simpler dotted lines going to the middle of the &#960; bond, sometimes with dotted &#960; bonds, and sometimes with bonds (simple or dotted) going to the ends of the old &#960; bond. These are all acceptable as the bonding is complex, as you will see. We might almost say that the ambiguity is helpful: we often don&#8217;t know either the exact nature of the bonding or the number of other ligands in the complex. In the diagrams in this section we have shown the main bond from metal to ligand as a heavy line in the simplest representation but we also offer alternatives with simple and dotted bonds. Don&#8217;t worry about this&#8212;things will become clearer as the chapter develops. When you have to draw the structure of a complex but you don&#8217;t know the exact bonding, just draw a line from metal to ligand.</p>
<figure class="maxcdfig8"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1071-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</div>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">These labels are useful where there is a choice of type of bonding, as with allylic ligands. The metal can either form a &#963; bond to a single carbon (hence &#951;1), or form a &#960; complex with the p orbitals of all three carbons of the allyl system&#8212;this would be &#951;3. If the &#960; complex is made from an allyl cation, the ligand has two electrons, but it has four if it is made from an allyl anion. Similarly, a cyclopentadienyl anion can act as a &#963; ligand (&#951;1), an allyl ligand (&#951;3), or, most usually, as a cyclopentadienyl ligand (&#951;5). The distinction is very important for electron counting as these three different situations contribute two, four, or six electrons, respectively, to the complex.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1071-04.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Neutral ligands can also bond in a variety of ways. Cyclooctatetraene can act as an alkene (&#951;2), a diene (&#951;4), a triene (&#951;6), or a tetraene (&#951;8), and the reactivity of the ligand changes accordingly. These are all &#960; complexes with the metal above or below the black portion of the ring and with the thick bond to the metal at right angles to the alkene plane.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1071-05.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">To determine the number of electrons around the transition metal in a complex the valence electrons from the metal ion are added to those contributed by all the ligands. The numbers of electrons donated by various classes of ligands are summarized in the table. Anions such as halides, cyanide, alkoxide, hydride, and alkyl donate two electrons, as do neutral ligands with a lone pair such as phosphines, amines, ethers, sulfides, carbon monoxide, nitriles, and isonitriles. Unsaturated ligands can contribute as many as eight electrons and can be neutral or negatively charged. If the overall total is 18, then the complex is likely to be stable. If the overall total is less than 18 the complex is called <i>coordinatively unsaturated</i>.<a class="page" id="page_1072">Page 1072, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>

This complex does not fulfil the 18-electron rule and is stable yet reactive.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4a">The oxidation state of metals in complexes</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent">As well as the problem of bond drawing, there is a potential problem over oxidation states too. You can either say that ferrocene is a complex of Fe(II), having two fewer electrons than the normal eight, with two cyclopentadienyl anions contributing six electrons each, or you can say that it is a complex of Fe(0), having eight electrons, with two cyclopentadienyl ligands each contributing five electrons. The simplest approach is to say that a metal is in the (0) oxidation state unless it has &#963; bonds to ligands such as Cl, AcO, or Me that form bonds with shared electrons. Neutral ligands such as Ph<sub>3</sub>P that provide two of their own electrons do not affect the oxidation state of the metal.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Bonding and reactions in transition metal complexes</h3>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">The majority of ligands have a lone pair of electrons in a filled sp<i>n</i> type orbital that can overlap with a vacant metal &#8216;dsp&#8217; orbital, derived from the vacant d, p, and s orbitals of the metal, to form a conventional two-electron two-centre &#963; bond. Ligands of this type increase the electron density on the central metal atom.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1073-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A bonding interaction is also possible between any filled d orbitals on the metal and vacant ligand orbitals of appropriate symmetry such as &#960;* orbitals. This leads to a reduction of electron density on the metal and is known as <b>back-bonding</b>. An example would be a complex with carbon monoxide. Many metals form these complexes and they are known as <b>metal carbonyls</b>. The ligand (CO) donates the lone pair on carbon into an empty orbital on the metal while the metal donates electrons into the low-energy &#960;* orbital of CO. Direct evidence for this back-bonding is an increase in the C&#8211;O bond length and a lowering of the infrared stretching frequency from the population of the &#960;* orbital of the carbonyl.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">When an unsaturated ligand such as an alkene approaches the metal sideways to form a &#960; complex, similar interactions lead to bonding. The filled &#960; orbitals of the ligand bond to empty d orbitals of the metal, while filled d orbitals on the metal bond to the empty &#960;* orbitals of the ligand. The result is a &#960; complex with the metal&#8211;alkene bond perpendicular to the plane of the alkene. The bond has both &#963; and &#960; character.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1073-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Coordination to a metal by any of these bonding methods changes the reactivity of the ligands dramatically and this is exploited in the organometallic chemistry we will be discussing in the rest of the chapter. You do not need to understand all the bonding properties of metal complexes but you need to be able to count electrons, to recognize both &#963; and &#960; complexes, and to realize that complexes show a balance between electron donation and electron withdrawal by the metal.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Oxidative addition inserts metal atoms into single bonds</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Potential ligands that do not have a lone pair or filled &#960;-type orbital are still able to interact with transition metal complexes but only by breaking a &#963; bond. This is the first step in a wide variety of processes and is described as <b>oxidative addition</b> because the formal oxidation state of the transition metal is raised by two, for example M(0) to M(II), in the process. This is the result of having two extra ligands bearing a formal negative charge. You have seen this process in the formation of Grignard reagents (<a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).<a class="page" id="page_1074">Page 1074, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The number of coordinated ligands also increases by two so the starting complex is usually in low oxidation state (0 or 1; the diagram shows 0) and <b>coordinatively unsaturated</b>, that is, it has an empty site for a ligand and, say, only 16 electrons, like (MeCN)<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>2</sub>, whereas the product is usually <b>coordinatively saturated</b>, that is, it cannot accept another ligand unless it loses one first.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Oxidative addition occurs for a number of useful neutral species, including molecular hydrogen, carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds, and silanes as well as polarized bonds or electrophilic species containing at least one electronegative atom. The resulting species with metal&#8211;ligand bonds allow useful chemical transformations to occur. Important examples include the oxidative addition of Pd(0) to aryl iodides and the activation of Wilkinson&#8217;s catalyst for hydrogenation in solution by oxidative addition to a hydrogen molecule.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4a">Vaska&#8217;s complex</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta">There are a number of possible mechanisms for oxidative addition and the precise one followed depends on the nature of the reacting partners. Vaska&#8217;s complex [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COCl] has been extensively studied and it reacts differently with hydrogen and methyl iodide. Hydrogen is added in a cis fashion, consistent with concerted formation of the two new iridium&#8211;hydrogen bonds. The 16e (count them!), d8, Ir(I) complex becomes a new 18e, d6, Ir(III) species. With methyl iodide the kinetic product is that of trans addition, which is geometrically impossible from a concerted process. Instead, an S<sub>N</sub>2-like mechanism is followed involving nucleophilic displacement of iodide followed by ionic recombination.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Reductive elimination removes metal atoms and forms new single bonds</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent" style="width:70%;">If we want to use organometallic chemistry to make organic compounds other than those containing metals, we must be able to remove the ligands from the coordination sphere of the metal at the end of the reaction. Neutral organic species such as alkenes, phosphines, and carbon monoxide can simply dissociate in the presence of other suitable ligands but those that are bound to the metal with shared electrons require a more active process. Fortunately, most reactions that occur around a transition metal are reversible and so the reverse of oxidative addition, known as <b>reductive elimination</b>, provides a simple route for the release of neutral organic products from a complex. Our general reaction shows M(II) going to M(0), releasing X&#8211;Y. These two ligands were separate in the complex but are bound together in the product. A new X&#8211;Y &#963; bond has been formed.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1074-05.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

This is because the process is concerted. Two examples from palladium chemistry make this point clear. Warming in DMSO causes ethane production from the first palladium complex because the two methyl groups are <i>cis</i> in the square planar complex. The more elaborate second bisphosphine forces the two methyl groups to be <i>trans</i> and reductive elimination does not occur under the same conditions.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4a">L and L<sub>n</sub></h4>
<p class="maxnoindentl">We know that the Pd product here must carry more than just the two ligands it is left with after the reductive elimination, but the scheme we have here doesn&#8217;t tell us what they are. It&#8217;s quite conventional in such cases&#8212;where we are more interested in the structure of the organic product than the remains of the complex&#8212;to indicate a general metal ligand &#8216;L&#8217;, or &#8216;L<sub>n</sub>&#8217; for an undefined number of unknown ligands.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Of course, no one wants to make ethane that way (if at all) but many other pairs of ligands can be coupled by reductive elimination. Reductive elimination is one of the most important methods for the removal of a transition metal from a reaction sequence, leaving a neutral organic product. We will see many examples as the chapter develops but here is an indole synthesis that depends on a reductive elimination at palladium as a last step. In the starting material, palladium has two &#963; bonds sharing electrons with C, and is Pd(II). In the reaction the two C substituents bond together to form the indole ring and a Pd(0) species is eliminated.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Migratory insertion builds ligand structure</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Two ligands can also react together to produce a new complex that still has the composite ligand attached to the metal, ready for further modification. This process involves migration of one of the ligands from the metal to the other ligand, and insertion of one of the ligands into the other metal&#8211;ligand bond. It is known as <b>migratory insertion</b>. The insertion process is reversible and, as the metal effectively loses a ligand in the process, the overall insertion may be driven by the addition of extra external ligands (L) to produce a coordinatively saturated complex. As with reductive elimination, a <i>cis</i> arrangement of the ligands is required and the migrating group (X) retains its stereochemistry (if it has any) during the migration.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Wilkinson&#8217;s catalyst is used in homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes. The catalyst is soluble in many organic solvents such as EtOH, chloroform, or some hydrocarbons. The alkene complexes with the metal and migratory insertion forms an alkyl metal complex by hydrogen transfer. The next step, reductive elimination, usually follows rapidly to give the alkane and a complex that adds a hydrogen molecule to regenerate the catalyst.<a class="page" id="page_1076">Page 1076, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Migratory insertion is the principal way of building up the chain of an organic ligand before elimination. The group to be inserted must be unsaturated in order to accommodate the additional bonds and common examples include carbon monoxide, alkenes, and alkynes, producing metal&#8211;acyl, metal&#8211;alkyl, and metal&#8211;alkenyl complexes, respectively. In each case the insertion is driven by additional external ligands, which may be an increased pressure of carbon monoxide in the case of carbonylation or simply excess phosphine for alkene and alkyne insertions. In principle, the chain extension process can be repeated indefinitely to produce polymers by Ziegler&#8211;Natta polymerization.</p>

Each of these complexes has 18 electrons. If extra CO is added by increasing the pressure, CO inserts into one Fe&#8211;C bond to form an iron acyl complex. Finally, reductive elimination couples the acyl group to the other alkyl group in a conceptually simple ketone synthesis. It does not matter which Fe&#8211;C bond accepts the CO molecule: the same unsymmetrical ketone is produced at the end.</p>

The phosphine adds to the iron and pushes out the poorest ligand (one of the alkyl groups) on to a CO ligand in a process of <b>ligand migration</b>.

It requires a vacant site on the metal as the number of ligands increases in the process and so is favoured by the shortage of ligands in 16-electron complexes. In more complex structures, the metal and the hydride must be <i>syn</i> to each other on the carbon chain for the elimination to be possible. The product is an alkene complex that can lose the neutral alkene simply by ligand exchange. &#946; elimination is an important final step in a number of transition-metal catalysed processes, but it can be a nuisance because Pd&#8211;Et (and other similar Pd&#8211;alkyl) complexes cannot be used as &#946; elimination is too fast.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3" style="width:70%;">Palladium is the most widely used metal in homogeneous catalysis</h3>
<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">These elementary steps form the basis for most of organo-transition metal chemistry, and are the same regardless of the metal and the detailed structure of the ligands. Transition metal catalysis is an enormous and rapidly expanding field that we just do not have the space to discuss in comprehensive detail. Instead, we will concentrate on the chemistry of one important, and representative, transition metal: palladium. Pd-catalysed reactions are widely used in both industrial and academic laboratories, on both a minute and very large scale. The variety of reactions that can be catalysed by Pd together with the range of functional groups tolerated, and usually excellent chemo- and regioselectivity, means that most syntheses of organic molecules of any complexity will now involve palladium chemistry in one or more key steps.</p>
<div class="maxbluea" style="width:68%;">
<h4 class="maxh4a">Choice of palladium complex</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent" style="margin-top:0.4em;">There are many available complexes of palladium(0) and palladium(II). Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium(0), Pd<sub>2</sub>(dba)<sub>3</sub>, or the chloroform complex, Pd<sub>2</sub>(dba)<sub>3</sub><sup><span class="maxblue">&#8226;</span></sup>CHCl<sub>3</sub>, which is air-stable, are the most common sources of palladium(0). The detailed structures of some palladium complexes, particularly the dimers, are beyond the scope of this book but we will discuss the reactions in detail. Palladium(II) complexes are generally more stable than their palladium(0) counterparts. The dichloride PdCl<sub>2</sub> exists as a polymer and is relatively insoluble in most organic solvents. However, (PhCN)<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>2</sub> and (MeCN)<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>2</sub> (both easily prepared from PdCl<sub>2</sub>) are soluble forms of PdCl<sub>2</sub>, as the nitrile ligands are readily displaced in solution. Bis(phosphine)palladium(II) chloride complexes are also air-stable and readily prepared from PdCl<sub>2</sub>. Palladium is, of course, an expensive metal&#8212;these complexes cost about &#163;50&#8211;100 per gram&#8212;but very little is needed for a catalytic reaction.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1078-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</div>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Let&#8217;s start with a review of the basic chemistry of palladium, as you will be seeing many more examples of these steps in specialized situations. Palladium chemistry is dominated by two oxidation states. The lower, palladium(0), present in tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, for example, is nominally electron-rich, and will undergo oxidative addition with suitable substrates such as organic halides, resulting in a palladium(II) complex. Oxidative addition is thought to occur on the coordinatively unsaturated 14-electron species, formed by ligand dissociation in solution.<a class="page" id="page_1079">Page 1079, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1079-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The resulting Pd&#8211;R &#963; bond in such complexes is very reactive, especially towards carbon&#8211;carbon &#960; bonds. Thus an alkene in the reacting system will lead to coordination followed by migratory insertion into the palladium&#8211;carbon &#963; bond. Like hydrometallation this process is a migratory insertion and is called <b>carbopalladation</b> because carbon and palladium become attached to the ends of the alkene system. There is no change in oxidation state during this process, although the ligands (often phosphines) must dissociate to allow coordination of the alkene and associate to provide a stable final 16-electron product.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1079-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">With some metals the process of olefin coordination and insertion may continue, leading to polymerization, but with palladium the metal is expelled from the molecule by a &#946;-hydride elimination reaction and the product is an alkene, plus a Pd(II) complex. For the whole process to be catalytic, this Pd(II) product of &#946;-hydride elimination must be converted to a Pd(0). This occurs in the presence of base, which removes HX from the palladium(II) species. This is another example of reductive elimination: one that forms a hydrogen halide rather than a carbon&#8211;carbon or carbon&#8211;hydrogen bond, as you saw earlier.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1079-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The speed of the &#946;-hydride elimination (which is intramolecular and very fast) means that the original substrate for the oxidative addition reaction must be chosen with care&#8212;the presence of hydrogen at an sp3 carbon in the &#946; position must be avoided. Thus, substrates for oxidative addition reactions in palladium chemistry are frequently vinylic, allylic, or aromatic and never ethyl or <i>n</i>-propyl.</p>

<p class="maxindent">This palladium-catalysed addition of aryl, vinyl, or substituted vinyl groups to organic halides or triflates is one of the most synthetically useful palladium-catalysed reactions. The method is very efficient, and carries out a transformation that is difficult by more traditional techniques. The mechanism involves the oxidative addition of the halide, insertion of the olefin, and elimination of the product by a &#946;-hydride elimination process. A base then regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst. The whole process is a catalytic cycle.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Notice the regioselectivity: unlike the carbonylation on p. <a href="chapter_40.xhtml#page_1077">1077</a>, the Heck reaction favours one isomer, and when the alkene is polarized by an electron-withdrawing group the new C&#8211;C bond forms at the other end of the alkene. Notice also in this example and those below that the Pd is added as Pd(II), not Pd(0): the box below explains how this works.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mild conditions of the Heck reaction mean that protected amino acids can be made without any racemization. The two examples below use a more hindered analogue of triphenyl phosphine, but the mechanism is the same.</p>

Any phosphine may then be used in the reaction, without the need to synthesize and isolate the corresponding palladium(0)&#8211;phosphine complex. The reduction of palladium(II) to palladium(0) can be achieved with amines, phosphines, alkenes, and organometallics such as DIBAL-H, butyllithium, or trialkylaluminium.

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Because &#946;-hydride elimination is reversible, when there is a choice the more stable of the possible alkenes usually results.

<p class="maxnoindent1" style="width:70%;">Reversible &#946;-hydride eliminations provide a mechanism for interconverting regioisomers of an alkene, and the following reaction sequence also illustrates another point about the reductive elimination step: it is a <i>syn</i> elimination, and the C&#8211;Pd and C&#8211;H bonds have to eclipse one another for the Pd&#8211;H bond to form. Oxidative addition of the aryl iodide to a palladium(0) complex, formed from Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> by reduction, gives the active palladium(II) complex ArPdOAcL<sub>2</sub>. Carbopalladation occurs as expected on an electron-rich alkene to give the product of aryl addition to the oxygen end of the alkene in a <i>syn</i> fashion. &#946;-Hydride elimination must occur away from the aryl group because there is only one C&#8211;H bond <i>syn</i> to the C&#8211;Pd bond.

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The initial mechanism is much the same. However, the enol ether has two diastereotopic faces: <i>syn</i> or <i>anti</i> to the aromatic substituent (Ar1) introduced in the first step. Palladium is very sensitive to steric effects and generally forms less hindered complexes where possible, so the palladium(II) complexes the face of the enol ether <i>anti</i> to Ar1. This in turn controls all the subsequent steps, which must be <i>syn</i>, leading to a final product with <i>anti</i> stereochemistry. The requirement for <i>syn</i> &#946;-hydride elimination also explains the regiochemical preference of the elimination. In the &#963;-bonded cyclic structure there is only one hydrogen (green) that is <i>syn</i> to the palladium; the one on the carbon bearing the naphthyl substituent is <i>anti</i> and cannot be eliminated. Further migrations of the alkene by hydropalladation are prevented by the silver carbonate, which rapidly removes iodide from the intermediate, preventing read-dition of Pd&#8211;H to the alkene.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mechanism of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling starts, as in the Heck reaction, with oxidative addition of the halide or triflate to the initial palladium(0) phosphine complex to form a palladium(II) species. But the next step is new: it is a <b>transmetallation</b>, so-called because the nucleophile (R1) is transferred from the metal in the organometallic reagent to the palladium and the counterion (X=halide or triflate) moves in the opposite direction. The new palladium(II) complex with two organic ligands undergoes reductive elimination to give the coupled product and the palladium(0) catalyst, ready for another cycle.</p>

Both components form &#963; complexes with Pd but the halide partner (R2X) bonds first by oxidative addition and this R2&#8211;Pd bond must survive while the metal partner (R1M) transfers R1 to Pd by transmetallation. Once the two components are joined to the palladium atom, only the cross-coupled product can be formed. R2X combines with Pd(0) and R1M with Pd(II). There can then be no confusion. In contrast to the Heck reaction, here the metal defines the location of the new C&#8211;Pd bond.</p>

The important difference is the transmetallation step, which explains the need for an additional base, usually sodium or potassium ethoxide or hydroxide, in the Suzuki coupling.

By now, you should not be surprised by the mechanism! Oxidative addition of the organic halide gives a palladium(II) intermediate that undergoes transmetallation with the alkynyl copper (generated from the terminal alkyne, base, and copper iodide). Reductive elimination with coupling of the two organic ligands gives the product and regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst.</p>

Symmetrical ene-diynes may be synthesized in one step from two molecules of a terminal alkyne and Z-dihaloethylene. The ene-diyne part of the molecule does the remarkable Bergmann cyclization to give a benzene diradical: the ene-diyne is able to penetrate DNA and the diradical is able to react with it, giving the compounds anticancer activity. To make the most biologically active compounds, however, the reaction is performed sequentially, allowing different functionality on each of the alkyne units.</p>

This problem was described in <a href="chapter_24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>.

<p class="maxnoindentl">You can represent the palladium &#960;-allyl cation complex in two ways. Either you draw a neutral allyl group complexed to Pd<sup>+</sup> or you draw an allyl cation complexed to neutral Pd. Although the counting is different (Pd<sup>+</sup> has only nine electrons: the neutral allyl has three, but the allyl cation only two), both come out as &#951;3 16-electron species, which is just as well as they are merely different ways of drawing the same thing.</p>

The full catalytic cycle is shown below, with the intermediate &#960;-allyl complex in equilibrium between the neutral version, which has the leaving group coordinated to palladium, and the cationic &#960;-allyl complex.</p>

Coordination of Pd to the double bond of the allylic acetate occurs on the less hindered face opposite the leaving group and we can think of the oxidative addition step as an invertive nucleophilic displacement of the leaving group by a pair of Pd electrons. The nucleophile then adds to the face of the &#960;-allyl Pd cation complex opposite the Pd. The net result is displacement of the leaving group by the nucleophile with retention. Thereafter, the <a class="page" id="page_1090">Page 1090, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a>nucleophile attacks from the less hindered face of the resulting &#960;-allyl complex (that is, away from the metal), leading to overall retention of configuration.</p>

The relief of strain in the three-membered ring drives the reaction with palladium(0) to produce the zwitterionic intermediate.

The sodium salts of malonate esters react with this monoacetate under palladium catalysis at the less hindered end to give the allylic alcohol.</p>

One of the most successful of these is the use of trimethylenemethane [3 + 2] cycloaddition, catalysed by palladium(0) complexes. The trimethylenemethane unit in these reactions is derived from 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2-propen-1-yl acetate, which is at the same time an allyl silane and an allylic acetate. This makes it both a weak nucleophile and an electrophile in the presence of palladium(0). Formation of the palladium &#960;-allyl complex is followed by removal of the trimethylsilyl group by nucleophilic attack of the<a class="page" id="page_1092">Page 1092, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a> resulting acetate ion, thus producing a zwitterionic palladium complex that can undergo cycloaddition reactions.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Palladium-catalysed amination of aromatic rings</h3>
<p class="maxnoindent" style="width:70%;margin-top:0.5em;">You&#8217;ve seen that palladium catalysis helps form carbon&#8211;carbon bonds that are difficult to make using conventional reactions. It can also help form carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds that are difficult to make, and you have already seen some examples in the reactions of &#960;-allyl complexes. Work starting in the 1990s by Buchwald and Hartwig has shown that Pd can be used to promote nucleophilic substitution at a vinylic or aromatic centre&#8212;a reaction which would not normally be possible. For example, aromatic amines can be prepared directly from the corresponding bromides, iodides, or triflates and the required amine in the presence of palladium(0) and a strong alkoxide base.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The mechanisms and catalysts used in this &#8216;Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8217; chemistry mirror those of coupling reactions involving oxidative addition, transmetallation, and reductive elimination. The first step, as usual, is oxidative insertion of Pd(0) into the aryl&#8211;halogen bond. The Pd(II) complex now adds the amine so that both coupling partners find themselves bonded to the same palladium atom. The base eliminates H&#8211;I from the complex and reductive elimination forms the Ar&#8211;N bond.</p>

The ability to act as a ligand for palladium is the important thing. The ligand xantphos (see above) is used in these reactions and again the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring is of little account.

The C&#8211;N coupling chemistry of Buchwald and Hartwig could have been made for this problem.</p>

However, there is a potential problem of selectivity: we want to add this benzene ring just once, and the way to do this is to protect one nitrogen atom by reductive amination with benzaldehyde. The remaining NH group can then be coupled to the aromatic ring and the benzyl group removed by hydrogenation.</p>

Now we can disconnect the two C&#8211;N bonds with the idea of putting a halide (X) at the point of substitution in each aromatic coupling partner.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The substituents on the right-hand ring are both electron withdrawing and are <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to the leaving group. As you know from <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>, this is perfect for ordinary nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8212;so much so that chloride is a good enough choice and it is not necessary to use fluoride. The left-hand ring has again a good electron-withdrawing substituent but it is <i>meta</i> to the halide and so nucleophilic aromatic substitution will not work. Palladium catalysis is needed. Chemists at Berlex Biosciences chose to introduce the left-hand ring first.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3" style="width:70%;">Alkenes coordinated to palladium(II) are attacked by nucleophiles</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Now for another case where a transition metal catalysis facilitates a reaction that would not occur under normal conditions: nucleophilic attack on an isolated double bond. Usually alkenes react with nucleophiles only when conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group. But coordination of an electron-rich alkene to a transition metal ion such as palladium(II) changes its reactivity dramatically: electron density is drawn towards the metal and away from the &#960; orbitals of the alkene. This leads to activation towards attack by nucleophiles, just as in conjugate addition, and unusual chemistry follows. Unusual, that is, for the alkene; the palladium centre behaves exactly as expected.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1096-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindent"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt=""/> This regioselectivity is not the same as in the Heck reaction, where attack mostly occurs at the end of the alkene. Internal nucleophiles transferred from the palladium to the alkene usually prefer the terminal position of the alkene but external nucleophiles usually prefer the more substituted end.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Many nucleophiles, such as water, alcohols, and carboxylates, are compatible with an alkene&#8211;Pd(II) complex and can attack the complexed alkene from the side opposite the palladium. The attack of the nucleophile is regioselective for the more substituted position. This parallels attack on bromonium ions but is probably governed by the need for the bulky palladium to be in the less hindered position.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1096-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The resulting Pd(II) &#963;-alkyl species decomposes by &#946;-hydride elimination to reveal the substituted alkene. Reductive elimination of a proton and the leaving group, usually chloride, leads to palladium(0). The weakness of this reaction is that the catalytic cycle is not complete: Pd(II), not Pd(0), is needed to complex the next alkene.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1096-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">There are two solutions to this problem. We could use stoichiometric Pd(II) but this is acceptable only if the product is very valuable or the reaction is performed on a small scale. It is better to use an external oxidant to return the palladium to the Pd(II) oxidation state so that the cycle can continue. Air alone does not react fast enough (even though Pd(0) must be protected from air to avoid oxidation) but, in combination with copper(II) chloride, oxygen completes the catalytic cycle. CuCl<sub>2</sub> oxidizes Pd(0) to Pd(II) and is itself oxidized back to Cu(II) by oxygen, ready to oxidize more palladium.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Oxypalladation and the Wacker oxidation</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">This combination of reagents has been used to oxidize terminal vinyl groups to methyl ketones and is known as the <b>Wacker oxidation</b>. The nucleophile is simply water, which attacks the activated alkene at the more substituted end in an <i>oxypalladation</i> step. &#946;-Hydride elimination from the resulting &#963;-alkyl palladium complex releases the enol, which is rapidly converted into the more stable keto form. Overall, the reaction is a hydration of a terminal alkene that can tolerate a range of functional groups.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1096-04.jpg" alt="images"/><a class="page" id="page_1097">Page 1097, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">A related reaction is the oxidation of silyl enol ethers to enones. This requires stoichiometric palladium(II), although reoxidation of Pd(0) with benzoquinone can cut that down to about half an equivalent. The reaction provides a valuable way of turning regioselective methods for making silyl enol ethers (<a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>) into regioselective methods for oxidizing ketones to enones. The first step is again oxypalladation and &#946; elimination puts the alkene in conjugation with the ketone: there are no &#946; hydrogens on the other side.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1097-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">An example of catalytic oxypalladation is the rearrangement of allylic acetates with Pd(II). The reaction starts with oxypalladation of the alkene and it is the acetate already present in the molecule that provides the nucleophile to attack the alkene. The intermediate can reverse the oxypalladation in either direction and the product is whichever allylic acetate has the more substituted alkene. In this case, trisubstituted beats monosubstituted easily.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1097-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The reaction is <i>E</i>-selective, which means that a simple synthesis of an <i>E,Z</i>-diene is possible from the symmetrical acetate with two <i>Z</i>-allylic alkenes. The one that rearranges goes <i>E</i> and the one that stays behind remains <i>Z</i>. The driving force for this rearrangement, from one disubstituted alkene to another, is establishment of conjugation.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1097-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h4 class="maxh4">Alcohols and amines as intramolecular nucleophiles</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Cyclic ethers and amines can be formed with an intramolecular alcohol or amine nucleophile. Stoichiometric palladium can be avoided by using benzoquinone as the stoichiometric oxidant with a catalytic amount of palladium. In this example intramolecular oxypalladation of a diene is followed by attack of an external nucleophile on a &#960;-allyl complex.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1097-04.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Palladium coordinates to one face of the diene, promoting intramolecular attack by the alcohol on the opposite face. The resulting &#960;-allyl palladium can form a &#960;-allyl complex with the palladium on the lower face simply by sliding along to interact with the double bond. Nucleophilic attack of chloride from the lithium salt then proceeds in the usual way on the face opposite palladium. The overall addition to the diene is therefore <i>cis</i>.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;margin-left:-5em;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1097-05.jpg" alt="images"/><a class="page" id="page_1098">Page 1098, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Nitrogen nucleophiles also attack alkenes activated by Pd(II), and benzoquinone can again act as a reoxidant, allowing the use of catalytic quantities of palladium. The mechanism follows the same pattern as for oxygen nucleophiles, and a final isomerization produces the most stable regioisomer of product. In this example the product is an aromatic indole, so the double bond migrates into the five-membered ring.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1098-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">If the substrate lacks a hydrogen suitable for &#946; elimination and there is another alkene present in the molecule, the &#963;-alkyl palladium intermediate can follow the Heck pathway to form a bicyclic structure in a tandem reaction sequence. Once again, the final step is a palladium-hydride-mediated isomerization to give the endocyclic alkene.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Palladium catalysis in the total synthesis of a natural alkaloid</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">We take our leave of palladium by presenting a synthesis of an alkaloid, <i>N</i>-acetyl clavicipitic acid methyl ester, by Hegedus. The power of organometallic chemistry is illustrated in five of the steps in this seven-step process (the metals are highlighted in orange). Each of the organometallic steps catalysed by Pd(0) or Pd(II) has been described in this chapter. The overall yield is 18%, a remarkably good result for a molecule of such complexity.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The first step is to make an indole by Pd(II)-catalysed cyclization in the presence of benzoquinone as reoxidant. The nucleophilic nature of the 3-position of the indole (<a href="chapter_30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>) was exploited to introduce the required iodide functionality. Rather than direct iodination, a high-yielding two-step procedure involving mercuration followed by iodination was employed.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1098-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Aryl iodides are more reactive towards oxidative addition than aryl bromides, and a selective Heck coupling (without phosphine ligands) with an unsaturated side chain left the bromide in place. A second Heck reaction of this bromide with an allylic alcohol was used to introduce a second side chain. Cyclization of the amide on to the allylic alcohol was achieved with palladium catalysis, not as might have been expected with palladium(0) but instead with palladium(II), to produce the seven-membered ring. Finally, the conjugated double bond was reduced and the sulfonamide removed under photolytic conditions.<a class="page" id="page_1099">Page 1099, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>

<h3 class="maxh3">An overview of some other transition metals</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Some metals&#8212;palladium chief among them&#8212;see continual service in catalysis but others have their day and then fall out of favour when better alternatives become available. Tin is less popular now than it was 20 years ago because of its toxicity. A more serious case is mercury. Mercury(II) is an excellent catalyst for the addition of water to alkynes. But mercury is very toxic indeed, and the last ten years have seen its role largely superseded by gold. Do not recoil at the expense! Gold is expensive on the scale used to make rings, plates, medals, and coins, but here it is used in only catalytic quantities. Gold is in fact less expensive than palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium. Part of the age-old appeal of gold is its unreactivity as a metal: it is very stable but it does form Au(I) and Au(III) salts such as AuCl and AuCl<sub>3</sub>. Both are available commercially and are generally used as their phosphine complexes.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Gold: activating alkynes</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Au(I) and Au(III) form cationic &#960; complexes with alkynes and these react with nucleophiles of many kinds. With water the result is simple: it adds to the more substituted end of the alkyne and the net result is hydration to give a ketone.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;margin-left:-5em;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1099-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This simple reactivity can be developed in many more elaborate ways you can read about elsewhere, but simple examples include hydration of an enyne to form a conjugated ketone and the capture of the ketone by intramolecular acetal formation. The details give you an idea of reagents, solvents, and yields.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">The theme of this chapter is that transition metals let you do things to organic molecules which are unthinkable without them. Nowhere is this more true than in metathesis reactions, and we finish the chapter with a reminder of the power of the ruthenium catalysts we introduced in <a href="chapter_38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a>. There we discussed the carbene-based mechanism of the reaction, and we showed you some simple examples such as this cyclization of a symmetrical amine to give a five-membered heterocycle using a catalytic amount of the ruthenium complex known as Grubbs I catalyst.<a class="page" id="page_1100">Page 1100, Chapter 40 Organometallic chemistry</a></p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1100-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The synthesis of a sleep-inducing drug by GlaxoSmithKline in their laboratories at Verona used a very similar metathesis, although on an unsymmetrical amine and giving a six-membered heterocycle. The starting material is also a single enantiomer and the stereochemistry is important as the cyclopropane, introduced by a Simmons&#8211;Smith reaction (<a href="chapter_38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a>), must be on the opposite face of the six-membered ring to the side chain.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1100-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">At another GlaxoSmithKline site, in the USA, the development of a drug for osteoporosis and osteoarthritis required a seven-membered heterocycle with two controlled chiral centres. This time the Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalyst had to be used but the loading is very low indeed. Notice also that a free OH group does not interfere.</p>
<figure style="width:100%;margin-left:-5em;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1100-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Our third example comes from Syngenta&#8217;s crop protection laboratory in Basel. It is another cyclization but this time to form an oxygen heterocycle with four chiral centres. The final product of this synthesis is malayamycin A, a natural fungicide found in bacteria. The metathesis step is early in the synthesis and you will notice that the alkene formed in this cyclization is used to provide two more chiral centres in malayamycin.</p>
