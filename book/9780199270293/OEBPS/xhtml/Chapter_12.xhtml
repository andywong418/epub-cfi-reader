<p class="noindent">If you go into a chemistry laboratory, you will see some reactions being heated in boiling solvent (perhaps 80 to 120 &#x00B0;C), and you will see others being performed at maybe &#x2013;80 &#x00B0;C or below. Some reactions are over in a few minutes; others are left for hours. In some reactions the amounts of reagents are critical; in others large excesses are used. Some reactions use water as a solvent; in others it must be rigorously excluded, and perhaps toluene, ether, ethanol, or DMF is essential for the success of the reaction. Why such a diverse range of conditions? How can conditions be chosen to favour the reaction we want? To explain all this we will need to work through some thermodynamic principles. We will take a practical, visual approach to the topic, and we will avoid detailed algebraic discussion: for that you are welcome to turn to a textbook of physical chemistry&#x2014;there are some suggestions at the end of this chapter. In fact, we will use only two algebraic equations. Both are so important that you should memorize them; the second in particular can be extremely valuable when we think about how to get reactions to work.</p>

<p class="hang">&#x2018;The most important factor in the strength of an acid is the stability of the conjugate base&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>); &#x2018;F<sup>-</sup> is much more stable than CH<sup>&#x2013;</sup><sub>3</sub> because fluorine is much more electronegative than carbon&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>); &#x2018;Oximes are more stable than imines because the electronegative substituent can participate in delocalization of the imine double bond&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>);</p>
<p class="noindent">and about the <i>rate of reactions:</i></p>
<p class="hang">&#x2018;Benzaldehyde is reduced about 400 times faster than acetophenone in isopropanol&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>); &#x2018;While amines react with acetic anhydride quite rapidly at room temperature (reaction complete in a few hours), alcohols react extremely slowly in the absence of a base&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>); &#x2018;Secondary and tertiary amides are difficult to hydrolyse but a similar mechanism is successful with only a little water and plenty of a strong base&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>); &#x2018;Acyclic hemiacetals form relatively slowly from an aldehyde or ketone plus an alcohol, but their rate of formation is greatly increased either by acid or by base&#x2019; (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">We are now going to consider in detail why some reactions can run forwards or backwards, why some form products irreversibly, why some reach an equilibrium, why some reactions go fast and some go slow, and what stability has to do with all of this. Understanding these factors will allow you to make the reactions you want to happen go faster and the reactions you don&#x2019;t want to happen go slower, giving you a product in a useful yield. We shall be breaking reaction mechanisms down into steps and working out which step is the most important. But first we must consider what we really mean by the &#x2018;stability&#x2019; of molecules and what determines how much of one substance you get when it is in equilibrium with another.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stability and energy levels</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:60%;">So far we have been rather vague about the term &#x2018;stability&#x2019;, just saying things like &#x2018;this compound is more stable than that compound&#x2019;. What we really mean is that this compound has less energy than that one. For example, as you know from Chapters 4 and 7 alkenes can come in two forms we can call <i>cis</i> and <i>trans.</i> In general <i>trans</i>-alkenes are more stable than <i>cis</i>-alkenes. How do we know? Well, we can convert both <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-butene</i> to the same alkane, butane, by adding a molecule of hydrogen. Energy is given out during the reaction, and if we measure how much energy we get from hydrogenation of <i>trans</i>-butene and compare it with the amount we get from <i>cis</i>-butene, we find that the cis-alkene give us about 2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> more. Cis-butene is higher in energy, and must therefore be less stable. We can represent this in the energy profile diagram on the right. The two red lines show the energies of the molecules, and the black arrows the amount of energy released when hydrogen is added.</p>
<figure style="margin-top:-17em;float:right;">
<img src="../images/pg241.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This comparison of energy is most interesting when two compounds can interconvert. For example, as you saw in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, rotation about the C&#x2013;N bond of an amide is slow because delocalization of the N lone pair gives it some double-bond character.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> We used a similar argument to compare the stabilities of benzene and cyclooctatetraene (see p. <a href="chapter_7.xhtml#page_157">157</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The C&#x2013;N bond can rotate, but the rotation is slow and can be measured by NMR spectroscopy. We might expect to find two forms of an amide of the type RNH&#x2013;COR: one with the two R groups <i>trans</i> to one another, and one with them <i>cis</i>. Depending on the size of R we should expect one form to be more stable than the other and we can represent this on an energy profile diagram showing the relationship between the two molecules in energy terms.<a id="page_242" class="page">Page 242, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="indent">This time there is an axis along the bottom indicating the extent of rotation about the C&#x2013;N bond. The two red lines show the energies of the molecules and the curved black line shows what must happen in energy terms as the two forms interconvert. Energy goes up as the C&#x2013;N bond starts to rotate and reaches a maximum at point X when rotation by 90&#x00B0; has removed the conjugation (the nitrogen lone pair can&#x2019;t delocalize into the C&#x003D;O bond because it is perpendicular to the C&#x003D;O &#x03C0;* orbital) before falling again as the conjugation is regained.</p>

<p class="indent">The relative energies of the two states will depend on the nature of R.

<h3 class="h3">How the equilibrium constant varies with the difference in energy between reactants and products</h3>
<p class="noindent">You saw that when the energies of the two forms of the amide were the same, the equilibrium constant for their interconversion must be <i>K</i> &#x003D; 1. When one was higher in energy than the other, we just said that <i>K</i> was &#x2018;large&#x2019;. But we can be more specific. For any reaction in equilibrium, the equilibrium constant <i>K</i> is related to the difference in energy between the starting materials and the products by the following equation:</p>
<p class="fig1">&#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; -<i>RT</i> ln<i>K</i></p>
<p class="noindent">where &#x0394;<i>G</i> (the <b>free energy</b> of the reaction) is the difference in energy between the two states (in kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), <i>T</i> is the temperature (in kelvin, not &#x00B0;C), and <i>R</i> is a constant known as the <b>gas constant</b> and equal to 8.314 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">This relationship was derived by the American physical chemist J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s.</p>

<h3 class="h3">An example: hydration of an aldehyde</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> we showed you that water adds reversibly to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde: the aldehyde and the hydrate are in equilibrium. Here&#x2019;s the example with isobutyraldehyde (2-methylpropanal). The equilibrium constant is the concentration of hydrate at equilibrium divided by the concentration of aldehyde, also at equilibrium.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Although water is involved in the reaction, you saw on p. <a href="chapter_8.xhtml#page_169">169</a> that the concentration of neat water effectively remains constant at 55.5 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> and is usually not included in the equilibrium constant.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg243.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent" style="width:60%;">The concentrations of hydrate and aldehyde at equilibrium in water may be determined by measuring the UV absorption of known concentrations of aldehyde in water and comparing these with the absorptions in a solvent such as cyclohexane where no hydrate formation is possible. Such experiments reveal that the equilibrium constant for this reaction in water at 25 &#x00B0;C is approximately 0.5 so that there is about twice as much aldehyde as hydrate in the equilibrium mixture.</p>
<p class="indent" style="width:60%;">Using the equation above, we find that the corresponding value for &#x0394;<i>G</i> is &#x2013;8.314 &#x00D7; 298 &#x00D7; ln(0.5) &#x003D; &#x002B;1.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. In other words, the solution of the hydrate in water is 1.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the solution of the aldehyde in water. All this can be shown on an energy profile diagram.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The sign of &#x0394;<i>G</i> tells us whether products or reactants are favoured at equilibrium</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the equilibrium above, the hydrate is higher in energy than the aldehyde: at equilibrium there is more aldehyde than hydrate, and the equilibrium constant is therefore less than 1. Whenever this is the case (i.e. the equilibrium lies to the side of the reactants, rather than the <a id="page_244" class="page">Page 244, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a> products) <i>K</i> will be less than 1. This means that its logarithm must be negative and, because &#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; <i>-RT</i>ln<i>K</i>, &#x0394;<i>G</i> must be positive. Conversely, for a reaction in which products are favoured over reactants, <i>K</i> must be greater than 1, its logarithm will be positive, and hence &#x0394;<i>G</i> must be negative.

Since the position of the equilibrium favours neither the starting materials nor the products, how can we manipulate the conditions of the reaction if we actually want to make 100&#x0025; ester?</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_245" class="page">Page 245, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The important point is that, at any one particular temperature, the equilibrium constant is just that&#x2014;<i>constant.</i> This gives us a means of forcing the equilibrium to favour the products (or reactants) since the ratio between them must remain constant. Imagine what happens if we add more methanol to the reaction above. [MeOH] increases, but the overall value of <i>K</i> has to stay the same. The only way this can happen is if more of the ester converts to the acid. Alternatively, imagine removing water from the equilibrium. [H<sub>2</sub>O] goes down, so to bring <i>K</i> back to the value of 1, the concentrations of acid and methanol are going to have to go down too, by converting themselves to ester and water.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg245.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This is exactly how the equilibrium is manipulated in practice. One way to make esters in the laboratory is to use a large excess of the alcohol and remove water continually from the system as it is formed, for example by distilling it out. This means that in the equilibrium mixture there is a tiny quantity of water, lots of the ester, lots of the alcohol, and very little of the carboxylic acid; in other words, we have converted the carboxylic acid into the ester. We must still use an acid catalyst, but the acid must be anhydrous since we do not want any water present&#x2014;commonly used acids are toluenesulfonic acid (tosic acid, TsOH), concentrated sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), or gaseous HCl. The acid catalyst does not alter the position of the equilibrium; it simply speeds up the rate of the reaction, allowing equilibrium to be reached more quickly. This is an important point that we will come back to shortly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Almost all methods for hydrolysing an ester in order to convert it back to an acid and an alcohol simply make use of excess water. Increasing [H<sub>2</sub>O] forces more acid and alcohol to form to restore the equilibrium, and in favourable situations high yields of the acid and alcohol are formed.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Entropy is important in determining equilibrium constants</h2>
<p class="noindent">The equation we introduced on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_243">243</a> tells us that an equilibrium favours whichever of the reactants or products has lower energy. But you might reasonably ask this question: why does it just <i>favour</i> the components with lower energy? Why do you get <i>any</i> of the higher energy ones at all? For the hydration on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_243">243</a>, for example, the hydrate is 1.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the starting aldehyde, so why does the aldehyde react at all? Surely the equilibrium would attain a lower energy state, not with just an excess of aldehyde over hydrate, but with no hydrate at all?</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> That equation again: &#x0394;<i>G</i> = -<i>RT</i>ln<i>K</i></p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The answer is due to <i>entropy,</i> a measure of disorder. Even when there is a difference in energy between the starting materials and products in an equilibrium, you still get <i>some</i> of the less stable components. Put simply, having a mixture of components is favourable because a mixture has higher entropy than a pure compound, and equilibria tend to maximize overall entropy. This may be quite a new concept to you, so we will now work our way stepwise through these ideas.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_12.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Energy, enthalpy, and entropy: &#x0394;<i>G</i>, &#x0394;<i>H</i>, and &#x0394;<i>S</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The equation in the margin just above tells us that the sign and magnitude of the energy &#x0394;<i>G</i> are the only things that matter in deciding whether an equilibrium goes in one direction or another. If &#x0394;<i>G</i> is negative the equilibrium will favour the products and if &#x0394;<i>G</i> is large and negative the reaction can go to completion. The table on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_244">244</a> tells us that it is enough for &#x0394;<i>G</i> to be only about &#x2013;10 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> to get complete reaction. But we haven&#x2019;t yet considered what &#x0394;<i>G</i> actually corresponds to <i>physically</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">To do this we need to introduce our second equation. The free energy of a reaction, &#x0394;<i>G</i>, is related to two other quantities, the enthalpy of reaction, &#x0394;H, and the entropy of reaction, &#x0394;S, by the equation:</p>
<p class="fig1">&#x0394;<i>G</i> = &#x0394;<i>H</i> -<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> If you are interested in the derivation of this equation, which is an expression of the second law of thermodynamics, you will need to consult a textbook of physical chemistry. But you will be able to follow the explanations below without knowing the background to the equation.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As before, <i>T</i> is the temperature of the reaction in kelvin. Enthalpy, <i>H</i>, is a measure of heat, and the change in enthalpy, &#x0394;<i>H</i>, in a chemical reaction is the <b>heat given out or taken up</b> in that reaction. Reactions which give out heat are called <i>exothermic,</i> and have negative &#x0394;<i>H</i>; reactions which take in heat are called <i>endothermic</i> and have positive &#x0394;<i>H</i>. Since breaking bonds requires energy and making bonds liberates energy, the enthalpy change gives an indication of whether the products have more stable bonds than the starting materials or not.</p>
<p class="indent">Entropy, <i>S</i>, is a measure of the <b>disorder in the system</b>, so &#x0394;<i>S</i> represents the entropy difference&#x2014;the change in disorder&#x2014;between the starting materials and the products. More disorder gives a positive &#x0394;<i>S</i>; less disorder a negative &#x0394;<i>S</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">So &#x0394;<i>G</i> represents a combination of heat and disorder. But what does this mean for you as a chemist wanting to get a reaction to work the way you want it to? We know that for a favourable change (i.e. an equilibrium favouring products) &#x0394;<i>G</i> must be negative&#x2014;in fact the more negative the better, as this gives a larger equilibrium constant. Since &#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; &#x0394;<i>H</i>&#x2013;<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i>, we get a large, negative &#x0394;<i>G</i> most readily if:</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>1.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x0394;H is negative, i.e. the reaction is exothermic.</p>
<p class="noindent">and</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="c_blue1"><b>2.</b></span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x0394;S is positive (and hence &#x2013;<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i> is negative), i.e. the reaction becomes more disordered.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_247" class="page">Page 247, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, we can still get a negative &#x0394;<i>G</i> from an endothermic reaction (i.e. from a positive &#x0394;H) but only if the reaction products are more disordered than the starting materials; likewise a reaction which becomes more ordered as it proceeds can still be favourable, but only if it is exothermic to compensate for the loss of entropy.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the factor <i>T</i> multiplying the entropy term, both the equilibrium constant <i>K</i> (which depends on &#x0394;<i>G</i>) and the relative importance of the two quantities (&#x0394;<i>H</i> and &#x0394;<i>S</i>) will vary with temperature (entropy changes are more important at higher temperatures). We&#x2019;ll now look at some examples to see how this works in practice.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_12.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">Enthalpy versus entropy&#x2014;some examples</h3>
<p class="noindent">Entropy dominates equilibrium constants in the difference between inter-and intramolecular reactions. In <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> we explained that hemiacetal formation is often an equilibrium, with neither starting materials nor products strongly favoured. The addition of ethanol to acetaldehyde shown below on the left, for example, has an equilibrium constant not far from 1. Overall, &#x0394;<i>G</i> must therefore be approximately 0 (in fact it&#x2019;s very slightly positive). The <i>enthalpy</i> change associated with the reaction is the result of the change in bonding: in this case, a C&#x003D;O double bond becomes two C&#x2013;O single bonds, and these two single bonds are marginally more stable than the C&#x003D;O double bond, therefore &#x0394;<i>H</i> is slightly negative. But working against this is the fact that every molecule of hemiacetal that forms consumes two molecules of starting material. Decreasing the number of molecules (and moving from a mixture of aldehyde and alcohol towards pure hemiacetal) leads to an increase in the order of the mixture&#x2014;in other words a <i>decrease</i> in entropy. &#x0394;<i>S</i> is negative, so the <i>&#x2013;T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i> is positive, just about counterbalancing the small negative &#x0394;<i>H</i>, and giving a slightly positive &#x0394;<i>G</i>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="bbox1">
<p class="noindent2">A mixture has more entropy than a pure substance because there are many more ways of arranging a mixture. Imagine lining up every molecule in a mole of substance and a mole of a 1:1 mixture. For the pure substance, each member of the line of molecules has to be the same. For the mixture, at every position in the line there is a choice of two alternatives, giving a huge number of possible arrangements.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg247.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reaction on the right is different because it is an <i>intra</i>molecular reaction: the hydroxyl group and aldehyde lie in the same molecule. &#x0394;<i>H</i> will have essentially the same value as in the intermolecular reaction on the left, but as the intramolecular reaction progresses, one molecule stays one molecule&#x2014;there is consequently a much less significant decrease in entropy. Our <i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i> term no longer weighs against the negative &#x0394;<i>H</i> term, making &#x0394;<i>G</i> negative overall and allowing the equilibrium to lie to the right.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> we showed you how acetals can be used as base-stable protective groups to prevent nucleophiles attacking carbonyl groups. The acetals we chose to use were cyclic compounds known as dioxolanes, for a very good reason: cyclic acetals are more resistant to hydrolysis than their acyclic counterparts. They are also easier to make&#x2014;they form quite readily, even from ketones. Again, we have entropic factors to thank for their stability. For the formation of an acyclic acetal (below on the left), three molecules go in and two come out, but for a cyclic one, a cyclic acetal, two molecules go in (ketone plus diol) and two molecules come out (acetal plus water), so the usually unfavourable &#x0394;<i>S</i> factor is no longer against us.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Overcoming entropy: orthoesters</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">There is a neat way of sidestepping the entropic problem associated with making acyclic acetals: we can use an <i>ortho-ester</i> as a source of alcohol. Orthoesters can be viewed as the &#x2018;acetals of esters&#x2019;, which are hydrolysed by water, when catalysed by acid, to an ordinary ester and two molecules of alcohol.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/pg248.jpg" alt="images"/>

</figure>
<p class="bnoindent">Ketones or aldehydes undergo acetal exchange with orthoesters. The mechanism starts off as if the orthoester is going to hydrolyse but the alcohol released adds to the ketone and acetal formation begins. The water produced is taken out of the equilibrium by hydrolysis of the orthoester, and we get two molecules from two: entropy is no longer our enemy.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Equilibrium constants vary with temperature</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have said (p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_245">245</a>) that the equilibrium constant is a constant only as long as the temperature does not change. We can work out exactly how the equilibrium constant varies with temperature by putting our two all-important equations &#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; &#x2013;<i>RT</i>ln<i>K</i> and &#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; &#x0394;H&#x2013;<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i> together to make</p>
<p class="fig1">&#x2013;<i>RT</i>ln<i>K</i> &#x003D; &#x0394;<i>H</i> -<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i></p>
<p class="indent">If we divide throughout by <i>&#x2013;RT</i> we have</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg248-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This equation separates the equilibrium constant <i>K</i> into enthalpy and entropy terms, but it is the enthalpy term that determines how <i>K</i> varies with temperature. Plotting ln <i>K</i> against 1/T would give us a straight line with slope &#x2013;&#x0394;<i>H/R</i> and intercept &#x0394;<i>S/R</i>. Since <i>T</i> (the temperature in kelvin) is always positive, whether the slope is positive or negative depends on the sign of &#x0394;<i>H</i>: if &#x0394;<i>H</i> is negative then, as temperature increases, ln <i>K</i> (and hence <i>K</i>) increases. In other words, if the reaction is exothermic (that is, gives out heat) then at higher temperatures the equilibrium constant will be smaller. For an endothermic reaction, as the temperature is increased, the equilibrium constant increases.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_12.4.1">
<h3 class="h3">Some reactions are reversible on heating: cracking</h3>
<p class="noindent">Notice that the equation above also tells us that enthalpy becomes a less important contributor to the equilibrium constant as temperature increases, so the higher the temperature, the more important is the entropy term. This fact means that some reactions favour one side of the equilibrium at low temperature but the other at high temperature. Here is an example: the dimerization of cyclopentadiene. You will meet the mechanism of this reaction in <a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a>, but for<a id="page_249" class="page">Page 249, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a> now we can just treat it as a simple dimerization reaction in which two C &#x003D; C &#x03C0; bonds are replaced by two C&#x2013;C &#x03C3; bonds&#x2014;enthalpically a very favourable process because &#x03C3; bonds are stronger than &#x03C0; bonds. On standing at low temperature, cyclopentadiene converts to the dimer even though two monomer molecules have more entropy than one molecule of the dimer.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg249.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But on heating, the dimer breaks down to give monomeric cyclopentadiene: the equilibrium constant now favours the starting materials. As we predicted, because the reaction is exothermic, heating it makes it less favourable. You can also think of it in terms of our earlier equation &#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; &#x0394;<i>H</i> &#x2013;<i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S:</i> at low temperature, the large negative &#x0394;<i>H</i> term dominates, and &#x0394;<i>G</i> is large and negative too. But as <i>T</i> increases, the positive &#x0394;<i>S</i> becomes more important, and eventually <i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i> overtakes &#x0394;<i>H</i> and &#x0394;<i>G</i> becomes positive, and the reaction now favours starting materials.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to use cyclopentadiene, you have to heat the dimer to &#x2018;crack&#x2019; it (&#x2018;cracking&#x2019; is the term used for getting monomers from dimers or polymers). If you lazily leave the monomer overnight and plan to do your reaction tomorrow, you will return in the morning to find dimer.</p>
<p class="indent">This idea becomes even more pointed when we look at polymerization. Polyvinyl chloride is the familiar plastic PVC and is made by reaction of large numbers of monomeric vinyl chloride molecules. There is, of course, an enormous decrease in entropy in this reaction any polymerization will not occur above a certain temperature. Some polymers can be depolym-erized at high temperatures and this can be the basis for recycling.</p>

<p class="bnoindent">You may well be familiar with a rule that helps to predict how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in external conditions&#x2014;<b>Le Ch&#x00E2;telier&#x2019;s principle</b>. This says that if we disturb a system at equilibrium it will respond so as to minimize the effect of the disturbance.

This is a consequence of the equilibrium constant being, well..., constant and hardly needs anybody&#x2019;s principle.</p>
<p class="bindent">Another disturbance is heating. If a reaction under equilibrium is heated, how the equilibrium changes depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.

<h2 class="h2">Introducing kinetics: how to make reactions go faster and cleaner</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although in chemistry laboratories you will see lots of reactions being heated, very rarely will this be to alter the equilibrium position. This is because most reactions are not carried out reversibly and so the ratio of products to reactants is not an equilibrium ratio. The main reason chemists heat up reactions is simple&#x2014;it speeds them up. The study of the rates of reactions, as opposed to their equilibrium states, is known as <b>kinetics</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">Since isooctane can exist in an atmosphere of oxygen despite the fact that the equilibrium position really would be completely on the side of the combustion products, the only conclusion we can draw must be that a mixture of isooctane and oxygen cannot be at equilibrium. A small burst of energy is needed to reach equilibrium: in a car engine, the spark plug provides this energy and combustion occurs. Without this burst of energy, the petrol is stable and no combustion occurs (as you will ruefully be aware if you have ever tried to start a car with a flat battery).</p>
<p class="indent">The mixture of petrol and oxygen is said to be <i>thermodynamically</i> unstable with respect to the products of the reaction, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, but <i>kinetically</i> stable. We can be certain that they are thermodynamically unstable because even if the same small energy burst were applied to the products CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, they would never convert back to petrol and oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Kinetically stable</i> means that although the mixture <i>could</i> convert to a more stable set of products, it doesn&#x2019;t do so because an energy barrier separates it from those products. An energy level diagram for a reaction such as the combustion of isooctane is shown below. The products are more stable (lower in energy) than the reactants, but to become the products, the reactants have to overcome a barrier to reaction. This barrier is called the activation energy and is usually given the symbol E<sub>a</sub> or &#x0394;<i>G</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The route from reactants to products: the transition state</h3>
<p class="noindent">The combustion of kinetically stable fuel releases lots of energy by a very complex mechanism. To understand how energy is involved in the progress of a reaction we will need to take a much more simple and familiar mechanism. The reduction of a ketone to an alcohol with sodium borohydride will do. You met this reaction in Chapters 5 and 6 and it should by now be a familiar part of your chemical vocabulary. An example is shown in the margin: in this particular case, the ketone is rather hindered by the adjacent <i>tert</i>-butyl group, and the reaction must be heated to form the product. Evidently, then, there is an activation barrier that must be overcome.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Let&#x2019;s think about what that barrier might be. Although the final product is an alcohol, as you know well, the first step is transfer of a hydrogen atom from boron to the carbonyl group, as shown in the mechanism below. Overall, as shown in the energy profile diagram, the products of this step are more stable than the starting materials (&#x0394;<i>G</i> is negative), but to get there the reaction has to pass through the activation energy barrier (&#x0394;<i>G</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>). This barrier&#x2014;the highest energy point on the profile&#x2014;must correspond to some structure (which we have shown in square brackets) in which the hydrogen atom is only partly transferred from B to C, and the carbonyl group is only partly broken. We call this structure&#x2014;the highest energy form through which the molecules must pass to get from reactants to products&#x2014;the transition state. It is often represented in square brackets, frequently with a double dagger symbol &#x2021; (to match the activation energy &#x0394;<i>G</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>).</p>

<p class="indent">A transition state is always unstable and can never be isolated: if the reaction proceeds just a little more forwards or backwards, the energy of the system is lower. Isolating a transition state would be like balancing a marble on top of a bowling ball.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Why some reactions are done at low temperature</h3>
<p class="noindent">So far in this chapter you have seen that while heating a reaction can change the position of an equilibrium, the usual reason for heating a reaction is to speed it up by giving the reactants more energy to allow them to overcome the activation barrier. But as we said in the introduction, in a typical laboratory you will see many reactions being carried out at low temperatures. Why might a chemist want to <i>slow a reaction down</i>?</p>
<p class="indent">Well, often molecules can react in several different ways. A good reaction will have a lower activation energy than these alternatives. But often there are other unavoidable reactions waiting in the wings that will compete with the one that is wanted if the molecules have enough energy. The ideal situation is to give the starting materials enough energy to do the reaction we want, but not enough to do anything else: and that means keeping the reaction cold.</p>
<p class="indent">A famous example of a reaction which must be kept cold is the diazotization of anilines to make diazonium salts. The reaction involves treating the amine with nitrous acid (HONO) made from NaNO<sub>2</sub> and HCl. You need not think about the mechanism at this stage&#x2014;you will meet it in <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>&#x2014;but the key point is that the product is a rather unstable but very useful diazonium salt. The diazotization takes place readily at room temperature, but unfortunately so does the decomposition of the product to give a phenol. By lowering the temperature, we supply insufficient energy for the phenol formation, but the diazotization still works just fine. </p>

However, they do also have a tendency to attack some of the solvents which they dissolve best in, such as THF.

<h3 class="h3">Catalysis</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:60%;">You&#x2019;ve met the idea in several places in this book (and probably elsewhere) that a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction. From what you have just read, it must therefore be the case that a catalyst lowers the activation energy for a reaction. It can do this in one or both of two ways: it can lower the energy of the transition state (as shown in the diagram on the left, or it can raise the energy of the starting materials.</p>
<figure style="margin-top:-10em;float:right;">
<img src="../images/pg254.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<div class="ybox">
<p class="cbh3"><b><span class="bull1">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy for a reaction.</b></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">To illustrate the point with one simple example, let&#x2019;s take a reaction which simply does not work without a catalyst: the isomerization of butene. As you saw on p. <a href="chapter_4.xhtml#page_105">105</a>, <i>cis</i> but-2-ene is about 2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than <i>trans</i> but-2-ene. This small energy difference would correspond to a 2.2:1, 70:30, <i>trans:cis</i> ratio of alkenes if they were in equilibrium. But it&#x2019;s a big <i>if:</i> the activation energy needed to get from one to the other is of the order of 260 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which is practically unattainable. A quick calculation predicts that the half-life for the reaction would be approximately 10<sup>25</sup> years at room temperature, a time many orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe. At 500 &#x00B0;C, however, the half-life is a more reasonable 4 hours, but unfortunately, when most alkenes are heated to these sorts of temperatures other unwanted reactions occur.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to interconvert the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers we must use a different strategy: catalysis. You will meet several ways of doing this in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, but for the moment we will use just one: catalytic acid. As you saw in <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, alkenes are nucleophiles, and either isomer of but-2-ene can react with H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> from acid to form a transient species known as a carbocation. The activation energy for formation of the carbocation is much less than that for rotation about the C &#x003D; C bond. The carbocation can now easily lose a proton again, to reform either <i>cis</i>-or <i>trans</i>-but-2-ene, regenerating the catalyst and allowing the interconversion to take place. Overall, the activation energy is much lower than in the uncatalysed reaction. We will come back to other examples of catalysis later in the chapter.</p>

Alcohol solvents cannot be used with organolithiums because they are deprotonated by the strong organolithium bases.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Solvents</h3>
<p class="noindent">The nature of the solvent used in reactions often has a profound effect on how the reaction proceeds. Sometimes, if the solvent is also a reagent, the choice is easy: it&#x2019;s a good idea to carry out hydrolyses of esters in water and formations of esters in the appropriate alcohol because <a id="page_255" class="page">Page 255, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a>the large concentration of the solvent drives the reaction towards the product, as explained on p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_208">208</a>. Likewise, the solvent may also catalyse a reaction: ester formation from an acid chloride and an alcohol is often carried out in pyridine as a solvent because pyridine acts as a base catalyst of the reaction (p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_199">199</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">On occasions, the choice of solvent is limited by simple features of the starting materials and products, such as their solubility or reactivity. Simple examples are cases where an inorganic salt is a reagent: ionic compounds are relatively insoluble in most organic solvents. Sodium bromide, for example, dissolves well in water, reasonably well in methanol, a little in ethanol, and hardly at all in most other organic solvents.</p>

<p class="bnoindent">The insolubility of some salts in organic solvents can be used to drive an equilibrium in the direction required. For example, in the synthesis of this alkyl iodide from the alkyl bromide by reaction with sodium iodide, acetone is used as the solvent. Why? Well, sodium iodide is rather more soluble in acetone than is sodium bromide, so as sodium bromide is removed from the equilibrium mixture, more of the starting materials have to convert to the products to restore the equilibrium constant. You will meet more on this reaction in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Water dissolves sodium bromide well because it solvates both cations and anions: electrostatic interactions with its &#x03B4;&#x2013; oxygen atoms can stabilize the positive sodium ions, while attraction to its &#x03B4;&#x002B; hydrogen atoms can stabilize the negative bromide ion. Solvents which have polarized bonds like this are known as <i>polar</i>. Water and other alcohols are also called protic solvents because they have &#x03B4;&#x002B; protons that can interact readily with anions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg255-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Another group of polar solvents lack &#x03B4;&#x002B; protons: these are the polar aprotic solvents, such as DMSO or DMF. Although they have a localized &#x03B4;&#x2013; at oxygen, which can solvate cations, they are much less good at solvating anions because their molecules do not have a localized accessible &#x03B4;&#x002B; region. In <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> (p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_213">213</a>) you met a specific combination of t-BuOK and DMSO to help hydrolyse an amide. This is why DMSO is used here: it solvates the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation, leaving the t-BuO<sup>-</sup> unstabilized by solvation. It is desperate to become neutral by finding a proton. Metal alkoxides in DMSO are extremely basic, and when even sodium chloride is dissolved in DMSO the usually innocuous chloride ion becomes quite a powerful nucleophile, as you will see in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">A third group of solvents are not polar at all, but may still dissolve organic molecules quite well. These include hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents (chloroform), and aromatic solvents (toluene, benzene).</p>

<p class="indent">By virtue of their ability or inability to solvate charged species, solvents can affect the course of reactions by stabilizing or destabilizing a transition state or an intermediate. Here&#x2019;s a very simple example: the effect of solvent on one of the first &#x2018;reactions&#x2019; in this chapter&#x2014;the rotation about the C&#x2013;N bond of an amide. The table in the margin shows the activation energy &#x0394;<i>G</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> for C&#x2013;N bond rotation in dimethylacetamide (DMA) in a range of solvents.

<p class="indent">To understand rates, we have to think about activation energies, in other words the difference in energy between the starting materials and the transition state. As you know, an amide in its ground state (in other words, its lowest energy state) is delocalized because of conjugation between the nitrogen&#x2019;s lone pair and the carbonyl group. This delocalization leads to a degree of charge separation and polarization of the amide. But as the C&#x2013;N bond rotates, the conjugation is broken because the molecule has to pass through a transition state in which the N lone pair is perpendicular to the &#x03C0; system of the carbonyl group. The transition state is therefore less polar than the ground state.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Rate equations</h2>
<p class="noindent">We&#x2019;ve pointed out that reactions go faster at higher temperature because the starting materials have more energy. But temperature is not the sole controller of rate. Two molecules might well collide with plenty of energy, but unless they are two molecules that can actually react, that energy will be lost as heat. Going back again to the reduction of p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_251">251</a> (a reminder in the margin), it&#x2019;s obvious that only collisions between ketone (<b>A</b>) and borohydride (<b>B</b>) get us anywhere&#x2014;there will be plenty of non-productive collisions between <b>A</b> and <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> and <b>B</b>. Obviously the chance of a collision between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is increased the more of each you have, and especially if you have lots of <b>A</b> <i>and</i> lots of <b>B</b>. In fact, the chance of a successful reaction is proportional to the product of the concentration of <b>A</b> and the concentration of <b>B</b>. We can express this in a simple <i>rate equation:</i></p>

<p class="noindent">where the value <i>k</i> represents the <i>rate constant</i> for the reaction. The value of <i>k</i> is different for different reactions, and it also varies with temperature.

We call this analysis of the factors affecting the rate of the reactions the <b>kinetics</b> of the reaction.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<p class="bnoindent">There is of course a link between the activation energy of a reaction and its rate, and the connection between them is known as the Arrhenius equation, after the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859&#x2013;1927) who formulated it and won the Nobel Prize in 1903.</p>
<p class="fig1"><i>k</i> &#x003D; <i>Ae</i><sup>-Ea/RT</sup></p>
<p class="bnoindent">where <i>k</i> is the rate constant for the reaction, <i>R</i> is the gas constant (see p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_243">243</a>), <i>T</i> is the temperature (in kelvin), and A is a quantity known as the pre-exponential factor. Because of the minus sign in the exponential term, the larger the activation energy, <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>, the slower the reaction but the higher the temperature, the faster the reaction.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As we discussed on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_253">253</a> , the reaction between borohydride and the ketone to make an alkoxide is only the first step of this reaction. Since ethanol likewise has to collide with the alkoxide for this second step to take place, you might very reasonably ask yourself why the rate of formation of the alcohol product does not also depend on [EtOH]: why is the rate equation not</p>
<p class="fig1">rate of reaction &#x003D; <i>k</i> &#x00D7; &#x005B;<b>ketone</b>&#x005D; &#x00D7; &#x005B;<b>borohydride</b>&#x005D; &#x00D7; &#x005B;<b>EtOH</b>&#x005D; ?</p>
<p class="indent">The answer is hinted at in the energy profile diagram you saw on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_253">253</a>, which is reproduced below. The activation energy for the proton transfer step is lower than for the addition step, so it happens faster. It fact, it can happen fast <i>whatever the concentration of ethanol,</i> so ethanol does not appear in the rate equation. The overall rate of any reaction is determined only by what happens in the mechanistic step that is slowest, known as the <b>rate-determining step</b> or <b>rate-limiting step</b>. This is a general point about anything that happens in several</p>

<h3 class="h3">Kinetics gives us an insight into the mechanism of a reaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Chapters 10 and 11 you met some other multistep reactions with intermediates. Take this example: an alkoxide RO<sup>&#x2013;</sup> will react with an acid chloride to form an ester. If we measure how the rate of the formation of the ester varies with the concentration of the alkoxide and of the acid chloride, we discover a rate equation</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i>[MeCOCl][RO<sup>-</sup>]</p>
<p class="indent">Both the acid chloride and alkoxide must therefore be involved in the rate-determining step, which, as you know from <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, must be the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate is less stable than the starting materials, so the reaction energy profile takes the form shown below, with the highest transition state corresponding to the addition step.<a id="page_259" class="page">Page 259, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg259.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The presence of two species in the rate equation confirms that the reaction is bimolecular (i.e. it involves two molecules), and we call such rate equations <i>second order.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Numerous kinetic studies have confirmed that this mechanism, with a tetrahedral intermediate, is the normal pathway by which substitution reactions at carbonyl groups take place, as we explained in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. You could draw a similar pathway, and a similar energy profile, for all of the reactions shown on p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_215">215</a>, adjusting the energies of the starting materials, products, and intermediates appropriately, but all of them are second order, with rate-limiting attack on the carbonyl group.</p>
<p class="indent">However, there are occasional exceptions. These are not important enough for you to consider them likely when you write substitution mechanisms, but they do illustrate the fact that <i>kinetics</i> tells us about <i>mechanism.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Here is one: when an acid chloride is heated with an alcohol in the absence of base, an ester forms. However, it turns out that under these conditions the rate equation is first order: it does not matter how much or how little alcohol is added, the rate depends only on the concentration of the acid chloride:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure>
<img src="../images/pg259-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;This is not the recommended way to make an ester: the reaction is much better if a base is added, in which case it follows the usual addition&#x2013;elimination mechanism.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="fig1">rate of reaction &#x003D; <i>k</i>&#x005B;R<sup>1</sup>COCl&#x005D;</p>
<p class="indent">Evidently, from the rate equation, no collision between the acid chloride and the alcohol is required for this reaction to go. The rate-determining step must be <i>unimolecular.</i> What actually happens is that the acid chloride decomposes by itself to give a reactive cation with the loss of the good leaving group Cl<sup>-</sup>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg259-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">There are three steps in this reaction scheme, although the last is a trivial deprotonation. The energy barrier must be highest in the first step, which involves the acid chloride alone. The cation is an intermediate (although a short-lived one) with a real existence that reacts rapidly with the alcohol in a step that does not affect the rate of the reaction. The easiest way to picture this detail is in an energy profile diagram:<a id="page_260" class="page">Page 260, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg260.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Notice that the products are again lower in energy than the starting materials, and although there are three transition states in this reaction, only the highest-energy transition state (the first one here) matters in determining the reaction rate. The reaction now passes through two intermediates (local minima). It is often the case that when intermediates are involved in a reaction, the highest-energy transition state is associated with the formation of the highest-energy intermediate.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_12.6.2">
<h3 class="h3">What does third-order kinetics mean?</h3>
<p class="noindent">The first-order kinetics of this unusual substitution reaction is here to illustrate a point, but it should not distract you from the fact that most nucleophilic substitutions of carboxylic acid derivatives (the reactions you met in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) are bimolecular reactions with rate-determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg260-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">However, something different again happens when we come to reactions of amides. Because of the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the carbonyl group, nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group is very difficult. In addition, the leaving group (NH<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> with p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of NH<sub>3</sub> about 35) is very bad indeed.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg260-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_261" class="page">Page 261, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What happens as a consequence is that in the hydrolysis of amides the second step&#x2014;the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate&#x2014;becomes rate determining. But this offers the opportunity for base catalysis of this step. If a second hydroxide ion removes the proton from the tetrahedral intermediate, the loss of NH<sub>2</sub> from what is now a dianion is made easier, and a stable carboxylate ion is formed directly.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Notice that in the first mechanism just one hydroxide ion is involved, whereas now two are involved: one is consumed to form product, but the second is in fact regenerated when the product NH<sup>&#x2013;</sup><sub>2</sub> anion reacts with water&#x2014;in other words the second hydroxide ion is a catalyst.</p>
<p class="indent">The rate equation for the amide hydrolysis reflects this involvement of two hydroxide ions: the rate depends on the square of the hydroxide ion concentration and it is <i>third order.</i> We&#x2019;ll label the rate constant <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> to emphasize this:</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>[MeCONH<sub>2</sub>] &#x00D7; [HO<sup>-</sup>]<sub>2</sub></p>
<p class="indent">But you may be asking yourself where this third-order kinetics comes from, since the hydroxide ions are not actually involved in the rate-determining step. In fact, third-order kinetics hardly ever mean the real simultaneous termolecular collision of three molecules at once&#x2014;such events are just too rare.</p>
<p class="indent">The rate-determining step here is actually unimolecular&#x2014;the collapse of the dianion. So we expect</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i>[dianion]</p>
<p class="indent">We don&#x2019;t know the concentration of the dianion but we do know that it&#x2019;s in equilibrium with the monoanion&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll call this equilibrium constant K<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg261-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">and so [dianion] &#x003D; K<sub>2</sub>[monanion][HO<sup>-</sup>].</p>
<p class="indent">This sort of helps, but we still don&#x2019;t know what [monoanion] is, other than that it&#x2019;s again in equilibrium, this time with the amide&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll call this equilibrium constant K<sub>1</sub>:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg261-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">and so [monoanion] &#x003D; K<sub>1</sub>[amide][HO<sup>-</sup>].</p>
<p class="indent">Substituting these values in the simple rate equation we discover that</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>k</i>[dianion] becomes</p>
<p class="fig1">rate &#x003D; <i>kK</i><sub>1</sub><i>K</i><sub>2</sub>[amide][HO<sup>-</sup>]<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent">The third-order kinetics result from two equilibria starting with the amide and involving two hydroxide ions, followed by a unimolecular rate-determining step, and the &#x2018;third-order rate constant&#x2019; <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> is actually a product of the two equilibrium constants and a first-order rate constant:</p>
<p class="fig1">k3 &#x003D; <i>k</i> &#x00D7; <i>K</i><sub>1</sub> &#x00D7; <i>K</i><sub>2</sub></p>
<p class="indent">This often happens with reactions with late rate-determining steps: the rate constant can depend on the concentrations of any species involved before the rate-determining step (although not necessarily in that step itself) but never depends on species involved after the rate-determining step.<a id="page_262" class="page">Page 262, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="indent">Just because a proposed mechanism gives a rate equation that fits the experimental data, it does not necessarily mean that it is the <i>right</i> mechanism; all it means is that it is consistent with the experimental facts so far, but there may be other mechanisms that also fit. It is then up to the experimenter to design cunning experiments to try to rule out other possibilities.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Catalysis in carbonyl substitution reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The amide hydrolysis you have just met is much faster in base because base (in this case hydroxide) deprotonates the intermediate and makes it more reactive. The same is true for many other base-catalysed processes: often it is the nucleophile that is made more reactive by deprotonation to form an anion. For example, ester hydrolysis is faster at higher pH because the higher the pH the more hydroxide there is to act as a nucleophile.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg262.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The rate equation at high pH is second order, as you expect, and depends on the concentration of hydroxide and the concentration of the ester. Notice, though, that below pH 7 the rate starts to increase again as the concentration of [H&#x002B;] increases. This is because ester hydrolysis is also acid catalysed, as you saw in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. At acidic pH, a new mechanism takes over in which protonation of the carbonyl group accelerates attack of weakly nucleophilic water.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> You will also see rate constants labelled in other ways&#x2014;this is a matter of choice.

<p class="indent">This is typical acid&#x2013;base catalysis, known as &#x2018;specific acid&#x2013;base catalysis&#x2019; because the specific acid and base involved are H&#x002B; (or H<sub>3</sub>O&#x002B;) and OH<sup>-</sup>.

But too much acid is a problem because it protonates the starting amine and slows the reaction down.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg263.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For these reasons, the pH&#x2013;rate profile for imine formation looks like this: there is a maximum rate around pH 6, and either side the reaction goes more slowly.</p>

It does not speed the reaction up very much but it does lower the energy of the transition state leading to the tetrahedral intermediate by avoiding the build-up of positive charge as the alcohol adds. The disadvantage of general base catalysis is that the first, rate-determining, step really is termolecular (unlike in the amide hydrolysis mechanism you met on p. <a href="chapter_12.xhtml#page_261">261</a>). It is inherently unlikely that three molecules will collide with each other simultaneously. In this case, however, if ROH is the solvent, it will always be nearby in any collision so a termolecular step is just about acceptable.</p>

<p class="indent">Alkynes, like alkenes, are nucleophiles, and so the mechanism involves first of all attack by the alkyne on HCl, followed by recombination of the vinyl cation, which is formed with the chloride anion.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> It&#x2019;s worth taking a moment to think about the structure of the intermediate cation here: the cationic carbon is sp hybridized (linear) with an empty p orbital perpendicular to the p orbitals of the double bond (it is the p orbital that used to be involved in the second p bond of the alkyne).</p>

<p class="indent">The two alkenes are labelled <i>E</i> and Z. After about 2 hours the main product is the Z-alkene. However, this is not the case in the early stages of the reaction. The graph below shows how the proportions of the starting material and the two products change with time.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="noindent">Points to note:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;When the alkyne concentration drops almost to zero (10 minutes), the only alkene that has been formed is the <i>E</i>-alkene.<a id="page_265" class="page">Page 265, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="blist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;As time increases, the amount of <i>E</i>-alkene decreases as the amount of <i>Z</i>-alkene increases.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="b1bull">&#x2022;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Eventually, the proportions of <i>E-</i> and <i>Z</i>-alkene do not change.</p>
<p class="indent">Since it is the <i>Z</i>-alkene that dominates at equilibrium, this must be lower in energy than the <i>E-</i>alkene. Since we know the ratio of the products at equilibrium, we can work out the difference in energy between the two isomers:</p>
<p class="fig1">ratio of <i>E:Z</i>-alkenes at equilibrium &#x003D; 1:35</p>

<p class="noindent">that is, the Z-alkene is 8.8 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> lower in energy than the E-alkene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> You might normally expect an <i>E</i>-alkene to be more stable than a <i>Z</i>-alkene&#x2014;it just so happens here that Cl has a higher priority than Ph and the <i>Z</i>-alkene has the two largest groups (Ph and Me) <i>trans</i> (see p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_392">392</a> for rules of nomenclature).</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent">However, although the Z-alkene is more stable, the E-alkene is formed faster under these conditions: the route to the E-alkene must have a smaller activation energy barrier than <i>trans</i> addition. This is quite easy to understand: the intermediate cation has no double-bond geometry because the cationic C is sp hybridized (linear). When chloride attacks, it prefers to attack from the side of the H atom rather than the (bigger) methyl group.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg265-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">There must then be some mechanism by which the quickly formed <i>E</i>-alkene is converted into the more stable <i>Z</i>-alkene. The conditions are acidic, so the most likely mechanism is the acid-catalysed alkene isomerization you saw earlier in the chapter:</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_266" class="page">Page 266, Chapter 12: Equilibria, rates, and mechanisms</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Initially, the alkyne is converted into the <i>E</i>-alkene via the intermediate linear cation. The activation energy for this step is labelled &#x0394;<i>G</i><sub>1</sub><sup>&#x2021;</sup>. The <i>E</i>-alkene can convert to the <i>Z</i> isomer via an intermediate, with activation energy &#x0394;<i>G</i><sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2021;</sup>. Since &#x0394;<i>G</i><sub>1</sub><sup>&#x2021;</sup> is smaller than &#x0394;<i>G</i><sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2021;</sup>, the E-alkene forms faster than it isomerizes, and all the alkyne is rapidly converted to the <i>E</i>-alkene. But over the course of the reaction, the <i>E</i>-alkene slowly isomerizes to the <i>Z</i>-alkene. An equilibrium is eventually reached that favours the <i>Z</i>-alkene because it is more stable (by 8.8 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, as we calculated earlier). Why doesn&#x2019;t the <i>Z</i>-alkene form faster than the <i>E</i>? Well, as we suggested above, the transition state for its formation from the linear cation must be higher in energy than the transition state for formation of the <i>E</i>-alkene, because of steric hindrance.</p>

<p class="indent">If we wanted to isolate the kinetic product, the <i>E</i>-alkene, we would carry out the reaction at low temperature and not leave it long enough for equilibration. If, on the other hand, we want the thermodynamic product, the <i>Z</i>-alkene, we would leave the reaction for longer at higher temperatures to make sure that the larger energy barrier yielding the most stable product can be overcome.</p>
