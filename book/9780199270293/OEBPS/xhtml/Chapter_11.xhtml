<p class="indent">In this chapter you will meet substitution reactions of a different type. Instead of losing a leaving group, the carbonyl group loses its oxygen atom. Here are two important examples: the carbonyl oxygen atom has been replaced by a nitrogen atom during imine formation and by two atoms of oxygen during acetal formation. Notice too the acid catalyst&#x2014;we shall see shortly why it is required. These are examples of <i>nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group with loss of carbonyl oxygen.</i></p>

The equilibrium between an aldehyde or ketone and its hydrate (p. <a href="chapter_6.xhtml#page_134">134</a>) is one such reaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When the hydrate reverts to starting materials, either of its two oxygen atoms must leave: one came from the water and one from the carbonyl group, so 50&#x0025; of the time the oxygen atom that belonged to the carbonyl group will be lost. Usually, this is of no consequence, but it can be useful. For example, in 1968 some chemists studying the reactions that take place inside mass spectrometers needed to label the carbonyl oxygen atom of a ketone with the isotope <sup>18</sup>O.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_223_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">By stirring the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; <sup>16</sup>O compound with a large excess of isotopically labelled water for a few hours in the presence of a drop of acid they were able to make the required labelled compound. Without the acid catalyst, the exchange is very slow. Acid catalysis speeds the reaction up by making the carbonyl group more electrophilic so that equilibrium is reached more quickly.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_11.2">
<h2 class="h2">Aldehydes can react with alcohols to form hemiacetals</h2>
<p class="noindent">When acetaldehyde is dissolved in methanol, a reaction takes place: we know this because the IR spectrum of the mixture shows that a new compound has been formed. Most dramatically, the carbonyl frequency is no longer there. However, isolating the product is impossible: it decomposes back to acetaldehyde and methanol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_223_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The product is in fact a hemiacetal. Like hydrates, most hemiacetals are unstable with respect to their parent aldehydes and alcohols, for example the equilibrium constant for reaction of acetaldehyde with simple alcohols is about 0.5.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">So by making [MeOH] very large (using it as the solvent, for example) we can turn most of the aldehyde into the hemiacetal. However, if we try to purify the hemiacetal by removing the methanol, more hemiacetal keeps decomposing to maintain the equilibrium constant. That is why we can never isolate such hemiacetals in a pure form.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Acid or base catalysts increase the rate of equilibration of hemiacetals with their aldehyde and alcohol parents</h3>
<p class="noindent">Acyclic hemiacetals form relatively slowly from an aldehyde or ketone plus an alcohol, but their rate of formation is greatly increased either by acid or by base. As you would expect from Chapters 6 and 10, acid catalysts work by increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group.</p>

In both cases the energy of the starting materials is raised: in the acid-catalysed reaction the aldehyde is destabilized by protonation and in the base-catalysed reaction the alcohol is destabilized by deprotonation.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">You can see why hemiacetals are unstable: they are essentially tetrahedral intermediates containing a leaving group and, just as acid or base catalyses the formation of hemiacetals, acid or base also catalyses their decomposition back to starting aldehyde or ketone and alcohol.

<h2 class="h2">Acetals are formed from aldehydes or ketones plus alcohols in the presence of acid</h2>
<p class="noindent">We said that a solution of acetaldehyde in methanol contains a new compound: a hemiacetal. We&#x2019;ve also said that the rate of formation of hemiacetals is increased by adding an acid (or a base) catalyst to the alcohol plus aldehyde mixture. But, if we add catalytic acid to our acetal-dehyde&#x2013;methanol mixture, we find not only that the rate of reaction of the acetaldehyde with the methanol increases, but also that a different product is formed. This product is an acetal; the hemiacetal is half-way there.</p>

<p class="indent">In the presence of acid (but not base&#x0021;) hemiacetals can undergo an elimination reaction (different from the one that just gives back aldehyde plus alcohol), losing the oxygen atom that once belonged to the parent aldehyde&#x2019;s carbonyl group.<a id="page_225" class="page">Page 225, Chapter 11: Nucleophilic substitution at C&#x003D;O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</a></p>

<p class="bnoindent">Oxonium ions have three bonds to a positively charged oxygen atom. All three bonds can be &#x03C3; bonds, as in H<sub>3</sub>O&#x002B; or Meerwein&#x2019;s salt, trimethyloxonium fluoroborate, a stable (though reactive) alkylating agent, or one bond can be a &#x03C0; bond as in the acetal intermediate. The term &#x2018;oxonium ion&#x2019; describes either of these structures. They are like alkylated ethers or O-alkylated carbonyl compounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as protonated carbonyl groups are much more electrophilic than unprotonated ones, these oxonium ions are powerful electrophiles. They can react rapidly with a second molecule of alcohol to form the new, stable compounds known as acetals. An oxonium ion was also an intermediate in the formation of hemiacetals in acid solution. Before reading any further, it would be worthwhile to write out the whole mechanism of acetal formation from aldehyde or ketone plus alcohol through the hemiacetal to the acetal, preferably without looking at the fragments of mechanism above or the answer overleaf.</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism is the most complex you have met and it will help you to recall it if you see it in two halves, each very similar to the other. The reaction starts with a protonation on carbonyl oxygen and addition of an alcohol to the C&#x003D;O &#x03C0; bond. When you get to the temporary haven of the hemiacetal, you start again with protonation of that same oxygen then lose the OH group by breaking what was the C&#x003D;O &#x03C3; bond to form an oxonium ion. Each half goes through an oxonium ion and the alcohol adds to each oxonium ion. The last step in the formation of both the acetal and the hemiacetal is the loss of a proton from the recently added alcohol. From your complete mechanism you should also be able to verify that acetal formation is indeed catalytic in acid.<a id="page_226" class="page">Page 226, Chapter 11: Nucleophilic substitution at C&#x003D;O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">Making acetals</h3>
<p class="noindent">Just as with the ester formation and hydrolysis reactions we discussed in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, every step in the formation of an acetal is reversible. To make acetals, therefore, we must use an excess of alcohol or remove the water from the reaction mixture as it forms, by distillation for example.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_226_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In fact, acetal formation is even more difficult than ester formation: while the equilibrium constant for acid-catalysed formation of ester from carboxylic acid plus alcohol is usually about 1, for acetal formation from an aldehyde and ethanol (shown above), the equilibrium constant is <b><i>K</i></b> &#x003D; 0.0125. For ketones, the value is even lower: in fact, it is often very difficult to make the acetals of ketones (sometimes called ketals) unless they are cyclic (we consider cyclic acetals later in the chapter). However, there are several techniques that can be used to prevent the water produced in the reaction from hydrolysing the product.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Cyclic acetals are more stable than acyclic acetals</h3>
<p class="noindent">Of course you want us to prove it. Well, in this example the starting material has three acetals: an ordinary acetal formed from methanol (in black), a five-membered cyclic acetal, and a dithioacetal. Only the black acetal hydrolyses under these mild conditions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

You can&#x2019;t distil water from a reaction mixture containing methanol or ethanol because the alcohols distil too&#x0021; One very useful piece of equipment for removing water from reaction mixtures containing only reagents that boil at higher temperatures than water is called a Dean Stark head.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Cyclic acetals like this are more resistant to hydrolysis than acyclic ones, and easier to make&#x2014;they form quite readily even from ketones. One explanation for this is that whenever the second oxonium ion in this mechanism forms, the hydroxyl group is always held close by, ready to snap shut and give back the dioxolane; water gets less of a chance to attack it and hydrolyse the acetal. We will discuss in <i>entropic</i> terms why cyclic acetals and hemiacetals are more stable in <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.</p>

By using a Dean Stark apparatus, or Dean Stark head, the toluene layer can be returned to the reaction mixture while the water is removed. Reactions requiring removal of water by distillation are therefore often carried out in refluxing toluene or benzene under a Dean Stark head.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Modifying reactivity using acetals</h3>
<p class="noindent">Why are acetals so important? Well, they&#x2019;re important to both nature and chemists because many carbohydrates are acetals or hemiacetals (see the box below). One important use that chemists have put them to is as <i>protecting groups</i>. One synthesis of the steroid class of compounds (about which more later) requires a Grignard reagent with an impossible structure. This compound cannot exist as the Grignard functional group would attack the ketone: it would react with itself. Instead, the protected Grignard reagent is used, made from the same bromoketone, but with an acetal-forming step.</p>

<p class="indent">Acetals, as we stressed, are stable to base and to basic nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents, so we no longer have a reactivity problem. Once the Grignard reagent has reacted with an electrophile, the ketone can be recovered by hydrolysing the acetal in dilute acid. The acetal is functioning here as a protecting group because it protects the ketone from attack by the Grignard reagent.

<p class="noindent">The ketone carbonyl group of pyruvic acid (or 2-oxopropanoic acid) has a stretching frequency of a typical ketone, 1710 cm<sup>-1</sup>. When hydroxylamine is added to a solution of pyruvic acid, this stretching frequency slowly disappears. Later, a new IR absorption appears at 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup>. What happens?</p>

<p class="indent">You can probably apply something of what you know from Chapters 6 and 10 about the reactivity of carbonyl compounds towards nucleophiles to work out what is happening in this reaction between a carbonyl compound and an amine. The hydroxylamine first adds to the ketone to form an unstable intermediate similar to a hemiacetal.</p>

<p class="indent">Notice that it is the more nucleophilic nitrogen atom, and not the oxygen atom, of hydroxyl-amine that adds to the carbonyl group. Like hemiacetals, these intermediates are unstable and can decompose by loss of water. The product is known as an oxime and it is this compound, with its C&#x003D;N double bond, that is responsible for the IR absorption at 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup>.<a id="page_230" class="page">Page 230, Chapter 11: Nucleophilic substitution at C&#x003D;O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</a></p>

<p class="indent">We know that the oxime is formed <i>via</i> an intermediate because the 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup> absorption hardly appears until after the 1710 cm<sup>-1</sup> absorption has almost completely gone. There must really be another curve to show the formation and the decay of the intermediate. The only difference is that the intermediate has no double bond to give an IR absorbance in this region of the spectrum. We come back to oximes later in the chapter.</p>

<p class="indent">You shouldn&#x2019;t need us to tell you the mechanism of this reaction: even without looking at the mechanism we gave for the formation of the oxime it should come as no surprise to you by now. But as the reaction is very important in chemistry and biology, we&#x2019;ll discuss it in some depth. First, the amine attacks the aldehyde and the intermediate known as a hemiacetal is formed. Amines are good nucleophiles for carbonyl groups, and aldehydes and ketones are electrophilic. There is no need for any catalysis in this step. Indeed, addition of acid would slow the reaction down as the nucleophilic amine would be removed as a salt.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">Dehydration of the hemiaminal gives the imine. Now there is some need for catalysis: acid must be added so that the OH group can become a good leaving group.

The difference is that the iminium ion can lose a proton and become a neutral imine.<a id="page_231" class="page">Page 231, Chapter 11: Nucleophilic substitution at C&#x003D;O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</a></p>

Without an acid catalyst, the reaction is very slow, although in some cases it may still take place. Imine formation is in fact fastest at about pH 4&#x2013;6: at lower pH, too much amine is protonated and the rate of the first step is slow; above this pH the proton concentration is too low to allow protonation of the OH leaving group in the dehydration step. Imine formation is like a biological reaction: it is fastest near neutrality.</p>

<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Up to this point, the two mechanisms follow a very similar path, with clear analogy between the hemiaminal and hemiacetal intermediates, and between the iminium and oxonium ions. Here, though, they diverge, because the iminium ion carries a proton, which the oxonium ion doesn&#x2019;t have. The iminium ion therefore acts as an acid, losing a proton to become the imine. The oxonium ion, on the other hand, acts as an electrophile, adding another molecule of alcohol to become the acetal.</p>

The selective reduction of iminium ions (but not carbonyl compounds) by sodium cyanoborohydride makes this possible. When Na(CN)BH<sub>3</sub> is added to a typical imine-formation reaction it reacts with the iminium ion but not with the starting carbonyl compound nor with the imine.

<p class="indent">You have already met phosphonium salts in <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, where you saw the reaction of a phosphine (triphenylphosphine) with an alkyl halide (methyl iodide) to give the tetrahedral phosphonium salt.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

</figure>
<p class="indent">So here is a typical Wittig reaction: it starts with a phosphonium salt, which is treated with a strong base such as BuLi or sodium hydride, and then with a carbonyl compound; the alkene forms in 85&#x0025; yield.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The positively charged P atom stabilizes the negative charge on carbon, making phosphonium salts another class of &#x2018;carbon acids&#x2019; (to add to those you met in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>) that can be deprotonated by strong base. The hydride ion H-is the conjugate base of H<sub>2</sub> which has a pK<sub>a</sub> of about 35.</p>

<p class="indent">What about the mechanism? We warned you that the mechanism is rather different from all the others you have met in this chapter, but nonetheless it begins with attack on the <a id="page_238" class="page">Page 238, Chapter 11: Nucleophilic substitution at C&#x003D;O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</a>carbonyl group by a nucleophile; the nucleophile is the carbanion part of the phosphonium ylid. This reaction generates a negatively charged oxygen that attacks the positively charged phosphorus and gives a four-membered ring called an oxaphosphetane.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_238_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now, this four-membered ring (like many others) is unstable, and it can collapse in a way that forms two double bonds. Here are the curly arrows: the mechanism is cyclic and gives the alkene, which is the product of the reaction along with a phosphine oxide.</p>

<p class="indent">The chemistry of some elements is dominated by one particular property, and a theme running right through the chemistry of phosphorus is its exceptional affinity for oxygen. The P&#x003D;O bond, with its bond energy of 575 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, is one of the strongest double bonds in chemistry, and the Wittig reaction is irreversible and is driven forward by the formation of this P&#x003D;O bond. No need here for the careful control of an equilibrium necessary when making acetals or imines.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, as in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, you have met a wide variety of reactions, but we hope you have again been able to see that they are all related mechanistically. Of course, we have not been exhaustive: it would be impossible to cover every possible reaction of a carbonyl group, but having read Chapters 6, 9, and 10 you should feel confident in writing a <i>reasonable mechanism</i> for any reaction involving nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group. You could try thinking about this, for example.</p>

<p class="indent">In the next chapter we examine in a little more detail the phrase &#x2018;a reasonable mechanism&#x2019;: how do we know what mechanisms are reasonable, and what can we do to understand them? We shall look in more detail at some of the topics raised in this chapter, such as equilibria and rates of reactions. Carbonyl groups next star in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> where they reveal a thus far hidden <i>nucleophilic</i> side to their character. </p>
