<h2 class="h2">Some compounds can exist as a pair of mirror-image forms</h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the very first reactions you met, back in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, was between an aldehyde and cyanide. The product was a compound containing a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group.</p>

<p class="indent">How many products are formed in this reaction? Well, the straightforward answer is one&#x2014; there&#x2019;s only one aldehyde, only one cyanide ion, and only one reasonable way in which they can react. But this analysis is not <i>quite</i> correct. One point that we ignored when we first talked about this reaction, because it was irrelevant at that time, is that the carbonyl group of the aldehyde has two faces. The cyanide ion could attack either from the front face or the back face, giving, in each case, a distinct product.</p>

This translates into &#x2018;front&#x2019; and &#x2018;back&#x2019; on a diagram on paper. Compare the diagram on the left with the others to make sure this is clear.</p>
<p class="indent">Are these two products different?

<h3 class="h3">Chiral molecules have no plane of symmetry</h3>
<p class="noindent">What is the essential difference between these two compounds that means one is superimposable on its mirror image and one is not? The answer is <i>symmetry.</i> Acetone cyanohydrin has a plane of symmetry running through the molecule. This plane cuts the central carbon and the OH and CN groups in half, and has one methyl group on each side. All planar molecules (such as our simple aldehyde) cannot be chiral as the plane of the molecule must be a plane of symmetry. Cyclic molecules may have a plane of symmetry passing through two atoms of the ring, as in the cyclohexanone below. The plane passes through both atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the methyl group as well as the hydrogen atom (not shown) on the same carbon atom. The bicyclic acetal looks more complicated but a plane of symmetry passes between the two oxygen atoms and the two ring-junction carbon atoms while bisecting the two methyl groups. None of these molecules is chiral.</p>

<p class="bnoindent">Most gloves exist in pairs of non-identical mirror-image forms: only a left glove fits a left hand and only a right glove fits a right hand. This property of gloves and of the hands inside them gives us the word &#x2018;chiral<i>&#x2019;&#x2014;cheir</i> is Greek for &#x2018;hand&#x2019;. Hands and gloves are chiral; they have no plane of symmetry, and a left glove is not superimposable on its mirror image (a right glove). Feet are chiral too, as are shoes. But socks (usually&#x0021;) are not. Although we all sometimes have problems finding two socks of a matching colour, once you&#x2019;ve found them, you never have to worry about which sock goes on which foot because socks are achiral. A pair of socks is manufactured as two identical objects, each of which has a mirror plane.</p>
<p class="bindent">The ancient Egyptians had less care for the chirality of hands and their paintings often show people, even Pharaohs, with two left hands or two right hands&#x2014;they just didn&#x2019;t seem to notice.</p>

Golf clubs are clearly therefore chiral; they can exist as either of two enantiomers. You can tell this just by looking at a golf club. It has no plane of symmetry, so it must be chiral. But left-handed tennis players have no problem using the same racquets as right-handed tennis players and tennis players of either chirality sometimes swap the racquet from hand to hand. Look at a tennis racquet: it has a plane of symmetry (indeed, usually two), so it&#x2019;s achiral. It can&#x2019;t exist as two mirror-image forms.</p>

<p class="noindent">Back to chemistry, and the product from the reaction of an aldehyde with cyanide. We explained above that this compound, being chiral, can exist as two enantiomers. Enantiomers are clearly isomers; they consist of the same parts joined together in a different way. In particular, enantiomers are a type of isomer called <b>stereoisomers</b> because the isomers differ not in the connectivity of the atoms, but only in the overall shape of the molecule.</p>

We therefore say that they have different configurations. But any molecule can exist in a number of conformations: two conformations differ only in the temporary way the molecule happens to arrange itself, and can easily be interconverted just by rotating around bonds. Humans all have the same <i>configuration:</i> two arms joined to the shoulders. We may have different <i>conformations</i>: arms folded, arms raised, pointing, waving, etc.</p>

Any sample of a chiral compound that contains molecules all of the same enantiomer is enantiomerically pure. <i>All</i> alanine is chiral (the structure has no plane of symmetry) but <i>laboratory-produced</i> alanine is racemic (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers) whereas <i>naturally isolated</i> alanine is enantiomerically pure.</p>

The angle through which a sample of a compound (usually a solution) rotates plane-polarized light depends on a number of factors, the most important ones being the path length (how far the light has to pass through the solution), concentration, temperature, solvent, and wavelength. Typically, optical rotations are measured at 20 &#x00B0;C in a solvent such as ethanol or chloroform, and the light used is from a sodium lamp, with a wavelength of 589 nm.</p>
<p class="indent">The observed angle through which the light is rotated is given the symbol &#x03B1;. By dividing this value by the path length <i>l</i> (in dm) and the concentration <i>c</i> (in g cm<sup>-3</sup>) we get a value, [&#x03B1;], which is specific to the compound in question. Indeed, [&#x03B1;] is known as the compound&#x2019;s <b>specific rotation</b>. The choice of units is eccentric and arbitrary but is universal so we must live with it.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Most [&#x03B1;] values are quoted as [a]<sub>D</sub> (where the D indicates the wavelength of 589 nm, the &#x2018;D line&#x2019; of a sodium lamp) or [&#x03B1;]<sub>D</sub><sup>20</sup>, the 20 indicating 20 &#x00B0;C. These define the remaining variables.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is an example. A simple acid, known as mandelic acid, can be obtained from almonds in an enantiomerically pure form. When 28 mg was dissolved in 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of ethanol and the solution placed in a 10-cm-long polarimeter cell, an optical rotation &#x03B1; of &#x2013;4.35&#x00B0; was measured (that is, 4.35&#x00B0; to the left) at 20 &#x00B0;C with light of wavelength 589 nm.

<h3 class="h3">Enantiomers can be described as (&#x002B;) or (-)</h3>
<p class="noindent">We can use the fact that two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions to assign each a label that doesn&#x2019;t depend on knowing its configuration. We call the enantiomer that rotates plane-polarized light to the right (gives a positive rotation) the (&#x002B;)-enantiomer (or the <i>dextrorotatory</i> enantiomer) and the enantiomer that rotates plane-polarized light to the left (gives a negative rotation) the (&#x2013;)-enantiomer (or the <i>laevorotatory</i> enantiomer). The direction in which light is rotated is not dependent on whether a stereo-genic centre is <i>R</i> or S. An (R) compound is equally as likely to be (&#x002B;) as (&#x2013;)&#x2014;of course, if it is (&#x002B;) then its (S) enantiomer must be (&#x2013;). The enantiomer of mandelic acid we have just discussed, for example, is (R)&#x2013;(&#x2013;)-mandelic acid because its specific rotation is negative, and (S)-alanine happens to be (S)&#x2013;(&#x002B;)-alanine. The labels (&#x002B;) and (&#x2013;) were more useful before the days of X-ray crystallography, when chemists did not know the actual configuration of the molecules they studied, and could distinguish two enantiomers only by the signs of their specific rotations.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Enantiomers can be described as D or L</h3>
<p class="noindent">Long before the appearance of X-ray crystallography as an analytical tool, chemists had to discover the detailed structure and stereochemistry of molecules by a complex series of degradations. A molecule was gradually broken down into its constituents, and from the products that were formed the overall structure of the starting molecule was deduced. As far as stereochemistry was concerned, it was possible to measure the specific rotation of a compound, but not to determine its configuration. However, by using series of degradations it was possible to tell whether certain compounds had the same or opposite configurations.</p>
<p class="indent">Glyceraldehyde is one of the simplest chiral compounds in nature. Because of this, chemists took it as the standard against which the configurations of other compounds could be compared. The two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde were given the labels D (for dextro&#x2014;because it was the (&#x002B;)-enantiomer) and L (for laevo&#x2014;because it was the (&#x2013;)-enantiomer). Any enantio-merically pure compound that could be related, by a series of chemical degradations and transformations, to D-(&#x002B;)-glyceraldehyde was labelled D, and any compound that could be <a id="page_311" class="page">Page 311, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a>related to L-(&#x2013;)-glyceraldehyde was labelled L. The processes concerned were slow and laborious (the scheme below shows how (&#x2013;)-lactic acid was shown to be D-(&#x2013;)-lactic acid) and are never used today. D and L are now used only for certain well-known natural molecules, where their use is established by tradition, for example, the L-amino acids or the D-sugars.

<h3 class="h3">Diastereoisomers can arise when structures have more than one stereogenic centre</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let&#x2019;s analyse our set of four stereoisomers a little more closely. You may have already noticed that these structures all contain stereogenic centres&#x2014;two in each case. Go back to the diagram of the four structures at the bottom of p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_312">312</a> and, without looking at the structures overleaf, assign an <i>R</i> or <i>S</i> label to each of the stereogenic centres.</p>

<p class="indent">All the compounds that we have talked about so far have been cyclic because the diastereoisomers are easy to visualize: two diastereoisomers can be identified because the substituents are either on the same side or on opposite sides of the ring (cis or <i>trans).</i> But acyclic compounds can exist as diastereoisomers too. Take these two, for example. Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are members of the amphetamine class of stimulants, which act by imitating the action of the hormone adrenaline.</p>

<p class="indent">Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are stereoisomers that are clearly not mirror images of each other&#x2014;only one of the two stereogenic centres in ephedrine is inverted in pseudoephedrine&#x2014;so they must be diastereoisomers. Thinking in terms of stereogenic centres is useful because, just as this compound has two stereogenic centres and can exist as two diastereoisomers, any compound with more than one stereogenic centre can exist in more than one diastereoisomeric form.</p>
<p class="indent">Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are produced in enantiomerically pure form by plants, so, unlike the anti-asthma intermediates above, in this case we are talking about single enantiomers of single diastereoisomers. Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is also chiral. In nature it is a single enantiomer but it cannot exist as other diastereoisomers as it has only one stereogenic centre.</p>

<p class="indent">We can illustrate the combination of two stereogenic centres in a compound by considering what happens when you shake hands with someone. Hand-shaking is successful only if you each use the same hand&#x0021; By convention, this is your right hand, but it&#x2019;s equally possible to shake left hands. The overall pattern of interaction between two right hands and two left hands is the same: a right-handshake and a left-handshake are enantiomers of one another; they differ only in being mirror images. If, however, you misguidedly try to shake your right hand with someone else&#x2019;s left hand you end up holding hands. Held hands consist of one left and one right hand; a pair of held hands have totally different interactions from a pair of shaking hands; we can say that holding hands is a diastereoisomer of shaking hands. We can summarize the situation when we have two hands, or two chiral centres, each one <i>R</i> or <i>S</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">What about compounds with more than two stereogenic centres? The family of sugars provides lots of examples. Ribose is a five-carbon sugar that contains three stereogenic centres. The enantiomer shown here is the one used in the metabolism of all living things and, by convention, is known as D-ribose. The three stereogenic centres of D-ribose have the <i>R</i> configuration. For convenience, we will consider ribose in its open-chain form, but more usually it would be cyclic, as shown underneath.<a id="page_316" class="page">Page 316, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a></p>
<p class="indent">In theory we can work out how many &#x2018;stereoisomers&#x2019; there are of a compound with three stereogenic centres simply by noting that there are 8 (&#x003D; 2<sup>3</sup>) ways of arranging Rs and Ss.</p>

<p class="indent">But this method blurs the all-important distinction between diastereoisomers and enantiomers. In each case, the combination in the top row and the combination directly below it are enantiomers (all three centres are inverted); the four columns are diastereoisomers. Three stereogenic centres therefore give four diastereoisomers, each a pair of two enantiomers. Going back to the example of the C<sub>5</sub> aldoses, each of these diastereoisomers is a different sugar. In these diagrams each diasteroisomer is in a frame but the top line shows one enantiomer (D) and the bottom line the other (L).</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Structure of sugars</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">A sugar has the empirical formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n</sub>, and consists of a chain of carbon atoms, one being a carbonyl group and the rest carrying OH groups. If the carbonyl group is at the end of the chain (in other words, it is an aldehyde), the sugar is an aldose. If the carbonyl group is not at the end of the chain, the sugar is a ketose. We come back to all this in detail in <a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>. The number of carbon atoms, n, can be 3&#x2013;8: aldoses have n &#x2013;2 stereogenic centres and ketoses n &#x2013;3 stereogenic centres. In fact, most sugars exist as an equilibrium mixture of this open-chain structure and a cyclic hemiacetal isomer (<a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>

Fischer projections are so unlike real molecules that you should never use them. However, you may see them in older books, and you should have an idea about how to interpret them. Just remember that all the branches down the side of the central trunk are effectively bold wedges (coming towards the viewer), while the central trunk lies in the plane of the paper. By mentally twisting the backbone into a realistic zig-zag shape you should end up with a reasonable representation of the sugar molecule.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Why only <i>usually</i>?&#x2014;achiral compounds with more than one stereogenic centre</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, symmetry in a molecule can cause some stereoisomers to be degenerate, or &#x2018;cancel out&#x2019;&#x2014;there aren&#x2019;t as many stereoisomers as you&#x2019;d <i>expect</i>. Take tartaric acid, for example. This stereoisomer of tartaric acid is found in grapes, and its salt, potassium hydrogen tartrate, can precipitate out as crystals at the bottom of bottles of wine.

<p class="indent">While the pair of structures on the left are certainly enantiomers, if you look carefully at the pair of structures on the right, you&#x2019;ll see that they are, in fact, not enantiomers but identical structures.

<p class="indent">(1R,2S)-Tartaric acid and (1S,2R)-tartaric acid are not enantiomers, but they are identical because, even though they contain stereogenic centres, they are achiral. By drawing (1R,2S)-tartaric acid after a 180&#x00B0; rotation about the central bond, you can easily see that it has a mirror plane, and so must be achiral. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, and <i>R</i> is the mirror image of S, the <i>R,S</i> diastereoisomer cannot be chiral.</p>

<p class="indent">So tartaric acid can exist as two diastereoisomers, one with two enantiomers and the other achiral (a <i>meso</i> compound). It&#x2019;s worth noting that the formula stating that a compound with <i>n</i> stereogenic centres has 2<sup>n-1</sup> diastereoisomers has worked but not the formula that states there are 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> &#x2018;stereoisomers&#x2019;. In general, it&#x2019;s safer not to count up total &#x2018;stereoisomers&#x2019; but to work out first how many diastereoisomers there are, and then to decide whether or not each one is chiral, and therefore whether or not it has a pair of enantiomers.</p>

<h3 class="ch3">The mystery of Feist&#x2019;s acid</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is hard nowadays to realize how difficult structure solving was before the days of spectroscopy. A celebrated case was that of &#x2018;Feist&#x2019;s acid&#x2019;, discovered by Feist in 1893 from a deceptively simple reaction. Early work without spectra led to two suggestions for its structure, both based on a three-membered ring, which gave the compound some fame because unsaturated three-membered rings were rare. The favoured structure was the cyclopropene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</aside>
<p class="indent">The argument was still going on in the 1950s when the first NMR spectrometers appeared. Although infrared appeared to support the cyclopropene structure, one of the first problems resolved by the primitive 40 MHz instruments available was that of Feist&#x2019;s acid, which had no methyl group signal but did have two protons on a double bond and so had to be the exomethylene isomer after all.</p>
<p class="indent">This structure has two chiral centres, so how will we know which diastereoisomer we have? The answer was simple: the stereochemistry has to be <i>trans</i> because Feist&#x2019;s acid is chiral: it can be resolved (see later in this chapter) into two enantiomers. Now, the <i>cis</i> diacid would have a plane of symmetry, and so would be achiral&#x2014;it would be a <i>meso</i> compound. The <i>trans</i> acid on the other hand is chiral. If you do not see this, try superimposing it on its mirror image&#x2014;you will find that you cannot. In fact, Feist&#x2019;s acid has an <i>axis</i> of symmetry, and you will see shortly that axes of symmetry <i>are</i> compatible with chirality.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Chiral compounds with no stereogenic centres</h2>
<p class="noindent">A few compounds are chiral, yet have no stereogenic centres. Try making a model of the allene in the margin. It has no stereogenic centre, but these mirror images are not superimposable and so the allene is chiral: the structures shown are enantiomers. Similarly, some biaryl compounds, such as the important bisphosphine below, known as BINAP, exist as two separate enantiomers because rotation about the green bond is restricted. If you were to look at this molecule straight down along the green bond, you would see that the two flat rings are at right angles to each other and so the molecule has a twist in it rather like the 90&#x00B0; twist in the allene. Compounds that are chiral because of restricted rotation about a single bond are called <i>atropisomers</i> (from the Greek for &#x2018;won&#x2019;t turn&#x2019;).</p>

These two rings have to be orthogonal because of the tetrahedral nature of the central carbon atom. There is no chiral centre, but there is no plane of symmetry. Cyclic compounds like this with rings joined at a single C atom are called spiro compounds. Spiro compounds are often chiral even when at a first glance they look quite symmetrical, and you should look particularly carefully for planes of symmetry when you think about their stereochemistry.</p>

<p class="noindent">The fact that the three compounds we have just introduced (along with Feist&#x2019;s acid in the box on p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_319">319</a>) were chiral might have surprised you, because at first glance they do look quite &#x2018;symmetrical&#x2019;. In fact, they do all have an element of symmetry, and it is only one which is compatible with chirality: an <i>axis</i> of symmetry. If a molecule can be rotated through 180&#x00B0; about an axis to give exactly the same structure then it has twofold axial symmetry, or C<sub>2</sub> symmetry. Compounds with an axis of symmetry will still be chiral, provided they lack either a plane or a centre of symmetry.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Separating enantiomers is called resolution</h2>
<p class="noindent">Early in this chapter we said that most of the molecules in Nature are chiral, and that Nature usually produces these molecules as single enantiomers. We&#x2019;ve talked about the amino acids, the sugars, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and tartaric acid&#x2014;all compounds that can be isolated from natural sources as single enantiomers. On the other hand, in the laboratory, if we make chiral compounds from achiral starting materials we are doomed to get racemic mixtures. So how do chemists ever isolate compounds as single enantiomers, other than by extracting them from natural sources? We&#x2019;ll consider this question in much more detail in <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>, but here we will look at the simplest way: using Nature&#x2019;s enantiomerically pure compounds to help us separate the components of a racemic mixture into its two enantiomers. This process is called resolution. Imagine the reaction between a chiral, but racemic, alcohol and a chiral, but racemic, carboxylic acid, to give an ester in an ordinary acid-catalysed esterification (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_322_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The product contains two chiral centres, so we expect to get two diastereoisomers, each a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, so they should be easy to separate, for example by chromatography.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_322_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We could then reverse the esterification step and hydrolyse either of these diastereoisomers, to regenerate racemic alcohol and racemic acid.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_322_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Remember that (&#x00B1;) means the compounds are racemic: we&#x2019;re showing only relative, not absolute, stereochemistry.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_323" class="page">Page 323, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If we repeat this reaction, this time using an enantiomerically pure sample of the acid, available from (R)-mandelic acid, the almond extract you met on p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_310">310</a>, we will again get two diastereoisomeric products, but this time each one will be enantiomerically pure. Note that the stereochemistry shown here <i>is</i> absolute stereochemistry.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_323_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we now hydrolyse each diastereoisomer separately, we have done something rather remarkable: we have managed to separate two enantiomers of the starting alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_323_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A separation of two enantiomers is called a <b>resolution</b>. Resolutions can be carried out only if we make use of a component that is already enantiomerically pure: it is very useful that Nature provides us with such compounds; resolutions nearly always make use of compounds derived from nature.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">Natural chirality</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">Why Nature uses only one enantiomer of most important biochemicals is an easier question to answer than how this asymmetry came about in the first place, or why L-amino acids and D-sugars were the favoured enantiomers, since, for example, proteins made out of racemic samples of amino acids would be complicated by the possibility of enormous numbers of diastereomers. Some have suggested that life arose on the surface of single chiral quartz crystals, which provided the asymmetric environment needed to make life&#x2019;s molecules enantiomerically pure. Or perhaps the asymmetry present in the spin of electrons released as gamma rays acted as a source of molecular asymmetry. Given that enantiomerically pure living systems should be simpler than racemic ones, maybe it was just chance that the L-amino acids and the D-sugars won out.</p>
</div>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_323_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Now for a real example. Chemists studying the role of amino acids in brain function needed to obtain each of the two enantiomers of the amino acid in the margin. They made a racemic sample using the Strecker synthesis of amino acids that you met in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>. The racemic amino acid was treated with acetic anhydride to make the mixed anhydride and then with the sodium salt of naturally derived, enantiomerically pure alcohol menthol to give two diastereoisomers of the ester.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the diastereoisomers turned out to be more crystalline (that is, to have a higher melting point) than the other and, by allowing the mixture to crystallize, the chemists were able to isolate a pure sample of this diastereoisomer. Evaporating the diastereoisomer left in solution (the &#x2018;mother liquors&#x2019;) gave them the less crystalline diastereoisomer.<a id="page_324" class="page">Page 324, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a></p>
<p class="indent">Next the esters were hydrolysed by boiling them in aqueous KOH. The acids obtained were enantiomers, as shown by their (nearly) opposite optical rotations and similar melting points. Finally, a more vigorous hydrolysis of the amides (boiling for 40 hours with 20&#x0025; NaOH) gave them the amino acids they required for their biological studies (see bottom of p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_322">322</a>).</p>

<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Note that the rotations of the pure diastereoisomers were not equal and opposite. These are single enantiomers of different compounds and there is no reason for them to have the same rotation.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_14.5.1">
<h3 class="h3">Resolutions using diastereoisomeric salts</h3>
<p class="noindent">The key point about resolution is that we must bring together two stereogenic centres in such a way that there is a degree of interaction between them: separable diastereoisomers are created from inseparable enantiomers. In the last two examples, the stereogenic centres were brought together in covalent compounds, esters. Ionic compounds will do just as well&#x2014;in fact, they are often better because it is easier to recover the compound after the resolution.<a id="page_325" class="page">Page 325, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a></p>
<p class="indent">An important example is the resolution of the enantiomers of naproxen. Naproxen is a member of a family of compounds known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are 2-aryl propionic acids. This class also includes ibuprofen, the painkiller developed by Boots and marketed as Nurofen.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_325_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Both naproxen and ibuprofen are chiral but, while both enantiomers of ibuprofen are effective painkillers, and the drug is sold as a racemic mixture (and anyway racemizes in the body) only the (<i>S</i>) enantiomer of naproxen has anti-inflammatory activity. When the American pharmaceutical company Syntex first marketed the drug they needed a way of resolving the racemic naproxen they synthesized in the laboratory.</p>
<p class="indent">Since naproxen is a carboxylic acid, they chose to make the carboxylate salt of an enantiomerically pure amine, and found that the most effective was a glucose derivative. Crystals were formed, which consisted of the salt of the amine and (<i>S</i>)-naproxen, the salt of the amine with (R)-naproxen (the diastereoisomer of the crystalline salt) being more soluble and so remaining in solution. These crystals were filtered off and treated with base, releasing the amine (which can later be recovered and reused) and allowing the (<i>S</i>)-naproxen to crystallize as its sodium salt. This is an unusual resolving agent as a simpler amine might usually be preferred. However, it makes the point that many resolving agents may have to be tried before one is found that works.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_325_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">Chiral drugs</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">You may consider it strange that it was necessary to market naproxen as a single enantiomer, in view of what we have said about enantiomers having identical properties. The two enantiomers of naproxen do indeed have identical properties in the laboratory, but once they are inside a living system they, and any other chiral molecules, are differentiated by interactions with the enantiomerically pure molecules they find there. An analogy is that of a pair of gloves&#x2014;the gloves weigh the same, are made of the same material, and have the same colour&#x2014;in these respects they are identical. But interact them with a chiral environment, such as a hand, and they become differentiable because only one fits.</p>
</div>
<div class="bbox">
<a id="page_326" class="page">Page 326, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a>
<p class="bnoindent">The way in which drugs interact with receptors mirrors this hand-and-glove analogy quite closely. Drug receptors, into which drug molecules fit like hands in gloves, are nearly always protein molecules, which are enantiomerically pure because they are made up of just L-amino acids. One enantiomer of a drug is likely to interact much better than the other, or perhaps in a different way altogether, so the two enantiomers of chiral drugs often have quite different pharmacological effects. In the case of naproxen, the (S)-enantiomer is 28 times as effective as the (R). Ibuprofen, on the other hand, is still marketed as a racemate because the compound racemizes in the bloodstream.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_326_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="bnoindent">Sometimes, the enantiomers of a drug may have completely different therapeutic properties. One example is Darvon, which is a painkiller. Its enantiomer, known as Novrad, is an anticough agent. Notice how the enantiomeric relationship between these two drugs extends beyond their chemical structures&#x0021; In <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> we will talk about other cases where two enantiomers have quite different biological effects.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_14.5.2">
<h3 class="h3">Resolutions can be carried out by chromatography on chiral materials</h3>
<p class="noindent">Interactions even weaker than ionic bonds can be used to separate enantiomers. Chromatographic separation relies on a difference in affinity between a stationary phase (often silica) and a mobile phase (the solvent travelling through the stationary phase, known as the eluent) mediated by, for example, hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions. If the stationary phase is made chiral by bonding it with an enantiomerically pure compound (often a derivative of an amino acid), chromatography can be used to separate enantiomers.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, is a macromolecular array of silicon and oxygen atoms. Its surface is covered with free OH groups, which can be used as an anchor for chiral derivatizing agents.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_326_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Chromatography on a chiral stationary phase is especially important when the compounds being resolved have no functional groups suitable for making the derivatives (usually esters or salts) needed for the more classical resolutions described above. For example, the two enantiomers of an analogue of the tranquillizer Valium were found to have quite different biological activities.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent"><a id="page_327" class="page">Page 327, Chapter 14: Stereochemistry</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to study these compounds further, it was necessary to obtain them in enantiomerically pure form. This was done by passing a solution of the racemic compound through a column of silica bonded to an amino-acid-derived chiral stationary phase. The (<i>R</i>)-(&#x2013;)-enantiomer showed a lower affinity for the stationary phase and therefore was eluted from the column first, followed by the (<i>S</i>)-(&#x002B;)-enantiomer.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> You can think about chiral chromatography like this. Put yourself in this familiar situation: you want to help out a pensioner friend of yours who sadly lost his left leg in the war. A local shoe shop donates to you all their spare odd shoes, left and right, in his size (which happens to be the same as yours). You set about sorting the lefts from the rights, but are plunged into darkness by a power cut. What should you do? Well, you try every shoe on your right foot. If it fits you keep it; if not it&#x2019;s a left shoe and you throw it out.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Now this is just what chromatography on a chiral stationary phase is about. The stationary phase has lots of &#x2018;right feet&#x2019; (one enantiomer of an adsorbed chiral molecule) sticking out of it and, as the mixture of enantiomers of &#x2018;shoes&#x2019; flows past, &#x2018;right shoes&#x2019; fit, and stick but &#x2018;left shoes&#x2019; do not and flow on down the column, reaching the bottom first.</p>

<p class="indent">Two enantiomers of one molecule may be the same compound, but they are clearly different, although only in a limited number of situations. They can interact with biological systems differently, for example, and can form salts or compounds with different properties when reacted with a single enantiomer of another compound. In essence, enantiomers behave identically <i>except</i> when they are placed in a chiral environment. In <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> we will see how to use this fact to make single enantiomers of chiral compounds, but next we move on to three classes of reactions in which stereochemistry plays a key role: substitutions, eliminations, and additions.</p>
