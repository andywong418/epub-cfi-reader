<p class="htwnoindent">The last chapter was about reactions of enols and enolates with alkyl
ating agents such as alkyl halides and a,P-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.We emphasized how 
important it was to avoid nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group.</p>
<figure class=""><img src="../images/page_614_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This chapter is about deliberately getting nucleophilic attack by enols 
and enolates on carbonyl groups of aldehydes or ketones (the aldol reaction in the first half
 of the chapter) or on acylating agents (the second half of the chapter).</p>

<p class="htwh2">The aldol reaction</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">The simplest enolizable aldehyde is acetaldehyde (ethanal, CH3CHO). What
 happens if we adda small amount of base, say NaOH, to this aldehyde? Some of it will
 form the enolate ion.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_615_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Only a small amount of the nucleophilic enolate ion is formed: as we pointed out in Chapter
 25, hydroxide is not basic enough to enolize an aldehyde completely. Each molecule of 
enolate is surrounded by molecules of the aldehyde that are not enolized and so still have 
the electrophilic carbonyl group intact. The enolate ion will attack one of these aldehydes
 to form an alkoxide ion, which will be protonated by the water molecule formed in the first 
step.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> pK H2O = 15.7; pKa
 MeCHO - 20</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_615_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The product is an aldehyde with a hydroxy (ol) group and it has the trivial name aldol. The name aldol is given to the whole class of reactions between enolates (or enols) and carbonyl compounds even if in most cases the product is not a hydroxy-aldehyde at all. Notice that the base catalyst (hydroxide ion) is regenerated in the last step, so it is truly a catalyst.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">This reaction is so important because of the carbon&#x002D;carbon bond formed when the nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic aldehyde. This bond is shown as a black bond in this version of the key step.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_615_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reaction occurs with ketones as well. Acetone is a good example for us to use at the
 start of this chapter because it gives an important product, and as it is a symmetrical
 ketone, there can be no argument over which way it enolizes. Each step is the same as the 
aldol sequence with acetaldehyde, and the product is again a hydroxy-carbonyl compound, but
 this time a hydroxy-ketone</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_615_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The acetaldehyde reaction works well when one drop of dilute sodium hydroxide is added to acetaldehyde. The acetone reaction is best done with insoluble barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Both approaches keep the base concentration low. Without this precaution,
 the aldol products are not the compounds isolated from the reaction. With more base, 
further reactions occur because the aldol products dehydrate rather easily under the reaction
 conditions to give stable conjugated unsaturated carbonyl compounds.<a id="page_616" class="page">Page 616, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_616_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">These are elimination reactions, and you met them in <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, where the possible mechanisms are discussed. You cannot normally eliminate water from an alcohol in basic solution as hydroxide is a bad leaving group. It is the carbonyl group that allows 
elimination here: these are E1cB reactions, with a second enolization allowing the loss 
of OH</p>

<p class="htwtwoviolet"> <img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img>&#160;&#160;Interactive mechanism for acid- catalysed aldol reaction</p></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_616_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In the examples that follow you will see that the base-catalysed aldol reaction sometimes gives the aldol and sometimes the elimination product. The choice is partly based on 
conditions&#x2014;the more vigorous the conditions (stronger base, higher temperature,
 longer time) the more likely elimination is to occur&#x2014;and partly on the structure of 
the reagents.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The elimination is even easier in acid solution and acid-catalysed aldol reactions commonly give unsaturated products instead of aldols. In this simple example with a symmetrical cyclic ketone, the enone is formed in good yield in acid or base. We shall use the acid-catalysed 
reaction to illustrate the mechanism. First the ketone is enolized under acid catalysis as 
you saw in <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a></p>.
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_616_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Then the aldol reaction takes place. Enols are less nucleophilic than 
enolates, and the reaction occurs because the electrophilic carbonyl component is protonated: 
the addition is acid- catalysed. An acid-catalysed aldol reaction takes place.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_616_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The aldol is a tertiary alcohol and would be likely to eliminate by an E1 mechanism in acid
 even without the carbonyl group. But the carbonyl ensures that only the stable conjugated
 enone is formed. Notice too that the dehydration is genuinely acid-catalysed as the acid
 reappears in the very last step</p>
<figure class="fig2"><img src="../images/page_616_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent"><a id="page_617" class="page">Page 617, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a>None of these intermediates is detected or isolated in practice&#x2014;
simple treatment of the ketone with acid gives the enone in good yield. A base-catalysed
 reaction gives the same product via the aldol&#x002D;E1cB elimination mechanism.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Aldol condensations</h3>
<p class="htwnoindenta">The term 'condensation' is often used for reactions 
like this. Condensations are reactions where two molecules
 combine with the loss of another small molecule-usually water.
In this case, two ketones combine with the loss of water. This 
reaction is called an aldol condensation and chemists may say 
'two molecules of cyclopentanone condense together to give a conjugated enone'.
 You will also find the term 'condensation' used for all aldol reactions whether
 they occur with dehydration or not. The distinction is no longer important</p>

<p class="htwh2">Aldol reactions of unsymmetrical ketones</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">If the ketone is blocked on one side so that it cannot enolize-in other words it has no 
protons on that side-only one aldol reaction is possible. Ketones of this type might bear a
 tertiary alkyl or an aryl substituent. tert-Butyl methyl ketone (3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one),
 for example, gives aldol reactions with various bases in 60-70% yield. Enolization cannot 
occur towards the t-butyl group and must occur towards the methyl group instead</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-0.5em"><img src="../images/page_617_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">An especially interesting case of the blocked carbonyl compound is the
 lactone or cyclic ester. Open-chain esters do not give aldol reactions: they prefer a 
different reaction that is the subject of the second half of this chapter. But lactones 
are in some ways quite like ketones (the stretching frequencies of their C=O groups in the 
IR are similar, and unlike esters they react with NaBH4) and give unsaturated carbonyl 
roducts under basic catalysis. Enolization is unambiguous because the ester oxygen atom 
blocks enolization on one side.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_617_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1"><a id="page_618" class="page">Page 618, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The enolate then attacks the carbonyl group of an unenolized lactone just
 as we have seen with aldehydes and ketones.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_618_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The last step is the familiar dehydration. As this reaction is being 
carried out in base we had better show the E1cB mechanism via the enolate of the aldol
 product.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_618_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You might have been surprised that the intermediate in the aldol step of
 this reaction did not decompose. This intermediate could be described as a tetrahedral 
intermediate in a nucleophilic substitution at a carbonyl group (<a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>). Why then does
 it not break down in the usual way?</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em">
<div class="htwblue">
<p class="htwnoindenta">The equilibrium does not affect
the eventual product; it simply withdraws some of the material
out of the productive reaction. We call this sort of equilibrium a
parasitic equilibrium as it has no real life of its own&#x002D;it just sucks
the blood of the reaction.</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_618_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The best leaving group is the alkoxide and the product is quite
 reasonable. But what is it to do now? The only reasonable next step is for it to close back
 up again. Because the lactone is a <i>cyclic</i> ester, the leaving group cannot
 escape&#x2014;it must stay attached to the molecule. This reaction is reversible, but
 dehydration is effectively irreversible because it gives a stable conjugated product.
 Normal, acyclic esters are different: their alkoxide leaving groups <i>can</i> leave, and 
the result is a different sort of reaction, which you will meet later in this chapter.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_26.3">
<h2 class="htwh2">Cross-condensations</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">So far we have considered only 'self-condensations'&#x2014;dimerization 
reactions of a single car-bonyl compound. These form only a tiny fraction of known aldol 
reactions. Those that occur between two different carbonyl compounds, one acting as a 
nucleophile in its enol or enolate form, and the other as an electrophile, are called 
<b>cross-condensations</b>. They are more interesting than self-condensations, but working 
out what happens needs more thought. We shall start with an example that works well. The 
ketone PhCOMe reacts with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in aqueous ethanol under NaOH catalysis to 
give a quantitative yield of an enone.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_618_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The first step must be the formation of an enolate anion using NaOH as a
 base. Although both carbonyl compounds are unsymmetrical, there is only one site for 
enolization as there is only one set of a protons, on the methyl group of the ketone. The 
aldehyde has no a protons at all.?<a id="page_619" class="page">Page 619 Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_619_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">To get the observed product, the enolate obviously attacks the aldehyde 
to give an aldol, which then dehydrates by the E1cB mechanism.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_619_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, in this step there was a choice. The enolate could have attacked 
another molecule of unenolized ketone. It didn't, because ketones are less reactive than 
aldehydes (<a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). In this case the aldehyde has an electron-withdrawing nitro 
substituent too, making it even more reactive. The enolate selects the better electrophile
&#x2014;that is, the aldehyde.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">In other cases the balance may shift towards self-condensation. You might
 think that a crossed aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and benzophenone (diphenylketone
 Ph<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;O) should work well.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_619_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">After all, only the aldehyde can enolize and the enolate could attack 
the ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_619_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">But it won't work. The ketone is very hindered and very conjugated. It
 is less electrophilic than a normal ketone and normal ketones are less electrophilic than
 aldehydes. Given a choice between attacking this ketone and attacking another (but 
unenolized) molecule of acetaldehyde, the enolate will choose the aldehyde every time. 
The reaction at the start of the chapter occurs, while the ketone is just a spectator.</p>
<div class="htwyellow">
<p class="htwnoindent" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"/><b>&#160;&#160;Successful crossed aldol reactions</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>For this kind of crossed aldol reaction to work well we must have two

<ul style="color:red">
<li><span style="color:#000000"><b>One partner only must be capable of enolization.</b></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000"><b>The other partner must be incapable of enolization and be more

<p class="htwdivi"><b>Everyone remembers the fi rst of these conditions, but it is easy to forget the second.</b></p></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_620" class="page">Page 620, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a></p>
<h2 class="htwh2">The Mannich reaction</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">At first sight formaldehyde (methanal, CH2=O) seems the ideal 
electrophilic partner in a mixed aldol reaction. It cannot enolize. (Usually we are 
concerned with a hydrogen atoms in an aldehyde. Formaldehyde does not even have a carbon 
atoms.) And it is a super aldehyde. Aldehydes are more electrophilic than ketones because
 a hydrogen atom replaces one of the alkyl groups. Formaldehyde has two hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The trouble is that it is too reactive. It tends to react more than once and to give extra 
unwanted reactions as well. You might think that condensation between acetaldehyde and 
formaldehyde in base would be quite simple. The acetaldehyde alone can form an enolate, 
and this enolate will attack the more electrophilic carbonyl group, which is formaldehyde.
 In each reaction the only possible enolate attacks another molecule of formaldehyde. By now 
you have got the idea so we simply draw the next enolate and the structure of the third aldol.</p>
 <aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em">
<div class="htwblue">
<h3 class="h3">Formaldehyde</h3>
<p class="htwnoindenta">Formaldehyde is not available as a pure monomer because it forms trimers and tetramers 
in the pure state. The aqueous solution 'formalin' used to preserve biological specimens
 is available-it is 37% formaldehyde and mostly consists of the hydrate CH2(OH)2; see Chapter
 6. A pure dry polymer 'paraformaldehyde' is also available and was mentioned in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.
 Neither of these is particularly useful in aldol reactions. The aqueous solution is used in 
the Mannich reaction that we describe shortly. It is possible to make the short-lived monomer
 and capture it with a lithium enolate, but this is not trivial experimentally.</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig2"><img src="../images/page_620_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This aldol is formed all right but it is not the final product of the 
reaction because, with an electrophile as powerful as formaldehyde, a second and a third 
aldol follow swiftly on the heels of the first.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_620_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Even this is not all. A fourth molecule of formaldehyde reacts with hydroxide ion and then
reduces the third aldol. This reduction is known as the Cannizzaro reaction, and is described 
in the box below. The final product is the highly symmetrical 'pentaerythritol', C(CH2OH)4,
 with four CH2OH groups joined in a tetrahedral array about the same carbon atom. The overall 
reaction uses four molecules of formaldehyde and can give a high yield (typically 80% with
 NaOH but as much as 90% with MgO) of the product.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_620_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3">The Cannizzaro reaction</h3>
<p class="htwdivi">As you know, aldehydes are generally at least partly hydrated in water.
 Hydration is 
catalysed by base, and we can represent the hydration step in base like this. The hydration 
product is an anion but, if the base is sufficiently strong (or concentrated) and as long as
 the aldehyde cannot be enolized, at least some will be present as a dianion</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_620_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></div>
<div class="htwblue1">
<a id="page_621" class="page">Page 621, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a>
 <p class="htwdivii">The dianion is very unstable, and one way in which it can become much
 more stable is by behaving like a tetrahedral intermediate. Which is the best leaving group? 
Out of a choice of O2-, R-, and H-, it's H- that (if reluctantly) has to go. Hydride is, of 
course, too unstable to be released into solution but, if there is a suitable electrophile at
 hand (another molecule of aldehyde, for example), it is transferred to the electrophilic 
centre in a mechanism that bears some resemblance to a borohydride reduction.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">A general solution to using formaldehyde in aldol reactions is to use the Mannich reaction.
 A typical example is shown in the margin: the reaction involves an enolizable aldehyde or 
ketone (here we use cyclohexanone), a secondary amine (here dimethylamine), the Mannich 
reaction formaldehyde as its aqueous solution, and catalytic HCl. The product is an amino-
 ketone from the addition of one molecule each of formaldehyde and the amine to the ketone.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The mechanism involves the preliminary formation of an imine salt from the amine and 
formaldehyde. The amine is nucleophilic and attacks the more electrophilic of the two 
carbonyl compounds available, which is, of course, formaldehyde. No acid is needed for this 
addition step, but acid-catalysed dehydration of the addition product gives the imine salt.
 In the normal Mannich reaction, this is just an intermediate but it is quite stable and the
 corresponding iodide is sold as Eschenmoser's salt for use in Mannich reactions.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The electrophilic salt can now add to the enol (we are in acid solution) 
of the ketone to give the product of the reaction, an amine sometimes called a Mannich
 base.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">By using this reaction, you can add one molecule of formaldehyde&#x2014;
and one only&#x2014;to carbonyl compounds. You might, of course, reasonably object that the
 product is not actually an aldol product at all&#x2014;indeed, if you wanted the aldol 
product, the Mannich reaction would be of little use to you. It nevertheless remains a very 
important reaction. First of all, it is a simple way to make amino-ketones and many drug 
molecules belong to this class.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Secondly, the Mannich products can be converted to enones. The most 
reliable method for making the enone is to alkylate the amine product of the Mannich reaction
 with MeI and then treat the ammonium salt with base. Enolate ion formation leads to an E1cB 
reaction rather like the dehydration of aldols, but with a better leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_621_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Enones like this, with two hydrogen atoms at the end of the double bond,
 are called <b>exo-methylene compounds</b>; they are very reactive and cannot easily be made
 or stored. They cer-tainly cannot be made by aldol reactions with formaldehyde alone as we 
have seen. The solution? <a id="page_622" class="page">Page 622, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a>is to make the Mannich product, store that, and then to alkylate and eliminate only when  the enone is needed. We have seen how useful this is in the Michael reaction in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">If the enone is wanted, any secondary amine will do as it does not end up in the molecule so
 the more convenient (less volatile and less smelly) cyclic amines, pyrrolidine, and 
piperidine, are often used. The very electrophilic enones with monosubstituted double bonds 
can be made in this way.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Carbonyl compounds that are electrophilic but cannot enolize</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Good crossed aldol condensations require one component to enolize and act
 as a nucleophile and the other not to enolize and to act as the electrophile. Here follows 
a list of carbonyl substituents that prevent enolization and therefore force a carbonyl 
compound to take the role of the electrophilic partner. They are arranged roughly in order
 of reactivity with the most reactive towards nucleophilic attack by an enolate at the top.
 You do, of course, need two substituents to block enolization so typical compounds also 
appear in the list. Note that the last two entries&#x2014;esters and amides&#x2014;do not 
normally do aldol reactions with enolates, but they do react as acylating agents for 
enolates, as you will see later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Compounds that can enolize but that are not electrophilic	</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">We can complement this type of selectivity with the opposite type. Are 
there any compounds that can enolize but that cannot function as electrophiles? No carbonyl
 compound can fill <a id="page_623" class="page">Page 623, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: the aldol and Claisen reactions</a>groups altogether. Most notable among these were the nitroalkanes. 
Deprotonation of nitro- alkanes is not enolization nor is the product an enolate ion, but
 the whole thing is so similar to enolization that it makes sense to consider them together.
 You saw these anions, sometimes called nitronates, reacting with Michael acceptors in
 <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, and they also react well with aldehydes and ketones.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">This particular example, using cyclohexanone as the electrophile and 
nitromethane itself as the source of the 'enolate', works quite well with NaOH as the base 
in methanol solution to give the 'aldol' in reasonable yield. Once again this reaction 
involves choice. Either compound could enolize and, indeed, cyclohexanone reacts well with
 itself under essentially the same conditions.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_623_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Although cyclohexanone forms an enolate in the absence of nitromethane, 
when both ketone and nitroalkane are present, the base prefers to remove a proton from 
nitromethane. This is simply a question of pKa values. The pKa of a typical ketone is about 
20 but that of nitromethane is </p>
<p class="htwindent1">The elimination step also occurs easily with nitro compounds and is 
difficult to prevent in reactions with aromatic aldehydes. Now you can see how the useful

In all cases that fail to meet these three criteria, a specific enol equivalent will be required: one component must be turned quantitatively into an enol equivalent, which will be reacted in a separate step with an electrophile. That is what the next section is about-and you will find that some of the methods have a lot in common with those we used for alkylating enolates in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Specific enol equivalents can be used to control aldol reactions</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> we saw that the alkylation of enolates was most simply controlled by preparing a specific enol equivalent from the carbonyl compound. The same approach is the most powerful of all the ways to control the aldol reaction. The table is a reminder of some of the most useful of these specific enol equivalents.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_624_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

That was all we needed to know in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>. Now we know that a further threat is the reaction of the partly formed enol derivative with its unenolized parent and we should add that 'no aldol reaction should occur during the preparation of the specific enol equivalent&#x2019;.</p>
<div class="htwyellow1"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"/><b>&#160;&#160;Specific enol equivalents are intermediates that still have the reactivity of enols or enolates but are stable enough to be prepared in good yield from the carbonyl compound <i>without any aldol reaction.</i></b></div>
<p class="htwindent1">Sensible choice of an appropriate specific enol equivalent will allow almost any aldol reaction to be performed successfully. The first two compounds in our list, the silyl enol ethers and the lithium enolates, have a particularly wide application and we should look first at the way these work. As the table suggests, silyl enol ethers are more like enols: they are non-basic and not very reactive. Lithium enolates are more like enolate anions: they are basic and reactive. Each is appropriate in different circumstances.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Lithium enolates in aldol reactions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Lithium enolates are usually made at low temperature in THF with a hindered lithium amide base (often LDA) and are stable under those conditions because of the strong O-Li bond. The formation of the enolate begins with Li-O bond formation before the removal of the proton from the position by the basic nitrogen atom.</p>

<div class="htwgreen"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;Aldehydes are an exception. You can make lithium enolates from some aldehydes such as i-PrCHO, but generally self-condensation is too fast, so unwanted aldol selfcondensation products are produced during the formation of the lithium enolate. To make specific enolates of aldehydes we need to use another type of derivative: see later.</div>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="htwgreen"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;&#160;A lithium cation has four coordination sites-those we do not show are occupied by solvent molecules. Before the aldol reaction can take place, one of these molecules must be displaced by the electrophilic carbonyl partner.</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This reaction happens very quickly-so quickly that the partly formed enolate does not have a chance to react with unenolized carbonyl compound before proton removal is complete.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_625_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, if a second carbonyl compound is added, it too complexes with the same lithium atom. This allows the aldol reaction to take place by a cyclic mechanism in the coordination sphere of the lithium atom. The aldol step itself is now a very favourable intramolecular reaction with a six-membered cyclic transition state. The product is initially the lithium alkoxide of the aldol, which gives the aldol on work-up.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_625_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This reaction works well even if the electrophilic partner is an enolizable aldehyde. In this example, an unsymmetrical ketone (blocked on one side by an aromatic ring) reacts as the enol partner in excellent yield with a very enolizable aldehyde. This is the first complete aldol reaction we have shown you using a specific enol equivalent: notice the important point that it is done in two steps:</p>
<ul style="color:#034694;">
<li><span style="color:#000000">first, form the specific enol equivalent (here, the lithium enolate at low temperature)</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">then add the electrophile.</span>

<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_626_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">Contrast the crossed aldols earlier in the chapter, where enolizable component, base, and electrophile were all mixed together in one step.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The next example is particularly impressive. The enol partner is a symmetrical ketone that is very hindered-there is only one hydrogen on either side. The electrophilic partner is a conjugated enal that is not enolizable but that might accept the nucleophile in a conjugate manner. In spite of these potential problems, the reaction goes in excellent yield.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_626_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You may wonder why we did not mention the stereochemistry of the fi rst of these two
products. Two new stereogenic centres are formed and the product is a mixture of diastereo -
i somers. In fact, both of these products were wanted for oxidation to the 1,3-diketone so the
stereochemistry is irrelevant. This sequence shows that the aldol reaction can be used to
make diketones too.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Silyl enol ethers in aldol reactions</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The silyl enol ether can be prepared from its parent carbonyl compound by forming a small equilibrium concentration of enolate ion with weak base such as a tertiary amine and trapping the enolate with the very efficient oxygen electrophile Me3SiCl. The silyl enol ether is stable enough to be isolated but is usually used immediately without storing.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">You should look upon silyl enol ethers as rather reactive alkenes that combine with things like protons or bromine (<a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>), but do not react with aldehydes and ketones without catalysis: they are much less reactive than lithium enolates. As with alkylation (pp. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_595">595</a> and 609), a Lewis acid catalyst is needed to get the aldol reaction to work, and a Ti(IV) compound such as TiCl4 is popular.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_626_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The immediate product is actually the silyl ether of the aldol product but this is hydrolysed during work-up and the aldol is formed in good yield. The Lewis acid presumably bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the electrophile.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now the aldol reaction can occur: the positive charge on the titanium-complexed carbonyl oxygen atom makes the aldehyde reactive enough to be attacked even by the not very nucleophilic silyl enol ether. Chloride ion removes the silyl group and the titanium alkoxide<a id="page_627" class="page">Page 627, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds: The aldol and claisen reactions</a> captures it again. This last step should not surprise you as any alkoxide (MeOLi, for example) will react with Me<sub>3</sub>SiCl to form a silyl ether.</p>

<figure class="fig3">

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1"> This mechanism looks complicated, and it is. It is, in fact, not clear that the details of what we have written here are right: the titanium may well coordinate to <i>both</i> oxygens throughout the reaction, and some of the steps that we have represented separately probably happen simultaneously. However, all reasonable mechanisms will agree on two important points, which you must understand:</p>
<ul style="color:#054795">
<li> <span style="color:#000000">Lewis acid is needed to get silyl enol ethers to react.</span></li>
<li style="width:70%"> <span style="color:#000000">The key step is an aldol reaction of the silyl enol ether with the Lewis-acid 
complexed electrophile.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="htwindent1"> The use of silyl enol ethers can be illustrated in a synthesis of manicone, a conjugated enone that ants use to leave a trail to a food source. It can be made by an aldol reaction between pentan-3-one (as the enol component) and 2-methylbutanal (as the electrophile). Both partners are enolizable so we shall need to form a specific enol equivalent from the ketone. The silyl enol ether works well. The aldol product will be a mixture of diastereoisomers but it eliminates to give a single compound.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_627_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1"> The silyl enol ether is not isolated but is treated immediately with the aldehyde to give an excellent yield of the aldol. Dehydration in acid solution with toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) gives the enone. You can see by the high yield in the aldol reaction that there is no significant self-condensation of either partner in the aldol reaction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"> <b>Conjugated Wittig reagents as specific enol equivalents</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent"> When the Wittig reaction was introduced (<a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>) we saw it simply as an alkene synthesis. Now if we look at one group of Wittig reagents, those derived from a-halo-carbonyl compounds, we can see that they behave as specific enol equivalents in making unsaturated carbonyl compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3"> <b>Specific enol equivalents from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent"> Although these are the oldest of the specific enol equivalents, they are still widely used because they need no special conditions&#x2014;no low temperatures or strictly anhydrous solvents.

<p class="htwindent1">Ethyl acetoacetate is partly enolized under normal conditions. So, you might ask, why doesn&#x2019;t it immediately react with itself by the aldol reaction? There are two aspects to the answer. First, the enol is very stable (see <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> for a full discussion) and, second, the carbonyl groups in the unenolized fraction of the sample are poorly electrophilic ester and ketone groups. The second carbonyl group of the enol is not electrophilic because of conjugation. When a normal carbonyl compound is treated with catalytic acid or base, we have a small proportion of reactive enol or enolate in the presence of large amounts of unenolized electrophile. Aldol reaction (self-condensation) occurs. With 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds we have a small proportion of not particularly reactive unenolized compound in the presence of large amounts of stable (and hence unreactive) enol. No aldol occurs.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>How to control aldol reactions of esters</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Among the enolates of carboxylic acid derivatives, esters are the most widely used. Ester eno- lates cannot be used as such in crossed aldols with aldehydes because the aldehyde is both more enolizable and more electrophilic than the ester. It will just condense with itself and ignore the ester. The same is true for ketones. A specific enol equivalent for the ester will therefore be needed for a successful aldol reaction of an ester enolate.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Fortunately, because this is a classic problem, many solutions are available. You can use the lithium enolate or the silyl enol ether, usually made best via the lithium enolate.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>How to control aldol reactions of aldehydes</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Aldehydes enolize very readily but also self-condense rather easily. Lithium enolates of aldehydes 
can&#x2019;t be made cleanly because the self-condensation reaction happens even at -78 
&#x00B0;C and is as fast as the enolization by LDA. Silyl enol ethers are a much better 
choice. They clearly must not be made via the lithium enolate, and amine bases are usually 
used. As each molecule of enolate is produced in the equilibrium, it is efficiently trapped 
by the silylating agent.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_632_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">These silyl enol ethers are probably the best way of carrying out crossed aldol reactions with an aldehyde as the nucleophilic (enol or enolate) partner. An example is the reaction of the enol of the not very enolizable isobutyraldehyde with the very enolizable 3-phenylpropanal. Mixing the two aldehydes and adding base would of course lead to an orgy of self-condensation and cross-couplings.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_632_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Preliminary formation of the silyl enol ether from either aldehyde, <i>in the absence of the other,</i> would be trouble-free as Me<sub>3</sub>SiCl captures the enolate faster than self-condensation occurs. Here we need the silyl enol ether from isobutyraldehyde. The other aldehyde is now added along with the necessary Lewis acid, here TiCl<sub>4</sub>. The mechanism described on p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_627">627</a> gives the aldol after work-up in an excellent 95&#x0025; yield. No more than 5&#x0025; of other reactions can have occurred.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_632_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Other useful specific enol equivalents of aldehydes and ketones are enamines and aza-eno- lates, which you saw in use in alkylation reactions in <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>. Aza-enolates&#x2014;the lithium enolates of imines&#x2014;derived from aldehydes are also useful in aldol reactions. Cyclohexylamine gives a reasonably stable imine even with acetaldehyde and this can be isolated and lithiated with LDA to give the aza-enolate. The mechanism is similar to the formation of lithium eno- lates and the lithium atom binds the nitrogen atom of the aza-enolate, just as it binds the oxygen atom of an enolate.<a id="page_633" class="page">Page 633, chapter26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl components: the aldol and claisen reactions</a></p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The aza-enolate reacts cleanly with other aldehydes or ketones to give aldol products. Even the most challenging of cross-couplings&#x2014;attack on another similar enolizable aldehyde&#x2014; occurs in good yield.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_633_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="htwindent1">The initial product is a new imine, which is easily hydrolysed during acidic aqueous workup. The alkoxide is protonated, the imine hydrolysed, and finally the aldol is dehydrated to give the enal&#x2014;65&#x0025; overall yield in this case.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_633_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The key to the success of the aza-enolates is that the imine is first formed from the aldehyde with the primary amine, a relatively weak base, and under these conditions imine formation is faster than self-condensation. Only after the imine is formed is LDA added when selfcondensation cannot occur simply because no aldehyde is left.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Except in certain cases (and you will meet some of these in <a href="chapter_41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>) enamines are not generally used in aldol condensations, partly because they are not reactive enough, but mainly because they are too much in equilibrium with the carbonyl compound itself and exchange would lead to self-condensation and the wrong cross-couplings. You will see later that enamines come into their own when we want to acylate enols with the much more reactive acid chlorides.</p>

Gingerol is a 3-hydroxyketone, so we might consider using an aldol reaction to make it. We shall need the enol (or enolate) on the methyl side of an unsymmetrical ketone to react with a simple aldehyde (pentanal) as the electrophilic partner in the aldol reaction.

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We can deduce the mechanism of the reaction simply from the structure of the product by working backwards. The double bond is formed from an aldol whose structure we can predict and hence we can see which enolate anion was formed and which ketone acted as the electrophilic partner.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_638_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">Must we argue that this one enolate is more easily formed than the other three? No, of course not. There is little difference between all four enolates and almost no difference between the three enolates from CH<sub>2</sub> groups. We <i>can</i> argue that this is the only aldol reaction that leads to a stable conjugated enone in a stable six-membered ring. This must be the mechanism; the others are just too slow to compete. Protonation and dehydration follow as usual.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">Now try some of the alternatives in which the same ketone forms an enolate on the other side. These reactions give unstable four-membered rings or bridged bicyclic systems that would revert to the enolate. Providing the reaction is done under equilibrating conditions, the whole process would go into reverse back to the original diketone and the observed (six-membered ring) cyclization would eventually predominate. The key point about the bridged compound in the margin is that dehydration is impossible. No enolate can form at the bridgehead because bridgehead carbons cannot be planar (<a href="chapter_17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, p. <a href="chapter_17.xhtml#page_389">389</a>) and the enone product cannot exist for the same reason: the carbons marked (o) in the brown structure would all have to lie in the same plane. The aldol has a perfectly acceptable conformation but that elimination is impossible. The aldol product remains in equilibrium with the alternative aldol products, but only one elimination is possible&#x2014;and that is irreversible, so eventually all the material ends up as the one enone.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Robinson annelation</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">One of the most important applications of the intramolecular aldol reaction is a ring synthesis (annelation or annulation) that takes place in two steps, both involving enols. The compound made by Robinson in the first example is a bicyclic diketone that contains the basic structure of rings A and B of the steroids. The bonds made in the two steps are marked.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Acylation at carbon</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Introduction: the Claisen ester condensation and the aldol reaction 
compared</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">We began this chapter with the treatment of acetaldehyde with base. This led initially to the formation of an enolate anion and then to the aldol reaction. We are going to start this section by looking at what happens if you just treat ethyl acetate with base. To start with, there is hardly any difference. We shall use ethoxide as base rather than hydroxide as hydroxide would hydrolyse the ester, but otherwise the first steps are very similar. Here they are, side by side.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_640_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The next step in both cases is nucleophilic attack by the enolate ion on unenolized carbonyl compound. The concentration of enolate is low and each enolate ion is surrounded by unenolized aldehyde or ester molecules, so this reaction is to be expected. Here is that step, again shown for both aldehyde and ester.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_640_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Only now does something different happen. The aldehyde dimer simply captures a proton from the solvent to give an aldol product. The &#x2019;aldol&#x2019; from the ester (not, in fact, an aldol at all) has a leaving group, EtO<sup>-</sup>, instead of a hydrogen atom and is actually the tetrahedral inter-mediate in a nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group. Compare the two different steps again.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_640_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Even though the last step is different, the two products are quite similar. Both are dimers of the original two-carbon chain and both have carbonyl groups at the end of the chain and oxygen substituents at position three. The two reactions obviously belong to the same family but are usually given different names. The ester reaction is sometimes known as the <b>Claisen ester condensation</b> and sometimes as the <b>Claisen&#x2014;Schmidt reaction.</b> More important than remembering the name is being familiar with the reaction and its mechanism.<a id="page_641" class="page">Page 641,chapter26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl components: the aldol and claisen reactions</a></p>
<p class="htwindent1">This is another of those reactions where the base is not strong enough 
to transform the ester entirely into the enolate. Only a small equilibrium concentration 
is produced, which reacts with the ester electrophile. The by-product from the reaction is 
ethoxide ion and so it looks at first sight as though we get our catalyst back again&#x2014;the aldol, if you remember, is catalytic in base. But not the Claisen reaction. The second step of the reaction is also really an equilibrium, and the reaction works only because the product can be irreversibly deprotonated by the ethoxide by-product, consuming ethoxide in the process. You recall that the aldol reaction often works best when there is an extra driving force to push it across&#x2014;dehydration to an enone, for example. Similarly, the ester dimerization works best when the product reacts with the ethoxide ion to give a stable enolate ion.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The point is that the base used, ethoxide ion EtO<sup>-</sup>, is too weak (EtOH has a pK<sub>a</sub> of about 16) to remove the proton completely from ethyl acetate (pK<sub>a</sub> about 25), but is strong enough to remove a proton from the acetoacetate product (pK<sub>a</sub> about 10). Under the conditions of the reaction, a small amount of the enolate of ethyl acetate is produced&#x2014;just enough to let the reaction happen&#x2014;but the product is completely converted into its enolate. The neutral product, ethyl acetoacetate itself, is formed on acidic work-up.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_641_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="htwindent1">The final product has been formed by the acylation at carbon of the enolate of an ester. This general process&#x2014;acylation at carbon&#x2014;is the subject of the second part of this chapter. It so happened in this case that the acylating agent was another molecule of the same ester, but the general process we shall consider is the acylation of enolates at carbon. We shall use a variety of enols, enolates, and specific enol equivalents and a variety of acylating agents, but the basic idea is that the enolate of one carbonyl compound will have an acyl group (here the R<sup>2</sup>CO group in orange) added to the enolate carbon atom.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Claisen ester condensation and other self-condensations</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The self-condensation of ethyl acetate is the most famous example of the Claisen ester condensation and it works in good yield under convenient conditions. The product (ethyl aceto- acetate) is commercially available for this very reason&#x2014;and cheap too&#x2014;so you are unlikely to want to do this particular example.</p>

It then carries out a nucleophilic attack on the more abundant unenolized ester molecules.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_642_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">These steps are all unfavourable equilibria and, on their own, would give very little product.

<p class="htwnoindent">Finally, the reaction is worked up in acid and the &#x03B2; keto-ester product is formed.

<p class="htwindent1">As you might expect, all the equilibria are now unfavourable, and this reaction does not go well under the normal equilibrating conditions (EtO<sup>-</sup> in EtOH).

<h3 class="h3"><b>Reactive esters that cannot enolize</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">There are several useful esters of this kind, of which the four in the margin are the most important. They cannot act as the enol partner, and the first three are more electrophilic than most esters, so they should acylate an ester enolate faster than the ester being enolized can.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">These four are arranged in order of reactivity towards nuclophiles, the most electrophilic at the top and the least electrophilic at the bottom. Oxalates are very reactive because each carbonyl group makes the other more electrophilic. The molecular LUMO is the <i>sum</i> of the two <i>n*</i> orbitals and is lower in energy than either.<a id="page_644" class="page">Page 644,chapter26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl components: the aldol and claisen reactions</a></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_644_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Formate esters look a bit like aldehydes but their ester character dominates. The hydrogen atom just makes them very electrophilic as they lack the <i>a</i> conjugation (and steric hindrance) of simple esters.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Carbonates are particularly useful as they introduce a CO<sub>2</sub>R group on to an enolate. It is perhaps not immediately obvious why they are more electrophilic than simple esters. Normal esters are (slightly) less electrophilic than ketones because the deactivating lone pair donation by the oxygen atom is more important than the inductive effect of the electronegative oxygen atom.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_644_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The result is a small difference between two large effects. In carbonate esters there are two oxygen atoms on the same carbonyl group. Both can exert their full inductive effect but the lone pairs have to share the same <i>n*</i> orbital. The balance is changed&#x2014;the summed inductive effects win out&#x2014;and carbonates are more electrophilic than ordinary esters.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwnoindent">Claisen condensations are acylations that always involve esters as the electrophilic partner, but enolates of other carbonyl compounds&#x2014;ketones, for example&#x2014;may work equally well as the enol partner. In a reaction with a carbonate, only the ketone can enolize and the reactive carbonate ester is more electrophilic than another molecule of the ketone. A good example is this reaction of cyclooctanone. It does not matter which side of the carbonyl group enolizes&#x2014; they are both the same.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Unsymmetrical ketones often give a single product, even without the use of a specific enol equivalent, as reaction usually occurs on the less substituted side. This is another consequence of the final enolization being the irreversible step. In this example, both possible products may form, but only one of them can form a stable enolate. Under the equilibrating conditions of the reaction, only the enolate is stable, and all the material ends up as the isomer shown.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Diethyl oxalate also gives well-controlled condensations with ketones and we shall take the synthesis of a new drug as an example. One way to try to prevent heart disease is to reduce the amount of &#x2019;bad&#x2019; lipoproteins in the blood. The drug Acifran does this, and a key step in its synthesis is the base-catalysed reaction between diethyl oxalate and a methyl ketone.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Notice that the hydroxyl group on the ketone does not interfere with the reaction.

<p class="htwindent1">Ethyl acetoacetate (ethyl 3-oxobutyrate) can of course be made by the self-condensation of ethyl acetate. This ester is cheap to buy but homologues, available by the self-condensation of other esters, are usually made in the laboratory. Which esterifying group is used (OEt, OMe, etc.) is not important as long as the same alkoxide is used as the base.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwnoindent">Compounds with only one of the R substituents in this structure are also easy to make. If the R substituent is at C2, it is best introduced by alkylation of the unsubstituted ester (see <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_595">595</a>).</p>

The simple alkylation route above removes the need for control. The green route requires a condensation between an unsymmetrical ketone and diethyl carbonate. This condensation will work all right, but not to give this product. As you saw on p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_645">645</a>, Claisen condensations prefer to give the less substituted dicarbonyl compound, and condensation would occur at the methyl group of the ketone on the right to give the other unsymmetrical keto-ester.

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Controlling acylation with specific enol equivalents</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the first part of this chapter we saw how specific enol equivalents could be used to control aldol reactions. We now need to look at the same type of control in the acylation of enolates and extend our discussion to specific enolates of carboxylic acid derivatives.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_648_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">We established in <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> a hierarchy for the electrophilic reactivity of acid derivatives that should by now be very familiar to you&#x2014;acyl chlorides at the top to amides at the bottom. But what about the reactivity of these same derivatives towards enolization at the position, that is, the CH<sub>2</sub> group between R and the carbonyl group in the various structures? You might by now be able to work this out. The principle is based on the mechanisms for the two processes.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_648_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">See how similar these two mechanisms are. In particular, they are the same at the carbonyl group itself. Electrons move into the C&#x003D;O <i>n*</i> orbital: the C&#x003D;O bond becomes a C&#x2014;O single bond as a negative charge develops on the oxygen atom. It should come as no surprise that <i>the order of reactivity for enolization is the same as the order of reactivity towards nucleophilic attack.</i> Aldehydes are more electrophilic and more easily enolized than ketones and ketones are more electrophilic and more easily enolized than esters, although exact comparisons between aldehydes and ketones on the one hand and acid derivatives on the other are unwise.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_648_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In <a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> we established that enolates can be formed from acid chlorides, but that they decompose to ketenes. Enolates can be formed from amides with difficulty, but with primary or secondary amides one of the NH protons is likely to be removed instead. For the remainder of this section we shall look at how to make specific enol equivalents of acids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_648_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Directed C-acylation of esters</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The danger we have to face is that acylation is inclined to occur on oxygen rather than on
carbon. In the extreme case, naked enolates (those with completely non-coordinating cati-
ons) acylate cleanly on oxygen with anhydrides or acid chlorides.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_648_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Fortunately, the reagents we have just discussed for aldol reactions (lithium and zinc eno-
lates) are also acylated at carbon rather than on oxygen. Even with acid chlorides magnesium
enolates, particularly those of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, give reliable C-acylation. The mag-
nesium atom bonds strongly to both oxygens, lessening their effective negative charge.</p>

<a id="page_649" class="page"><b>Page 649, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds:the aldol and claisen reactions</b></a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Hydrolysis and decarboxylation in the usual way lead to keto-esters or keto-acids. Of the more
 common metals used to form enolates, lithium is the most likely to give good C-acylation as, like magnesium, it forms
 a strong O&#x2014;metal bond. It is possible to acylate simple lithium enolates with enolizable acid chlorides.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_649_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160; See p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_597">597</a> for a discussion of decarboxylation.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">We shall describe two examples of this reaction being used as part of the synthesis of natural
 products. The first is pallescensin A, a metabolite of a sponge. It is quite a simple compound and some chemists in
 Milan conceived that it might be made from the chloro-diketone shown below, which might in turn be made by acylation
 of the enolate of a symmetrical ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_649_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The route chosen was to react the lithium enolate of 4-f-butyl cyclohexanone with the correct acid
 chloride. This reaction worked well, as did the rest of the synthesis of pallescensin A, which was first made by this 
route. The key step, the acylation of the lithium enolate, is interesting because alkylation could have occurred 
instead. The acid chloride is more electrophilic than the alkyl chloride in this reaction, although alkylation does 
occur in the next step. Notice how the lithium atom holds the molecules together during the reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_649_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Even the dilithio derivatives of carboxylic acids, made by treating a carboxylic acid with two 
molecules of LDA, can give good reactions with acid chlorides. In these reactions it is not necessary to have a proton
 remaining between the two carbonyl groups of the product as the reaction is between a strong nucleophile and a strong
 electrophile and is under kinetic control.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_649_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">It is rather more common to use enamines or silyl enol ethers in acylations with acid chlorides.
 These are more general methods&#x2014;enamines work well for aldehydes and ketones while silyl enol ethers work for
all classes of carbonyl compounds. It is possible to combine two enolizable molecules quite specifically by these 
methods, and we shall consider them next.</p>
<h2 class="htwh2">The acylation of ketones via enamines and aza-enolates</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Enamines are made from secondary amines and aldehydes or ketones via the iminium salt: you met them
 in <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> and have seen them in action in Chapters 20 and 25. In <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> we saw that reliable C-alkylation of 
enamines occurs with reactive allyl halides and <a id="page_650" class="page">Page 650, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds:the aldol and claisen reactions</a>&#x03B1;-halocarbonyl compounds, but that unwanted N-alkylation often competes with simple alkyl halides. We also noted earlier in this chapter that they are rarely used for aldol reactions as they are not reactive enough.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-22em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_649_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_650_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Acylation with the much more reactive acid chlorides could follow the same two pathways, but with
 one big difference. The products of N-acylation are unstable salts and N-acylation is reversible. Acylation on carbon,
 on the other hand, is irreversible. For this reason enamines end up acylated reliably on carbon.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_650_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The Swiss chemist Oppolzer used just such a reaction in a synthesis of the natural product 
longifolene. He first prepared an acid chloride from cyclopentadiene, and the enamine from cyclopentanone and the 
secondary amine morpholine.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_650_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160; Morpholine is frequently used in the preparation of enamines.
 See p. <a href="chapter_25.xhtml#page_592">592</a>.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Combining the enamine with the acid chloride led to a clean acylation at carbon in 82&#x0025;
 yield and eventually to a successful synthesis of longifolene.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_650_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Aza-enolates also react cleanly at carbon with acid chlorides. Good examples come from 
dimethylhydrazones of ketones. When the ketone is unsymmetrical, the aza-enolate forms on the less substituted side,
 even when the distinction is between primary and secondary carbons. The best of our previous regioselective acylations
 have distinguished only methyl from more highly substituted carbon atoms.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Acylation of ketones under acidic conditions</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Acylations of ketone enols with anhydrides are catalysed by Lewis acids such as BF<sub>3</sub>. 
This process will remind you of Friedel&#x2014;Crafts acylation (p. <a href="chapter_21.xhtml#page_477">477</a>) but a better analogy is perhaps the aldol 
reaction, where metals such as lithium hold the reagents together so that reaction can occur around a six-membered 
ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_651_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The mechanism obviously involves attack by the enol (or &#x2019;boron enolate&#x2019;) of the 
ketone on the anhydride, catalysed by the Lewis acid. Probably the boron atom holds the reagents together, much as 
the lithium atom does in aldol reactions of lithium enolates (p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_625">625</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_651_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Under the conditions of the reaction, the product forms a stable boron enolate, which needs to be
 decomposed to the diketone with refluxing aqueous sodium acetate.</p>

<p class="htwh2">Acylation of free carboxylic acids</p>
<p class="htwnoindent">You might think that the presence of the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid would present an 
insuperable barrier to the formation and use of any enol derivatives. In fact, this is not a problem with either the
 lithium enolates or the silyl enol ethers. Addition of BuLi or LDA to a carboxylic acid immediately results in the
 removal of the acidic proton and the formation of the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid. If BuLi is used, the next 
step is addition of BuLi to the carbonyl group and the eventual formation of a ketone (see <a href="chapter_10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_218">218</a>). But, 
if LDA is used, it is possible to form the lithium enolate of the lithium derivative of the carboxylic acid.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Intramolecular crossed Claisen ester condensations</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the same way as with intramolecular aldol condensations, we do not have to worry so much about 
controlling where enolization occurs providing that one product is more stable than the others&#x2014;for example, it
 might have a five- or a six-membered ring (rather than a four- or eight-membered one)&#x2014;and we carry out the 
reaction under equilibrating conditions. A cou-ple of examples should show what we mean. Although there are two sites
for enolate anion formation, one would give a four-membered ring and can be ignored. Only enolization of the methyl 
group leads to a stable six-membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_652_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In this next example the two possible sites for enolate anion formation would both lead to stable
 five-membered rings. The product forms a stable enolate under the reaction conditions but the alternative cannot form 
a stable enolate as there is no hydrogen atom between the two carbonyl groups.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwindent1">In the next example, there are three possible sites for enolate anion formation, but only one
 product is formed and in good yield too. If we consider all three possible enolate anions, the choice is more easily
 made. First, the reaction that <i>does</i> happen. An enolate anion is formed from the ketone at the green site and
 acylation at carbon follows. The product is a fused rather than a bridged bicyclic structure and can easily form a 
stable enolate anion.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_653_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We could form the enolate anion on the other side of the ketone at the orange site and attack the 
ester in the same way. The product would be a bridged bicyclic diketone, and is not formed (see above). The third 
possible enolate site (brown) could give an aldol reaction but the product would again be a bridged bicyclic compound
 and is not formed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">

 <i>spiro</i> compounds (one atom in common), and bridged compounds (rings joined at two non-adjacent atoms). Each

<h2 class="htwh2">Symmetry in intramolecular crossed Claisen condensations</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">If cyclization is to be followed by decarboxylation, a cunning plan can be set in motion. 
Addition of an amine by an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to an a halo-ester followed by conjugate addition to an unsaturated 
ester gives a substrate for Claisen ester cyclization.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_653_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This diester is unsymmetrical so cyclization is likely to lead to two different keto-esters.
Either can form a stable enolate so both are indeed formed. This sounds like very bad news since it gives a mixture
 of products.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_653_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The cunning plan is that the relative positions of the ketone and the nitrogen atom in the 
five-membered ring are the same in both products. All that differs is the position of the<a id="page_654" class="page"><b>Page 654, Chapter 26 Reactions of enolates with carbonyl compounds:the aldol and claisen reactions</b></a> CO<sub>2</sub>Et group.

give the same amino-ketone&#x0021;</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_654_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Just occasionally it is possible to carry out cross-condensations between two different enolizable
 molecules under equilibrating conditions. A notable example is the base-catalysed reaction between methyl ketones and
 lactones. With sodium hydride&#x2014;a strong base that can convert either starting material entirely into its 
enolate anion&#x2014;good yields of products from the attack of the enolate of the ketone on the electrophilic lactone
 can be obtained.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_654_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Kinetic enolate formation must occur at the methyl group of the ketone followed by acylation with
 the lactone. Lactones are rather more electrophilic than non-cyclic esters, but the control in this sequence is still
 remarkable. Notice how a stable enolate is formed by proton transfer within the first-formed product.</p>
