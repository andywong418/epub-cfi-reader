<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> This chapter builds on the concepts introduced in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>: make sure you understand all the terms used to describe stereochemistry that are defined there. In particular make sure you are absolutely clear on the meanings of <i>chiral, achiral, enantiomer</i>, and <i>diastereoisomer</i>, along with what the designators <i>R, S</i>, +, &#8211;, <small>L</small>, and <small>D</small> refer to.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:73%;">&#8216;How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they&#8217;d give you milk in there? Perhaps looking-glass milk isn&#8217;t good to drink. . .&#8217; Lewis Carroll, <i>Through the looking-glass and what Alice found there</i>, Macmillan, 1872.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">You are chiral, and so are Alice, Kitty, and all living organisms. You may think you look fairly symmetrical in a looking-glass, but as you read this book you are probably turning the pages with your right hand and processing the information with the left side of your brain. Some organisms are rather more obviously chiral: snails, for example, carry shells that could spiral to the left or to the right. Not only is nature chiral, but by and large it exists as just one enantiomer&#8212;although some snail shells spiral to the left, the vast majority of marine snail shells spiral to the right; humans have their stomach on their left and their liver on their right; honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera</i>) climbs by spiralling to the left and all bindweed (<i>Convolvulus</i>) spirals to the right.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">Nature has a left and a right, and it can tell the difference between them. You may think that human beings are sadly lacking in this respect, since as children we all had to learn, rather laboriously, which is which. Yet at an even earlier age, you could no doubt distinguish the smell of oranges from the smell of lemons, even though this is an achievement at least as remarkable as getting the right shoe on the right foot. The smells of orange and lemon differ in being the left- and right-handed versions of the same molecule, limonene. (<i>R</i>)-(+)Limonene smells rounded and orangey; (<i>S</i>)-(&#8211;)-limonene is sharp and lemony. Similarly, spearmint and caraway seeds smell quite different, although again this pair of aromas differs only in being the enantiomeric forms of the ketone carvone. Evolution has left many of us regrettably sensitive to (+)-androstenone, the smell of stale human urine. (&#8211;)-Androstenone is essentially odourless.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">Even bacteria know their right from their left: <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> can use aromatic hydro-carbons as a foodstuff, degrading them to diols. The diol produced from bromobenzene is formed as one enantiomer only.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">How can this be? We said in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> that enantiomers are chemically identical, so how is it that we can distinguish them with our noses and bacteria can produce them selectively? Well, the answer lies in a proviso to our assumption about the identity of enantiomers: they are identical <i>until they are placed in a chiral environment.</i> This concept will underlie all we say in this chapter about how to make single enantiomers in the laboratory. We take our lead from nature: all life is chiral, so all living systems are chiral environments.</p>

<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> The molecules of life are examined in detail in the next chapter.</p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">The sheer complexity of life means that nature has to build its living structures from molecules that are chiral, principally amino acids and sugars. For all of those chiral molecules, evolution has forced the use of a single enantiomeric form, for example every amino acid in your body has the same configuration (usually labelled <i>S</i>). From this fact derives the larger-scale chirality of all living structures, from the right-handed double helix of DNA to the location of a blue whale&#8217;s internal organs. The answer to the question posed by Alice at the start of the chapter is most certainly <i>no</i>&#8212;her kitten&#8217;s digestive system will be able to hydrolyse the achiral fats in the looking-glass milk quite easily (achiral compounds are superimposable on their mirror image), but looking-glass proteins (which will be made of D-amino acids) and L-lactose will be quite indigestible.</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> Natural <small>L</small>-amino acids all look like this:</p>
<figure class="maxcdfig8"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1103-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindentl">All have <i>S</i> stereochemistry except cysteine (R=SH), where the priority rules mean the chiral centre is <i>R</i>. Some bacteria make their cell walls from &#8216;unnatural&#8217; <i>R</i>-amino acids to make them unassailable by the (<i>S</i>-amino acid-derived) enzymes used by higher organisms to hydrolyse peptides (see p. <a href="chapter_42.xhtml#page_1141">1141</a>).</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">For a perfumer or flavour and fragrance manufacturer, the distinction between the differently scented enantiomers of the same molecule is clearly of great importance. Nonetheless, we could all get by with caraway-flavoured toothpaste. Yet when it comes to drug molecules, making the right enantiomer can be a matter of life and death. Parkinson&#8217;s disease sufferers are treated with the non-proteinogenic amino acid dopa (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine). Dopa is chiral, and only (<i>S</i>)-dopa (known as L-dopa) is effective in restoring nerve function. (<i>R</i>)-Dopa is not only ineffective, it is quite toxic, so the drug must be marketed as a single enantiomer.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">In other cases, only one of the two enantiomers of a drug molecule possesses activity: the antidepressant citalopram and the painkiller naproxen are both marketed only as their <i>S</i> enantiomer because the <i>R</i> enantiomers are essentially inactive. In a few cases, the enantiomers both have activity, but in different ways: (+)-Darvon and (&#8211;)-Novrad are a painkiller and a cough suppressant, respectively.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">It is not only drugs that have to be manufactured enantiomerically pure. This simple lactone is the pheromone released by the Japanese beetle <i>Popilia japonica</i> as a means of communication. The beetles, whose larvae are serious crop pests, are attracted by the pheromone, and synthetic pheromone is marketed as &#8216;Japonilure&#8217; to bait beetle traps. Provided the synthetic pheromone is the stereoisomer shown, with the <i>Z</i> double bond and the <i>R</i> configuration at the stereogenic centre, only 25 &#956;g per trap catches thousands of beetles. You met this compound in <a href="chapter_27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, where we pointed out that double bond stereocontrol is important since the <i>E</i> isomer of the pheromone is virtually useless as a bait (it retains only about 10% of the activity). Even more important is control over the configuration at the chiral centre because the <i>S</i> enantiomer of the pheromone is not only inactive in attracting the beetles, but acts as a powerful inhibitor of the <i>R</i> enantiomer&#8212;even 1% of <i>S</i> enantiomer in a sample of pheromone destroys the activity.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">So you see why chemists need to be able to make compounds as single enantiomers. In Chapters 32 and 33 we looked at <i>relative stereochemistry</i> and how to control it; this chapter is about how to control <i>absolute stereochemistry</i>. We call this asymmetric synthesis.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:73%;">In the last 25 years or so, this subject has occupied more organic chemists than possibly any other, and we are now at a point where it is not only possible (and in fact essential because of strict regulatory rules) to make many drug molecules as single enantiomers, but it is also even possible to make many chiral molecules that are indigenous to nature more cheaply in the laboratory. By 2007, for example, at least 30% of the world&#8217;s supply of menthol was not extracted from plants but made synthetically. A thousand tonnes of (&#8211;)-menthol a year is made by the company Takasago in Japan using the techniques of asymmetric synthesis that you will meet later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">The chiral pool: Nature&#8217;s chiral centres &#8216;off the shelf&#8217;</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:73%;">When we first introduced you to enantiomers and chirality in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, we stressed that any imbalance in enantiomers always derives ultimately from nature. A laboratory synthesis of a chiral compound from achiral or racemic starting materials alone always gives a racemic mixture of enantiomers. If you want to make just one enantiomer, you have to use a starting material or reagent which is also just one enantiomer. This seems like a chicken-and-egg situation, until you realize that nature provides a collection of &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; enantiomerically pure compounds that we can exploit in various ways. This collection of natural, enantiomerically pure compounds is called the <b>chiral pool</b>. The principal groups of compounds in the chiral pool are:</p>
<ol class="decimal" style="width:70%;">
<li><span class="maxblue2"><b>1.</b></span> The amino acids. There is a full list of the natural amino acids found in proteins on p. <a href="chapter_23.xhtml#page_554">554</a>, but for the purposes of this chapter you should make sure you are familiar with the structures below. They all have simple side chains that are simple alkyl groups or functionalized chains with plenty of versatile chemistry, and can be obtained by hydrolysis of protein.</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<ol class="decimal" style="width:70%;">
<li><span class="maxblue2"><b>2.</b></span> Simple derivatives of the amino acids: amino alcohols and hydroxy acids. It&#8217;s easy to reduce amino acids to amino alcohols with borane (BH<sub>3</sub>), usually generated in the reaction mixture by treating sodium borohydride with concentrated sulfuric acid. We will use a number of naturally derived amino alcohols as starting materials in this chapter.</li>
</ol>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1105-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Ephedrine is an amino alcohol which is itself a useful member of the chiral pool&#8212;it&#8217;s a plant extract readily available as either diastereoisomer (see p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_314">314</a>), each, unusually, also available as either enantiomer.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">It&#8217;s also easy to make hydroxy acids from amino acids by diazotization. You saw this being done in <a href="chapter_33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>, but as a reminder nitrous acid generates a diazonium salt, which undergoes substitution by water via an intermediate &#945;-lactone. Two configurational inversions are involved, so the product alcohol retains <i>S</i> stereochemistry.</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> Look back at p. <a href="chapter_33.xhtml#page_875">875</a> for more on the mechanism of this transformation&#8212;it&#8217;s very important that the reaction goes with overall <i>retention</i> of stereochemistry.</p>
</aside>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1105-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Some hydroxy acids are themselves available from nature, and are therefore also members of the chiral pool: both (<i>R</i>)- and <i>(S</i>)-lactic acid, for example, can be made by bacterial fermentation; mandelic, malic, and tartaric acids are extracted from almonds, apples, and grapes, respectively.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1105-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> The concept of <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> rotational symmetry is discussed on p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_320">320</a>. <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry is compatible with chirality.

<li><span class="maxblue2"><b>3.</b></span> Carbohydrates and their derivatives. There are a great many simple carbohydrates available, but one of the most useful is mannose. Reduction to the alcohol gives the <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-symmetric compound mannitol, which can be converted to a useful aldehyde by selective protection as a bis-acetal with acetone and a Lewis acid. Cleavage of the remaining diol with sodium periodate gives two equivalents of a useful protected form of glyceraldehyde.</li>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In this chapter we will show you the many and varied ways in which members of the chiral pool can be put to work in asymmetric synthesis, but the most straightforward application is simply to spot that a target molecule has a close structural similarity with, say, an amino acid. This is what Mori did when he made another important insect pheromone, ipsenol. The left-hand half of the molecule has the same structure as the side chain of leucine, and the <i>S</i> chiral centre can also come from (<i>S</i>)-leucine.<a class="page" id="page_1106">Page 1106, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1106-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Mori used (<i>S</i>)-leucine as the starting material and converted it to the (<i>S</i>)-hydroxy acid by the method on p. <a href="chapter_33.xhtml#page_875">875</a>. The hydroxyl group was protected as the THP derivative (<a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1106-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Reduction of the acid, via the ester, then allowed introduction of the tosylate leaving group, which was displaced to make an epoxide. The epoxide was opened by a Grignard reagent to introduce the diene portion and give the target molecule.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1106-03.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> This drawback is highlighted in the synthesis of oseltamivir in <a href="chapter_43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a> (p. <a href="chapter_43.xhtml#page_1174">1174</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This might seem rather long-winded, and long-windedness can be a drawback of syntheses starting from the chiral pool: you have to shoe-horn your synthetic route into the available starting materials. Another drawback of syntheses starting from the chiral pool is the fact that many natural compounds are only available as one enantiomer or, if both enantiomers are available, one is much more expensive than the other. You will see some ingenious ways of circumventing this problem later in the chapter, but we deal with a very simple one in the next section.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Resolution can be used to separate enantiomers</h3>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> We will not explain resolution again here: turn to p. <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#page_322">322</a> for the details.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> we introduced you to resolution as a means of separating enantiomers. Resolution requires an enantiomerically pure resolving agent, which must be a compound from the chiral pool or a simple derivative of that compound. When the Swiss company Cilag wanted one enantiomer of the unusual chiral amino acid in the margin in order to make some potential drug candidates, the chemists there decided the easiest way to get hold of it quickly and in large quantities was to make it in racemic form and then resolve it. It turned out that one of the two enantiomers of the protected derivative below forms a crystalline salt with cheap, readily available (&#8211;)-ephedrine, while the other remains in solution. Filtration and treatment with acid to remove the protecting group and protonate the acid gave them a single enantiomer of their target amino acid.<a class="page" id="page_1107">Page 1107, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1107-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Of course, with resolution, there is a maximum yield of 50% because if you only want one enantiomer, the other is wasted. But there are many cases where you might want <i>both</i> enantiomers. You may need to test them both for biological activity, for example. In that case, resolution is ideal&#8212;in the example above the chemists at Cilag could get hold of the other enantiomer of the amino acid just by evaporating the mother liquors from the recrystallization. This is a big advantage of resolution: it lets you get both enantiomers using just one compound from the chiral pool.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Chiral auxiliaries</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">In <a href="chapter_33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> we showed you methods for making single diastereosiomers using diastereoselective reactions. Diastereoselective reactions work just as well whether the starting material is racemic or enantiomerically pure&#8212;you get the same diastereoisomeric outcome in each case, but if you start with racemic material you get racemic product and if you start with enantiomerically pure material you get enantiomerically pure product. Here&#8217;s an example, from p. <a href="chapter_33.xhtml#page_867">867</a>:</p>
<figure style="width:80%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1107-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">So if you use a starting material from the chiral pool, you can build new chiral centres in enantiomerically pure form just by using diastereoselective reactions. We showed you two syntheses at the end of <a href="chapter_33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> using this idea: the chiral pool starting materials (<i>S</i>)-lactic acid and (<i>S</i>)-serine were converted to two natural products using a series of diastereoselective reactions to introduce further chiral centres into the molecules.</p>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>

Chiral auxiliaries are extremely versatile because they can be used to make a whole variety of target molecules in enantiomerically pure form.

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">We have introduced you to this chiral auxiliary before any other because it is more commonly used than any other. It is a member of the oxazolidinone (the name of the heterocyclic ring) family of auxiliaries developed by David Evans at Harvard University, and is easily and cheaply made from the amino acid (<i>S</i>)-valine. Even though it is cheap, it can be recycled. The last step of the route above regenerates the auxiliary ready for re-use.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The most versatile chiral auxiliaries should also be available as both enantiomers. For the valine-derived one here, this is not the case&#8212;(<i>R</i>)-valine is quite expensive since it is not found in nature. However, by starting with the naturally occurring (and cheap) compound norephedrine, we can make an auxiliary that, although not enantiomeric with the one derived from (<i>S</i>)-valine, acts as though it were.</p>

Evans&#8217;s oxazolidinone auxiliaries are particularly appropriate here because they are readily turned into enolizable carboxylic acid derivatives.

The problem with less than perfect diastereoselectivity is that, when the chiral auxiliary is removed, the final product is contaminated with some of the other enantiomer. A 94:6 ratio of diastereoisomers will result in a 94:6 ratio of enantiomers, or a sample of 94:6 e.r. (e.r. for enantiomeric ratio).</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Enantiomeric excess</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Compounds that are neither racemic nor enantiomerically pure are usually called <i>enantiomerically enriched</i>. Chemists have two ways of referring to the ratio of enantiomers in an enantiomerically enriched sample. The first is the simple one we have just used: e.r. or enantiomeric ratio, expressed as two numbers adding to 100. More common, however, is to express this ratio as an <i>enantiomeric excess</i>. Enantiomeric excess (or ee) is defined as the excess of one enantiomer over the other, expressed as a percentage of the whole. So a 94:6 mixture of enantiomers consists of one enantiomer in 88% excess over the other, and we call it an enantiomerically enriched mixture with 88% ee. Why not just say that we have 94% of one enantiomer? Enantiomers are not like other isomers because they are simply mirror images. The 6% of the minor enantiomer can be paired with 6% of the major isomer to form a race-mic mixture amounting to 12% of the total. The mixture contains 12% racemate and 88% of one enantiomer, hence 88% ee.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;"><a class="page" id="page_1111">Page 1111, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We will see shortly how we can make further use of the chiral auxiliary to increase the ee of the reaction products. But first, we should consider how to measure ee. One way is simply to measure the angle through which the sample rotates plane-polarized light. The angle of rotation is approximately proportional to the enantiomeric excess of the sample (see box). The problem with this method is that to measure an actual value for ee you need to know what rotation a sample of 100% ee gives, and that is not always possible. Also, polarimeter measurements are notoriously unreliable&#8212;they depend on temperature, solvent, and concentration, and are subject to massive error due to small amounts of highly optically active impurities.</p>
<div class="maxbluea" style="width:70%;">
<h4 class="maxh4a">Is optical rotation proportional to enantiomeric excess?</h4>
<p class="maxnoindent">Imagine you have a sample, A, of an enantiomerically pure compound&#8212;a natural product perhaps&#8212;and, using a polarimeter, you find that it has an [&#945;]<sub>D</sub> of +10.0. Another sample, B, of the same compound, which you know to be <i>chemically</i> pure (perhaps it is a synthetic sample), shows an [&#945;]<sub>D</sub> of +8.0. What is its enantiomeric excess? Well, you would have got the same value of 8.0 for the [&#945;]<sub>D</sub> of B if you had mixed 80% of your enantiomerically pure sample A with 20% of a racemic (or achiral) compound with no optical rotation. Since you know that sample B is chemically pure, and is the same compound as A, it must therefore indeed consist of 80% enantiomerically pure material plus 20% racemic material, or 80% of one enantiomer plus 20% of a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers&#8212;which is the same as 90% of one enantiomer and 10% of the other, or 80% enantiomeric excess. Optical rotations can give a guide to enantiomeric excess&#8212;sometimes called <i>optical purity</i> in this context&#8212;but slight impurities of compounds with large rotations can distort the result and there are some examples where the linear relationship between ee and optical rotation fails because of what is known as the Horeau effect. You can read more about this in Eliel and Wilen, <i>Stereochemistry of organic compounds</i>, Wiley, 1994.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Chemists now usually use chromatography, or occasionally spectroscopy, to quantify ratios of enantiomers. You may think that this should be impossible&#8212;since enantiomers are chemically identical and have identical NMR spectra, how can chromatography or spectroscopy tell them apart? Well, again, they are identical <i>unless they are in a chiral environment</i>. We introduced HPLC on a chiral stationary phase as a way of separating enantiomers preparatively in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>. The same method can be used analytically&#8212;less than a milligram of chiral compound can be passed down a narrow column containing silica modified which a chiral additive. One enantiomer passes through the silica faster than the other; the two enantiomers are separated and the quantity of each can be measured (usually by UV absorption or by refractive index changes) and an ee derived. Gas chromatography can be used in the same way&#8212;the columns are packed with a chiral stationary phase such as the isoleucine derivative shown in the margin.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Distinguishing enantiomers spectroscopically relies again on putting them into a chiral environment. One way of doing this, if the compound is, say, an alcohol or an amine, is to make a derivative (an ester or an amide) with an enantiomerically pure and racemization-proof acyl chloride. The one most commonly used is known as Mosher&#8217;s acyl chloride, after its inventor Harry Mosher, although there are many others. The two enantiomers of the alcohol or amine now become diastereoisomeric esters, and give different sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum&#8212;the integrals can be used to determine ee and, although the 1H NMR of such a mixture of diastereoisomers may become quite cluttered because it is a mixture, the presence of the CF<sub>3</sub> group means that the ratio can alternatively be measured by integrating the two singlets in the otherwise featureless plain of the 19F NMR spectrum.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Another powerful method of discriminating between enantiomers is to add an enantiomerically pure compound to the NMR sample that simply forms a complex with the compound under investigation. The complexes formed from the two opposite enantiomers are diastereoisomeric, and therefore have different chemical shifts and, by integrating the NMR signals, the ratio of enantiomers can be determined. Among the most commonly used is this alcohol, 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(9-anthryl)ethanol, or TFAE, which can both hydrogen-bond to and form &#960;-stacked complexes with a range of functionalized compounds, and often splits NMR signals due to enantiomeric compounds very cleanly.<a class="page" id="page_1112">Page 1112, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Time to go back to chiral auxiliaries. We pointed out that, although we want to get maximum levels of stereoselectivity in our chiral-auxiliary-controlled reaction, we may still have a small percentage of a minor diastereoisomer, which, once we have removed our chiral auxiliary, will compromise the ee of our final product. It is at this point that we can use a trick that essentially employs the chiral auxiliary in a secondary role as a resolving agent. Provided the products are crystalline, it will usually be possible to recrystallize our 94:6 mixture of diastereoisomers to give essentially a single diastereoisomer, rather like carrying out a resolution with an enormous head start. Once this has been done, the chiral auxiliary can be removed and the product may be very close to 100% ee. Of course, the recrystallization sacrifices a few percentage points of yield, but these are invariably much less valuable than the few percentage points of ee gained! Here is an example from the work of Evans himself. During his synthesis of the complex antibiotic X-206 he needed large quantities of the small molecule below. He decided to make it by a chiral-auxiliary-controlled allylation, followed by reduction to give the alcohol. The auxiliary needed is the one derived from norephedrine, and the reaction of the enolate with allyl iodide gives a 98:2 mixture of diastereoisomers. However, recrystallization converts this into an 83% yield of a single diastereoisomer in &#62;99% purity, giving material of essentially 100% ee after removal of the auxiliary.</p>

But is it also possible for enantioselective reactions to be controlled by chiral <i>reagents</i>. For example, a typical achiral base will just remove a proton from a substrate, but an enantiomerically pure chiral base can select one of two enantiotopic protons and form a product enantioselectively. The product of course has to be chiral, so we can&#8217;t use a chiral base to make planar enolates enantioselectively, for example, but we can a chiral base to make chiral organolithiums.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Alkyllithiums are sufficiently strong as bases to remove the protons adjacent to the nitrogen atom of <i>N</i>-Boc pyrrolidine, shown in the margin. The product of deprotonation is an organolithium which is a chiral molecule: the lithium-bearing carbon is chiral.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Alkyllithiums can be turned into chiral bases in quite a simple way&#8212;by complexation with a chiral ligand. A widely used example is the tetracyclic diamine (&#8211;)-sparteine. Sparteine&#8217;s structure looks complex, but it is a relatively widely available natural product which folds around the lithium atom of an alkyllithium and places the base in a chiral environment.</p>

The most common prochiral units that give rise to new chiral centres are the trigonal carbon atoms of alkenes and carbonyl groups, which become tetrahedral by addition reactions. In the last section you saw a prochiral, tetrahedral CH<sub>2</sub> group becoming a chiral organolithium by enantioselective removal of one enantiotopic proton. Much more common are the reactions you saw in the section before that, where in every case a prochiral alkene (we can count enolates as alkenes for this purpose) reacted selectively on one face because of the influence of the chiral auxiliary, which made the faces of the alkene diastereotopic.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Catalytic asymmetric reduction of ketones</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">One of the simplest transformations you could imagine of a prochiral unit into a chiral one is the reduction of a ketone. Although chiral auxiliary strategies have been used to make this type of reaction asymmetric, conceptually the simplest way of getting the product as a single enantiomer would be to use a chiral reducing agent&#8212;in other words, to attach the chiral influence not to the <i>substrate</i> (as we did with chiral auxiliaries) but to the <i>reagent</i>. We need an asymmetric version of NaBH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">One of the more widely used solutions to this challenge is the chiral borohydride analogue invented by Itsuno in Japan and developed by Corey, Bakshi, and Shibata. It is based on a stable boron heterocycle made from an amino alcohol derived from proline (see the box below for the synthesis), and is known as the CBS catalyst after its developers. The active reducing agent is generated when the heterocycle forms a complex with borane. Only catalytic amounts (usually about 10%) of the boron heterocycle are needed because borane is sufficiently reactive to reduce ketones only when complexed with the nitrogen atom. The rest of the borane just waits until a molecule of catalyst becomes free.</p>

<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> The fact that the reactions are catalytic in the heterocycle means that relatively little is needed. Note the distinction from chiral auxiliaries here: although auxiliaries are recoverable, they always have to be used in stoichiometric quantities and recovery is usually a separate step. Later in the chapter you will see catalytic reactions that use 1000 times less catalyst than this one.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">CBS reductions are best when the ketone&#8217;s two substituents are well-differentiated sterically&#8212;just as Ph and Me are in the example above. The reaction works because the heterocyclic catalyst brings together the borane (which complexes to its basic nitrogen atom) and the carbonyl compound (which complexes to its Lewis-acidic boron atom). Complexation activates both partners towards reaction: donating electron density to the borane is essential to persuade it to transfer hydride, and withdrawing electron density from the carbonyl group makes it electrophilic enough to react with a weak hydride source. The hydride is delivered via a six-membered cyclic transition state, with the enantioselectivity arising from the preference of the larger of the ketone&#8217;s two substituents (R<sub>L </sub>) for the pseudoequatorial position on this ring.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Until recently, the CBS reagent was one of the most commonly used asymmetric reducing agents for ketones. But in the early years of the 21st century a new reaction has taken over that role&#8212;one in which the job of bringing together the ketone and the reducing agent is taken by an atom of ruthenium. The ruthenium is added as Ru(II) in a 16-electron complex (see p. <a href="chapter_41.xhtml#page_1116">1116</a>) with an aromatic compound such as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (known as mesitylene). A chiral ligand is needed&#8212;the diamine derivative shown here is best. Only very small amounts (often &#60;&#60; 1%) of the catalyst and ligand are required, which is a good thing as both are much more expensive than the reagents in the CBS reduction. The reducing agent itself can be hydrogen or, more conveniently, a more easily handled source of hydrogen atoms such as isopropanol (which gets oxidized to acetone) or formic acid (which gets oxidized to carbon dioxide). Here&#8217;s a typical example; we will explain how it works shortly.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The usual solution is to use one chiral molecule containing two phosphorus atoms, and the most important of these is BINAP. BINAP is a chelating diphosphine: the metal sits between the two phosphorus atoms, firmly anchored in a chiral environment.

<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Asymmetric <i>hydrogenation</i> of an alkene can create two new chiral centres, but introduces no new functionality as it does so. Asymmetric <i>oxidation</i> of an alkene is different: it can create two new chiral centres and two new functional groups at the same time. We will now look at two examples of asymmetric oxidation, both products of the laboratories of Professor Barry Sharpless.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The first of Sharpless&#8217;s reactions is an oxidation of alkenes by asymmetric epoxidation. You met vanadium as a transition-metal catalyst for epoxidation with <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide in <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>, and this new reaction makes use of titanium, as titanium tetraisopropoxide, Ti(O<i>i</i>-Pr)<sub>4</sub>, to do the same thing. Sharpless and his co-worker Tsutomu Katsuki surmised that by adding a chiral ligand to the titanium catalyst they might be able to make the reaction asymmetric. The ligand that works best is diethyl tartrate, and one example of the reaction is shown below.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Transition-metal-catalysed epoxidations work only on allylic alcohols, so this is a limitation of the method, but otherwise there are few restrictions on what can be epoxidized enantio-selectively, and when this reaction was discovered in 1981 it was by far the best asymmetric reaction known. Because of its importance, a lot of work went into discovering exactly how the reaction worked, and the scheme below shows what is believed to be the active complex, formed from two titanium atoms bridged by two tartrate ligands (shown in orange). Each titanium atom retains two of its isopropoxide ligands and is coordinated to one of the carbonyl groups of the tartrate ligand. The reaction works best if the titanium and tartrate are left to stir for a while so that these dimers can form cleanly. When the oxidizing agent (<i>t</i>-BuOOH, shown in green) is added to the mixture, it displaces one of the remaining isopropoxide ligands and one of the tartrate carbonyl groups.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">For this oxidizing complex to react with an allylic alcohol, the alcohol must become co ordinated to the titanium too, displacing a further isopropoxide ligand. Because of the shape of the complex the reactive oxygen atom of the bound hydroperoxide has to be delivered to the lower face of the alkene (as drawn), and the epoxide is formed in high enantiomeric excess. Displacement of the product by another molecule of hydroperoxide starts the cycle again.<a class="page" id="page_1121">Page 1121, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

Tartrate is ideal as a chiral ligand because it is available relatively cheaply as either enantiomer. L-tartrate is extracted from grapes; D-(&#8211;)-tartrate is rarer and more expensive, but still cheap by the standards of some of the bisphosphine ligands used in the last section.

You met the chiral beta-blocker drug propranolol in <a href="chapter_28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>, and its 1,2,3-substitution pattern makes it a good candidate for synthesis using asymmetric epoxidation.<a class="page" id="page_1122">Page 1122, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Unfortunately, the obvious starting material, allyl alcohol itself, gives an epoxide that is hard to handle, so Sharpless, who carried out this synthesis of propranolol, used this silicon-substituted allylic alcohol instead. The hydroxyl group was mesylated and displaced with 1-naphthoxide and, after treatment with fluoride to remove the silicon, the epoxide was opened with isopropylamine.</p>

The benzylic end of the epoxide is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, and in the presence of Ti(O<i>i</i>-Pr)<sub>4</sub>, this time simply acting as a Lewis acid, the lithiated heterocycle opens the epoxide with inversion of configuration.</p>

The &#8216;other additives&#8217; include K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and methanesulfonamide (MeSO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), which increases the rate of the reaction by regenerating the catalyst at the end of each catalytic cycle.</p>

Sharpless chose some available chiral tertiary amines as ligands, and it turned out that the best ones are based on the alkaloids dihydroquinidine and dihydroquinine, whose structures are shown below. They coordinate to the osmium through the green nitrogen atom.<a class="page" id="page_1124">Page 1124, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The reason for this must come from the way in which the substrate interacts with the osmium&#8211;ligand complex. However, the detailed mechanism of the asymmetric dihydroxylation is still far from clear-cut. What is known is that the ligand forms some sort of &#8216;chiral pocket&#8217;, like an enzyme active site, with the osmium sitting at the bottom of it. Alkenes can only approach the osmium if they are correctly aligned in the chiral pocket, and steric hindrance forces the alignment shown in the scheme above. The analogy with an enzyme active site goes even further, since it appears that part of the pocket is &#8216;attractive&#8217; to aromatic or strongly hydrophobic groups. This part appears to accommodate R<sub>L</sub>, part of the reason why the selectivity in the dihydroxylation of <i>trans</i>-stilbene is so high.<a class="page" id="page_1125">Page 1125, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The asymmetric dihydroxylation is much less fussy about the alkenes it will oxidize than Sharpless&#8217; asymmetric epoxidation. Osmium tetroxide itself is a remarkable reagent, since it oxidizes more or less any sort of alkene, electron-rich or electron-poor, and the same is true of the asymmetric dihydroxylation reagent. The following example illustrates both this and a synthetic use for the diol product.</p>

Cyclic sulfates behave like epoxides, and this one opens easily with azide at the more reactive position adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Sharpless epoxidation works only with allylic alcohols, and Jacobsen epoxidation performs poorly here, giving only 70&#8211;74% ee (mainly because the substrate is not a <i>cis</i> alkene). However, asymmetric dihydroxylation saves the day with 98% ee and around 90% yield, and a variant of the reaction we have just shown you gives the epoxide, also in 90% yield&#8212;well worth the extra step.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Ligand-accelerated catalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">Asymmetric dihydroxylation is such a good reaction not just because of the careful way in which the ligands have been designed. It is a good reaction for a more fundamental reason: the reaction on which it is based (osmium-catalysed dihydroxylation) works only very poorly in the absence of the amine ligand. The chiral amine ligands don&#8217;t just provide a chiral environment, they accelerate the reaction at the same time. This is what we mean by &#8216;ligand accelerated catalysis&#8217;.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">In any asymmetric reaction, we want the reagents to combine with one another only in the presence of the asymmetric influence provided by the chiral ligands. If the reaction works anyway, even without the chiral ligands, we have an uphill struggle because the reagents are quite capable of producing racemic product on their own. Racemic &#8216;background&#8217; reactions are the reason why many of the reactions you are familiar with because they work so well racemically&#8212;addition of Grignard reagents to aldehydes, for example&#8212;don&#8217;t really have good asymmetric versions.

If the products of such an addition are chiral they are of course racemic. How might we make such a reaction enantioselective? One way would be to exploit the idea of ligand-accelerated catalysis and use a reaction which really doesn&#8217;t work very well in the racemic series.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This is the case when the organometallic reagent is a dialkylzinc. Diethylzinc is commercially available as a solution in toluene or hexane, but it reacts only very slowly with an aldehyde if the two are just left to stir together. However, if a chiral amino alcohol is added, the reaction becomes much faster. The amino alcohol forms a zinc alkoxide in the reaction mixture, and the coordination of this anionic chiral ligand to zinc both accelerates the transfer of zinc&#8217;s alkyl groups to the aldehyde and makes that transfer enantioselective.<a class="page" id="page_1127">Page 1127, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

We can again exploit the low reactivity of organozinc compounds with carbonyl compounds, and with alkenes, if we add a catalytic amount of copper and a chiral phosphorus-containing ligand based on the atropisomeric binaphthyl structure you saw in BINAP. The organozinc has to transmetallate to the organocopper in order to react, and the copper always remains bound to the chiral ligand. Conjugate addition can only take place in a chiral environment, and good ees result.</p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Organocatalysis</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">It will not have escaped your notice that most of the reactions we have presented in this chapter have made use of metals. Metals have labile coordination sites that can carry chiral ligands at the same time as they allow substrates and reagents to meet together in a chiral environment and then let the products dissociate so that the catalytic cycle can proceed. But in the early years of the 21st century, several chemists around the world realized that it is not always necessary to use a metal to initiate high levels of enantioselectivity in catalytic reactions. Simple chiral and enantiomerically pure organic molecules, many of them amines, can also react reversibly with substrates, providing a chiral environment and simultaneously activating them towards enantio selective attack.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Here is an example, which picks up where we left off: a catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition. As you know from <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, aldehydes and ketones react with secondary amines to form enamines, via iminium ions. But this unsaturated aldehyde can&#8217;t form an enamine because the iminium ion that is generated by condensation with the cyclic secondary amine cannot lose a proton. The iminium ion is the end of the line for this condensation: it is very reactive towards attack by water (which would reversibly regenerate starting materials), but also towards attack by other nucleophiles. We have just what we want for good asymmetric catalysis&#8212;an intermediate species that is reactive, chiral, and enantiomerically pure.<a class="page" id="page_1128">Page 1128, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

A pyrrole will do: pyrroles react well with cations. The phenyl ring highlighted in green hangs over the front of the molecule so the pyrrole has no choice but to attack diastereoselectively, from behind. The product is an enamine, which in the acid conditions of the reaction is hydrolysed by the water generated in the initial condensation, revealing the aldehyde in enantiomerically enriched form (93% ee) and regenerating the secondary amine catalyst.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This catalyst and strategy were invented by the Glaswegian chemist David MacMillan at the California Institute of Technology (now at Princeton in New Jersey) and given the name &#8216;organocatalysis&#8217;. Organocatalysis makes use of small organic molecules to achieve catalytic asymmetric transformations, and can be distinguished from the more widespread methods of catalysis which typically use metals. We&#8217;ll introduce another type of organocatalysis towards the end of the chapter, but before we move on it&#8217;s worth looking at this amine catalyst and the way it works in a little more detail.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The geminal dimethyl group highlighted in orange above is also important to the functioning of the catalyst. Without it, there is clearly a danger that the pyrrole will add directly to the C=N bond of the iminium ion, a reaction that would kill the catalyst because the product is an amine and not an enamine. The methyl groups on both faces of the iminium C=N bond stop this happening. The other thing it ensures is the geometry of the iminium C=N bond. This bond is <i>trans</i> so that the alkene can keep away from the quaternary carbon bearing the two orange groups; the benzyl group with the green phenyl may be bigger in terms of total number of atoms, but there is more space for the alkene on that side because the nearest carbon also carries just an H atom. Why is the geometry of the imine important? Well, if any of it were <i>cis</i>, it would present the other face to the pyrrole and would be likely to give the opposite enantiomer of product.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Catalysts aren&#8217;t used in such great quantities as chiral auxiliaries, and so in general their synthesis does not need to be quite so direct. Nonetheless as you can see from the examples here, organocatalysts are still generally used in much greater quantities (10&#8211;20 mol%) than some of the best metal catalysts. In this case you should be able to spot that the left-hand portion of the cyclic amine is a derivative of <small>L</small>-phenylalanine. Condensation of its <i>N</i>-methyl amide with an equivalent of acetone gives the catalyst itself.<a class="page" id="page_1129">Page 1129, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Asymmetric aldol reactions</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">You saw in <a href="chapter_33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> that it is possible to use aldol reactions to create two new chiral centres in a single step, and that the relative stereochemistry of the two chiral centres depends in many cases on the geometry of the enolate used to do the aldol reaction. The power of an <i>asymmetric</i> aldol reaction is easy to see: it creates two new chiral centres with control over their absolute stereochemistry, and also constructs a new C&#8211;C bond. What is more, the products of aldol reactions are very common features in a huge number of natural products known as polyketides&#8212;as you will see in the next chapter, polyketides are made by living things using a series of successive enzyme-controlled aldol reactions.</p>
<h4 class="maxh4">Chiral auxiliary-controlled aldol reactions: the Evans aldol</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">An aldol reaction is the addition of an enolate to an electrophile, where the electrophile is an aldehyde or a ketone. You have already seen earlier in this chapter how enolates can be used to make new C&#8211;C bonds enantioselectively when we explained how to control enolate alkylation with Evans&#8217; chiral auxiliaries. Evans&#8217; auxiliaries also provide one of the most straightforward ways of carrying out asymmetric aldol reactions, and we will start with an example before explaining how asymmetric aldol reactions can be done using catalytic methods.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This aldol reaction is carried out using a base (triethylamine) and dibutylboron triflate plus benzaldehyde. The aldol product is formed with outstandingly good selectivity and in high yield, and all that remains is to remove the auxiliary with base and isolate the hydroxy-acid as a single diastereoisomer and a single enantiomer.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1129-02.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Aldol reactions using the lithium enolate of the acylated auxiliary shown here fail to give good selectivities, so instead we use the boron enolate. The combination of triethylamine and the boron triflate form the stable boron enolate, whch has to be <i>cis</i> because the size of the auxiliary prevents the <i>trans</i> enolate forming. Boron has an empty p orbital, and donation into this orbital from the oxygen of the carbonyl group stabilizes the enolate.<a class="page" id="page_1130">Page 1130, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_1130-01.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Now the aldehyde is added. If the reaction is to take place, the aldehyde must coordinate to the boron because boron enolates aren&#8217;t reactive enough to attack aldehydes unless they are activated by coordination to a Lewis acid. However, the aldehyde can&#8217;t simply coordinate to the boron atom of the enolate because then the boron will end up with five bonds, which is impossible for a first-row element. So, if the reaction is to continue, the boron has to let go of the auxiliary&#8217;s carbonyl group and coordinate to the aldehyde instead.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">At this stage something rather remarkable happens: now that the boron is no longer holding the two oxygen atoms of the enolate close together, repulsion between them (they are both electron-rich atoms) forces the auxiliary part of the enolate to swing round through 180&#176; and end up pointing in the opposite direction. This is highly significant for what happens next because you can see from the last structure in the scheme above that this rotation ends up swinging the isopropyl group of the auxiliary round to the underside of the enolate and therefore forcing the auxiliary to react from the front instead of the back.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The diagrams below continue the story. The aldehyde has to attack the front face of the auxiliary, but it also has to do so through what we termed in <a href="chapter_33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> a &#8216;Zimmerman&#8211; Traxler transition state&#8217;&#8212;a six-membered, chair-like cyclic structure which allows the enolate to attack the aldehyde while simultaneously transferring the metal (here the boron) from the enolate oxygen to the new hydroxyl group.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">All the usual advantages and disadvantages of chiral auxiliaries apply here: the products are formed in very high selectivity and can be purified to high ee, but the extra steps required to introduce and remove the auxiliary may compromise the overall yield and efficiency of the reaction. Nonetheless, using this method and many others like it, it has now become possible routinely to make polyketide natural products by successive aldol reactons, mimicking nature&#8217;s approach to these compounds. In a spectacular demonstration of the power of synthetic chemistry to outperform natural sources, chemists at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis made 60 g of the anticancer compound discodermolide by a synthetic route, including five aldol reactions. Four of these, shown by black C&#8211;C bonds in the structure below, used the aldol or alkylation reactions controlled by Evans&#8217; oxazolidinone chiral auxiliaries. To obtain the same quantity from the natural source, the sponge <i>Discodermia</i>, is impossible: the sponge produces minuscule amounts of discodermolide and can be harvested only by using manned submersible vehicles, at some cost to the marine environment.<a class="page" id="page_1131">Page 1131, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<h4 class="maxh4">Aldol reactions catalysed by proline</h4>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">A variety of catalytic ways of doing asymmetric aldol reactions have also been invented, but space prevents us discussing all but one. This one we highlight firstly because it illustrates the use of a supremely simple biologically derived compound to catalyse a complex reaction, and secondly because this discovery was part of the revolution in catalytic thinking which launched the field of organocatalysis in the early years of the 21st century.</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> You saw the racemic example of this Robinson annelation on p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_638">638</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The catalyst we will use is the amino acid L-proline&#8212;no derivatization or protection required. It was actually back in 1971 that it was first noted that L-proline will catalyse asymmetric aldols, but until the year 2000 examples were limited to this one cyclization. Treatment of a triketone with proline leads to selective cyclization onto one of the two enantiotopic carbonyl groups. A molecule of proline must condense with the least hindered ketone, and in this case an enamine (rather than an iminium ion) can form. The chiral enamine can select to react with only one of the two other carbonyl groups, and it turns out that it chooses with rather high selectivity the one coloured green in the scheme below. Cyclization, in the manner of a Robinson annelation, and hydrolysis of the resulting iminium ion follow on, releasing the molecule of L-proline to start another catalytic cycle. The isolated product is the bicyclic ketone, in 93% ee.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">This remained an oddity of a reaction until 2000, when chemists at the Scripps Institute in California, and then others around the world, took the simple expedient of adding L-proline to many other aldol reactions, with considerable success. With care, excellent results can be obtained. Here is an example.</p>

<div class="maxgreen">
<p class="maxnoindentl"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_square.jpg" alt="images"/> It has an odd name too: the cyclization is sometimes called the Hajos&#8211;Parrish&#8211;Eder&#8211;Sauer&#8211; Wiechert reaction, after its discoverers, but only by those who want to impress their friends.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">You will remember from <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> that crossed aldol reactions between enolizable partners, like these, usually need one of the reagents to be converted to an enolate equivalent to ensure selective reaction. Here, the acetone is in excess, but the components are just stirred together at room temperature in DMSO! The key to success is that one of the two components must be more able to form a reactive enamine with proline than the other. In the case above, the acetone-derived enamine is favoured because (1) enamine formation is reversible, (2) the acetone is in excess, and (3) the enamine from acetone is less hindered and more reactive than the enamine that would arise from the aldehyde.</p>

<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;"><a class="page" id="page_1132">Page 1132, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the aldol reaction itself, proline&#8217;s carboxyl group has a key role to play because it can participate in a hydrogen bond that organizes the six-membered transition state in such a way that only one of the possible enantiomeric products can form. The diagram below shows how. Water generated in the initial condensation hydrolyses the iminium product of the aldol and regenerates the proline catalyst.</p>

</aside>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Organocatalytic aldol reactions also work well with hydroxylated ketones&#8212;the reaction below, for example. In this case, the enamine forms with an <i>E</i> double bond, which means that the hydroxyl group has to be equatorial on the six-membered transition state. You should be able to work out from this that the <i>anti</i> aldol has to form.</p>

<h3 class="maxh3">Enzymes as catalysts</h3>
<p class="maxnoindenta" style="width:70%;">We pointed out at the beginning of the chapter that all enantiomeric purity must ultimately derive from nature. We have almost come full circle: the reactions we have just been looking at use one of nature&#8217;s protein building blocks, L-proline, directly as a catalyst. Even more intriguingly, the reaction just above, which forms a ketodiol, is extremely reminiscent of the aldol reactions which nature uses to build carbohydrates, as you will see in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Yet nature does not use single amino acids to catalyse asymmetric reactions, it uses enzymes. Enzymes are vastly more efficient than L-proline and catalyse a much wider range of reactions, but while they are also much more complicated, their reactivity derives ultimately from the amino acids they are made up of.</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Life uses enzymes to catalyse asymmetric reactions, so the question is&#8212;can chemists? The answer is yes, and there are many enzymes that can be produced in quantities large enough to be used in the catalytic synthesis of enantiomerically pure molecules. This field&#8212;known as biocatalysis&#8212;melds ideas in chemistry and biology, and we do not have the space here to discuss it in detail. We leave you with just one example: the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol with an enzyme known as a ketoreductase.</p>
<aside class="maxabc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="maxnoindentb"><img src="../images/he_0199270295_graphic_arrow.jpg" alt="images"/> The structure of NADPH is on p. <a href="chapter_42.xhtml#page_1150">1150</a>.</p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">The ketoreductase takes hydride from the reducing agent NADPH (which you will meet in the next chapter) and transfers it enantioselectively to the carbonyl group in the active site of the enzyme. This ketoreductase, isolated from yeast, may never have met this non-biological substrate&#8212;benzoyloxyacetone&#8212;before, but the reaction works. In fact this sort of reaction works so well that ketoreductases are used to carry out the reduction needed to produce the pharmaceutical intermediate discussed on p. <a href="chapter_41.xhtml#page_1116">1116</a> on a 230 kg scale.<a class="page" id="page_1133">Page 1133, Chapter 41 Asymmetric synthesis</a></p>

<p class="maxnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="maxindent" style="width:70%;">Many other groups of enzymes behave similarly: they have evolved to take part in particular biochemical pathways, but they are sufficiently promiscuous that they will happily accept alternative substrates and provide chemically useful products from them. Enzymes are catalysts, like any other. In the next chapter, we take a more detailed look at those biochemical pathways and discuss the organic chemistry of life.</p>
