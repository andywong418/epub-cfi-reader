<p class="htwnoindent"><b>Cycloadditions</b>, the subject of the last chapter, are just one of the three main classes of peri- cyclic reaction. In this chapter we consider the other two classes: <b>sigmatropic rearrangements</b> and <b>electrocyclic reactions</b>. We will analyse them in a way that is similar to our dealings with cycloadditions.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_35.1">
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Sigmatropic rearrangements</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Claisen rearrangement was the first to be discovered</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The original sigmatropic rearrangement occurred when an aryl allyl ether was heated without solvent and an <i>ortho-allyl</i> phenol resulted. This is the Claisen rearrangement. The first step in this reaction is a pericyclic reaction of a type that you will learn to call a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"/> Interactive mechanism for aromatic
Claisen rearrangement</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This is a one-step mechanism without ionic 
intermediates or any charges, just like a cycloaddition. The arrows go round in a ring. The difference between this and a cycloaddition is that one of the arrows starts on a a bond instead of on a n bond. The second step in the reaction is a simple ionic proton transfer to regenerate aromaticity.</p>

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">How do we know that this is the mechanism? If the allyl ether is unsymmetrical, it turns 'inside out' during Claisen rearrangement, as required by the mechanism. Check for yourself that this is right.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_910_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The aliphatic Claisen rearrangement also occurs</b></h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_910_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwnoindent">It was later found that the same sort of reaction occurs without the aromatic ring. This is called either the aliphatic Claisen rearrangement or the </p>
<p class="htwindent1">All these reactions are called sigmatropic because a <i>a</i> bond appears to move from one place to another during the reaction. This particular reaction is called a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement because the new <i>a</i> bond has a 3,3 relationship to the old <i>a</i> bond. You can see this if you number both ends of the old <i>a</i> bond '1' and count round in both directions to the ends of the new <i>a</i> bond in the product. You will find that the ends of the new <i>a</i> bond both have the number '3'.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_910_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">These [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements happen through a chair-like transition state, which allows us both to get the orbitals right and to predict the stereochemistry (if any) of the new double bond. The orbitals look something like this.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_910_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Note that these do not represent any specific frontier orbitals, they simply show that, in this conformation, the new <i>a</i> bond is formed from two p orbitals that point directly at each other and that the two new <i>a</i> bonds are formed from orbitals that are already parallel.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Alkene stereochemistry in the Claisen rearrangement comes from a 
chair-like transition state</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Stereochemistry may arise if there is a substituent on the saturated carbon atom next to the oxygen atom. If there is, the resulting double bond strongly favours the <i>trans</i> (E) geometry. This is because the substituent prefers an equatorial position on the chair transition state.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_910_6.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a class="page" id="page_911"><b>Page 911, Chapter 35 Pericyclic reactions 2: sigmatropic and electrocyclic reactions</b></a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The substituent R prefers an equatorial position as the molecule reacts and R retains this position 
in the product. The new alkene bond is shown in green. Notice that the <i>trans</i> geometry of the alkene in the
 product is already there in the conformation chosen by the starting material and in the transition state.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_911_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The starting material for these aliphatic Claisen rearrangements consists of ethers with one 
allyl and one vinyl group. We need now to consider how such useful molecules might be made. There is no problem about
 the allyl half&#x2014;allylic alcohols are stable, easily made compounds. But what about the vinyl half? 'Vinyl 
alcohol' is just the enol of acetaldehyde (MeCHO).</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_911_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"/>&#160;Interactive aliphatic Claisen rearrangement mechanism</p>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The solution is to use an acetal of the aldehyde in an acid-catalysed exchange process with the
 allylic alcohol. It is not necessary to isolate the allyl vinyl ether as long as some of it is formed and rearranges
 into the final product.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_911_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The acid catalyst usually used, propanoic acid, has a conveniently high boiling point so that the 
whole mixture can be equilibrated at high temperature. The first step is an acetal exchange in which the allylic 
alcohol displaces methanol.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_911_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The methanol is distilled off as it is the most volatile of the components in this mixture.
 A second molecule of methanol is now lost in an acid-catalysed elimination reaction to give the vinyl group.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_911_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160; Note that the first molecule of methanol was displaced in an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction and the
 second lost in an E1 reaction. The chemistry of acetals is dominated by the loss of protonated OR or OH groups in the
 steps with green boxes. Never be tempted to write S<sub>n</sub>2 mechanisms with acetals.</p></div></aside>
<h3 class="h3">The Claisen rearrangement is a general synthesis of &#x01B3;.&#x03B4;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement itself can be carried out by heat as part of the same 
step or as a separate step depending on the compounds. This is a very flexible reaction sequence and can be used for
 aldehydes (as shown above), ketones, esters, or amides. In each case acetallike compounds are used&#x2014;acetals 
themselves for aldehydes and ketones; orthoesters and orthoamides for the other two (although the orthoamides are 
often called &#x2018;amide acetals&#x2018;).</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The common feature in the products of these Claisen rearrangements is a Y,8-unsaturated carbonyl 
group. If this is what you need in a synthesis, make it by a Claisen rearrangement.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Orbital descriptions of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">It is possible to give a frontier orbital description of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement but this
 is not a very satisfactory treatment because we don&#x2018;t have two separate reagents recognizing each other across 
space as we did in cycloadditions. There are <i>three</i> components in these reactions&#x2014;two non-conjugated n
 bonds that do have to overlap across space and a <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond in the chain joining the two &#x03C0;bonds. The Woodward-
Hoffmann rules give a more satisfying description and we shall follow the routine outlined on p. <a href="chapter_34.xhtml#page_892">892</a> for 
cycloadditions. Note that for stage 3, we can use the three-dimensional diagram we have already made.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">One new aspect of orbital symmetry has appeared in this diagram&#x2014;how did we deduce a or s 
symmetry in the way the <i>a</i> bond reacted? For &#x03C0; bonds it is simple&#x2014;if both bonds are formed on the same 
side of the old &#x03C0; bond, it has reacted suprafacially; if on opposite sides, antarafacially.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">With a <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond the symmetry is not so obvious. We want to know if it does the <i>
same</i> thing at each end (s) or a <i>different</i> thing (a). But what is the &#x2018;thing&#x2018; it does? It 
reacts using the large lobe of the sp<sup>3</sup> orbital (retention) or the small lobe (inversion). If it reacts 
with retention at both ends or inversion at both ends, it reacts suprafacially, while if it reacts with retention 
at one end and inversion at the other, it reacts antarafacially. There are four possibilities.</p>

rearrangements.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In the routine above, we chose to use our <i>a</i> bond so that we got inversion at one end and
 retention at the other. That was why we identified it as an antarafacial component. If we had chosen another style 
we should have got different descriptions of the components, but the reaction would still have been allowed, for 
example changing just one connecting line, as in the margin, changes the symmetry of the a bond so that it becomes a 
<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub> component but it also changes the symmetry of one of the n bonds so that it becomes a
 <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub> component. The net result is still only one component of the Woodward-Hoffmann symmetry,
 the sum is still 1, and the reaction still allowed.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">The direction of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Orbital symmetry tells us that [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements are allowed but says nothing 
about which way they will go. They are allowed in either direction. So why does the Claisen- Cope rearrangement always
 form the carbonyl-containing product? Think back to our discussion on enols (<a href="chapter_20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>) and you may recall that the
 combination of a carbonyl group and a C-C a bond made the keto form more stable than the enol form with its 
combination of a C&#x003D;C n bond and a C-O a bond. The same is true here. It is the stability of the carbonyl group
 that drives the reaction to the right.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Directing the Cope rearrangement by the formation of a carbonyl group</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with only carbon atoms in the ring.
 In its simplest version it is not a reaction at all. The starting material and the product are the same.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">We can drive this reaction too by the formation of a carbonyl group if we put an OH substituent in
 the right place.</p>

 is accelerated if the starting alcohol is treated with base (KH is the best) to make the alkoxide. The product is then 
the potassium enolate, which is more stable than the simple potassium alkoxide starting material. As the reaction 
proceeds, conjugation is growing between O<sup>-</sup> and the new n bond.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_914_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Some remarkable compounds can be made by this method. One of the strangest&#x2014;a &#x2018;
bridgehead&#x2018; alkene&#x2014;was made by a potassium alkoxide-accelerated Cope rearrangement in which a four-
membered ring was expanded into an eight-membered ring containing a <i>trans</i> double bond (shown in green).</p>

<p class="htwindent1">A combination of an oxygen atom in the ring and another one outside the ring is very powerful at 
promoting [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements and easy to arrange by making the lithium enolate of an ester of an allylic
 alcohol.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwindent1">Sometimes it is better to convert the lithium enolate into the silyl enol ether before heating to

work-up.</p>

Claisen rearrangement invented by R. E. Ireland in the 1970s and widely used since. If the substituents are suitably
 arranged, it shows the same <i>E</i> selectivity as the simple Claisen rearrangement and for the same reason.</p>

unstable starting material or a stable product. The instability might be strain and the stability might simply be more
 substituents on the double bonds. In the next reaction the driving force is the breaking of a weak <i>a</i> bond in a
 three-membered ring. This reaction goes in 100&#x0025; yield at only just above room temperature, so it is very 
favourable. In the second example, the trisubstituted double bonds inside the five-membered rings of the product are
more stable than the exomethylene groups in the starting material.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">&#x2018;Citral&#x2018; is a key intermediate in the synthesis of vitamin A, and it is manufactured
 by a remarkable process that involves two successive [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, a Claisen followed by a Cope.
 The allyl vinyl ether needed for the Claisen rearrangement is an enol ether of an unsaturated aldehyde with an 
unsaturated alcohol. The two starting materials are themselves derived from a common precursor, making this a most 
efficient process&#x0021; Heating the enol ether promotes [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement propelled by the formation

<h3 class="h3">Seaweed sex censored by a sigmatropic shift</h3>
<p class="htwdivi">In order to reproduce, the female gametes of marine brown algae must attract mobile male gametes. 
This they do by releasing a pheromone, long thought to be the cycloheptadiene ectocarpene. In 1995 results were
 published that sug-gested that, in fact, the pheromone was a cyclopropane, and that ectocarpene was ineffective as 
a pheromone.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_915_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwdivi">How had the confusion arisen? Well, the remarkable thing is that the cyclopropyl pheromone 
inactivates itself, with a half-life of several minutes at ambient temperature, by [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement
 to the cycloheptadiene, driven by release of strain from the three-membered ring. This not only confused the earlier
 pheromone chemists, but it also provides a marvellously precise way for the algae to signal their presence and 
readiness for reproduction without saturat-ing the sea water with meaningless pheromone.</p></div>

 oxidation can take place, but a kind of conjugate oxidation occurs.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The first step in Cr(VI) oxidations can take place to give a chromate ester but this intermediate
 has no proton to lose so it transfers the chromate to the other end of the allylic system, where there is a proton.
 The chromate transfer can be drawn as a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The final step is the normal oxidation in 
which chromium drops down from orange Cr(VI) to Cr(IV) and eventually by disproportionation to green Cr(III).</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">[2.3]-Sigmatropic rearrangements</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">All [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements have six-membered cyclic transition states. It is no accident
 that the size of the ring is given by the sum of the two numbers in the square brackets and this is universally the 
case for sigmatropic rearrangements. We are now going to look at [2.3]	-sigmatropic rearrangements so we will be needing five-membered cyclic transition states. 
There is a problem here. You cannot draw three arrows going round a five-membered ring without stopping or starting 
on an atom, not a bond. This can be OK if the atom is a carbanion.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The starting material is a benzyl allyl ether and undergoes [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to
 make a new C&#x2014;C <i>a</i> bond at the expense of a C&#x2014;O <i>a</i> bond&#x2014;a bad bargain this as the
 C&#x2014;O bond is stronger. The balance is tilted by the greater stability of the oxyanion in the product than of
 the carbanion in the starting material. The new bond has a 2,3 relationship to the old and the transition state is 
a five-membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwindent1">The transition state can be quite chair-like so that the new n bond will be <i>trans</i> if it

 something new. We have a &#x03C0;bond and a <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond 
and a carbanion. How are we to represent a carbanion (or a carbocation) that is just a p orbital on an atom? The new

<p class="htwnoindent">There are many [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements involving a variety of heteroatoms as well as 
carbon. The mechanism is common with elements that are prepared to change their oxidation state by two so that an 
arrow can both start and finish on that atom. The examples in this section involve sulfur and selenium, which can 
both form stable compounds at three oxidation states: S or Se(II), S or Se(IV), and S or Se(VI).</p>

 start and stop on the sulfur atom, which changes from S(II) to S(IV) during the reaction. The new functional group
 with an S&#x003D;O bond is a sulfoxide, and this is a good way of making allylic sulfoxides. The product forms an 
anion stabilized by sulfur, which can be alkylated.</p>

 If this product is heated in methanol with a nucleophile such as (MeO)<sub>3</sub>P (trimethylphos- phite), which
 has a liking for sulfur, the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement runs backwards and a sulfenate ester is again formed.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">This is an unfavourable reaction because the equilibrium lies over on the sulfoxide side. But the

<p class="htwnoindent">When one of the numbers in square brackets is &#x2018;1&#x2018;, the old and new <i>a</i> bonds are 
to the same atom, so we are dealing with the migration of a group around a conjugated system. In the case of a [1,5]-
sigmatropic rearrangement the transition state is a six-membered ring (remember&#x2014; just add together the numbers
 in square brackets). There is an important example in the margin. Let us first check that this is indeed a [1,5]-
sigmatropic rearrangement by numbering the position of the new <i>a</i> bond with respect to the old. Note that we
 must go the long way round the five-membered ring because that is the way the mechanism goes.</p>

<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"/>&#160;interactive mechanism for a [1,5]-sigmatropic shift on 
cyclopentadiene</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">It <i>is</i> a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The figure &#x2018;1&#x2018; in the square brackets
 shows that the same atom is at one end of the new&#x03C3; bond as was at one end of the old a bond. One atom has moved in a
 1,5 manner and these are often called [1,5]-sigmatropic <i>shiffs.</i> This is often abbreviated to [1,5]H shift to
 show which atom is moving. This particular example is important because sadly it prohibits a most attractive idea.
 The aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion is easily formed, stable, and readily alkylated. This sequence of alkylation and
 Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction looks very good.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_919_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">But sadly this sequence is, in fact, no good at all. A mixture of three Diels&#x2014;Alder adducts
 is usually obtained resulting from addition to the three cyclopentadienes present in solution as<a class="page" id="page_920"><b>Page 920, Chapter 35 Pericyclic reactions 2: sigmatropic and electrocyclic reactions</b></a>the result of rapid [1,5]H shifts. The one drawn above is a minor product because there is more 
of the other two dienes, which have an extra substituent on the double bonds.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_920_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">An excellent example comes from the intramolecular Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions explored by 
Dreiding in 1983. One particular substituted cyclopentadiene was made by a fragmentation reaction (see <a href="chapter_36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).
 It might have been expected to give a simple Diels&#x2014;Alder adduct.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_920_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">There is nothing wrong with this reaction&#x2014;indeed, the product looks beautifully 
stable&#x2014; but it is not formed because the [1,5]H shift is too quick and gives a more stable cyclopentadiene 
with more substituents on a double bond. <i>Then</i> it does the Diels-Alder reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_920_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Notice that in these compounds the ketone is not conjugated to any of the alkenes and so does not 
influence the reaction. If we increase the reactivity of the dienophile by putting an ester group in conjugation with
 it, most of the compound does the Diels-Alder reaction <i>before</i> it does the [1,5]H shift.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Orbital description for the [1,5]H sigmatropic shift</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">It is equally satisfactory to use frontier orbitals or the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for these
 reactions. We can take the diene as one component (HOMO or LUMO or <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4) and the C-H bond as the other 
(LUMO or HOMO or <sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2). Let us start by using the LUMO of the diene (&#x0471;<sub>3</sub>) and the HOMO of the C-H 
bond (its filled <i>a</i> orbital), as shown in the margin. If the circle around the H atom surprised you, perhaps it
 will also remind you that hydrogen has only a 1s orbital, which is spherical. You can probably see already that all 
the orbitals are correctly lined up for the reaction.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The hydrogen atom slides across the top face of the planar cyclopentadiene ring. We call this a 
suprafacial migration, meaning that the migrating group leaves from one face of the &#x03C0; system and rejoins that same 
face (the top face in this example). Antarafacial migration would mean leaving the top face and rejoining the bottom 
face&#x2014;a clear impossibility here.</p>

 with retention. The 1s orbital is spherically symmetrical and has no node, so wherever you draw the dotted line from
 that orbital it always means retention. Choosing the components is easy&#x2014;the diene is a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4 and 
the C&#x2014;H bond a <sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2 component.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The easiest way to join them up is to link the hydrogen atom&#x2018;s 1s orbital to the top lobe of
the p orbital at the back of the diene and the black sp<sup>3</sup> orbital to the top lobe at the front of the diene.
 This gives us <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>s</sub> and &#x03C3;2<sub>s</sub> components and there is one <i>(4q</i> &#x002B; 2)
<sub>s</sub> and no (4r)<sub>a</sub> components so the sum is odd and the reaction is allowed. Both approaches give us
 the same picture&#x2014;a suprafacial migration of the hydrogen atom with (inevitably) retention at the migrating
 group.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">These [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts are not restricted to cyclopentadienes. In <a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a> we bemoaned 
the lack of Diels-Alder reactions using <i>E,Z</i> dienes. One reason for the shortage of examples is that such dienes
 undergo [1,5]H shifts rather easily and mixtures of products result.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The consequences of orbital symmetry for sigmatropic hydrogen shifts are simple. In thermal 
reactions, [1,5]H shifts occur suprafacially but [1,3]H and [1,7]H shifts must be antarafa- cial. Antarafacial 
[1,3]H shifts are impossible, even though they are allowed, because a rigid three-carbon chain is too short to 
allow the H atom to transfer from the top to the bottom&#x2014; the H atom just can&#x2018;t reach. This is just as
 well, as otherwise double bonds would just wander around molecules by repeated [1,3]H shifts.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">When we come to [1,7]H shifts, the situation is different. Now the much longer chain is just
flexible enough to allow antarafacial migration. The hydrogen atom leaves the top side of the triene and adds back
 in on the bottom side. The diagram shows this in orbital terms: the LUMO of hexatriene has three nodes. Antarafacial
 [1,7]H migration is allowed and possible.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Electrocyclic reactions</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In an electrocyclic reaction a ring is always broken or formed. Rings may, of course, be formed by 
cycloadditions as well, but the difference with electrocyclic reactions is that just one new <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond is formed 
(or broken) across the ends of a single conjugated &#x03C0; system. In a cycloaddition, two new <i>a</i> bonds are always 
formed (or broken), and in a sigmatropic rearrangement one <i>a</i> bond forms while one breaks.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">One of the simplest electrocyclic reactions occurs when hexatriene is heated to 500 &#x00B0;C. 
It is a pericyclic reaction because the electrons go round in a ring (you could equally draw the arrows going the
 other way); it&#x2018;s electrocyclic because a new <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond is formed across the ends of a n system. The
reaction goes because the <i>a</i> bond that is formed is stronger than the &#x03C0; bond that is lost.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The opposite is true for the electrocyclic opening of cyclobutene&#x2014;ring strain in the four-
 membered ring means that the reverse (ring-opening) reaction is preferred to ring closure.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">In one famous case, the release of ring strain is almost exactly counterbalanced by the formation 
of a <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond at the expense of a &#x03C0; bond. Cycloheptatriene exists in equilibrium with a bicyclic isomer known as

<h3 class="h3">Rules for electrocyclic reactions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Whether they go in the direction of ring opening or ring closure, electrocyclic reactions are 
subject to the same rules as all other pericyclic reactions. With most of the pericyclic reactions you have seen so 
far, we have given you the choice of using either HOMO&#x2014;LUMO reasoning or the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. With
 electrocyclic reactions, you really have to use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules because (at least for the ring closures)
 there is only one molecular orbital involved.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/>&#160;In the same way, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules apply both to cycloadditions and to reverse 
cycloadditions, as you saw in <a href="chapter_34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a>.</p></div></aside>

<li style="margin-bottom:0.5em"><span style="color:#000000"><b> An electrocyclic reaction is the formation of a new o bond across the ends of a conjugated
 polyene or the reverse.</b></span></li></ul>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>It is important that you do not confuse electrocyclic reactions with pericyclic reactions. 
Pericyclic is the name for the whole family of reactions involving no charged intermediates in which 
the electrons go round the outside of the ring. <i>Electrocyclic</i> reactions, 
<i>cycloadditions,</i> and <i>sigmatropic</i> rearrangements are the three main classes of <i>pericyclic</i> reactions.</b>
</p></div>
<p class="htwindent1">Let&#x2018;s start with the hexatriene ring closure from the beginning of this section, first 
looking at the orbitals and then following the same procedure that we taught you for cycloadditions and sigmatropic
 rearrangements to see what the Woodward-Hoffmann rules have to say about the reaction.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Hexatriene is, of course, a 6&#x03C0; electron (<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>6) conjugated system and, on forming 
cyclohexa- diene, the end two orbitals must rotate through 90&#x00B0; to form a &#x03C3; bond.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">So, now for the Woodward-Hoffmann treatment.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Now it works&#x0021; In fact, extension of this reasoning to other electrocyclic reactions tells 
you that they are <i>all</i> allowed&#x2014;provided you choose to make the conjugated system react with itself 
suprafacially for <i>(4n &#x002B;</i> 2) &#x03C0;systems and antarafacially for <i>(4n)&#x03C0;</i> systems. This may not seem
 particularly informative, since how you draw the dotted line has no effect on the reaction product in these cases.
 But it can make a difference. Here is the electrocyclic ring closure of an octatriene, showing the product from (a)
 suprafacial reaction and (b) antarafacial reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Conrotatory and disrotatory reactions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Whether the reaction is supra- or antarafacial ought to be reflected in the relative 
stereochemistry of the cyclized products&#x2014;and indeed it is. The reaction above gives solely the diastereoisomer 
on the left, with the methyl groups <i>syn</i>&#x2014;clear proof that the reaction is supra- facial. This is a 
difficult result to explain without the enlightenment provided by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules&#x0021; This
 electrocyclic cyclobutene ring opening also gives the product as a single stereoisomer.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_925_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Again, if we draw the reverse reaction, we can see that the reaction required has to be antara- 
facial for the stereochemistry to be right.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_925_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We have drawn little green arrows on the diagrams to show how the methyl groups move as the new
 <i>&#x03C3;</i> bonds form. For the allowed suprafacial reaction of the 6&#x03C0; electron system they rotate in opposite directions
 so the reaction is called <b>disrotatory</b> (yes, they both go up, but one has to rotate clockwise and one 
anticlockwise) while for the allowed antarafacial reaction of the 4&#x03C0; electron system they rotate in the same direction
 so the reaction is called <b>conrotatory</b> (both clockwise as drawn, but they might equally well have both gone 
anticlockwise). We can sum up the course of all electrocyclic reactions quite simply using these words.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">This rotation is the reason why you must carefully distinguish electrocyclic reactions from all
 other pericyclic reactions. In cycloadditions and sigmatropic rearrangements there are small rotations as bond angles
 adjust from 109&#x00B0; to 120&#x00B0; and vice versa, but in electrocyclic reactions rotations of nearly 90&#x00B0;
 are required as a planar polyene becomes a ring or vice versa. These rules follow directly from application of the

<h3 class="h3">Electrocyclic reactions in nature: the endiandric acids</h3>
<p class="htwdivi">A beautiful example of electrocyclic reactions at work is provided by the chemistry of the 
endiandric acids. This family of natural products, of which endiandric acid D is one of the simplest, is remarkable
 in being racemic&#x2014;most chiral natural products are enantiomerically pure (or at least enantiomerically enriched)
 because they are made by enantiomerically pure enzymes (we discuss all this in <a href="chapter_42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>). So it seemed that the 
endiandric acids were formed by non-enzymatic cyclization reactions, and in the early 1980s their Australian 
discoverer, Black, proposed that their biosynthesis might involve a series of electrocyclic reactions, starting 
from an acyclic polyene precursor.</p></div>

<h3 class="h3">Photochemical electrocyclic reactions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">After your experience with cycloadditions and sigmatropic rearrangements, you will not be surprised
 to learn that, in photochemical electrocyclic reactions, the rules regarding conrota- tory and disrotatory 
cyclizations are reversed.</p>

 electrocyclic ring opening of ergosterol to give provitamin D<sub>2</sub>. By looking at the starting material 
and product we can deduce whether the reaction is conrotatory or disrotatory.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_927_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">It&#x2018;s clearly conrotatory, and a little more thought will tell you why it has to be&#x2014;a 
disrotatory thermal 6&#x03C0; cyclization would put an impossible trans double bond into one of the two-six membered
rings. vitamin D deficiency is endemic in those parts of the world where sunlight is scarce for many months of the 
year&#x2014;and all because of orbital symmetry.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Cations and anions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">What we have just been telling you should convince you that the two reactions below are 
electrocyclic reactions, not least because the stereochemistry reverses on going from thermal to photochemical 
reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_927_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">They are examples of what is known, after its Russian discoverer, as the Nazarov cyclization.
 In its simplest form, the Nazarov cyclization is the ring closure of a doubly &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ketone to give a 
cyclopentenone. Nazarov cyclizations require acid, and protonation of the ketone sets up the conjugated &#x03C0; system
 required for an electrocyclic reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_927_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">One of the five &#x03C0;orbitals involved is empty&#x2014;so the cyclization is a &#x03C0;n electrocyclic
reaction, and the orbitals forming the new <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond must interact antarafacially. Loss of a proton and tautomerism
 gives the cyclopentenone.</p>

<a class="page" id="page_928"><b>Page 928, Chapter 35 Pericyclic reactions 2: sigmatropic and electrocyclic reactions</b></a>

<p class="htwindent1">The example below confirms that the reaction is thermally conrotatory and photochemically 
disrotatory.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_928_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Dienyl cations and dienyl anions both undergo electrocyclic ring closure&#x2014;a nice example
occurs when this cyclooctadiene is deprotonated with butyllithium. There are still five p orbitals involved in the 
cyclization, but now there are six &#x03C0; electrons, so the reaction is disrotatory.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_928_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In this case, it is the conrotatory <i>photochemical</i> cyclization that is prevented by strain
 (it was tried&#x2014;cyclooctadienyl anion is stable for at least a week at -78 &#x00B0;C in broad daylight) as the 
product would be a 5,5 transfused system. The same strain prevents thermal electrocyclic ring closure of 
cyclooctadienyl <i>cations.</i></p>

All electrocyclic reactions are allowed</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>It would be a good point here to remind you that, although all electrocyclic reactions are 
allowed both thermally and photochemically providing the rotation is right, the steric requirements for con- or 
disrotatory cyclization or ring opening may make one or both modes impossible.</b></p></div>
<h3 class="h3">Small rings are opened by electrocyclic reactions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Ring strain is important in preventing a reaction that would otherwise change your view of a lot 
of the chemistry you know. Allyl cations are conjugated systems containing 2&#x03C0; electrons, so if you knew no other 
chemistry than what is in this chapter you might expect them to cyclize via disrotatory electrocyclic ring closure.
 The product would be a cyclopropyl cation.</p>

<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160; You saw allyl cations as intermediates in substitution
 reactions in Chapters 15 and 24.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In fact, it is the cyclopropyl cations that undergo this reaction (very readily indeed&#x2014;
 cyclopropyl cations are virtually unobservable) because ring strain encourages them to undergo electrocyclic ring
 opening to give allyl cations. The instability of cyclopropyl cations means that, even as they start to form as 
intermediates, they spring open to give allyl cation- derived products. Try nucleophilic substitution on a cyclopropane
 ring and this happens.</p>

 American cockroach. Insect sex pheromones often have economic importance because they can form the key to remarkably
 effective traps for insect pests.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">In 1984, Schreiber published a synthesis of the pheromone in which the majority of steps involve
 pericyclic reactions. Make sure you understand each one as it appears&#x2014;re-read the appropriate part of Chapter
 34 or this chapter if you have any problems. The first step is a photochemical [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloaddition. You

 ketones.</p>
