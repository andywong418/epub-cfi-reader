<p class="noindent">You are already familiar with reactions of compounds containing carbonyl groups. Aldehydes and ketones react with nucleophiles at the carbon atom of their carbonyl group to give products containing hydroxyl groups. Because the carbonyl group is such a good electrophile, it reacts with a wide range of different nucleophiles: you have met reactions of aldehydes and ketones with (in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) cyanide, water, and alcohols, and (in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) organometallic reagents (organolithiums and organomagnesiums, or Grignard reagents).</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter and <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> we shall look at some more reactions of the carbonyl group&#x2014; and revisit some of the ones we touched on in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. It is a tribute to the importance of this functional group for organic chemistry that we have devoted four chapters of this book to its reactions. Just like the reactions in Chapters 6 and 9, the reactions in Chapters 10 and 11 all involve attack of a nucleophile on a carbonyl group. The difference is that this step is followed by other mechanistic steps, which means that the overall reactions are not just <b><i>additions</i></b> but also <b><i>substitutions.</i></b></p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_10.1">
<h2 class="h2">The product of nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group is not always a stable compound</h2>
<p class="noindent">Addition of a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde or ketone gives a stable alkoxide, which can be protonated with acid to produce an alcohol (you met this reaction in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). The same is not true for addition of an alcohol to a carbonyl group in the presence of base&#x2014;in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> we drew a reversible, equilibrium arrow for this transformation and said that the product, a hemiacetal, is formed to a significant extent only if it is cyclic.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason for this instability is that RO<sup>-</sup> is easily expelled from the molecule. We call groups that can be expelled from molecules, usually taking with them a negative charge, leaving groups. We&#x2019;ll look at leaving groups in more detail later in this chapter and again in <a href="chapter_15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">So, if the nucleophile is also a leaving group, there is a chance that it will be lost again and that the carbonyl group will reform&#x2014;in other words, the reaction will be reversible. The energy released in forming the C&#x003D;O bond (bond strength 720 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) makes up for the loss of two C-O single bonds (about 350 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> each), one of the reasons for the instability of the hemiacetal product in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">The same thing can happen if the starting carbonyl compound contains a potential leaving group. The unstable negatively charged intermediate in the red box below is formed when a Grignard reagent is added to an ester.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_198_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Again, it collapses with loss of RO<sup>-</sup> as a leaving group. This time, though, we have not gone back to starting materials: instead we have made a new compound (a ketone) by a substitution reaction&#x2014;the OR group of the starting material has been substituted by the Me group of the product. In fact the ketone product can react with the Grignard reagent a second time to give a tertiary alcohol. Later in this chapter we&#x2019;ll discuss why the reaction doesn&#x2019;t stop at the ketone.</p>

<p class="indent">In each case, a substitution (of the black part of the molecule, Cl<sup>-</sup> or AcO<sup>-</sup>, by cyclohexanol) has taken place&#x2014;but how? It is important that you learn not only the <b><i>fact</i></b> that acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with alcohols but also the <b><i>mechanism</i></b> of the reaction. In this chapter you will meet a lot of reactions, but relatively few mechanisms&#x2014;once you understand one, you should find that the rest follow on quite logically.</p>
<p class="indent">The first step of the reaction is, as you might expect, addition of the nucleophilic alcohol to the electrophilic carbonyl group&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll take the acyl chloride first. The base is important because it removes the proton from the alcohol once it attacks the carbonyl group. A base commonly used for this is pyridine. If the electrophile had been an aldehyde or a ketone, we would have got an unstable hemiacetal, which would collapse back to starting materials by eliminating the alcohol. With an acyl chloride, the alkoxide intermediate we get is also unstable. It collapses again by an elimination reaction, this time losing chloride ion, to form the ester. Chloride is the <b><i>leaving group</i></b> here&#x2014;it leaves with its negative charge.</p>

Try to write it down without looking at the acyl chloride mechanism above, and certainly not at the answer below. Here it is, with pyridine as the base.

<h3 class="ch3">More details of this reaction</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">Acylation with acyl chlorides in the presence of pyridine has more subtleties than first meet the eye. If you are reading this chapter for the first time, you might skip this box, as it is not essential to the general flow of what we are saying. There are three more points to notice.</p>
<p class="bindent">Pyridine is consumed during both of these reactions, since it ends up protonated. One whole equivalent of pyridine is therefore necessary and, in fact, the reactions are often carried out with pyridine as solvent.</p>
<p class="bindent">The observant among you may also have noticed that the (weak&#x2014;pyridine) base catalyst in this reaction works very slightly differently from the (strong&#x2014;hydroxide) base catalyst in the hemiacetal-forming reaction on p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_197">197</a>: pyridine removes the proton <b><i>after</i></b> the nucleophile has added; hydroxide removes the proton <b><i>before</i></b> the nucleophile has added. This is deliberate, and will be discussed further in Chapters 12 and 40. The basicities of pyridine (pK<sub>a</sub> for protonation 5.5) and hydroxide (pK<sub>a</sub> of water 15.7) were discussed in <a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p class="bindent">Pyridine is, in fact, more nucleophilic than the alcohol, and it attacks the acyl chloride rapidly, forming a highly electro-philic (because of the positive charge) intermediate. It is then this intermediate that subsequently reacts with the alcohol to give the ester. Because pyridine is acting as a nucleophile to speed up the reaction, yet is unchanged by the reaction, it is called a <b>nucleophilic catalyst.</b></p>

<h2 class="h2">Why are the tetrahedral intermediates unstable?</h2>
<p class="noindent">The alkoxide formed by addition of a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde or ketone is stable, lasting long enough to be protonated on work-up in acid to give an alcohol as product.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_200_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Tetrahedral intermediates are similarly formed by addition of a nucleophile, say ethanol in base, to the carbonyl group of acetyl chloride, but these tetrahedral intermediates are unstable. Why are they <b><i>unstable</i></b>? The answer is to do with leaving group ability. Once the nucleophile has added to the carbonyl compound, the stability of the product (or tetrahedral intermediate) depends on how good the groups attached to the new tetrahedral carbon atom are at leaving with the negative charge. In order for the tetrahedral intermediate to collapse (and therefore be just an intermediate and not the final product) one of the groups has to be able to leave and carry off the negative charge from the alkoxide anion formed in the addition.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_200_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The most stable anion will be the best leaving group. There were three choices for the leaving group: Cl<sup>-</sup>, EtO<sup>-</sup>, or Me<sup>-</sup>. We can make MeLi but not Me<sup>-</sup> because it is very unstable so Me<sup>-</sup> must be a very bad leaving group. EtO<sup>-</sup> is not so bad&#x2014;alkoxide salts are stable, but they are still strong, reactive bases. But Cl<sup>-</sup> is the best leaving group: Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are perfectly stable and quite unreactive, and happily carry off the negative charge from the oxygen atom. <a id="page_201" class="page">Page 201, Chapter 10: Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</a>You probably eat several grams of Cl<sup>-</sup> every day but you would be unwise to eat EtO or MeLi.

<h3 class="h3">How do we know that the tetrahedral intermediate exists?</h3>
<p class="noindent">We don&#x2019;t expect you to be satisfied with the bland statement that tetrahedral intermediates are formed in these reactions: of course, you wonder how we know that this is true. The first evidence for tetrahedral intermediates in the substitution reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives was provided by Bender in 1951. He made carboxylic acid derivatives RCOX that had been &#x2018;labelled&#x2019; with an isotope of oxygen, <sup>18</sup>O. This is a non-radioactive isotope that is detected by mass spectrometry. He then reacted these derivatives with water to make labelled carbox-ylic acids. By any reasonable mechanism, the products would have one <sup>18</sup>O atom from the labelled starting material. Because the proton on a carboxylic acid migrates rapidly from one oxygen to another, both oxygens are labelled equally.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;In Bender&#x2019;s original work, X was an alkoxy group (i.e. RCOX was an ester).</p>
</div>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_201_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">He then reacted these derivatives with insufficient water for complete consumption of the starting material. At the end of the reaction, he found that the proportion of labelled molecules in the <b><i>remaining starting material</i></b> had decreased significantly: in other words, it was no longer completely labelled with <sup>18</sup>O; some contained &#x2018;normal&#x2019; <sup>16</sup>O. The formation of the tetrahedral intermediate would be as before but rapid proton transfer would also mean that the two oxygen atoms would be the same. Now you may see the next step in the argument.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_201_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This result cannot be explained by direct substitution of X by H<sub>2</sub>O, but is consistent with the existence of an intermediate in which the unlabelled <sup>16</sup>O and labelled <sup>18</sup>O can &#x2018;change places&#x2019;. This intermediate is the <b><i>tetrahedral intermediate</i></b> for this reaction. Either isomer can lose X and in each case labelled carboxylic acid is formed.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_201_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">But either tetrahedral intermediate could lose water instead. In one case (top line below) the original starting material is regenerated complete with label. But in the second case, labelled water is lost and <b><i>unlabelled starting material is formed</i></b>. This result would be difficult to explain without a tetrahedral intermediate with a lifetime long enough to allow for proton exchange. This &#x2018;addition-elimination&#x2019; mechanism is now universally accepted.<a id="page_202" class="page">Page 202, Chapter 10: Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</a></p>

<p class="bnoindent">As these mechanisms show, the formation of amides from acid chlorides and amines is accompanied by production of one equivalent of HCl, which needs to be neutralized by a second equivalent of amine. An alternative method for making amides is to carry out the reaction in the presence of another base, such as NaOH, which then does the job of neutralizing the HCl. The trouble is, OH<sup>-</sup> also attacks acyl chlorides to give carboxylic acids. Schotten and Baumann, in the late nineteenth century, published a way round this problem by carrying out these reactions in two-phase systems of immiscible water and dichloromethane. The organic amine (not necessarily ammonia) and the acyl chloride remain in the (lower) dichloromethane layer, while the base (NaOH) remains in the (upper) aqueous layer. Dichloromethane and chloroform are two common organic solvents that are heavier (more dense) than water. The acyl chloride reacts only with the amine, but the HCl produced can dissolve in, and be neutralized by, the aqueous solution of NaOH.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact only the top reaction works: amides can be formed from esters but esters cannot be formed from amides. The key question is: which group will leave from the common tetrahedral intermediate? The answer is MeO<sup>-</sup> and not NH<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub>. You should have worked this out from the stability of the anions. Alkoxides are reasonably strong bases (pK<sub>a</sub> of ROH about 15) so they are not good leaving groups.

<p class="indent">But just a moment&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve overlooked an important point. We have sometimes used anions as nucleophiles (for example when we made acid anhydrides from acid chlorides plus car-boxylate salts, we used an anionic nucleophile RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) but on other occasions we have used neutral nucleophiles (for example when we made amides from acid chlorides plus amines, we used a neutral nucleophile NH<sub>3</sub>). Anions are better nucleophiles for carbonyl groups than are neutral compounds so we can choose our nucleophilic reagent accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">For proper comparisons, we should use the pK<sub>a</sub> of NH4 (about 10) if we are using neutral ammonia, but the pK<sub>a</sub> of RCO<sub>2</sub>H (about 5) if we&#x2019;re using the carboxylate anion. Ammonia is a good nucleophile and we don&#x2019;t usually need its anion but carboxylic acids are very weak nucleophiles and we often use their anions.

The nucleophile is the same in each case (water), as is the product, the carboxylic acid, but the electrophiles vary from very reactive to unreactive. The conditions needed for successful reaction show just how large is the variation on reactivity. Acid chlorides react violently with water. Amides need refluxing with 10&#x0025; NaOH or concentrated HCl in a sealed tube at 100 &#x00B0;C overnight. We&#x2019;ve seen that this hierarchy is partly due to how good the leaving group is (the ones at the top are best). But it also depends on the reactivity of the acid derivatives.

<h3 class="h3">Delocalization and the electrophilicity of carbonyl compounds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Amides are the least reactive towards nucleophiles because they exhibit the greatest degree of delocalization. You met this concept in <a href="chapter_7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> and we shall return to it many times more. In an amide, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom can be stabilized by overlap with the &#x03C0;* orbital of the carbonyl group&#x2014;this overlap is best when the lone pair occupies a p orbital (in an amine, it would occupy an sp<sup>3</sup> orbital).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_206_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The molecular orbital diagram shows how this interaction both lowers the energy of the bonding orbital (the delocalized nitrogen lone pair), making it neither basic nor nucleophilic, and raises the energy of the &#x03C0;* orbital, making it less ready to react with nucleophiles. Esters are similar, but because the oxygen lone pairs are lower in energy, the effect is less pronounced. The degree of delocalization depends on the electron-donating power of the substituent and increases along the series of compounds below from almost no delocalization from Cl to complete delocalization in the carboxylate anion, where the negative charge is equally shared between the two oxygen atoms.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_206_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The greater the degree of delocalization, the weaker the C&#x003D;O bond becomes. This is most clearly evident in the stretching frequency of the carbonyl group in the IR spectra of<a id="page_207" class="page">Page 207, Chapter 10: Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</a> carboxylic acid derivatives&#x2014;remember that the stretching frequency depends on the force constant of the bond, itself a measure of the bond&#x2019;s strength. The carboxylate anion is included because it represents the limit of the series, with complete delocalization of the negative charge over the two oxygen atoms. There are two frequencies for the anhydride and the carboxylate anion because of symmetric and antisymmetric stretching of identical bonds.</p>

<p class="indent">Amides react as electrophiles only with powerful nucleophiles such as HO<sup>-</sup>. Acid chlorides, on the other hand, react with even quite weak nucleophiles: neutral ROH, for example. They are more reactive because the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom.</p>
<div class="bbox">
<h3 class="ch3">Bond strengths and reactivity</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">You may think that a weaker C&#x003D;O bond should be more reactive. This is not so because the partial positive charge on carbon is also lessened by delocalization and because the molecule as a whole is stabilized by the delocalization. Bond strength is not always a good guide to reactivity&#x0021;</p>
<p class="bindent">For example, in acetic acid the bond strengths are surprising. The strongest bond is the O-H bond and the weakest is the C-C bond. Yet very few reactions of acetic acid involve breaking the C-C bond, and its characteristic reactivity, as an acid, involves breaking O-H, the strongest bond of them all&#x0021;</p>
<p class="bindent">The reason is that polarization of bonds and solvation of ions play an enormously important role in determining the reactivity of molecules. In <a href="chapter_37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> you will see that radicals are relatively unaffected by solvation and that their reactions follow bond strengths much more closely.</p>

Only strong acids are powerful enough to protonate carbonyl groups: the pK<sub>a</sub> of protonated acetone is -7 so, for example, even 1M HCl (pH 0) would protonate only 1 in 10<sup>7</sup> molecules of acetone. However, even proportions as low as this are sufficient to increase the rate of substitution reactions at carbonyl groups enormously because those carbonyl groups that are protonated become extremely powerful electrophiles.<a id="page_208" class="page">Page 208, Chapter 10: Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</a></p>

It can protonate any of the oxygen atoms reversibly. Again, only a very small proportion of molecules are protonated at any one time but, once the oxygen atom of, say, one of the OH groups is protonated, it becomes a much better leaving group (water instead of HO<sup>-</sup>). Loss of ROH from the tetrahedral intermediate is also possible: this leads back to starting materials&#x2014; hence the equilibrium arrow in the scheme above.

In order for this reaction to be useful, it is therefore necessary to ensure that the equilibrium is pushed towards the ester side by using an excess of alcohol or carboxylic acid (usually the reactions are done in a solution of the alcohol or the carboxylic acid).

You may be surprised to learn that coconut oil contains more saturated fat than butter, lard, or beef dripping: much of it is the trimyristate ester of glycerol. Hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by reprotonation of the sodium carboxylate salt with acid, gives myristic acid. Notice how much longer it takes to hydrolyse this branched ester than it did to hydrolyse a methyl ester (p. <a href="chapter_10.xhtml#page_210">210</a>).</p>

<h3 class="ch3">Saponification</h3>
<p class="bnoindent">The alkaline hydrolysis of esters to give carboxylate salts is known as saponification because it is the process used to make soap. Traditionally, beef tallow (the tristearate ester of glycerol&#x2014;stearic acid is octadecanoic acid, C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H) was hydrolysed with sodium hydroxide to give sodium stearate, C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Na, the principal component of soap. Finer soaps are made from palm oil and contain a higher proportion of sodium palmitate, C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>31</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Na. Hydrolysis with KOH gives potassium carboxylates, which are used in liquid soaps. Soaps like these owe their detergent properties to the combination of polar (carboxylate group) and non-polar (long alkyl chain) properties.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Amides can be hydrolysed under acidic or basic conditions too</h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to hydrolyse amides, the least reactive of the carboxylic acid derivatives, we have a choice: we can persuade the amine leaving group to leave by protonating it, or we can use brute force and forcibly eject it with concentrated hydroxide solution.</p>
<p class="indent">Amides are very unreactive as electrophiles, but they are also rather more basic than most carboxylic acid derivatives: a typical protonated amide has a pK<sub>a</sub> of -1; most other carbonyl compounds are much less basic. You might therefore imagine that the protonation of an amide would take place on nitrogen&#x2014;after all, <b><i>amine</i></b> nitrogen atoms are readily protonated. And, indeed, the reason for the basicity of amides is the nitrogen atom&#x2019;s delocalized lone pair, making the carbonyl group unusually electron rich. But amides are always protonated on the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, never the nitrogen, because protonation at nitrogen would disrupt the delocalized system that makes amides so stable. Protonation at oxygen gives a delocalized cation (<a href="chapter_8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_212_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Protonation of the carbonyl group by acid makes the carbonyl group electrophilic enough for attack by water, giving a neutral tetrahedral intermediate. The amine nitrogen atom in the tetrahedral intermediate is much more basic than the oxygen atoms, so now <b><i>it</i></b> gets protonated, and the RNH<sub>2</sub> group becomes really quite a good leaving group. Once it has left, it will immediately be protonated again, and therefore become completely non-nucleophilic. The conditions are very vigorous&#x2014;70&#x0025; sulfuric acid for 3 hours at 100 &#x00B0;C.</p>

We said that it is always easy to move down the series of acid derivatives we listed early in the chapter, and so far that is all we have done. But some reactions of carboxylic acids also enable us to move upwards in the series. What we need is a reagent that changes the bad leaving group HO<sup>-</sup> into a good leaving group. Strong acid does this by protonating the OH<sup>-</sup>, allowing it to leave as H<sub>2</sub>O. In this section we look at two more reagents, SOCl<sub>2</sub> and PCl<sub>5</sub>, which convert the OH group of a carboxylic acid and also turn it into a good leaving group.

<h2 class="h2">Making ketones from esters: the problem</h2>
<p class="noindent">Substitution of the OR group of an ester by an R group would give us a ketone. You might therefore think that reaction of an ester with an organolithium or Grignard reagent would be a good way of making ketones. However, if we try the reaction, something else happens, as you saw at the start of this chapter.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_216_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Two molecules of Grignard have been incorporated and we get an alcohol&#x0021; If we look at the mechanism we can understand why this should be so. First, as you would expect, the nucleo-philic Grignard reagent attacks the carbonyl group to give a tetrahedral intermediate. The only reasonable leaving group is RO<sup>-</sup>, so it leaves to give us the ketone we set out to make.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_216_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Now, the next molecule of Grignard reagent has a choice. It can react with either the ester starting material or the newly formed ketone. Ketones are more electrophilic than esters so the Grignard reagent prefers to react with the ketone in the manner you saw in <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. A stable alkoxide anion is formed, which gives the tertiary alcohol on acid work-up.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Making alcohols instead of ketones</h3>
<p class="noindent">In other words, the problem here lies in the fact that the ketone product is more reactive than the ester starting material. We shall meet more examples of this general problem later (in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, for example): in the next section we shall look at ways of overcoming it. Meanwhile, why not see it as a useful reaction? This compound, for example, was needed by some chemists in the course of research into explosives.</p>
<p class="indent">It is a tertiary alcohol with the hydroxyl group flanked by two identical R (&#x003D; butyl) groups.

Sodium borohydride, often used for the reduction of ketones, does not usually reduce esters.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Making the products less reactive</h3>
<p class="noindent">This alternative solution is often better. With the right starting material, the tetrahedral inter-mediate can become stable enough not to collapse to a ketone during the reaction; it therefore remains completely unreactive towards nucleophiles. The ketone is formed only when the reaction is finally quenched with acid but the nucleophile is also destroyed by the acid and none is left for further addition.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_218_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We can illustrate this concept with a reaction of an unlikely looking electrophile, a lithium carboxylate. Towards the beginning of the chapter we said that carboxylic acids were bad electrophiles and that carboxylate salts were even worse. Well, that is true, but with a sufficiently powerful nucleophile (an organolithium) it is just possible to get addition to the carbonyl group of a lithium carboxylate.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_218_4.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">We could say that the affinity of lithium for oxygen means that the Li-O bond has considerable covalent character, making the CO<sub>2</sub>Li less of a true anion. And the intermediate after addition of MeLi is probably best represented as a covalent compound too. Anyway, the <a id="page_219" class="page">Page 219, Chapter 10: Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</a>product of this addition is a dianion of the sort that we met during one of the mechanisms of base-catalysed amide hydrolysis. But in this case there is no possible leaving group, so there the dianion sits. Only at the end of the reaction, when water is added, are the oxygen atoms protonated to give a hydrated ketone, which collapses immediately (remember <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) to give the ketone that we wanted. The water quench also destroys any remaining organo-lithium, so the ketone is safe from further attack.</p>

<p class="indent">A final alternative is to use a nitrile instead of an ester. The intermediate is the anion of an imine (see <a href="chapter_12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for more about imines), which is not electrophilic at all&#x2014;in fact, it&#x2019;s quite nucleophilic, but there are no electrophiles for it to react with until the reaction is quenched with acid. It gets protonated and hydrolyses (we&#x2019;ll discuss this in the next chapter) to the ketone.</p>

<h2 class="h2">And to conclude...</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you have been introduced to some important reactions&#x2014;you can consider them to be a series of facts if you wish, but it is better to see them as the logical outcome of a few simple mechanistic steps. Relate what you have seen to what you gathered from Chapters 6 and 9, when we first started looking at carbonyl groups. All we did in this chapter was to build some subsequent transformations on to the simplest organic reaction, addition to a carbonyl group. You should have noticed that the reactions of all acid derivatives are related and are very easily explained by writing out proper mechanisms, taking into account the presence of acid or base. In the next two chapters we shall see more of these acid-and base-catalysed reactions of carbonyl groups. Try to view them as closely related to the ones in this chapter&#x2014;the same principles apply to their mechanisms.</p>
