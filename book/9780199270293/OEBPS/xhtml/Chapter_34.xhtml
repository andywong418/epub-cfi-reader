<h2 class="htwh2"><b>A new sort of reaction</b></h2>
<p class="htwindent1">Most organic reactions are ionic. Electrons move from an electron-rich 
atom towards an electron-poor atom: anions or cations are intermediates. Formation of a
 cyclic ester (a lactone) is an example. The reaction involves five steps and four 
intermediates. The reaction is acid- catalysed and each intermediate is a cation. Electrons
 flow in one direction in each step&#x2014; towards the positive charge. This is an ionic
 reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_877_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This Chapter&#160;&#160;is about a totally different reaction type. Electrons move
 round a circle and there are no positive or negative charges on any 
intermediates&#x2014;indeed, there are no inter-</p>

<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> In Chapter&#160;&#160;24 you met a brief introduction to a third category&#x2014;radical reactions&#x2014;in which one electron instead of two is on the move. This will be developed in more detail in Chapter&#160;&#160;37.</p></div>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<div class="htwblue">
<p class="htwnoindenta">Otto Diels (1876-1954) and his research student Kurt Alder (1902-58)
 worked at the University of Kiel and discovered this reaction in 1928. They won the Nobel
 Prize in 1950. Diels also discovered carbon suboxide, C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 
(see p. <a href="chapter_18.xhtml#page_420">420</a>).</p></div>

<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> Cycloadditions are the first of
 three classes of pericyclic reactions, and the whole of this Chapter&#160;&#160;will be devoted to 
cycloadditions. The other two&#x2014; sigmatropic and electrocyclic reactions&#x2014;are 
discussed in Chapter&#160;&#160;35.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwnoindent">mediates at all. This type of reaction is called <b>pericyclic</b>. 
The most famous example is the <b>Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction</b>. This reaction goes in 
a single step simply on heating. We can draw the mechanism with the electrons going round 
a six-membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_878_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Each arrow leads directly to the next, and the last arrow connects
 to the first. We have drawn the electrons rotating clockwise, but it would make no 
difference at all if we drew the electrons rotating anticlockwise.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_878_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Both mechanisms are equally correct. The electrons do not really 
rotate at all. In reality two &#x03C0; bonds disappear and two &#x03C3; bonds take their place
 by the electrons moving smoothly out of the &#x03C0; orbitals into the &#x03C3; orbitals. Such 
a reaction is called a <b>cycloaddition</b>. We must spend some time working out how this
 could happen. First, just consider the orbitals that overlap to form the new bonds. 
Providing the reagents approach in the right way, nothing could be simpler.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_878_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The black p orbitals are perfectly aligned to make a new &#x03C3; bond, as 
are the two green orbitals, while the two brown orbitals are exactly right for the new
 &#x03C0; bond at the back of the ring. As this is a one-step reaction there are no intermediates
 but there is one transition state looking something like this:</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_878_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">One reason that the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction goes so well is 
that the transition state has six delocalized &#x03C0; electrons and thus is aromatic in
 character, having some of the special stabilization of benzene. You could look at
 it as a benzene ring having all its &#x03C0; bonds but missing two &#x03C3; bonds. This simple
 picture is fine as far as it goes, but it is incomplete. We shall return to a more
 detailed orbital analysis when we have described the reaction in more detail.<a class="page" id="page_879">Page 879, Chapter 34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></p>

<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Captan</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">One important industrial application of the Diels-Alder reaction we
 have been discussing is in the synthesis of the agricultural fungicide Captan.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_879_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></div>


<h2 class="htwh2"><b>General description of the Diels-Alder reaction</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Diels-Alder reactions occur between a <b>conjugated diene</b> and an 
alkene, usually called the <b>dienophile</b>. Here are some examples: first an open-chain
 diene with a simple unsaturated aldehyde as the dienophile.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_879_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The mechanism is the same and a new six-membered ring is formed 
having one double bond. Now a reaction between a cyclic diene and a nitroalkene.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_879_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"></img> This fused ring system,
 and how to draw it, was described in more detail in Chapter&#160;&#160;32.</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The mechanism leads clearly to the first drawing of the product but
 this is a cage structure and the second drawing is better. The new six-membered ring is 
outlined in black in both diagrams. A more elaborate example shows that quite complex 
molecules can be quickly assembled with this wonderful reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_879_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The diene</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The diene component in the Diels-Alder reaction can be open-chain or
 cyclic and it can have many different kinds of substituents. There is only one limitation: 
it must be able to take up the conformation shown in the mechanism. Butadiene normally 
prefers the <i>s-trans</i> conformation with the two double bonds as far away from each 
other as possible for steric reasons. The barrier to rotation about the central&#x03C3; 
bond is small (about 30 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature) and rotation to the less 
favourable but reactive s<i>-cis</i> conformation is rapid.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> The &#x2018;s&#x2019; in the 
terms <i>&#x2019;s-cis</i> and <i>&#x2019;s-trans</i> refers to a a bond and indicates 
that these are conformations about a single bond and not configurations about a 
double bond.</p></div></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><a class="page" id="page_880">Page 880, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a><img src="../images/page_880_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Cyclic dienes that are permanently in the <i>s-cis</i> conformation
 are exceptionally good at Diels-Alder reactions&#x2014;cyclopentadiene is a classic 
example&#x2014;but cyclic dienes that are permanently in the <i>s-trans</i> conformation
 and cannot adopt the <i>s-cis</i> conformation will not do the Diels-Alder reaction at 
all. The two ends of these dienes cannot get close enough to react with an alkene and, in
 any case, the product would have an impossible <i>trans</i> double bond in the new 
six-membered ring. (In the Diels-Alder reaction, the old <i>a</i> bond in the centre 
of the diene becomes a &#x03C0; bond in the product and the conformation of that <i>a</i> bond
 becomes the configuration of the new &#x03C0; bond in the product.)</p>

<div class="htwyellow">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"></img> The diene</p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>The diene must have the <i>s-cis</i> conformation.</b></p></div>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The dienophile</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The dienophiles you have seen in action so far all have one 
thing in common. They have an electron-withdrawing group conjugated to the alkene. This 
is a common, although not exclusive, feature of Diels-Alder dienophiles. There must be some
 extra conjugation&#x2014;at least a phenyl group or a chlorine atom&#x2014;or the 
cycloaddition does not occur. You will often see the reaction between butadiene and 
a simple alkene (even ethylene) given in books as the basic Diels-Alder reaction.
 This occurs in only poor yield. Attempts to combine even such a reactive diene as 
cyclopentadiene with a simple alkene lead instead to the dimerization of the diene.
 One molecule acts as the diene and the other as the dienophile to give the cage structure 
shown.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_880_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Cyclopentadiene</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">Cyclopentadiene is formed in considerable amounts during the refining 
of petroleum. It exists as its dimer at room temperature but can be dissociated into the
 monomer on heating&#x2014;the effect of the increased importance of entropy at higher 
temperatures (Chapter&#160;&#160;12). It can be chlorinated to give hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and
 the Diels-Alder product of this diene with maleic anhydride is a flame retardant.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_880_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></div>
<p class="htwindent1">Simple alkenes that do undergo the Diels-Alder reaction include 
conjugated carbonyl compounds, nitro compounds, nitriles, sulfones, aryl alkenes, vinyl 
ethers and esters, haloalk<a class="page" id="page_881">Page 881, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a>enes, and dienes. In addition to those you have seen so far, a few
examples are shown in the margin. In the last example it is the isolated double bond in
 the right-hand ring that accepts the diene. Conjugation with the left-hand ring activates
 this alkene. But what exactly do we mean by &#x2019;activate&#x2019; in this sense? We
 shall return to that question in a minute.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_881_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Dieldrin and Aldrin</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">In the 1950s two very effective pesticides were launched and their
 names were &#x2019;Dieldrin&#x2019; and &#x2019;Aldrin&#x2019;. As you may guess they 
were made by the Diels-Alder reaction. Aldrin is derived from two consecutive Diels-Alder
 reactions. In the first, cyclopentadiene reacts with acetylene to give a simple symmetrical
 cage molecule &#x2019;norbornadiene&#x2019; (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta- diene). Norbornadiene is
 not conjugated and cannot take part in a Diels-Alder reaction as a <i>diene.</i> However, 
it is quite strained because of the cage and it reacts as a <i>dienophile</i> with 
perchlorocyclopentadiene to give Aldrin.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_881_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwdivi">This is quite a complex product but we hope you can see how it is made
 up by looking at the two new bonds marked in black. Dieldrin is the epoxide of Aldrin. The
 use of these compounds, like that of many organochlorine compounds, was eventually banned 
when it was found that chlorine residues were accumulating in the fat of animals high up in 
the food chain, such as birds of prey and humans.</p></div>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The product</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Recognizing a Diels-Alder product is straightforward. Look for the 
six-membered ring, the double bond inside the ring, and the conjugating group outside 
the ring and on the opposite side of the ring from the alkene. These three features mean
 that the compound is a possible Diels-Alder product.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The simplest way to find the starting materials is to carry out a 
disconnection that is closer to a real reaction than most. Just draw the reverse Diels-Alder
 reaction. To do this, draw three arrows going round the cyclohexene ring, starting the
 first arrow in the middle of the double bond. It doesn&#x2019;t, of course, matter which 
way round you go.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_881_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_881_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reaction couldn&#x2019;t be simpler&#x2014;just heat the components
 together without solvent or catalyst. Temperatures of around 100-150&#x00B0;C are often 
needed and this may mean using a sealed tube if the reagents are volatile, as here.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_881_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> Disconnections and 
retrosynthetic arrows of the type shown here are ways of thinking about how to make 
molecules. They appear throughout Chapter&#160;&#160;28.</p></div></aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Stereochemistry</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. If there is 
stereochemistry in the dienophile, then it is faithfully reproduced in the product.
 Thus <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> dienophiles give different diastereo- isomers of 
the product. Esters of maleic and fumaric acids provide a simple example.<a class="page" id="page_882">Page 882, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_882_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img>Interactive explanation of the 
effect of dienophile stereochemistry</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In both cases the ester groups simply stay where they are. 
They are <i>cis</i> in the dienophile in the first reaction and remain <i>cis</i> in
 the product. They are <i>trans</i> in the dienophile in the second reaction and remain
 <i>trans</i> in the product. The second example may look less con-vincing&#x2014;may we
 remind you that the diene actually comes down on top of the dienophile like this:</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_882_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">One of the CO<sub>2</sub>Me groups is tucked under the diene in the 
transition state and then, when the product molecule is flattened out in the last drawing, 
that CO<sub>2</sub>Me group appears underneath the ring. The brown hydrogen atom remains
 <i>cis</i> to the other CO<sub>2</sub>Me group.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The search by the Parke&#x2014;Davis company for drugs to treat strokes 
provided an interesting application of dienophile stereochemistry. The kinds of compound 
they wanted were tri- cylic amines. They don&#x2019;t look like Diels&#x2014;Alder products
 at all. But if we insert a double bond in the right place in the six-membered ring,
 Diels&#x2014;Alder (D&#x2014;A) disconnection becomes possible.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_882_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_882_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Butadiene is a good diene, but the enamine required is not a good
 dienophile. An electron- withdrawing group such as a carbonyl or nitro group is 
preferable: either would do the job. In the event a carboxylic acid that could be 
converted into the amine by a rearrangement with (PhO)<sub>2</sub>PON<sub>3</sub> 
was used.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_882_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The stereochemistry at the ring junction must be <i>cis</i> because the
 cyclic dienophile can have only a <i>cis</i> double bond. Hydrogenation removes the double 
bond in the product and shows just how useful the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction is for making 
saturated rings, particularly when there is some stereochemistry to be controlled.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img>	The rearrangement with 
(PhO)<sub>2</sub>PON<sub>3</sub> is a Curtius rearrangement: it is described in 
Chapter&#160;&#160;38.</p></div>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img>You can add the Diels-Alder
 reaction to your mental list of reactions to consider for making a single diastereoisomer
 from a single geometrical isomer of an alkene: see Chapter&#160;&#160;33.</p></div></aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Stereochemistry of the diene</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">This is slightly more complicated as the diene can be 
<i>cis,cis,</i> or <i>cis,trans</i> (there are two of these if the diene is
 unsymmetrical), or <i>trans,trans.</i> We shall look at each case with the same 
dienophile, an acetylene dicarboxylate, as there is then no stereochemistry in the triple 
bond&#x0021; Starting with cis,cis-dienes is easy if we make the diene cyclic.<a class="page" id="page_883">Page 883, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_883_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The diene has two sets of substituents&#x2014;inside and outside.
 The inside one is the bridging CH<sub>2</sub> group and it has to end up on one side of 
the molecule (above in the last diagram) while the two green hydrogens are outside and
 remain so. In the final diagram they are below the new six-membered ring. With a <i>trans,
trans</i>-diene we simply exchange the two sets of substituents, in this example putting Ph
 where H was and putting H where the bridging CH<sub>2</sub> group was. This is
 the reaction:</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_883_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The green Ph groups end up where the hydrogens were in the first 
example&#x2014;beneath the new six-membered ring&#x2014;and the hydrogens end up above.
It may seem puzzling at first that a <i>trans,trans-diene</i> gives a product with the 
two phenyls <i>cis.</i> Another way to look at these two reactions is to consider their
symmetry. Both have a plane of symmetry throughout and the products must have this symmetry 
too because the reaction is concerted and no significant movement of substituents can occur
 The orange dotted line shows the plane of symmetry, which is at right angles
 to the paper.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_883_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The remaining case&#x2014;the <i>cis,trans-diene</i>&#x2014;is rarer than
 the first two, but is met sometimes. This unsymmetrical diene means the two substituents 
clearly end up on opposite sides of the new six-membered ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_883_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The red R group may seem to get in the way of the reaction but, of
 course, the dienophile is not approaching in the plane of the diene but from underneath.
 It is difficult to find a convincing example of this stereochemistry as there are so few 
known, partly because of the difficulty of making <i>E,Z</i> dienes. One good approach uses
 two reactions you met in Chapter&#160;&#160;29 for the control of double-bond geometry. The <i>cis</i>
 double bond is put in first by the addition of methanol to butadiyne and the <i>trans</i>
 double bond then comes from LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduction of the intermediate acetylenic 
alcohol.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The acetate of this alcohol is used in a Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction 
with the interesting dienophile DEAD (diethyl azodicarboxylate&#x2014;in orange). The
 product is formed in excellent yield and has the <i>trans</i> stereochemistry that was
 predicted. The amide nitrogen atoms are planar, so there is no question of stereochemistry
 there. DEAD itself can equilibrate rapidly between <i>E</i> and Z isomers, but the
 <i>E</i> predominates.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Now to the most interesting cases of all, when both the diene and
 the dienophile have stereochemistry.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The <i>endo</i> rule for the Diels-Alder reaction</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">It is probably easier to see this when both the diene and the dienophile
 are cyclic. All the double bonds are <i>cis</i> and the stereochemistry is clearer. In the
 most famous Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction of all time, that between cyclopentadiene and
 maleic anhydride, there are two possible products that obey all the rules we have so 
far described. They are the only possible diastereo- isomers of the product&#x2014;although
 it has four stereogenic centres, any other diastereoisomers would be impossibly 
strained.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> These names arise from the 
relationship in space between the carbonyl groups on the dienophile and the newly formed
 double bond in the middle of the old diene. If these are on the same side they are
 called <i>endo</i> (inside) and if they are on opposite sides they are called 
<i>exo</i> (outside).</p></div>

<p class="htwindent1">The two green hydrogen atoms must be <i>cis</i> in the product, but 
now there are two such com-pounds, known as the <i>exo</i> and <i>endo</i> products. When
 the reaction is carried out, the product is, in fact, the <i>endo</i> compound. Only one
 diastereoisomer is formed, and it is the less stable one. How do we know this? Well, for 
cases in which the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction is reversible and therefore under 
thermodynamic control, the <i>exo</i> product is formed instead. The best known example
 results from the replacement of cyclopentadiene with furan in reaction with the same
 dienophile.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_884_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Why is the <i>exo</i> product the more stable? Look again at these two
 structures. On the left-hand side of the molecules, there are two bridges across the ends
 of the new bonds (highlighted in black): a one-C-atom bridge and a two-C-atom bridge. There
 is less steric hindrance if the smaller (that is, the one-atom) bridge eclipses the
 anhydride ring.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The <i>endo</i> product is less stable than the <i>exo</i> product 
and yet it is preferred in irreversible Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions&#x2014;it must be 
the kinetic product of the reaction. It forms faster because <a class="page" id="page_885">Page 885, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a>a bonding interaction between the electron-deficient carbonyl groups of the dienophile and the developing n bond at the back of the diene lowers the energy of the transition state, leading to the <i>endo</i> product.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">There is more. The simpler picture we met earlier in this Chapter&#160;&#160;also 
fails to explain why the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction occurs simply on heating while
 attempted additions of simple alkenes (rather than dienes) to maleic anhydride fail
 on heating but succeed under irradiation with UV light.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">We shall now explain all this in one section using frontier molecular 
orbitals. Of all the kinds of organic reactions, pericyclic ones are the most tightly 
controlled by orbitals, and the development of the ideas we are about to expound is one 
of the greatest triumphs of modern theoretical chemistry. It is a beautiful and satisfying 
set of ideas based on very simple principles.</p>
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>The frontier orbital description of cycloadditions</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">When an ionic cyclization reaction occurs, such as the lactonization at
 the head of this chapter, one important new bond is formed. It is enough to combine one 
full orbital with one empty orbital to make the new bond. But in a cycloaddition two new 
bonds are formed at the same time. We have to arrange for two filled p orbitals and two 
empty p orbitals to be available at the right place and with the right symmetry. See what
 happens if we draw the orbitals for the reaction above. We could try the HOMO (&#x03C0;) of the
 alkene and the LUMO (&#x03C0;*) of the double bond in the anhydride (as in the margin). This 
combination is bonding at one end, but antibonding at the other so that no cycloaddition 
reaction occurs. It obviously doesn&#x2019;t help to use the other HOMO/LUMO pair, that is
 the HOMO of the aldehyde and the LUMO of the alkene, as they will have the same mismatched 
symmetry.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now see what happens when we replace the alkene with a diene. We shall
 again use the LUMO of the electron-poor anhydride. Now the symmetry is right because there
 is a node in the middle of the HOMO of the diene (the HOMO is &#x03C8;<sub>2</sub> of the diene)
 just as there is in the LUMO of the dienophile.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">If we had tried the opposite arrangement, the LUMO of the diene
 (&#x03C8;<sub>3</sub>) and the HOMO of the dienophile, the symmetry would again be right.
 The LUMO of the diene has two nodes and gives the same symmetry as the HOMO of the 
dienophile, which has no nodes. So either com-bination is excellent. In fact most 
Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions use electron-deficient dienophiles and electron-rich 
dienes so we prefer the first arrangement. The electron-deficient dienophile has a 
low-energy LUMO and the electron-rich diene has a high-energy HOMO so this combination
 gives a better overlap in the transition state. The energy levels will look like this,
 and the interaction shown in orange is better than the interaction shown in brown because
 the orbitals are closer in energy.</p>

<p class="htwindent1"><a class="page" id="page_887">Page 887, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is why we usually use dienophiles with conjugating groups for good
 Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions. Dienes react rapidly with electrophiles because their HOMOs
 are relatively high in energy, but simple alkenes are not suitable electrophiles because 
they have relatively high energy LUMOs. The most effective modification we can make is to 
lower the energy of the alkene&#x2019;s LUMO by conjugating the double bond with an
 electron-withdrawing group such as carbonyl or nitro. These are the most common type of
 Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions&#x2014;between electron-rich dienes and electron-deficient
 dienophiles.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwblue">
<p class="htwnoindenta">A rarer type is the <b>reverse electron demand Diels- Alder
 reaction</b> in which the dienophile has electron-donating groups and the diene has
 a conjugated electron-withdrawing group. These reactions use the HOMO of the dienophile
 and the LUMO of the diene. This combination still has the right orbital symmetry.</p></div>

</div></aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Dimerizations of dienes by cycloaddition reactions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Because dienes have relatively high-energy HOMOs and low-energy LUMOs 
they should be able to take part in cycloadditions with themselves. And indeed, dienes do
 dimerize, by a Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction. One molecule of the diene plays the role of 
the dienophile. The symmetry is correct for the interaction shown, and we call such 
reactions (like all the Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions in this chapter) &#x2019;[4 &#x002B; 2]
 cycloadditions&#x2019;&#x2014;the numbers referring to the number of atoms of each
 component taking part in the reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_887_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">What dienes cannot do is form an eight-membered ring in one step in 
a [4 &#x002B; 4] cycloaddi-tion (although this is possible photochemically or with
 transition metal catalysis, as we shall see later).</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_887_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You should have expected this failure because the ends of the required
 orbitals must again have the wrong symmetry, just as they had when we tried the alkene 
dimerization.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The orbital explanation for <i>endo</i> preference in Diels-Alder
 reactions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">We are going to use a diene dimerization to add more detail to our
 explanation of the forma-
tion of <i>endo</i> products. To make matters even easier we shall 
look at the dimerization of a cyclic
diene&#x2014;we might almost say <i>the</i> cyclic diene&#x2014;cyclopentadiene. We 
introduced the preference
for <i>endo</i> products on p. <a href="chapter_34.xhtml#page_885">885</a> by saying there was a favourable electronic 
interaction between
the conjugating group on the dienophile and the back of the diene.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_887_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">If we now draw the frontier orbitals in the two components as 
they come together for the reaction, we can see first of all that the symmetry is correct for bond formation
 (orbitals shown in black). But we can also see what is happening at the back of the diene 
(orbitals in green). The symmetry of the orbitals is correct for a bonding interaction at the 
back of the diene too. This interaction does not lead to the formation of any new bonds but it
 leaves its imprint in the stereochemistry of the product. The <i>endo</i> product is favoured 
because of this bonding interaction across the space between the orbitals.<a class="page" id="page_888">Page 888, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The solvent in the Diels-Alder reaction</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">We discussed some effects of varying the solvent in Chapter&#160;&#160;12, 
and we shall now introduce
a remarkable and useful special solvent effect in the Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction
 does not <i>need</i> a solvent and often the two reagents are just mixed together and heated. 
Solvents can be used but, because there are no ionic intermediates, it seems obvious that <i>which</i>
 solvent is unimportant&#x2014;any solvent that simply dissolves both reagents will do. This is, in 
general, true and hydrocarbon solvents are often the best.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">However, in the 1980s an extraordinary discovery was made. Water, 
a most unlikely solvent
for most organic reactions, has a large accelerating effect on the Diels-Alder reaction.
 Even
some water added to an organic solvent accelerates the reaction. And that is not all. 
The <i>endo</i>
selectivity of these reactions is often superior to those in no solvent or in a 
hydrocarbon sol-vent. Here is a simple example.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The suggestion is that the reagents, which are not soluble in 
water, are clumped together in oily drops by the water and forced into close proximity. 
Water is not exactly a solvent&#x2014;it is almost an anti-solvent&#x0021; Reactions like
 this are sometimes called reactions &#x2019;on water&#x2019; rather than reactions 
&#x2019;in water&#x2019;.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">When the diene and the dienophile are already part of the same molecule
 it is not so important for them to be held together by bonding interactions across space 
and the <i>exo</i> product is often preferred. Indeed, many intramolecular Diels-Alder
 reactions are governed more by normal steric considerations than by the <i>endo</i>
 rule.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_888_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This reaction happens only because it is intramolecular. There
 is no conjugating group
attached to the dienophile and so there are no orbitals to overlap with the back
 of the diene.
The molecule simply folds up in the sterically most favourable way (as shown in the margin,
with the linking chain adopting a chair-like conformation) and this leads to the <i>trans</i> ring junc-
tion. You can see this easily in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">In the next example there is a carbonyl group conjugated with
 the dienophile. Now the less

carbonyl group can
enjoy a bonding overlap with the back of the diene. This time the linking chain has

a boat-like conformation.<a class="page" id="page_889">Page 889, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Regioselectivity in Diels-Alder reactions</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The compounds that we are now calling dienophiles were the stars of 
Chapters 22 and 25, where we called them <b>Michael acceptors</b> as they were the 
electrophilic partners in conjugate addition reactions. Nucleophiles always add to the p 
carbon atoms of these alkenes because the product is then a stable enolate. Ordinary
 alkenes do not react with nucleophiles.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_889_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In frontier orbital terms this is because conjugation with a carbonyl
 group lowers the energy of the LUMO (the &#x03C0;* orbital of the alkene) and at the same time 
distorts it so that the coefficient on the p carbon atom is larger than that on the a carbon 
atom. Nucleophiles approach the conjugated alkene along the axis of the large p orbital of 
the p carbon atom.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"></img> This is discussed 
in Chapter&#160;&#160;22.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_889_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">These same features can ensure regioselective Diels-Alder reactions. The 
same orbital of the dienophile is involved and, if the HOMO of the diene is also 
unsymmetrical, the regioselectiv- ity of the reaction will be controlled by the two 
largest coefficients bonding together.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">So what about distortion of the HOMO in the diene? If a diene reacts 
with an electrophile, the largest coefficient in the HOMO will direct the reaction. Consider
 the attack of HBr on a diene. We should expect attack at the ends of the diene because that
 gives the most stable possible cation&#x2014;an allyl cation as an intermediate.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_889_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In orbital terms attack occurs at the ends of the diene because the 
coefficients in the HOMO are larger there. We need simply to look at the HOMO 
(y<sub>2</sub>) of butadiene, shown in the margin, to see this. So it is not 
surprising that the dienes react in the Diels-Alder reaction through their end 
carbons. But supposing the two ends are different&#x2014;which reacts now? We can 
again turn to the reaction with HBr as a guide. Addition of HBr to an unsymmetrical 
diene will give the more stable of the two possible allyl cations as the 
intermediate.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">In orbital terms, this must mean that the HOMO of the diene is
 distorted so that the end that reacts has the larger coefficient. When the unsymmetrical
 diene and the unsymmetrical dienophile combine in a Diels-Alder reaction, the reaction 
itself becomes unsymmetrical. It remains concerted but, in the transition state, bond
 formation between the largest coefficients in each partner is more advanced and this 
determines the regioselectivity of the reaction.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-1em"><img src="../images/page_890_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The simplest way to decide which product will be formed is to 
draw an &#x2019;ionic&#x2019; stepwise mechanism for the reaction to establish which 
end of the diene will react with which end of the dienophile. Of course this stepwise
 mechanism is not completely correct but it does lead to the correct orientation of the 
reagents and you can draw the right mechanism afterwards. As an example, try a diene with
 a substituent in the middle. This is the reaction:</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_890_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">First decide where the diene will act as a nucleophile and where 
the dienophile will act as an electrophile. This indicates where the largest coefficients
 of the HOMO and LUMO must lie. The two circles represent those largest coefficients.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_890_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now draw the reagents in the correct orientation for these two ends

<h3 class="h3"><b>Lewis acid catalysis in Diels-Alder reactions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Where the reagents are unsymmetrical, a Lewis acid that can bind to
 the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile often catalyses the reaction by lowering
 the LUMO of the dieno- phile still further. It has another important advantage: it 
increases the difference between the coefficients in the LUMO (a Lewis-acid complexed 
carbonyl group is a more powerful electron-withdrawing group) and may therefore increase
 regioselectivity.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_891_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This Diels-Alder reaction is useful because it produces a substitution 
pattern <i>(para)</i> common in natural terpenes (see Chapter&#160;&#160;42). But the regioselectivity
 introduced by one methyl group on the diene is not very great&#x2014;this reaction gives a 
71:29 mixture when the two compounds are heated together at 120&#x00B0;C in a sealed tube. 
In the presence of the Lewis acid (SnCl<sub>4</sub>) the reaction can be carried out at
 lower temperatures (below 25&#x00B0;C) without a sealed tube and the regioselectivity 
improves to 93:7.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Regioselectivity in intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Just as the stereoselectivity may be compromised in intramolecular 
reactions, so may the regioselectivity. It may be simply impossible for the reagents to
 get together in the &#x2019;right&#x2019; orientation. The examples below have a very
 short chain&#x2014;just three carbon atoms&#x2014;joining diene to dienophile and so the 
same regioselectivity is found regardless of the position of the conjugating carbonyl
 group.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_891_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The first example has the &#x2019;right&#x2019; orientation
 (<i>ortho</i>) but the second has the &#x2019;wrong&#x2019; orientation <i>(meta).
</i> The short tether entails no prospect of any other orientation and, as the reaction
 is intramolecular, it goes anyway. Notice the lower temperature required for the Lewis 
acid (ROAlCl<sub>2</sub>) catalysed reaction.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>The Woodward-Hoffmann description of the</b></h2> 
<h2 class="htwh2" style="margin-top:-0.5em"><b>Diels-Alder reaction</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Kenichi Fukui and Roald Hoffmann won the Nobel prize in 1981 (Woodward died in 1979 and so couldn&#x2019;t share this prize: he had already won a Nobel prize in 1965 for his work on synthesis) for the application of orbital symmetry to pericyclic reactions. Theirs is an alternative description to the frontier orbital method we have used and you need to know a little about it. They started by considering a more fundamental correlation between the symmetry of all the orbitals in the starting materials and all the orbitals in the products. This is rather too complex for us to cover here, and we shall concentrate only on a summary of the conclu- sions&#x2014;the <b>Woodward-Hoffmann rules</b>. The most important of these states:</p>
<div class="htwyellow">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"></img>	<b>Woodward-Hoffmann rules</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>In a thermal pericyclic reaction the total number of
 (4q <i>&#x002B;</i> 2)<sub>s</sub> and (4<i>i)<sub>a</sub></i> 
components must be odd.</b></p></div>
<p class="htwindent1">This needs some explanation. A component is a bond or orbital taking part 
in a pericyclic reaction as a single unit. A double bond is a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2 component. 
The 
number 2 is the most important part of this designation and simply refers to the number of 
electrons. The prefix &#x03C0; tells us the type of electrons. A component may have any
 number of 
electrons (a diene is a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4 component) but may not have mixtures of
 &#x03C0; and &#x03C3; 
electrons. Now look back at the rule. Those designations <i>(4q &#x002B;</i> 2) and (4r) 
simply refer to the number of electrons in the component where <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> are 
integers. An alkene is a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2 component and so it is of the (4q &#x002B; 2) kind 
while a diene is a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4 component and so is of the (4r) kind. You have already 
seen the importance of <i>4n &#x002B;</i> 2 numbers in aromaticity; here the significance
 is closely related.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now what about the suffixes &#x2019;s&#x2019; and &#x2019;a&#x2019;? The
 suffix &#x2019;s&#x2019; stands for suprafacial and &#x2019;a&#x2019; for antara- facial. 
A <b>suprafacial</b> component forms new bonds on the same face at both ends while an
 <b>antarafacial</b> component forms new bonds on opposite faces at both ends. If you 
find it easier to understand, you can think of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules like this:</p>
<div class="htwyellow">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"></img><b>Woodward-Hoffmann rules: alternative version</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>In an allowed thermal pericyclic reaction this sum:</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi" style="margin-left:1em"><b>number of suprafacial components with 2, 6, or 10 electrons </b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>&#x002B; number of antarafacial components with 0, 4, or 8 electrons</b></p>
 <p class="htwdivi"><b>&#x003D; an odd number</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>It&#x2019;s the number of relevant components that must be odd,
 not (obviously) the number of electrons, and you must ignore any components which
 aren&#x2019;t mentioned in the sum (for example you can have as many suprafacial 
components with four electrons as you like&#x2014;they just don&#x2019;t count).</b></p></div>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Trapping reactive intermediates by cycloadditions</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In Chapter&#160;&#160;22 you met the remarkable intermediate benzyne. Convincing
 evidence for the existence of this implausible structure is provided by the fact that it 
can be trapped in a Diels&#x2014; Alder reaction. One way of generating benzyne for this 
purpose is the diazotization of anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid).</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_893_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Benzyne may not look like a good dienophile but it is an unstable electrophilic molecule so it must have a low-energy LUMO (&#x03C0;&#x002A; of the triple bond). If benzyne is generated in the presence of a diene, efficient Diels&#x2014;Alder reactions take place. Anthracene gives a specially interesting product with a symmetrical cage structure.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_893_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">It is difficult to draw this mechanism convincingly. The two flat molecules approach each other in orthogonal planes, so that the (orbitals) of the localized n bond of benzyne interact with the p orbitals on the central ring of anthracene.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_893_4.jpg" alt="images"/><a class="page" id="page_894">Page 894, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Another intermediate for which a cycloaddition product provides 
convincing evidence is
the oxyallyl cation. This compound can be made from &#x03B1;,
&#x03B1;&#x2019;-dibromoketones on treatment
with zinc metal. The first step is the formation of a zinc enolate (compare the Reformatsky
reaction), which can be drawn in terms of the attack of zinc on oxygen or bromine. Now the
other bromine can leave as an anion. It could not do so before because it was next to an
electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Now it is next to an electron-rich enolate so the cation
is stabilized by conjugation.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The allyl cation has three atoms but only two electrons so it can
 take part in cycloadditions

 reaction. This is a [4 &#x002B; 3] all-suprafacial cycloaddition.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_34.4">
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Other thermal cycloadditions</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">A simple consequence of the Woodward&#x2014;Hoffmann rules is that 
cycloadditions involving a total (4n &#x002B; 2) electrons, if they are all suprafacial,
 are always allowed: they must always involve an odd number of <i>(4q &#x002B;</i> 
2)<sub>s</sub> components. Such reactions are often referred to as having &#x2019;aromatic
 transition states&#x2019; because of the obvious link with the aromatic requirement for
 (4n &#x002B; 2) electrons. Six is the most common (4n &#x002B; 2) number, but there are 
also a few cycloadditions involving ten electrons. These are mostly diene &#x002B; triene,
 that is, <sub>n</sub>4<sub>s</sub> &#x002B; <sub>n</sub>6<sub>s</sub> cycloadditions. Here
 are a couple of examples.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg"></img> Interactive mechanism
 for [4 &#x002B; 6] cycloaddition</p></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">In the first case, there is an <i>endo</i> relationship between the carbonyl group and the back of the diene&#x2014;this product is formed in 100&#x0025; yield. In the second case Et<sub>2</sub>NH is lost from the first product under the reaction conditions to give the hydrocarbon shown. This type of reaction is more of an oddity: by far the most important type of cycloaddition is the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Alder &#x2019;ene&#x2019; reaction</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction was originally called the &#x2019;diene
 reaction&#x2019; so, when half of the famous team (Kurt Alder) discovered an analogous 
reaction that requires only one alkene, it was called the <b>Alder ene reaction</b> and 
the name has stuck. Compare here the Diels&#x2014;Alder and the Alder ene reactions.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><a class="page" id="page_895">Page 895, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a><img src="../images/page_895_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The simplest way to look at the ene reaction is to picture it as a Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction in which one of the double bonds in the diene has been replaced by a C&#x2014;H bond (green). The reaction does not form a new ring, the product has only one new C&#x2014;C bond (shown in black on the product), and a hydrogen atom is transferred across space. Otherwise, the two reactions are remarkably similar.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The ene reaction is rather different in orbital terms. For the 
Woodward&#x2014;Hoffmann description of the reaction we must use the two electrons of
 the C&#x2014;H bond to replace the two electrons of the double bond in the 
Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction, but we must make sure that all the orbitals are parallel,
 as shown.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_895_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The C&#x2014;H bond is parallel with the p orbitals of the ene so
 that the orbitals that overlap to form the new n bond are already parallel. The two 
molecules approach one another in parallel planes so that the orbitals that overlap to 
form the new <i>a</i> bonds are already pointing towards each other. Because the electrons
 are of two types, n and a, we must divide the ene into two components, one <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2 
and one <sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2. We can then have an all-suprafacial reaction with three 
components.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">All three components are of the <i>(4q</i> &#x002B; 2)<sub>s</sub> type
 so all count and the total is three&#x2014;an odd number&#x2014;so the reaction is allowed.
 We have skipped the step-by-step approach we used for the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction
 because the two are so similar, but you should convince yourself that you can apply it 
here.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now for some real examples. Most ene reactions with simple alkenes are 
with maleic anhydride. Other dienophiles&#x2014;or enophiles as we should call them in this 
context&#x2014;do not work very well. However, with one particular alkene, the natural pine 
tree terpene &#x03B2;-pinene, a reaction does occur with enophiles such as acrylates.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_895_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/square.jpg"></img> We discuss in more detail 
in Chapter&#160;&#160;35 how to assign s or a with <i>a</i> bonds. Here the <i>a</i> bond reacts
 suprafacially because the 1s orbital of H has no nodes.</p></div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">The major interaction between these two molecules is between the 
nucleophilic end of the exocyclic alkene and the electrophilic end of the acrylate.
 These atoms have the largest coefficients in the HOMO and LUMO, respectively, and, 
in the transition state, bond formation between these two will be more advanced than 
anywhere else. For most ordinary alkenes and enophiles, Lewis acid catalysis to make 
the enophile more electrophilic, or an intramolecular reaction (or both&#x0021;), is 
necessary for an efficient ene reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_895_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">The &#x2019;ene&#x2019; component is delivered to the bottom face of the
 enone, as its tether is too short for it to reach the top face, and a <i>cis</i> ring 
junction is formed. The stereochemistry of the third centre is most easily seen by a Newman 
projection (Chapter&#160;&#160;16) of the reaction. In the diagram in the margin we are looking 
straight down the new C&#x2014;C bond and the colour coding should help you to see how 
the stereochemistry follows.</p>

 (the one with the lower LUMO) reacts.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_896_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

 symmetry of the alkene. The double bond in the product is not, in fact, in the same place

 a process for the production of menthol used to give a peppermint smell and taste to many

<p class="htwindent1">It is not obvious what has happened in the first step, but the movement

 Clearly, four is not a <i>(4n</i> &#x002B; 2) number, but when we described the

All<a class="page" id="page_897">Page 897, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a> suprafacial cycloadditions with 4n electrons <i>are</i> allowed if the reaction is not thermal (that is, driven by heat energy) but <b>photochemical</b> (that is, driven by light energy). Under photo-chemical conditions, the rules switch such that all the cycloadditions that are not allowed thermally are allowed photochemically. This works because the problem of the incompatible symmetry in trying to add two alkenes together is avoided by converting one of them into the excited state photochemically. First, one electron is excited by the light energy from the n to the &#x03C0;* orbital.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_897_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Now, combining the excited state of one alkene with the ground state of

<p class="htwindent1">Alkenes can be dimerized photochemically in this way, but reaction 
between two different alkenes is more interesting. If one alkene is bonded to a conjugating 
group, it alone will absorb UV light and be excited while the other will remain in the 
ground state. It is difficult to draw a mechanism for these reactions as we have no simple
 way to represent the excited alkene. Some people draw it as a diradical (since each 
electron is in a different orbital); others prefer to write a concerted reaction on an 
excited alkene marked with an asterisk.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_897_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The reaction is stereospecific within each component but
 there is no <i>endo</i> rule&#x2014;there is a conjugating group but no &#x2019;back of
 the diene&#x2019;. The least hindered transition state usually results. The dotted lines 
on the central diagram simply show the bonds being formed. The two old rings keep out of 
each other&#x2019;s way during the reaction and the conformation of the prod-uct looks 
reasonably unhindered.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_897_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You may be wondering why the reaction works at all, given the 
strain in a four-membered ring: why doesn&#x2019;t the product just go back to the 
two starting materials? This reverse reaction is governed by the Woodward&#x2014;Hoffmann
 rules, just like the forward one, and to go back again the four-membered ring products 
would have to absorb light. But since they have now lost <a class="page" id="page_898">Page 898, Chapter34 Pericyclic reactions 1: cycloadditions</a>their &#x03C0; bonds they have no low-lying empty orbitals into which
 light can promote electrons (see Chapter&#160;&#160;7). The reverse photochemical reaction is simply 
not possible because there is no mechanism for the compounds to absorb light.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Regioselectivity in photochemical [2 &#x002B; 2]
 cycloadditions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The observed regioselectivity is shown below. If we had combined
 the HOMO of the alkene with the LUMO of the enone, as we should in a thermal reaction,
 we would expect the opposite orientation so as to use the larger coefficients of the 
frontier orbitals and to maximize charge stabilization in the transition state.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_898_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">But we are not doing a thermal reaction. If you look back at the orbital
 diagram on p. <a href="chapter_34.xhtml#page_897">897</a>, you will see that it is the HOMO/HOMO and LUMO/LUMO interactions that
 now matter in the reactions of the excited state. The sizes of the coefficients in the LUMO
 of the alkene are the other way round to those in the HOMO. There is one electron in this 
pair of orbitals&#x2014; in the LUMO of the enone in fact, as the enone has been excited by
 the light&#x2014;so overlap between the two LUMOs (shown in the frame) is bonding and leads 
to the observed product. The easiest way to work it out quickly is to draw the product you
 do <i>not</i> expect from a normal HOMO/LUMO or curly arrow controlled reaction.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">Despite what we have told you about allowed cycloadditions, 
there <i>are</i> some thermal [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloadditions giving four-membered
 rings. These feature a simple alkene reacting with an electrophilic alkene of a 
peculiar type. It must have two double bonds to the <i>same</i> carbon atom. The most
 important examples are ketenes and isocyanates. The structures have two &#x03C0; bonds at 
right angles.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Here are typical reactions of dimethyl ketene to give a cyclobutanone 
and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate to give a P-lactam.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_898_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">To understand why these reactions work, we need to consider a new and 
potentially fruitful way for two alkenes to approach each other. As you saw on p. <a href="chapter_34.xhtml#page_886">886</a>, 
thermal cycloadditions between two alkenes do not work because the HOMO/LUMO combination
 is antibonding at one end.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">If one alkene turns at 90&#x00B0; to the other, there is a way in which
 the HOMO of one might bond at both ends to the LUMO of the other. First we turn the HOMO 
of one alkene so that we are <a class="page" id="page_899">Page 899, Chapter34 Pericyclic Reaction 1:Cycloadditions.</a>looking down on the p orbitals. Then we add the LUMO of the other alkene on top of this HOMO and at 90&#x00B0; to it so that there is the possibility of bonding overlap at both ends.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_899_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This arrangement looks quite promising until we notice that there is antibonding at the other two corners&#x0021; Overall there is no net bonding. We can tilt the balance in favour of bonding by adding a p orbital to one end of the LUMO and at a right angle to it so that both orbitals of the HOMO can bond to this extra p orbital. There are now four bonding interactions but only two antibonding. The balance is in favour of a reaction. This is also quite difficult to draw&#x0021;</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Ketenes have a central sp carbon atom with an extra n bond (the C&#x003D;O) at right angles to the first alkene&#x2014;perfect for thermal [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloadditions. They are also electrophilic and so have suitable low-energy LUMOs.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Ketene [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloadditions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Ketene itself is usually made by high-temperature pyrolysis of acetone but some ketenes are easily made in solution. The very acidic proton on dichloroacetyl chloride can be removed even with a tertiary amine and loss of chloride ion then gives dichloroketene in an ElcB elimination reaction. If the elimination is carried out in the presence of cyclopentadiene a very efficient regio- and stereospecific [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloaddition occurs.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The most nucleophilic atom on the diene adds to the most electrophilic atom on the ketene and the <i>cis</i> geometry at the ring junction comes from the <i>cis</i> double bond of cyclopentadiene. It is impressive that even this excellent diene undergoes no Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction with ketene as dienophile. The [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloaddition must be much faster.</p>
<div class="htwblue1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Using the products</b></h3>
<p class="htwdivi">Dichloroketene is convenient to use, but the two chlorine atoms are not usually needed in the product. Fortunately, these can be removed by zinc metal in acetic acid solution. Zinc forms a zinc enolate, which is converted into the ketone by the acid. Repetition removes both chlorine atoms. You saw the reductive formation of a zinc enolate earlier in the chapter (p. <a href="chapter_34.xhtml#page_894">894</a>) and in the Reformatsky reaction (<a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, p. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml#page_631">631</a>).</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Both sets of starting materials look all right&#x2014;the regiochemistry is correct for the first and doesn&#x2019;t matter for the second. However, we prefer the second because we can control the stereochemistry by using c/s-butene as the alkene and we can make the reaction work better by using dichloroketene instead of ketene itself, reducing out the chlorine atoms with zinc.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Synthesis of ^-lactams by [2 &#x002B; 2] cycloadditions</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Now the disconnections are really different&#x2014;one requires addition of a ketene to an imine and the other the addition of an isocyanate to an alkene. Isocyanates are like ketenes, but have a nitrogen atom instead of the end carbon atom. Otherwise the orbitals are the same.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_900_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">And the good news is that both work, providing we have the right substituents on nitrogen. The dichloroacetyl chloride trick works well with imines and, as you ought to expect, the more nucleophilic nitrogen atom attacks the carbonyl group of the ketene so that the regio- selectivity is right to make P-lactams.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_900_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">If both components have one substituent, these will end up <i>trans</i> on the four-membered ring just to keep out of each other&#x2019;s way. This example has more functionality and the product is used to make P-lactams with antibiotic activity.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_900_4.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="htwindent1">You will notice that in both of these examples there is an aryl substituent on the nitrogen atom of the imine.

</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">When we wish to make P-lactams by the alternative addition of an isocyanate to an alkene, a substituent on nitrogen is again required, but for quite a different reason. Because alkenes are only moderately nucleophilic, we need a strongly electron-withdrawing group on the isocyanate that can be removed after the cycloaddition, and the most popular by far is the chlorosulfonyl group. The main reason for its popularity is the commercial availability of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate. It reacts even with simple alkenes.</p>

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The alkene&#x2019;s HOMO interacts with the isocyanate&#x2019;s LUMO, and the most electrophilic atom is the carbonyl carbon so this is where the terminal carbon atom of the alkene attacks. The chlorosulfonyl group can be removed simply by hydrolysis under mild conditions via the sulfonic acid.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">With a more electron-rich alkene&#x2014;an enol ether, for example, or the following example with its sulfur analogue, a vinyl sulfide&#x2014;the reaction ceases to be a concerted process and occurs stepwise. We know this must be the case in the next example because, even though the starting material is an <i>E/Z</i> mixture, the product has only <i>trans</i> stereochemistry: it is stereoselective rather than stereospecific, indicating the presence of an intermediate in which free rotation can take place.</p>

Such molecules exist: they are called 1,3-dipoles and they are good reagents for [3 &#x002B; 2] cycloadditions. The molecule containing N and O atoms labelled &#x2019;four-electron component&#x2019; is an example.

<p class="htwindent1">This functional group is known as a nitrone. You could think of it as the N-oxide of an imine. The nitrone gets its four electrons in this way: there are two n electrons in the N&#x003D;C double bond and the other two come from one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom. The two-electron component in each of these reactions is an alkene which, in a Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction, would be called a dienophile. Here it is called a <b>dipolarophile</b>. Simple alkenes (which are bad dienophiles) are good dipolarophiles and so are electron-deficient alkenes. The difference between dienes and 1,3-dipoles is that dienes are nucleophilic and prefer to use their HOMO in cycloadditions with electron-deficient dienophiles while 1,3-dipoles, as their name implies, are both electrophilic and nucleophilic. They can use either their HOMO or their LUMO depending on whether the dipolarophile is electron-deficient or electron-rich.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The importance of the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction is that it makes six-membered rings with control over stereochemistry. The importance of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions is not so much in the heterocyclic products but in what can be done with them. Almost always, the first formed heterocyclic ring is broken down in some way by carefully controlled reactions. The nitrone adducts we have just seen contain a weak N&#x2014;O single bond that can be selectively cleaved by reduction. Reagents such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> or zinc metal in various solvents (acetic acid is popular) or hydrogenation over catalysts such as nickel reduce the N&#x2014;O bond to give NH and OH functionality without changing the structure or stereochemistry of the rest of the molecule. From the examples above, we get these products:</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="htwindent1">In each cycloaddition, one permanent C&#x2014;C and one C&#x2014;O bond (shown in brown) were made. These were retained while the N&#x2014;O bond present in the original dipole was discarded. The final product is an amino-alcohol with a 1,3-relationship between the OH and NH groups.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Linear 1,3-dipoles</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction, the dienes had to have an <i>s-cis</i> conformation about the central single bond so that they were already in the shape of the product. Many useful 1,3-dipoles are actually linear and although their 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions look very awkward they still work well.

This sort of chemistry was discussed in <a href="chapter_24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a> if you need to check up on it. Notice that it is the sulfur atom that does the attack&#x2014;it is the soft end of the nucleophile and better at S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions. The next step is the cleavage of the ester group to reveal the thiolate anion.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">In the margin we show how this reaction works&#x2014;the nitrile oxide comes up from the underside of the seven-membered ring, pushing the black hydrogen atoms upwards and making all the rings join up in a <i>cis</i> fashion. Next the cycloadduct is reduced completely with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> so that both the N&#x2014;O and C&#x003D;N bonds are cleaved. This step is very stereoselective so the C&#x003D;N reduction probably precedes the N&#x2014;O cleavage and the hydride has to attack from the outside (top) face of the molecule. These considerations are explored more thoroughly in <a href="chapter_32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Two very important synthetic reactions: cycloaddition of alkenes with osmium tetroxide and with ozone</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">We shall end this chapter with two very important reactions, both of which we have alluded to earlier in the book (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). These reactions are very important not just because of their mechanisms, which you must be aware of, but even more because of their usefulness in synthetic chemistry, and in that regard they are second only to the Diels&#x2014;Alder reaction when considering all the reactions in this chapter. They are both oxidations&#x2014;one involves osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) and one involves ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and they both involve cycloaddition.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>OsO<sub>4</sub> adds two hydroxyl groups <i>syn</i> to a double bond</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">In <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> we emphasized the stereospecificity of this reaction but now we want to consider the nature of the first step (in the green frame). This is a cycloaddition between the osmium tetroxide and the alkene. You can treat the OsO<sub>4</sub> like a dipole, although it isn&#x2019;t drawn as one because osmium has plenty of orbitals to accommodate four double bonds. The reaction is a [3 &#x002B; 2] cycloaddition or a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p class="htwindent1"><a class="page" id="page_906">Page 906, Chapter34 Pericyclic Reaction 1:Cycloadditions.</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The osmate ester isn&#x2019;t the required product, and the reaction is usually done in the presence of water (the usual solvent is a f-BuOH-water mixture), which hydrolyses the osmate ester to the diol. Because both oxygen atoms were added in one concerted step during the cycloaddition, their relative stereochemistry must remain <i>syn.</i></p>
<p class="htwindent1">Note that, in the cycloaddition, one arrow stops on osmium and another starts on the other side. Osmium therefore gains a lone pair of electrons and is reduced from Os(VIII) to Os(VI)&#x2014; the reaction is therefore an oxidation, and it&#x2019;s one that is very specific to C&#x003D;C double bonds (as we mentioned in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). As written, it would involve a whole equivalent of the expensive, toxic, and heavy metal osmium, but it can be made catalytic by introducing a reagent to oxidize Os(VI) back to Os(VIII). The usual reagent is N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO) or Fe(III), and typical conditions for an osmylation, or dihydroxylation, reaction are shown in the scheme below.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_906_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In behaviour that is typical of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, OsO<sub>4</sub> reacts almost as well with electron-poor as with electron-rich alkenes. OsO<sub>4</sub> simply chooses to attack the alk- ene HOMO or its LUMO, depending on which gives the best interaction. This is quite different from the electrophilic addition of m-CPBA or Br<sub>2</sub> to alkenes.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Our last type of cycloaddition is most unusual. It starts as a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition but eventually becomes a method of cleaving n bonds in an oxidative fashion so that they end up as two carbonyl groups. The reagent is ozone, O<sub>3</sub>. Again, you met this reaction in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, but we can now show you the full, remarkable details of the reaction mechanism.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Ozone is a symmetrical bent molecule with a central positively charged oxygen atom and two terminal oxygen atoms that share a negative charge. It is a 1,3-dipole and does typical 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with alkenes. The product is a very unstable compound. The O&#x2014;O single bond (bond energy 140 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) is a very weak bond&#x2014;much weaker than the N&#x2014;O bond (180 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) we have been describing as weak in previous examples&#x2014;and
this heterocycle has two of them. It immediately decomposes&#x2014;by a 
<i>reverse</i> 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_906_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The products are a simple aldehyde on the left and a new, rather unstable looking mole- cule&#x2014;a 1,3-dipole known as a carbonyl oxide&#x2014;on the right. At least it no longer has any true O&#x2014;O single bonds (the one that looks like a single bond is part of a delocalized system like the one in ozone). Being a 1,3-dipole, it now adds to the aldehyde in a third cycloaddition step. It might just add back the way it came, but it much prefers to add in the other way round, with the nucleophilic oxyanion attacking the carbon atom of the carbonyl group like this.<a class="page" id="page_907">Page 907, Chapter34 Pericyclic Reaction 1:Cycloadditions.</a></p>

</div></aside>
<p class="htwindent1">This compound&#x2014;known as an ozonide&#x2014;is the first stable product of the reaction with ozone. It is the culmination of two 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions and one reverse 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. It is still not that stable and is quite explosive, so for the reaction to be of any use it needs decomposing. The way this is usually done is with dimethylsulfide or Ph<sub>3</sub>P, which attacks the ozonide to give DMSO and two molecules of aldehyde.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_907_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="htwindent1">The ozonide will also react with oxidizing agents such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to give carboxylic acids, or with more powerful reducing agents such as NaBH<sub>4</sub> to give alcohols. Here are the overall transformations&#x2014;each cleaves a double bond&#x2014;it is called an ozonolysis.</p>

<ul style="width:65%;color:#006f9c">
<li><span style="color:#000000">A cycloaddition is a one-step ring-forming reaction between two 
conjugated n systems in which two new <i>a</i> bonds are formed, joining the two reagents at 
each end. The mechanism has one step with no intermediates, and all the arrows start on n bonds 
and go round in a ring.</span>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_907_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">The cycloadditions are suprafacial&#x2014;they occur on 
one face only of each n system&#x2014; and for a thermally allowed reaction there should 
be <i>4n</i> &#x002B; 2 electrons in the mechanism, but 4n in a photochemical cycloaddition.
 These rules are dictated by orbital symmetry.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000">Cycloaddition equilibria generally lie over on the 
right-hand side in a thermal reaction because C&#x2014;C <i>a</i> bonds are stronger 
than C&#x2014;C n bonds. In a photochemical cycloaddition the product loses its n bonds 
and therefore its means of absorbing energy. It is therefore the kinetic product of the 
reaction even if it has a strained four- membered ring.</span></li>
