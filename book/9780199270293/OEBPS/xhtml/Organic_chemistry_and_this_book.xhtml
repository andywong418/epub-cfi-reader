<p class="con"><b>Organic chemistry and this book</b></p>
<p class="line" style="border-bottom:2pt solid #006F9A;"></p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">You can tell from the title that this book tells you about organic chemistry. But it tells you more than that: it tells you <i>how we know</i> about organic chemistry. It tells you facts, but it also teaches you how to find facts out. It tells you about reactions, and teaches you how to predict which reactions will work; it tells you about molecules, and it teaches you how to work out ways of making them.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt">We said &#x2018;it tells&#x2019; in that last paragraph. Maybe we should have said &#x2018;we tell&#x2019; because we want to speak to you through our words so that you can see how we think about organic chemistry and to encourage you to develop your own ideas. We expect you to notice that three people have written this book, and that they don&#x2019;t all think or write in the same way. That is as it should be. Organic chemistry is too big and important a subject to be restricted by dogmatic rules. Different chemists think in different ways about many aspects of organic chemistry and in many cases it is not yet, and may never be, possible to be sure who is right. In many cases it doesn&#x2019;t matter anyway.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">We may refer to the history of chemistry from time to time but we are usually going to tell you about organic chemistry as it is now. We will develop the ideas slowly, from simple and fundamental ones using small molecules to complex ideas and large molecules. We promise one thing. We are not going to pull the wool over your eyes by making things artificially simple and avoiding the awkward questions. We aim to be honest and share both our delight in good complete explanations and our puzzlement at inadequate ones.</p>
<p class="chapter"><b>The chapters</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">So how are we going to do this? The book starts with a series of chapters on the structures and reactions of simple molecules. You will meet the way structures are determined and the theory that explains those structures. It is vital that you realize that theory is used to explain what is known by experiment and only then to predict what is unknown. You will meet mechanisms&#x2014;the dynamic language used by chemists to talk about reactions&#x2014;and of course some reactions.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The book starts with an introductory section of four chapters:</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">1.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>What is organic chemistry?</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">2.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Organic structures</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">3.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Determining organic structures</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">4.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Structure of molecules</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-top:0.8em;"><a href="chapter_1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> is a &#x2018;rough guide&#x2019; to the subject&#x2014;it will introduce the major areas where organic chemistry plays a role, and set the scene by showing you some snapshots of a few landmarks. In <a href="chapter_2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> you will look at the way in which we present diagrams of molecules on the printed page. Organic chemistry is a visual, three-dimensional subject and the way you draw molecules shows how you think about them. We want you too to draw molecules in the best way possible. It is just as easy to draw them well as to draw them in an old-fashioned or inaccurate way.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt">Then in <a href="chapter_3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, before we come to the theory which <i>explains</i> molecular structure, we shall introduce you to the experimental techniques which <i>tell us about</i> molecular structure. This means studying the interactions between molecules and radiation by spectroscopy&#x2014;using the whole electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to radio waves. Only then, in <a href="chapter_4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, will we go behind the scenes and look at the theories of why atoms combine in the ways they do. Experiment comes before explanation. The spectroscopic methods of <a href="chapter_3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> will still be telling the truth in a hundred years&#x2019; time, but the theories of <a href="chapter_4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> will look quite dated by then.</p>
<a id="page_xx" class="page">Page xx, Organic chemistry and this book</a>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">We could have titled those three chapters:</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">2.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>What shapes do organic molecules have?</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">3.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>How do we know they have those shapes?</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">4.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Why do they have those shapes?</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">You need to have a grasp of the answers to these three questions before you start the study of organic reactions. That is exactly what happens next. We introduce organic reaction mechanisms in <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. Any kind of chemistry studies reactions&#x2014;the transformations of molecules into other molecules. The dynamic process by which this happens is called <i>mechanism</i> and is the grammar of organic chemistry&#x2014;the way that one molecule can change into another. We want you to start learning and using this language straight away so in <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> we apply it to one important class of reaction. We therefore have:</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">5.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Organic reactions</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">6.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:0.8em;"><a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> reveals how we are going to subdivide organic chemistry. We shall use a mechanistic classification rather than a structural classification and explain one type of <i>reaction</i> rather than one type of <i>compound</i> in each chapter. In the rest of the book most of the chapters describe types of reaction in a mechanistic way. Here is a selection from the first half of the book:</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">9.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Using organometallic reagents to make C&#x2013;C bonds</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">10.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">11.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Nucleophilic substitution at C=O with loss of carbonyl oxygen</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">15.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</p>

<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">22.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Conjugate addition and nucleophilic aromatic substitution</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">Interspersed with these chapters are others on physical aspects of molecular structure and reactivity, stereochemistry, and structural determination, which allow us to show you how we know what we are telling you is true and to explain reactions intelligently.</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">7.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Delocalization and conjugation</p>
<p class="num-bh"><span class="num-col">8.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Acidity, basicity, and p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub></p>

<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">18.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Review of spectroscopic methods</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;margin-top:0.8em;">By the time we reach the end of <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> you will have met most of the important ways in which organic molecules react with one another, and we will then spend two chapters revisiting some of the reactions you have met before in two chapters on selectivity: how to get the reaction you want to happen and avoid the reaction you don&#x2019;t.</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">23.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Chemoselectivity and protecting groups</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">24.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Regioselectivity</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-top:0.8em;">The materials are now in place for us to show you how to make use of the reaction mechanisms you have seen. We spend four chapters explaining some ways of using carbonyl chemistry and the chemistry of Si, S, and P to make C&#x2013;C and C=C bonds. We then bring this all together with a chapter which gives you the tools to work out how you might best set about making any particular molecule.</p>
<a id="page_xxi" class="page">Page xxi, Organic chemistry and this book</a>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">25.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Alkylation of enolates</p>

<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">28.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Retrosynthetic analysis</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;margin-top:0.8em;">Most organic compounds contain rings, and many cyclic structures entail one of two aspects which are rather special: aromaticity and well-defined conformations. The next group of chapters leads you through the chemistry of ring-containing compounds to the point where we have the tools to explain why even acyclic molecules react to give products with certain spatial features.</p>
<p class="num-bh1"><span class="num-col">29.</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Aromatic heterocycles 1: reactions</p>

<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;margin-top:0.8em;">We said that <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> marks the point where most of the important ways in which molecules react together have been introduced&#x2014;most but not all. For the next section of the book we survey a range of rather less common but extremely important alternative mechanisms, finishing with a chapter that tells you how we can find out what mechanism a reaction follows.</p>

<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;margin-top:0.8em;">The last few chapters of the book take you right into some of the most challenging roles that organic chemistry has been called on to play, and in many cases tell you about chemistry discovered only in the last few years. The reactions in these chapters have been used to make the most complex molecules ever synthesized, and to illuminate the way that organic chemistry underpins life itself.</p>

<p class="chapter" style="margin-top:1.5em;">&#x2018;Connections&#x2019; sections</p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">That&#x2019;s a linear list of 43 chapters, but chemistry is not a linear subject! It is impossible to work through the whole field of organic chemistry simply by starting at the beginning and working through to the end, introducing one new topic at a time, because chemistry is a network of interconnecting ideas. But, unfortunately, a book is, by nature, a beginning-to-end sort of thing. We have arranged the chapters in a progression of difficulty as far as is possible, but to help you find your way around we have included at the beginning of each chapter a &#x2018;Connections&#x2019; section. This tells you three things divided among three columns:</p>
<p class="alpha-bh" id="frnt-a"><span class="num-col">(a)</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The &#x2018;Building on&#x2019; column: what you should be familiar with before reading the chapter&#x2014;in other words, which previous chapters relate directly to the material within the chapter.</p>
<p class="alpha-bh" id="frnt-b"><span class="num-col">(b)</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The &#x2018;Arriving at&#x2019; column: a guide to what you will find within the chapter.</p>
<p class="alpha-bh" id="frnt-c"><span class="num-col">(c)</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The &#x2018;Looking forward to&#x2019; column: signposting which chapters later in the book fill out and expand the material in the chapter.</p>
<a id="page_xxii" class="page">Page xxii, Organic chemistry and this book</a>
<p class="indent-frnt">The first time you read a chapter, you should really make sure you have read any chapter mentioned under <a href="#frnt-a">(a)</a>. When you become more familiar with the book you will find that the links highlighted in <a href="#frnt-a">(a)</a> and <a href="#frnt-c">(c)</a> will help you see how chemistry interconnects with itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="chapter"><b>Boxes and margin notes</b></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="arrow">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="images"/> This sort of margin note will mainly contain cross-references to other parts of the book as a further aid to navigation. You will find an example on p. <a href="chapter_1.xhtml#page_10">10</a>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="noindent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:1.2em;">The other things you should look out for throughout the text are the margin notes and boxes. There are four sorts:</p>
<div class="ybox">
<p class="noindednt"><span class="bull1">&#8226;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The most important box looks like this. Anything in this sort of box is a key concept or a summary. It&#x2019;s the sort of thing you would do well to hold in your mind as you read or to note down as you learn.</b></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="bbox" style="width:70%;">
<p class="noindent" style="width:100%;">Boxes like this will contain additional examples, amusing background information, and similar interesting, but maybe inessential, material. The first time you read a chapter, you might want to miss out this sort of box, and only read them later on to flesh out some of the main themes of the chapter.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="gbox">
<p class="noindent2"><span class="squ">&#x25A0;</span> Sometimes the main text of the book needs clarification or expansion, and this sort of margin note will contain such little extras to help you understand difficult points. It will also remind you of things from elsewhere in the book that illuminate what is being discussed. You would do well to read these notes the first time you read the chapter, although you might choose to skip them later as the ideas become more familiar.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="chapter"><b>Online support</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">Organic structures and organic reactions are three-dimensional (3D), and as a complement to the necessarily two-dimensional representations in this book we have developed a comprehensive online resource to allow you to appreciate the material in three dimensions. ChemTube3D contains interactive 3D animations and structures, with supporting information, for some of the most important topics in organic chemistry, to help you master the concepts presented in this book. Online resources are flagged on the pages to which they relate by an icon in the margin. Each web page contains some information about the reaction and an intuitive interactive reaction scheme that controls the display. 3D curly arrows indicate the reaction mechanism, and the entire sequence from starting materials via transition state to products is displayed with animated bond-breaking and forming, and animated charges and lone pairs. The entire process is under the control of you, the user, and can be viewed in three dimensions from any angle. The resizable window button produces a larger window with a range of control options and the molecular photo booth allows you to make a permanent record of the view you want.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="mouse">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg" alt="images"/> This icon indicates that related interactive resources are available online. A full explanation of how to find these resources is given in a purple panel on the first page of each chapter</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent-frnt">ChemTube3D uses Jmol to display the animations so users can interact with the animated 3D structures using the pop-up menu or console using only a web browser. It is ideal for personalized learning and open-ended investigation is possible. We suggest that you make use of the interactive resources once you have read the relevant section of the book to consolidate your understanding of chemistry and enhance your appreciation of the importance of spatial arrangements.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Substantial modifications were made in the writing of this new edition, including the loss or contraction of four chapters found towards the end of the first edition. To preserve this material for future use, the following four chapters from the first edition are available for download from the book&#x2019;s website at <a href="http://www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/orc/clayden2e/">www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/orc/clayden2e/</a>:</p>

<p class="chapter"><b>Further reading</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:1.2em;">At the end of each chapter, you may find yourself wanting to know more about the material it covers. We have given a collection of suggested places to look for this material-other books, or reviews in the chemical literature, or even some original research papers. There are thousands of examples in this book, and in most cases we have not directed you to the reports of the original work&#x2014;this can usually be found by a simple electronic database search. Instead, we have picked out publications which seem most interesting, or relevant. If you want an encyclopaedia of organic chemistry, this is not the book for you. You would be better turning to one such as <i>March&#x2019;s Advanced Organic Chemistry</i> (M. B. Smith and J. March, 6th edn, Wiley, 2007), which contains thousands of references.</p>
<p class="chapter"><b>Problems</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">You can&#x2019;t learn all of organic chemistry&#x2014;there&#x2019;s just too much of it. You can learn trivial things like the names of compounds but that doesn&#x2019;t help you understand the principles behind the subject. You have to <i>understand</i> the principles because the only way to tackle organic chemistry is to learn to work it out. That is why we have provided problems, which you can access from the book&#x2019;s web site. They are to help you discover if you have understood the material presented in each chapter.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="mouse">
<p class="noindent2"><img src="../images/mouse.jpg" alt="images"/> To access the problems just visit <a href="http://www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/ orc/clayden2e">www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/ orc/clayden2e</a>. The problems are available free of charge; you&#x2019;ll just need the username and password given at the very front of this book</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="indent-frnt">If a chapter is about a certain type of organic reaction, say elimination reactions (<a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>), the chapter itself will describe the various ways (&#x2018;mechanisms&#x2019;) by which the reaction can occur and it will give definitive examples of each mechanism. In <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> there are three mechanisms and about 60 examples altogether. You might think that this is rather a lot but there are in fact millions of examples known of these three mechanisms and <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> barely scrapes the surface. The problems will help you make sure that your understanding is sound, and that it will stand up to exposure to the rigours of explaining real-life chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt">In general, the 10-15 problems at the end of each chapter start easy and get more difficult. They come in two or three sorts. The first, generally shorter and easier, allow you to revise the material in that chapter. They might revisit examples from the chapter to check that you can use the ideas in familiar situations. The next few problems might develop specific ideas from different parts of the chapter, asking you, for example, why one compound reacts in one way while a similar one behaves quite differently. Finally, you will find some more challenging problems asking you to extend the ideas to unfamiliar molecules, and, especially later in the book, to situations which draw on the material from more than one chapter.</p>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:1.2em;">The end-of-chapter problems should set you on your way but they are not the end of the j ourney to understanding. You are probably reading this text as part of a university course and you should find out what kind of examination problems your university uses and practise them too. Your tutor will be able to advise you on suitable problems to help you at each stage of your development.</p>
<p class="chapter"><b>The solutions manual</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt">The problems would be of little use to you if you could not check your answers. For maximum benefit, you need to tackle some or all of the problems as soon as you have finished each chapter without looking at the answers. Then you need to compare your suggestions with ours. You will find our suggestions in the accompanying solutions manual, where each problem is discussed in some detail. (You can buy the solutions manual separately from this book.) The purpose of the problem is first stated or explained. Then, if the problem is a simple one, the answer is given. If the problem is more complex, a discussion of possible answers follows with some comments on the value of each. There may be a reference to the source of the problem so that you can read further if you wish.</p>
<a id="page_xxiv" class="page">Page xxiv, Organic chemistry and this book</a>
<p class="chapter"><b>Colour</b></p>
<p class="noindent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">If you have flicked forward through the pages of this book, you will already have noticed something unusual: almost all of the chemical structures are shown in red. This is quite intentional: emphatic red underlines the message that structures are more important than words in organic chemistry. But sometimes small parts of structures are in other colours: here are two examples from p. <a href="chapter_1.xhtml#page_12">12</a>, where we talk about organic compounds containing elements other than C and H.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-5em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">
<img src="../images/frnt-1.jpg" alt="img"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Why are the atom labels black? Because we wanted them to stand out from the rest of the molecule. In general you will see black used to highlight the important details of a molecule&#x2014;they may be the groups taking part in a reaction, or something that has changed as a result of the reaction, as in these examples from <a href="chapter_9.xhtml">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="chapter_17.xhtml">17</a>.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8.5em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">
<img src="../images/frnt-2.jpg" alt="img"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-frnt" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">We shall often use black to emphasize &#x2018;curly arrows&#x2019;, devices that show the movement of electrons, and whose use you will learn about in <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. Here are examples from <a href="chapter_11.xhtml">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">22</a>: notice black also helps the &#x2018; + &#x2019; and &#x2018;-&#x2019; charges to stand out.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8.5em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">
<img src="../images/frnt-3.jpg" alt="img"/>

<p class="indent-frnt">Occasionally, we shall use other colours, such as green, orange, or brown, to highlight points of secondary importance. This example is part of a reaction taken from <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>: we want to show that a molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is formed. The green atoms show where the water comes from. Notice black curly arrows and a new black bond.</p>

<p class="indent-frnt">Other colours come in when things get more complicated&#x2014;in this <a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> example, we want to show two possible outcomes of a reaction: the brown and the orange arrows show the two alternatives, with the green highlighting the deuterium atom remaining in both cases.</p>

<p class="indent-frnt">And, in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, colour helps us highlight the difference between carbon atoms carrying four different groups and those with only three different groups. The message is: if you see something in a colour other than red, take special note&#x2014;the colour is there for a reason.</p>
