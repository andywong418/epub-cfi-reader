<h2 class="htwh2">Creative Chemistry</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Chemistry is above all a creative science. Nearly all that you have learned so far in this book has had one underlying aim: to teach you how to make molecules. This is after all what most chemists do, for whatever reason. Small amounts of many drugs can be isolated from plants or marine animals; much greater quantities are made by chemists in laboratories. A limited range of dyes can be extracted from plants; many more vivid and permanent ones are made by chemists in the laboratory. Synthetic polymers, created by chemists, have replaced more expensive and less durable alternatives like rubber. Despite the bad press it has received, the use of PVC as insulating material for electric wires has prevented numerous fires and saved many lives. Food is healthier and people live longer because well-designed and controlled pesticides allow agriculture to supply copious quantities of disease-free food to the shelves of our shops, markets, and supermarkets. Most of the improvements in the quality of life over the last 50 to 100 years can be traced to new molecules created by chemists. But, faced with the challenge of making a new compound, how do chemists go about deciding how to make it?</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Synthetic planning starts with the product, which is fixed and unchangeable, and works backwards towards the starting materials. This process is called <i>retrosynthesis,</i> and the art of planning the synthesis of a target molecule is called <i>retrosynthetic analysis.</i> The aim of this chapter is to introduce you to the principles of retrosynthetic analysis: once you have read and understood it you will be well on the way to designing your own organic syntheses.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_28.2">
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Retrosynthetic analysis: synthesis backwards</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Most of the chemistry you have learned so far has concentrated on <i>reactions</i> (questions like 'What do you need to add to X to get Y?') or on <i>products</i> (questions like 'What will happen if X and Y react together?'). Now we're looking at starting materials (questions like 'What X and Y do you need to react together to make Z?'). We're looking at reactions in reverse, and we have a special symbol for a reverse reaction called a retrosynthetic arrow (the 'implies' arrow from
a retrosynthetic arrow	logic). A scheme with a retrosynthetic arrow (margin) means 'Z could be made from X plus Y'.</p>

repellent. As it&#x2019;s an
ester, we know that it can be made from alcohol plus acyl chloride, and we can represent this
using a retrosynthetic arrow.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwblue">
<h3 class="h3">Arrow</h3>
<p class="htwnoindenta">You now know four types of arrow: the simple reaction arrow &#x279B;
 meaning &#x2019;reacts to give&#x2019;, the delocalization arrow &#x2194; meaning &#x2019;two
 different ways to draw the same delocalized structure&#x2019;, the equilibrium arrow
 &#x21CC; meaning &#x2019;these two structures are interconverting&#x2019;, and now
 the retrosynthesis arrow &#x21D2;meaning &#x2019;could be made from&#x2019;.</p>
</div>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/> This chapter will rely heavily on 
the reactions you have met earlier in the book, and should therefore provide you with the 
opportunity to revise them and check you understand how they work. If you come across a 
reaction you aren&#x2019;t familiar with, look it up before carrying on to the next one.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The aromatic amide amelfolide is a cardiac antiarrhythmic agent. Because 
we see that it is an amide, we know that it can be made quite simply from p&#x002D;nitrobenzoyl 
chloride and 2,6&#x002D;dimethylaniline&#x002D;
again, we can represent this using a retrosynthetic arrow. Mentally breaking a molecule
into its component parts like this is known as disconnection, and it&#x2019;s helpful to indicate
the site of the disconnection with a wiggly line as we have here.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_28.3">
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Disconnections must correspond to known, reliable reactions</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The chemists who first made amelfolide chose to make it from an amine and an acyl chloride because they knew that this reaction, a standard way of making an amide, had a very good chance of success. They chose to disconnect the C&#x2014;N bond because this disconnection corresponds to a reliable reaction in a way that no other possible disconnection of this molecule does.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">Now that you&#x2019;ve seen the principle of retrosynthetic analysis at work, you should be able to suggest a reasonable disconnection of the compound in the margin, known as daminozide. You probably spotted immediately that daminozide is again an amide, so the best disconnection is the C&#x2014;N bond, which could take us back to acyl chloride and dimethylhydrazine. This time we&#x2019;ve written &#x2019;C&#x2014;N amide&#x2019; above the retrosynthetic arrow as a reminder of why we&#x2019;ve made the disconnection and we advise you to follow this practice.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Now, in fact, there is a problem with this acyl chloride&#x2014;it would be unstable as it can cyclize to an anhydride. But this poses no problem for the synthesis of daminozide&#x2014;we could just use the anhydride instead, since the reaction should be just as reliable. A better retrosynthesis therefore gives the anhydride and indeed this is how daminozide is made.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_28.4">
<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Synthons are idealized reagents</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">In the synthesis of daminozide an anhydride is used out of necessity rather than out of choice, but it often turns out that there are several alternative reagents all corresponding to <a id="page_696" class="page">Page 696, Chapter 28 Retrosynthetic analysis</a>the same disconnection. Paracetamol, for example, is an amide that can be disconnected either to amine &#x002B; acyl chloride or to amine &#x002B; anhydride.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_696_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Which reagent is best can often only be determined by experimentation&#x2014;commercially, paracetamol is made from <i>para-aminophenol</i> and acetic anhydride largely because the by-product, acetic acid, is easier to handle than HCl. In a retrosynthetic analysis, we don&#x2019;t really want to be bothered by this sort of decision, which is best made later, so it&#x2019;s useful to have a single way of representing the key attributes of alternative reagents. We can depict both anhydride and acyl chloride in this scheme as an &#x2019;idealized reagent&#x2019;&#x2014;an electrophilic acetyl group MeCO&#x002B;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_696_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">We call such idealized reagents <b>synthons</b>. Synthons are fragments of molecules with an associated polarity (represented by a &#x2019; &#x002B; &#x2019; or &#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2019;) which stand for the reagents we are going to use in the forward synthesis. They are not themselves reagents, although they may occasionally turn out to be intermediates along the reaction pathway. By disconnecting bonds to synthons rather than to actual reagents we can indicate the polarity of the bond-forming reaction we are going to use without having to specify details of the reagents.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_696_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We can apply these ideas to the synthesis of the herbicide 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid). The most reasonable disconnection of an ether is the C&#x2014;O bond because we know that
ethers can be made from alkyl halides by substitution with an alkoxide anion. We don&#x2019;t at
this stage need to decide exactly which alkyl halide or alkoxide to use, so we just write the
synthons.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwgreen">
<p class="htwnoindenta"><img src="../images/square.jpg"/> You will find that you learn much more and much faster if you try to do the retrosynthetic analyses in this chapter as you read it, before looking at the suggested solutions. Use a piece of paper to cover up the rest of the page as you read, and write some ideas down on another piece of paper. Don't just say &#x2019;oh I can do that' and move on&#x2014;you'll miss out on the chance of teaching yourself a lot of chemistry. Don't waste the opportunity&#x0021; Next time you read this chapter you'll have your memory as an aid&#x2014;and retrosynthetic analysis isn't about remembering; it's about deducing. Another important thing about retrosyn thetic analysis is that there is rarely one single &#x2019;right' answer, so even if your suggestions don't match up with ours,don't be discouraged. Aim to learn from the points where your attempts differ from our suggestions.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="htwindent1">Once the retrosynthetic analysis is done, we can go back and use our knowledge of chem-
istry to think of reagents corresponding to these synthons. Here, for example, we should cer-
tainly choose the anion of the phenol as the nucleophile and some functionalized acetic acid
molecule with a leaving group in the a position.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_696_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We can then write out a suggested synthesis in full from start to finish. It isn&#x2019;t reasonable to try to predict exact conditions for a reaction: to do that you would need to conduct a thorough search of the chemical literature and do some experiments. However, all of the syntheses in this chapter are real examples and we shall often give full details of conditions to help you become familiar with them.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Choosing a disconnection</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The hardest task in designing a retrosynthetic analysis is spotting where to make the disconnections. We shall offer some guidelines to help you, but the best way to learn is through experience and practice. The overall aim of retrosynthetic analysis is to get back to starting materials that are available from chemical suppliers, and to do this as efficiently as possible.</p>
<div class="htwyellow1">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"/> <b>Guideline 1</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>Disconnections must correspond to known, reliable reactions.</b></p>
</div>
<p class="htwindent1">We have already mentioned that disconnections must correspond to known reliable reactions and it&#x2019;s the most important thing to bear in mind when working out a retrosynthesis. When we disconnected the ether 2,4-D we chose to disconnect next to the oxygen atom because we know about the synthesis of ethers. We chose <i>not</i> to disconnect on the aryl side of the oxygen atom because we know of no reliable reaction corresponding to nucleophilic attack of an alcohol on an unactivated aromatic ring.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_697_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="htwtwoblue">
<p class="htwnoindent"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/> We talked about cases where nucleophilic aromatic substitution <i>is</i> possible in <a href="chapter_22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>.</p>
</div></aside>
<div class="htwyellow1">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"/> <b>Guideline 2</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>For compounds consisting of two parts joined by a heteroatom, 
disconnect next to the heteroatom.</b></p>
</div>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="htwindent1">In all the retrosynthetic analyses you&#x2019;ve seen so far there is a heteroatom (N or O) joining the rest of the molecule together, and in each case we made the disconnection next to that N or O. This guideline works for esters, amides, ethers, amines, acetals, sulfides, and so on because these compounds are often made by a substitution reaction. Chlorbenside is used to kill ticks and mites. Using Guideline 2 we can suggest a disconnection next to the sulfur atom; using Guideline 1 we know that we must disconnect on the alkyl and not on the aryl side.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_697_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">We can now suggest reagents corresponding to the synthons and propose a synthetic scheme.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">The next example is the ethyl ester of, and precursor to, cetaben, a drug that can be used to 
lower blood lipid levels. It is an amine, so we disconnect next to the nitrogen atom.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_698_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The alkyl bromide is available but we shall need to make the aromatic amino-ester and the
 best disconnection for an ester is the C&#x2014;O bond between the carbonyl group and the esterify- ing group.</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_698_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We have now designed a two-step synthesis of our target molecule, and this is how it is

<h2 class="htwh2"><b>Multiple step syntheses: avoid chemoselectivity problems</b></h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The next compound was an intermediate in the synthesis of the potential anti-obesity 
drug ICI-D7114. You can spot that, with two ethers and an amine functional group, it requires several
 disconnections to take it back to simple compounds. The question is, which do we do first? One way to 
solve the problem is to write down all the possibilities and see which looks best. Here there are four 
reasonable disconnections: one at each of the ether groups <i>(a</i> and <i>b)</i> or on either side of
 the amine (c and d).</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_698_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a id="page_699" class="page">Page 699, Chapter 28 Retrosynthetic analysis</a></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Both <i>(a)</i> and (b) pose problems of chemoselectivity as it would be hard to alkylate the phenol in 
the presence of the basic nitrogen atom. Between (c) and (d), (c) appears to be the better choice because 
the next disconnection after (d) will have to be an alkylation of O in the presence of an NH<sub>2</sub> group. 
To avoid chemoselectivity problems like this, we want to try to <i>intro-duce reactive groups late in
 the synthesis.</i> In terms of retrosynthetic analysis, then, we can formulate another guideline.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoviolet"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg"></img> We talked about this type of
 thing in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>.</p></aside>
<div class="htwyellow1">
<p class="htwdivi" style="color:red"><img src="../images/dot.jpg"></img> <b>Guideline 3</b></p>
<p class="htwdivi"><b>Consider alternative disconnections and choose routes that avoid chemoselectivity problems&#x2014; often this
 means disconnecting reactive groups first.</b></p></div>
<p class="htwindent1">This guideline helps us in the next retrosynthetic step for the ICI-D7114 intermediate.
 Disconnection (<i>c</i>) gave us a compound with two ethers that might be disconnected further by disconnection
 (e) or (f).</p>
<figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_699_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
 
<p class="htwindent1">Disconnection (<i>e</i>) requires alkylation of a compound that is itself an alkylating agent. 
Disconnection (f is much more satisfactory and leads to a compound that is easily disconnected to 4-hydroxyphenol 
and 1,2-dibromoethane. Using Guideline 3, we can say that it's best to disconnect the bromoethyl group f) before
 the benzyl group (g) because the bromo- ethyl group is more reactive and more likely to cause problems of 
chemoselectivity.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Functional group interconversion</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The antihypertensive drug ofornine contains an amide and an amine functional group,
 and we need to decide which to disconnect first. If we disconnect the secondary amine first (b), we will 
have chemoselectivity problems constructing the amide in the presence of the resulting NH<sub>2</sub> group.</p>
 <figure class="fig3"><img src="../images/page_699_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
 
<p class="htwindent1">Yet disconnection (<i>a</i>), on the face of it, seems to pose an even greater problem 
because we now have to construct an amine in the presence of an acyl chloride&#x0021; However, we shall want
 to make the acyl chloride from the carboxylic acid, which can then easily be disconnected to 2&#x002D;aminobenzoic
 acid (anthranilic acid) and 4&#x002D;chloropyridine.<a id="page_700" class="page">Page 700, Chapter 28 The retrosynthetic analysis</a></p>

<p class="htwindent1">The retrosynthetic transformation of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid is not really a disconnection because nothing is being disconnected. We call it instead a functional group interconversion, or FGI, as written above the retrosynthetic arrow. Functional group interconversions often aid disconnections because the sort of reactive functional groups (acyl chlorides, alkyl halides) we want in starting materials are not desirable in compounds to be disconnected because they pose chemoselectivity problems. They are also useful if the target molecule contains functional groups that are not easily disconnected.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_700_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="htwindent1">By using an appropriate reagent or series of reagents, almost any functional group can be converted into any other. You should already have a fair grasp of reasonable functional group interconversions. They mostly fall into the categories of oxidations, reductions, and substitutions (Chapters 10, 11, 15, and 23).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Amine synthesis using functional group interconversions</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The synthesis of amines poses a special problem because only in certain cases is the obvious disconnection successful.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_700_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The problem is that the product is usually more reactive than the starting material and there is a danger that multiple alkylation will take place.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue" style="padding:0.3em"> <img src="../images/arrow.jpg"/>&#160;We discussed this in Chapters 11 and 23.</p></aside>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_700_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwnoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The few successful examples you have seen so far in this chapter have been exceptions, for either steric or electronic reasons, and from now on we advise you to avoid disconnecting an amine in this way. Sometimes further alkylation is made unfavourable by the increased steric hindrance that would result: this is probably the case for the cetaben ethyl ester we made by this reaction.</p>

There are two main ones, and both involve functional group interconversion, with the reactive amine being converted to a less reactive derivative before disconnection.

<p class="htwindent1">In using the epoxide we have gone one step beyond all the disconnections we have talked about so far because we have <i>used one functional group to help disconnect another</i>&#x2014;in other words, we noticed the alcohol adjacent to the ether we wanted to disconnect and managed to involve them both in the disconnection. Such disconnections are known as two-group disconnections, and you should always be on the look-out for opportunities of using them because they are an efficient way of getting back to simple starting materials. We call this epoxide disconnection a
1.2-	disconnection because the two functional groups in the two-group disconnection are in a

<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_709_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">1,1 C-C disconnections</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">All of these disconnections relied on the reaction of a carbon electrophile with a nucleophilic functional group. The alternative, reaction of a carbon nucleophile (such as a Grignard reagent) with an electrophilic functional group, allows us to do C&#x2014;C disconnections on alcohols. For example, this compound, which has a fragrance reminiscent of lilac, is a useful perfume in soap because (unlike many other perfumes that are aldehydes or ketones) it is stable to alkali.<a id="page_710" class="page">Page 710, Chapter 28: The retrosynthetic analysis</a></p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_710_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We look to the one functional group, the hydroxyl, to tell us where to disconnect, and disconnection next to the OH group gives two synthons for which sensible reagents are a Grignard reagent and acetone. The perfume is made from benzyl chloride and acetone in this way. Notice that we label these disconnections 1,1 C&#x2014;C because the bond being disconnected is attached to the same carbon atom as the hydroxyl functional group.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_710_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This similar alcohol has a &#x2018;peony-like fruity odour&#x2019;and could be disconnected in three ways.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_710_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">Disconnection (c) leads back to a ketone, which is cheaply made starting from acetone and
benzaldehyde, and this was the route that was chosen for the synthesis.</p>

<img src="../images/page_710_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Double disconnections can be a short cut</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Tertiary alcohols with two identical groups next to the hydroxyl group are often made by attack of two equivalents of a Grignard reagent on an ester. The synthesis of the antihistamine compound fenpiprane provides an example: the tertiary alcohol is a precursor to the drug and can be disconnected to ester &#x002B; Grignard reagent because of the two Ph groups. The ester required has a 1,3 functional group relationship, and can be disconnected to amine plus Michael acceptor.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_710_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The fact that Grignard reagents add twice to esters means that disconnection of a <i>ketone</i> in this way is often not reliable because the Grignard reagent adds to the ketone.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Available starting materials</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">Although any of the three routes to the &#x2018;fruity peony perfume&#x2019;on p. <a href="chapter_28.xhtml#page_710">710</a> would give an acceptable synthesis, the key factor in choosing route (c) was the ease of synthesis of the starting materials from available compounds. But how can you know which materials will be available? So far in this chapter we have avoided this question, and often our retrosynthetic analyses have been incomplete because the suggested starting materials must themselves be synthesized in the laboratory. From now on, however, we will take every analysis back to available starting materials to help you get a feel for what is, and is not, available.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">The only way to be absolutely sure what you can buy is to look up a 
compound in a supplier&#x2019;s catalogue, and this is what a chemist would do when assessing 
possible alternative synthetic routes. A good rule of thumb is that <b>compounds with up to 
about six carbon atoms and with one functional group</b> (alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, acid, amine, double bond, or alkyl halide) are usually available. This is less true for heavily branched compounds, but most straight-chain compounds with these functional groups are available up to eight or more carbon atoms. Cyclic compounds with one functional group from five-to eight-membered are also available. Of course, many other compounds are available too, including some difunctional compounds. Here are a few of them.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_711_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">You will soon start to appreciate what is available as you see which compounds we use as starting materials. Supplier&#x2019;s catalogues are available free for the asking and make quite useful <a id="page_712" class="page">Page 712,Chapter 28 The retrosynthetic analysis</a>textbooks. You could consider getting one. In addition, online and CD catalogues are available in most chemistry departments and can be searched by structure.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_28.10">
<h2 class="htwh2">Donor and acceptor synthons</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">You&#x2019;ve now met a variety of synthons and it&#x2019;s useful to be able to classify them as <i>donor</i> or <i>acceptor</i> synthons. We call a negatively polarized synthon a donor synthon and give it the symbol &#x2018;d&#x2019;. Positively polarized synthons are called acceptor synthons and are given the symbol &#x2018;a&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">We can classify the synthons further according to where the functional group is in relation to the reactive site. The first synthon in the diagram below, which corresponds to an aldehyde, we call an a<sup>1</sup> synthon because it is an acceptor that carries a functional group on the same carbon as its reactive centre. The second is a d<sup>2</sup> synthon because it is a donor whose reacting site is in the 2-position relative to the carbonyl group. Earlier you met two other types of syn-thon, corresponding to epoxide and Michael acceptor, and we can now classify these as a<sup>2</sup> and a<sup>3</sup> synthons.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_712_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This terminology is useful because it reduces synthons to the bare essentials: what polarity they are and where the polarity is sited. The actual functional group they carry is, as you now appreciate, less important because FGI will usually allow us to turn one functional group into another.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">Two-group C-C disconnections</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1,3-	Difunctionalized compounds</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">It&#x2019;s not only Grignard reagents that will react with aldehydes or ketones to make alcohols: enolates will too&#x2014;we spent <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> discussing this reaction, the aldol reaction, its variants, and ways to control it.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_712_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The aldol reaction is extremely important in organic synthesis because it makes compounds with two functional groups in a 1,3-relationship. Whenever you spot this 1,3-relationship in a target molecule&#x2014;think aldol&#x0021; In disconnection terms we can represent it like this.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_712_3.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_713" class="page">Page 713,Chapter 28 The retrosynthetic analysis</a></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We call this disconnection a two-group C&#x2014;C disconnection because we are using the OH and the C&#x003D;O groups together to guide our disconnection. The disconnection gives us a d<sup>2</sup> synthon, for which we shall use an enolate equivalent, and an a<sup>1</sup> synthon, for which we shall use an aldehyde or a ketone. <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> has many examples and perhaps gingerol is the best. As soon as you see the 1,3-relationship, the disconnection should be obvious.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_713_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The &#x03B2;-hydroxy carbonyl products of aldol reactions are often very easily dehydrated to give a,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and if you spot an &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl group in the molecule, you should aim to make it by an aldol reaction. You will first need to do an FGI to the &#x03B2;-hydroxy carbonyl compound, then disconnect as before.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_713_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">This aldehyde is an intermediate in the synthesis of the tranquillizer oxanamide. Because both components of the aldol reaction are the same, no special precautions need to be taken to prevent side reactions occurring. In the synthesis, the dehydration happens spontaneously.</p>

<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_713_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The next compound was needed for an early synthesis of carotene. Again, it&#x2019;s an a,P- unsaturated ketone so we can disconnect using the same &#x2018;a,P&#x2019;disconnection. The aldehyde generated by this first disconnection is also a, P-unsaturated, so we can do another a, P disconnection, back to a ketone whose synthesis we have already discussed (p. <a href="chapter_28.xhtml#page_708">708</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_713_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">An aldol reaction using the enolate of acetaldehyde and requiring it to react with a ketone is doomed to failure: acetaldehyde itself is far too good an electrophile. In the forward synthesis, therefore, this first step was carried out at the ester oxidation level, and the ester was subsequently converted to the aldehyde by a reduction of the kind discussed in <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">There was no problem with selectivity in the second aldol reaction because the aldehyde is not enolizable. The Reformatsky reaction in this sequence illustrates the fact that, as you saw in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, aldol-type reactions happen at the ester oxidation level as well, and you should equally look to disconnect &#x03B2;-hydroxy or &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated esters, acids, or nitriles in this way. Just remember to look for 1,3-relationships, convert the functional groups to oxygen-based ones, and disconnect them to d<sup>2</sup> plus a<sup>1</sup> synthons.</p>

<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwindent1">Again, the forward reaction was best done using malonate chemistry, but the variant with

<h3 class="h3">Look out for concealed functional group relationships</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">The analgesic doxpicomine is a more difficult problem than those you have seen so far.

However,<a id="page_715" class="page">Page 715,Chapter 28 The retrosynthetic analysis</a> removal of the acetal reveals a 1,3-diol that could be formed by reduction of a much more promising diester.</p>

<img src="../images/page_715_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The diester has a 1,3-diCO relationship and could be disconnected but we have in mind using malonate so we would rather disconnect the alternative 3-amino carbonyl compound (the Me<sub>2</sub>N group has a 1,3-relationship with both ester groups) by a 1,3-diX disconnection giving an unsaturated ester. This &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ester disconnects nicely to a heterocyclic aldehyde and diethyl malonate.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_715_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The synthesis is shorter than the retrosynthetic analysis and involves only four steps. Good retrosynthetic analysis, using two-group disconnections, should lead to short syntheses.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Aldol-style disconnections with N and O in a 1,3-relationship: I</h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">Nitriles form another important class of compounds that undergoes aldol-type additions to aldehydes and ketones. Because nitriles can be reduced to amines, this reaction provides another useful route to 3-amino alcohols.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">This reaction, coupled with the reduction of cyanohydrins (<a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>), means that compounds with either a 1,3- or a 1,2-relationship between N and O can be made from nitriles.</p>

<img src="../images/page_716_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="htwindent1">In the forward synthesis, it turned out that the nitrile reduction was best done using hydrogen and a metal (Rh) catalyst. The final methylation of the primary amine had to be done via the imine and iminium ion (see <a href="chapter_23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>) to prevent further unwanted alkylations. The reagent was an excess of formaldehyde (methanal CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;O) in the presence of formic acid (HCO<sub>2</sub>H), which acts as a reducing agent.</p>

<p class="htwnoindent">Another important reaction for making amines with a 1,3-relationship to a carbonyl group is the Mannich reaction. You met this reaction in <a href="chapter_26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> as a way of doing otherwise unreliable aldol additions to formaldehyde. Because the amine is introduced directly and not by reduction of a nitrile, it can have two alkyl groups from the start. Compare this scheme with the one above using a nitrile group as the source of the amine.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Using Guideline 5 (p. <a href="chapter_28.xhtml#page_709">709</a>) we want to convert the halide to an oxygen-based group, and a sensible solution is to choose the ketone. 1,3-Disconnection of this compound corresponds to a Mannich reaction.

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Claisen ester disconnection: a 1,3-diO relationship needing two carbonyl groups</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">1,3-Diketones can be disconnected in a similar way: this time the disconnection corresponds to a Claisen condensation, but it's still 1,3-diO and again you need to look out for the 1,3 relationship. The synthons are still d<sup>2</sup> plus a<sup>1</sup> but the a<sup>1</sup> synthon is used at the ester oxidation level. This diketone is the starting material for the synthesis of the antidepressant tazadolene. With 1,3-diketones, there's always a choice where to disconnect, and you should be guided by which disconnection (a) corresponds to the most reliable reaction and (b) gives the simplest starting materials. In this case, it's much better to disconnect back to cyclohexanone.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

<p class="htwindent1">The synthesis is interesting because, after the acylation of the enamine,

Dehydration and double alkylation then gives tazadolene. Step 3, the attack of benzylamine on the diketone, has interesting chemoselectivity. Only the ketone in the six-membered ring is attacked while the less reactive conjugated phenyl ketone is not affected.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">Notice that the acceptor synthons have odd numbers; the donor synthon has an even number: donor and acceptor properties alternate along the chain as we move away from a carbonyl group. This 'natural reactivity' of carbonyl compounds explains why we find it easy to discuss ways of making 1,3- and 1,5-difunctionalized compounds&#x2014;because they arise from a<sup>1</sup> &#x002B; d<sup>2</sup> and from a<sup>3</sup> &#x002B; d<sup>2</sup>. Reagents corresponding to synthons like d<sup>1</sup> or a<sup>2</sup> are rarer, and therefore compounds with 1,2- or 1,4-related functional groups require special consideration retrosynthetically.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">You have in fact met one example of each of the 'unnatural' synthons with a<sup>2</sup> and d<sup>1</sup> reactivity. Such synthons are given the German name <i>umpolung,</i> meaning 'inverse polarity', because their natural reactivity is reversed, and umpolung reagents are the key to the synthesis of 1,2- and 1,4-difunctionalized compounds.</p>
<figure class="fig3">

</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We shall finish this chapter by looking at disconnections of 1,2- and 1,4-difunctionalized compounds because these require us to use reagents with umpolung equivalent to d<sup>1</sup>, d<sup>3</sup>, a<sup>2</sup>, and a<sup>4</sup> synthons. There are very many reagents for these synthons&#x2014;if you are interested to learn more, consult a specialized book.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1.2-	<b>Difunctional compounds</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">You met ways of making 1,2-difunctionalized compounds when we first talked about two- group disconnections, and we used an epoxide as an a<sup>2</sup> synthon. Epoxides are, of course, also
1.2-	functionalized, and in fact this is often the key to making 1,2-functionalized compounds: use something with the 1,2 relationship already in place. You saw lots of examples of this type of strategy earlier in this chapter. Perhaps the simplest approach is electrophilic addition to alkenes. If the alkene is made by a Wittig reaction, the disconnection is (eventually) between the two functionalized carbon atoms in the target molecule. This example shows dihydroxyl- ation as the electrophilic addition but there is also epoxidation, bromination, and bromination in water to give Br and OH as the functional groups.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="htwtwoblue"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" /> All of the electrophilic additions to alkenes were discussed in <a href="chapter_19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>. Dihydroxylation is on p. <a href="chapter_19.xhtml#page_442">442</a>.</p>

<p class="htwindent1">A normal C&#x2014;C disconnection is also a possibility, but disconnection to the 'natural' a<sup>1</sup> synthon and the umpolung d<sup>1</sup> is necessary. One very useful umpolung reagent is cyanide, and you can see it in action in this synthesis of the tranquillizer phenaglycodol. The tertiary alcohol with two R groups the same should prompt you to think of doing a double Grignard addition to an ester. FGI then reveals the nitrile functional group necessary for a 1,2-diX disconnection to cyanide plus ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_720_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">The starting material is obviously available by a Friedel&#x2014;Crafts acylation of chlorobenzene and the rest of the synthesis follows. Note that the nitrile can be converted directly into the ester with acidic ethanol and that an excess of Grignard reagent is needed because the free OH group destroys some of it.<a id="page_721" class="page">Page 721, Chapter 28 Retrosynthetic analysis </a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>1,4-Difunctional compounds</b></h3>
<p class="htwnoindent">There are more possibilities here and we shall finish this chapter with a brief analysis of them to show you how much of this subject lies beyond what we can do in this book.</p>
<p class="htwindent1">If we start with a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound we might consider first disconnection of the central bond.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_721_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">We can use an enolate for one reagent but the other will have to have umpolung. This is not a very difficult kind of umpolung as an a-bromo carbonyl compound will do the job nicely if we select our enol(ate) equivalent carefully. In <a href="chapter_25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> we suggested enamines for this job. The synthesis becomes:</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_721_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">If we attempt the disconnection of one of the other bonds, two possibilities are available because the two fragments are different. We can use either a d<sup>1</sup> &#x002B; a<sup>3</sup> strategy or an a<sup>1</sup> &#x002B; d<sup>3</sup> strategy. In each case we have one natural synthon and one with umpolung.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_721_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">These strategies are more difficult to realize with the reagents you have met so far but conjugate addition of a cyanide to an unsaturated carbonyl compound would be an example of the d<sup>1</sup> &#x002B; a<sup>3</sup> strategy. We have included these to try to convince you that there is no escape from umpolung in the synthesis of a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound. If you were making this keto-ester you would have to consider seriously two of the above three strategies.</p>
<figure class="fig3">
<img src="../images/page_721_5.jpg" alt="images"/>
<a id="page_722" class="page">Page 722, Chapter 28 Retrosynthetic analysis </a>
</figure>
<p class="htwindent1">There is one way to avoid umpolung and that is to make the disconnection outside the 1,4 relationship. As it happens, we have already seen this strategy in action (p. <a href="chapter_24.xhtml#page_568">568</a>). It involves a Friedel&#x2014;Crafts acylation of benzene (<a href="chapter_21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) with a cyclic anhydride and leads directly to this product by quite a short route. This strategy is available only if there happens to be a starting material available to suit any particular case.</p>

<h2 class="htwh2">To conclude...</h2>
<p class="htwnoindent">The best synthetic route to a molecule cannot be predicted with certainty. Retrosynthetic analysis allows you to suggest several different strategies for any given target molecule, and thorough literature searching plus experimentation in the laboratory will allow you to whittle the possibilities down to the most likely to succeed. Thinking like this underpins the design of syntheses of molecules, from the relatively simple molecules forming the next generation of drugs or agrochemicals to the most complex molecules known. Retrosynthetic thinking also reinforces the concept that the combination of electrophile and nucleophile is the basis for the understanding of organic reactions. Synthesis and reactions are two sides of the same coin. From now on we shall use the methods and terminology introduced in this chapter when we think that they will help you to develop your understanding.</p>
