<h1 class="main">6 Reactions with radical intermediates</h1>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="Ch06-6.1">
<h2 class="h2">6.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="banoindent">In <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">5</a> the reaction mechanisms all involved the transfer of pairs of electrons. These are heterolytic reactions and often have charged intermediates. In this chapter we will be looking at <i>homolytic reactions</i> which involve <i>radical</i> intermediates. A radical has an odd <i>unpaired electron,</i> and is normally uncharged. Radicals are electron-deficient in the sense that the atom carrying the unpaired electron is one electron short of a stable outer shell, such as carbon or chlorine with seven electrons instead of eight. For drawing mechanisms involving single electron transfers we use <i>fishhook arrows</i> (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_20">p. 20</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Formation and reactions of radicals</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">In order to unpair two bonding electrons to make two radicals we need to supply energy, usually as heat or light (often high-energy ultraviolet light). The formation of radicals at the beginning of a reaction is called the <i>initiation.</i> The reaction then continues by the <i>propagation</i> steps, in which a radical reacts with a molecule to give another radical as one of the products. The propagation steps can go on and on to make a <i>chain reaction,</i> until two radicals combine to form a stable compound; this is the <i>termination</i> reaction. We will now look at these three processes, <i>initiation, propagation,</i> and <i>termination,</i> for the radical chlorination of methane.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.2 Halogenation of hydrocarbons</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The radical chlorination of methane</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">This is a chain reaction.</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Initiation.</i> Chlorine and methane are mixed and either irradiated with ultraviolet light or left in sunlight, of which ultraviolet light forms a part. The energy of the light is absorbed by the chlorine molecules, which split <i>homolytically</i> to give two radicals. It is a photochemical reaction.</p>

<p class="banoindent">This is energetically easier than splitting the stronger H&#x2013;CH<sub>3</sub> bond of methane. <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Chapter 6 Reactions With Radical Intermediates</a></p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Propagation.</i> Each chlorine radical takes a hydrogen atom from methane to produce HCl and a new radical <sup>&#8226;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>, in which the C atom has a share in only 7 outer shell electrons.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page76-1.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure>
<p class="banoindent-v">The new methyl radical <sup>&#8226;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> can then take a chlorine atom from Cl<sub>2</sub> to make CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and another chlorine radical.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page76-2.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure>
<p class="banoindent-v">This chlorine radical can go on to react with another molecule of methane, and so on. Notice that in each of these propagation steps there is an odd number of electrons on both sides of the equation.</p>


<p class="baindent"><i>Termination.</i> The propagation chain is broken when any of the radicals involved reacts to form only electron-paired compounds. Here the propagation radicals are Cl<sup>&#8226;</sup> and <sup>&#8226;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>, so that the most likely chain termination reactions are combinations of these radicals.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">This is the major overall reaction if there are equimolar amounts of Cl<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. If there is more Cl<sub>2</sub>, the reaction can go on to give CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and eventually CCl<sub>4</sub> as well as HCl. The <i>propagation</i> steps for CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> are:</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page77-2.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Write the corresponding steps for CHCl<sub>3</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub>. Remember that the termination steps are any combination of chain-carrying radicals. By adjusting the relative amounts of CH<sub>4</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub>, you can make mostly CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, or CCl<sub>4</sub>. Draw radical flow diagrams for these, too.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Bromination of methane</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The photochemical bromination of methane is a very similar radical reaction. It starts with the homolytic splitting of the Br&#x2013;Br bond to give two bromine radicals. The propagation steps, involving Br<sup>&#8226;</sup> and <sup>&#8226;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>, follow and the termination is a combination of two radicals. Draw the mechanisms for the <i>initiation, propagation,</i> and <i>termination</i> steps for this reaction, using fishhook arrows. Draw a radical flow diagram for this reaction as well.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Halogenation of other hydrocarbons</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Chlorination and bromination of methane are relatively simple because methane has only one type of C&#x2013;H bond. Propane, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, has methyl C&#x2013;H&#x2019;s (six) and CH<sub>2</sub> C&#x2013;H&#x2019;s (two). Two different hydrocarbon radicals can be formed, primary CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup> and secondary CH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup>CHCH<sub>3</sub>. The secondary CH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup>CHCH<sub>3</sub> radical is more easily formed because the CH<sub>2</sub> C&#x2013;H bonds are weaker than methyl C&#x2013;H bonds; <i>but</i> there are three times as many methyl C&#x2013;H bonds. These factors are closely balanced and mixtures of products are often obtained.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">On an industrial scale it is sometimes worthwhile to separate these mixtures.</p>

<p class="baindent">In the photochemical chlorination of methylbenzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> , the side-chain radical C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup> is much more stable and is more easily formed than any of the ring radicals, such as the one shown in the margin. This is because <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Chapter 6 Reactions With Radical Intermediates</a>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup> is stabilized by delocalization (we shall see this type of radical again in the polymerization of phenylethene; see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_81">p. 81</a>).</p>

<p class="banoindent">These radical reactions are very important because an inert hydrocarbon is turned into a more reactive halocompound, allowing access to a wide range of organic reactions.</p>

<p class="banoindent">The mechanism of these reactions is not fully understood. Both alkene and hydrogen are probably absorbed on the catalyst surface, and the H<sub>2</sub> molecule is probably split into hydrogen atoms. The reaction is thus <i>heterogeneous</i> (taking place in <i>more than one phase,</i> here gas + solid) and <i>homolytic</i> (H&#x2013;H goes to 2H<sup>&#8226;</sup>, bonding electrons shared evenly). <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Chapter 6 Reactions With Radical Intermediates</a></p>
<p class="baindent">This reaction is very important industrially, for example in the conversion (&#8216;hardening&#8217;) of oils into fats, such as the hydrogenation of palm oil for margarine manufacture. Nickel catalysts, being relatively cheap and robust, are commonly used. In research laboratories, where smaller amounts of more delicate chemicals are used, the more expensive and more reactive Pd or Pt catalysts are usually used.</p>
<p class="baindent">Benzene rings are much more resistant to hydrogenation than alkenes (see the phenylethene reaction) and usually need high pressure and high temperature, even with more reactive catalysts. This is an important difference (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_68">p. 68</a>).</p>
<p class="baindent">Notice that the <i>nucleophilic</i> reducing agent LiAlH<sub>4</sub> does <i>not</i> react with benzene or ethene.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.4 The cracking of hydrocarbons</h2>
<p class="banoindent">The world&#x2019;s major sources of hydrocarbons are coal and oil. Both contain a wide range of hydrocarbons. Some of the most desirable hydrocarbons have quite low relative molecular masses. The less useful, higher relative molecular mass hydrocarbons can be &#8216;cracked&#8217;&#x2013;that is, converted by heating into hydrocarbons of lower relative molecular mass. The heat energy causes homolytic breakage of the C&#x2013;C bonds to give radicals, which react further to give alkanes and alkenes.</p>

Polymerization of propene goes through secondary radicals like (S) and so gives a regular head-to-tail polymer. Here is the overall equation: you should write the detailed mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6 Enzyme-catalysed radical reactions</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Most enzymic reactions are heterolytic, as they take place in aqueous solution where they can take advantage of the solvation energy available for charged or polarized species. Nevertheless, some enzymes do make use of radical reactions, and many of these take place within membranes where less water is available for solvation. For example an alkyl radical is involved in the reactions of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Homolytic breakage of a cobalt&#x2013;carbon bond (initiation) produces a &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;</sup> radical, which subsequently takes a hydrogen atom from another molecule to form a &#x2013;CH<sub>3</sub> group and a second radical (propagation). This is part of a biochemical pathway for the oxidation of fatty acids. For another possible example, see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_88">p. 88</a>.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Higher animals and plants cannot make their own vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; it is only synthesized by micro-organisms such as anaerobic bacteria. Pernicious anaemia is caused by impaired absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from the ileum, and it can be cured by relatively large injections of the vitamin.</p></aside>

<h2 class="h2">6.7 Radical reactions in the gas phase</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Here solvation is not possible and radical reactions often dominate, for example in the atmosphere. The formation of photochemical &#8216;smog&#8217; and the formation and destruction of the ozone layer are all complex radical processes.</p>
