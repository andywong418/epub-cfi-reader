<section epub:type="chapter" id="Ch07-7.1">
<h2 class="h2">7.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="banoindent">You are now familiar with a good deal of factual functional group chemistry, and when you have worked through the first six chapters of this book you will have met many of the basic ideas that underpin organic chemistry. These ideas help us to relate one aspect of the subject to another. They allow us to thread the facts together, like beads on a necklace, holding them together to make a satisfactory pattern. Such patterns should be recognizable and memorable so that they can be extended and developed in new and interesting ways.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Theories need evidence</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Underpinning these patterns is a solid base of fact, that is, <i>good</i>, <i>repeatable experimental data</i>. We need theories, but all good theories are firmly based on facts. The mechanisms in Chapters 4 to 6 are <i>descriptions</i> of what happens; in very few cases have we given you any of the experimental data upon which they are based or explained the interpretation of the data (but see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_63">p. 63</a>). &#8216;How do you know that?&#8217; and &#8216;How do you show that this statement is true?&#8217; are questions you will be asking more often in the future. It is in answering these questions that the armoury of techniques of the modern organic chemist comes into play, from chemical kinetics to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Mechanisms cannot be &#8216;proved&#8217;; they are <i>descriptions</i> based on the best available data. As new reliable data appear, mechanisms are constantly modified and updated.</p></aside>

<h2 class="h2">7.2 Mechanisms and molecular orbitals</h2>
<p class="banoindent">We have considered most reactions in terms of an electrophile (&#948;+, or &#8216;electron-deficient&#8217;), and a nucleophile (&#948;&#8211;, having a nonbonded electron pair or &#8216;electron-rich&#8217;), which might imply that the interaction between the two is just the attraction of positive and negative charges. This would be an over-simplification; it is clear that the electron pair concerned must go from an orbital in the nucleophile towards an orbital in the electrophile. The reaction therefore can also be seen as <i>an interaction between two orbitals</i>, molecular or atomic, an <i>occupied</i> orbital in the nucleophile and an <i>unoccupied</i> one in the electrophile. (Remember that each orbital can hold only <i>two</i> electrons.) This interaction depends on the size, shape, and energy levels of the two orbitals. If we are dealing with elements in the first short period of the periodic table (Li&#x2013;F) the size-and-shape match will probably be quite good. Since electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first, an occupied orbital will normally be of lower energy than an unoccupied one. We are therefore looking for a relatively <i>high-energy occupied orbital</i> to interact with a relatively <i>low-energy unoccupied orbital</i>. <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 7 Taking It Further</a></p>

<p class="baindent">Nonbonded and &#960; electron pairs occupy relatively high-energy orbitals, and polar (or multiple) bonds such as C&#x2013;Cl and C=O provide relatively low-energy unoccupied orbitals. So most of our reactions involve the combination of molecules with nonbonded pairs or &#960; electrons, such as NH<sub>3</sub> or ethene, with haloalkanes, carbonyl compounds, or even bromine (permanent or temporary polarization). These are exactly the molecules we have already classified as nucleophiles and electrophiles. So the two ways of looking at these reactions do have common ground!</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Orbitals and stereochemistry</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent-v">Orbitals, which show the probable distribution of electron density, may have directional properties; remember the three mutually perpendicular p orbitals (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_2">p. 2</a>). So for a successful interaction between two orbitals, we also need to have their relative positions in space more or less correct: the reagent has to be on the right &#8216;flight path&#8217; to start bond formation. The study of the stereochemistry of interacting molecular orbitals is called <i>stereoelectronics</i>. We will look at two examples: first, nucleophilic substitution of a haloalkane (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_41">p. 41</a>).</p>
<p class="banoindent"><i>Stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitution</i>. The nucleophile has a nonbonded pair (high-energy filled orbital). The haloalkane has its lowest energy unoccupied orbital at 180<sup>&#176;</sup> to (that is, behind) the C&#x2013;Br bond, so the best flight path is for the nucleophile nonbonded pair to approach the back of the C&#x2013;Br bond.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1.5em;">What is the stereochemical relationship between A and B in this substitution reaction? (The energy profile of this reaction looks like the second diagram on <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_24">p. 24</a>.)</p>

<figure>
 <img src="../images/page_84-3.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure>
<p class="banoindent-v">This flight path has important stereochemical consequences if the haloalkane is optically active, because it throws the molecule &#8216;inside out&#8217;.</p>
<p class="banoindent"><i>Stereochemistry of addition to carbonyl</i>. As the second example, let&#x2019;s look at addition to the carbonyl group (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_47">p. 47</a>). We believe that nucleophiles attack the carbonyl carbon atom from a direction at right angles to the plane of the carbonyl group and from slightly behind. This is where the lowest-energy unoccupied orbital is located. Some of the experimental evidence for this comes from collecting observations of many different X-ray crystal structure analyses of compounds which include both a carbonyl group and a nucleophile close together, and then looking for the most popular relative positions. These results agree with modern theoretical calculations and with the current molecular orbital picture of the carbonyl group. Now we can use this idea to predict the outcome of a new reaction, or to help us to understand the stereochemistry of other reactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3 Using functional group chemistry</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Having looked at the extensions of some theories, now let&#x2019;s look at the application of some familiar reactions on new molecules.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Benzocaine and Novocaine</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The local anaesthetic Benzocaine is an ester&#x2014;an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid.</p>

</aside>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="banoindent">Esters can be made from an acid and an alcohol (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_52">p. 52</a>) so Benzocaine could be prepared from 4-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol. We need an acid catalyst and dry conditions, such as dry HCl. The reactions will be:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:1.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page86-2.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Novocaine is a newer, related local anaesthetic. Work out the last stages for a synthesis of Novocaine.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="banoindent">Luminol is chemiluminescent. When it decomposes in the presence of alkaline K<sub>3</sub>Fe(III)(CN)<sub>6</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it gives out energy in the form of ultraviolet light. The hydrocarbon rubrene can absorb this light energy and re-emit it by fluorescence, making the solution glow with a bright yellow light. This type of reaction can be used in &#8216;light sticks&#8217;; the reagents are <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Chapter 7 Taking It Further</a>mixed by breaking the barrier between the two compartments when the stick is bent.</p>
<p class="baindent">Luminol can be made from benzene-1, 2-dicarboxylic anhydride in three stages.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1.8em;">Fireflies produce their light by enzymic oxidation of LUCIFERIN.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page87-2.jpg" alt="images" />
</figure></aside>
<p class="baindent">Stage (i) is the nitration of an aromatic compound (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_70">p. 70</a>) followed by the hydrolysis of an acid anhydride (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_54">p. 54</a>); the only difficulty is whether the new nitro group substitutes at position 3 or 4. Draw these mechanisms out.</p>
<p class="baindent">Stage (ii) is the reaction of a carboxylic acid with an amine under forcing conditions (220&#176;C) to form an amide bond (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_55">p. 55</a>). This happens twice; draw this mechanism, too.</p>
<p class="baindent">Stage (iii) is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine. The reducing agent Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> may be new to you; another possible reagent might have been hydrogen with a palladium catalyst, but this breaks the N&#x2013;N bond as well.</p>
<p class="baindent">You will notice how we have put each stage into its categories of reaction type (e.g. reduction in stage (iii)) and functional group change (e.g. acid to amide in stage (ii)). This is a very useful way to look at the chemistry of complex molecules, but you learn to be careful of undesirable side-effects on other functional groups (see stage (iii)).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The structure of the whole molecule affects each functional group</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">We must remember that the rest of the molecule around a functional group affects its chemistry. Our choice of reducing agent in the previous subsection depended on other groups present in the molecule, and we can <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Chapter 7 Taking It Further</a>see how the reactions of bromoethane and of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane with NaOH differ (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_46">p. 46</a>).</p>

<p class="banoindent">The biochemistry may alter too, even with quite subtle changes. The two molecules 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethanoic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutanoic acid (2,4-DB) look very similar chemically but they are very different to a plant.</p>
<p class="baindent">2,4-D stimulates a fatal level of growth in broadleaved plants and is an excellent weedkiller for narrow-leaved crops like wheat. 2,4-DB itself is inactive as a weedkiller, but some broadleaved plants metabolize it by oxidation to 2,4-D&#x2014;with fatal effects. Thus 2,4-DB is even more selective than 2,4-D.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.4 Some current research projects</h2>
<p class="banoindent">What sort of things are organic chemists busy investigating now? Three examples follow; we make no apology for the biological slant to these because this reflects the authors&#8217; interests!</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">The biosynthesis of ethene: ripening fruit</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">If you want to make green tomatoes ripen faster, put a ripe tomato or apple or banana with them. The ripe fruit gives off ethene which catalyses the ripening process. We know how to make ethene from coal or oil or ethanol; but how does a plant make ethene?</p>
<p class="baindent">Ethene in plants is made from the cyclic aminoacid A, which itself comes from one of the common &#8216;essential&#8217; amino acids, methionine:</p>

<figure  style="margin-left:1.8em;">
 <img src="../images/page88-3.jpg" alt="images" />
<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:-4em;margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1.5em;">Ethene will also accelerate the formation of seed-heads from flowers; so a bunch of carnations will last longer if they are not near a bowl of fruit.</p></aside>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="banoindent">How do we know this? If the methionine has been prepared with a radioactive &#8216;label&#8217; (<sup>14</sup>C) at either C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub>, then this label appears both in the aminoacid A and in the ethene. So the carbon atoms of the ethene are derived from carbons 3 and 4 of methionine. But what is the stereochemistry of the conversion of the amino acid A into ethene? Do the two <i>cis</i> hydrogen atoms on the same side of ethene always come from the same side of the ring of A? The answer is <i>no</i>&#x2014;because the two deuterated versions of A both give a &#8216;scrambled&#8217; 1:1 mixture of dideuterioethenes (but <i>no</i> CH<sub>2</sub>CD<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p class="baindent">The detailed enzyme mechanism is unknown, but it probably involves a radical intermediate. Even less is known about how the ethene catalyses ripening! <a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Chapter 7 Taking It Further</a></p>

<p class="banoindent">One of the most promising new drugs for the treatment of cancer of the breast or colon is taxol. Taxol is extracted from the Pacific yew, and it takes one mature tree to provide enough taxol for one patient. The tree is a slow-growing North American evergreen which is becoming rare. Total synthesis of taxol is difficult because of its complex stereochemistry. Several companies are attempting to set up commercial tissue cultures of Pacific yew bark cells to make taxol. A more wide-ranging approach to the problem is to use a tissue-culture to produce compounds similar to taxol, in which the plant cells have done much of the difficult chemistry. For example baccatin IV is <i>comparatively</i> abundant in English yew, and other related species have yet to be scanned.</p>
