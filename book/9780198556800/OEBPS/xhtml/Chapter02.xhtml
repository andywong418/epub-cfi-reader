<h2 class="h2">2.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Organic reaction <i>mechanisms</i> are shorthand descriptions of how the starting compounds are made into the products. Molecules with the same functional groups usually react by similar mechanisms, and we can use mechanisms for known reactions to predict how other molecules will behave under similar conditions. Mechanisms are thus a connecting thread between similar reactions and allow us to <i>rationalize the products</i> of a known reaction and to <i>predict the reactivity</i> of other organic molecules.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Types of reaction</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">In this book we will be considering the mechanisms of three types of reaction: substitution, addition, and elimination.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Substitution</i> reactions involve exchanging one atom or group of atoms on the organic molecule for another.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page18-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">A chlorine has replaced one of the hydrogen atoms on the methane.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Addition</i> reactions mean just that; one molecule adds onto another and nothing is lost.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page18-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="baindent"><i>Elimination</i> reactions involve the loss of a relatively small molecule from the organic reactant.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page18-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Water has been eliminated from the alcohol. Remember that elimination is the reverse of addition.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Heterolytic and homolytic bond breaking</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Most reactions involve <i>bond breaking</i> as well as bond making. This can be of two types, heterolysis and homolysis.</p>
<p class="baindent">In <i>heterolytic</i> bond breaking the pair of electrons in the bond becomes associated with only one of the atoms involved.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page18-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The resulting fragments are likely to be charged. If so, they are ions.</p>
<p class="baindent">In <i>homolytic</i> bond breaking each fragment retains one of the bonding pair of electrons. These fragments are called radicals.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2 Nucleophiles, electrophiles, radicals</h2>
<p class="banoindent">It is useful to classify the chemicals with which organic molecules react. Leaving acid/base and some redox reactions on one side for the time being, we find that there are three types of reagent to deal with.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent">Most <i>nucleophiles</i> are molecules or ions with a nonbonded pair of electrons (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_10">p. 10</a>), with which they can form a new dative bond. They are &#x2018;electron rich&#x2019;. Some examples are:</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page19-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">We can look at the reaction of the triphenylmethyl cation with hydroxide ion, following the nonbonded pair.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page19-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="baindent">It is a common mistake to suppose that nucleophiles must be negatively charged, forgetting that the critical thing that many of them have in common is a <i>nonbonded pair</i>. Textbooks and papers do not help the beginner by leaving them out most of the time, assuming that everyone knows they are there. We shall do so ourselves in due course, but you need to remember where the nonbonded pairs are when you write mechanisms.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Electrophiles</i> represent the other side of the coin. They are molecules or ions which are prepared to form a new covalent bond using a pair of electrons provided by another atom or molecule, often the organic reactant. Some examples are shown in the margin.</p>
<p class="baindent">Sometimes the electrophiles, such as the three positively charged
examples, actually have an <i>empty</i> bonding orbital available at low enough energy to accept the incoming pair of electrons. Uncharged electrophilic molecules are either polarized, e.g. HBr, or can be so readily, e.g. Br<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">

 <img src="../images/page19-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="baindent">The addition of a proton, H<sup>+</sup>, to an alkene will show how the first kind operates. The &#x03C0; electron pair on the alkene is shown as asterisks (*) for emphasis.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page19-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="baindent"><a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In other cases heterolytic bond breakage in the electrophile makes an empty orbital available.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page20-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The &#x03C0; electron pair forms a new bond to the hydrogen atom while the HBr bond breaks heterolytically (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_18">p. 18</a>). The bromine atom of HBr becomes a bromide ion, carrying both of the original shared pair of electrons.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent">A <i>radical</i> carries an <i>unpaired electron</i>. Radicals are usually written with a dot to show these unpaired electrons.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/page20-2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="baindent">It is worth drawing a full dot diagram for each of these to check the electron bookkeeping, and to show that they are electron deficient.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3 Drawing mechanisms using dot diagrams and curly arrows</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Curly arrows <img src="../images/page20-6.jpg" alt="images"/> and fishhooks <img src="../images/page20-7.jpg" alt="images"/>are the conventional ways of depicting electron movements for pairs of electrons and single electrons respectively. We use <img src="../images/page20-6.jpg" alt="images"/>for <i>ionic</i> (or polar) reaction mechanisms, that is, those involving nucleophiles and electrophiles. Bond breakage in these reactions results in the bonding pair of electrons remaining associated with only one of the atoms which were originally bonded so this is <i>heterolytic</i> bond breakage.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page20-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The pair of electrons in the breaking C&#x2013;Br bond go to the bromine atom, forming a bromide ion. The positively charged carbon is short of electrons (electron deficient). The C&#x2013;Br bond has broken heterolytically.</p>
<p class="baindent">Curly arrows <img src="../images/page20-6.jpg" alt="images"/> can be used for bond breaking, bond making, and for both making and breaking together.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page20-5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a> In each case a curly arrow must <i>start</i> from an electron pair, either a bonding or nonbonded pair, and <i>end</i> on an atom or in a new bond.</p>
<p class="baindent">We use <i><img src="../images/page20-7.jpg" alt="images"/></i> for radical reactions, where it represents the movement of a single electron.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page21-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">In radical reactions bond breakage leaves one of the bonding electrons on each of the originally bonded atoms. This is <i>homolytic</i> cleavage. Again, <i><img src="../images/page20-7.jpg" alt="images"/></i> can be used for making as well as breaking bonds.</p>
<p class="baindent">We can show both types, ionic and radical, using full dot diagrams. It is probably a good idea to draw each mechanism in both ways until it becomes familiar.</p>
<p class="baindent">Here is a <i>nucleophile</i> in action.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page21-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">By emphasizing the electron pairs involved with different coloured pens we can follow what is going on. This is for our convenience; the four pairs in the bromide ion outer shell are quite indistinguishable from each other. Compare this with the shorthand curly arrow version.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page21-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">You will frequently find such mechanisms drawn without the nonbonded pair on the hydroxyl ion. This nonbonded pair is <i>going to</i> form the new bond, a dative one, to carbon while the C&#x2014;Br bond breaks heterolytically with the bonding pair of electrons <i>going off</i> on the bromide ion as it leaves. Curly arrows show <i>electron pairs going places.</i></p>
<p class="baindent">An <i>electrophilic</i> reaction is shown below. Notice the asterisk pairs.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:0em;">
 <img src="../images/page21-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">In this reaction the right-hand carbon atom of ethene loses a half-share in the asterisk pair of electrons. Since formally it loses <i>one</i> electron from an uncharged state, the carbon must become positively charged.</p>
</aside></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The advantage of this method is that it helps us to see clearly why the right-hand carbon atom in the carbocation carries a positive charge. <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>

<figure>
 <img src="../images/page22-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="baindent">In the same way we can use either dot or fishhook versions of <i>radical</i> mechanisms, as for example in the reaction of methane with a chlorine radical.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Curly arrows are also used to relate resonance structures to each other, e.g. for the methanoate ion (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_5">p. 5</a>):</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em;">
 <img src="../images/page22-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>

<figure>
 <img src="../images/page22-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="baindent">Curly arrow and fishhook mechanisms are simple descriptions. They need to be based on real experimental evidence, such as kinetics, isolation of intermediates and radioactive tracer experiments. Like all good theories they must be firmly based on fact.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch02-2.4">

<h2 class="h2">2.4 Introduction: equilibria and rates</h2>
<p class="banoindent">For all chemical reactions there are two vital questions to be answered.</p>
<p class="indenthanging1">1. How much product can be made?</p>
<p class="indenthanging1">2. How fast will it be made?</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="baindent">&#x2018;How much&#x2019; is determined by the <i>equilibrium constant</i> for the reaction at a particular temperature. This is related to what are called <i>thermodynamic</i> factors (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_23">p. 23</a>).</p>
<p class="baindent">&#x2018;How fast?&#x2019; is determined by the rate constant at a particular temperature and what we call <i>kinetic</i> factors (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_24">p. 24</a>).</p>
<p class="baindent">Organic chemists are interested in the answers to both questions because they wish to obtain the maximum yield of a desired product, as fast as possible. Some idea of how the bond breaking and bond making happens would be useful. This is the heart of the reaction mechanism, which must fit the observed facts about how much and how fast. <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">How much can be made? Equilibrium and energy profiles</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent"><i>Equilibrium</i>. Some reactions seem to go to completion. This means that when the dust settles there are only products to be seen.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page23-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">In other reactions both starting materials and products are there at the end. The classic organic example is acid-catalysed esterification.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page23-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">In fact the reaction is still going on at the apparent end, but with equal rate in each direction. There is no further change in concentration of products or reactants once the reaction has reached this <i>dynamic equilibrium.</i> The concentrations of products and reactants at this point are related by the <i>equilibrium constant, K<sub>c</sub>,</i> which is constant at any particular temperature. For this example</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page23-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The [ ] terms refer to concentrations in mol dm <sup>&#x2013;3</sup>.</p>
<p class="baindent">A high value of the equilibrium constant, <i>K<sub>c</sub>,</i> would show that there will be a high proportion of products in the equilibrium mixture. A low value would indicate a low proportion of products at equilibrium.</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="banoindent"><i>Energy profiles</i>. A simplified energy profile for a reaction shows the difference in energy between the reactants and products.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page23-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This reaction is thermodynamically favourable.</p>
</aside></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="baindenthanging">Energy change = &#x2013;<i>RT</i>ln<i>K</i></p>
<p class="banoindent">The &#x2018;energy change&#x2019; for a reaction is related to its equilibrium constant by the expression <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a>where <i>R</i> is the gas constant (8.3 JK<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) and <i>T</i> is the temperature in kelvin. We can see that a large energy drop (&#x2013;) in going from reactants to products will correspond to a high value of the equilibrium constant <i>K</i> (greater than 1) and the reaction <i>can</i> give a good yield of product.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">This good yield can only be realized if the reaction is fast enough (see next section).</p>

<p class="banoindent">will give a low value of <i>K</i> (less than 1) and there will be a low proportion of product in the equilibrium mixture.</p>
<p class="baindent">In a special case there is no energy change. What do you think would be the implications for equilibrium constant and yield of product in this case?</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page24-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">For many reactions in solution the <i>enthalpy changes,</i> &#x03B4;H, can act as a guide to the energy changes and, hence, to where the equilibrium lies. But they are only a <i>rough</i> guide.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">How fast? Activation energy</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Even reactions with large values of <i>K</i> are not instantaneous; they happen at varying rates. What is involved in two molecules reacting?</p>
<p class="baindenthanging1">1. They must meet or collide.</p>
<p class="baindenthanging1">2. They must presumably approach each other lined up so that the bond breaking and making process is made easy.</p>
<p class="baindenthanging1">3. They must, between them, possess enough energy to get the reaction started.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;"><a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="banoindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="banoindent">A pen and its top can collide with each other from all directions.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page25-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">There is only one orientation which lets the top slip on, and they only stay together if it is pushed on with enough <i>energy</i>.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page25-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">For chemical reactions, the energy barrier is known as the <i>activation energy,</i> <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>. The height of the barrier determines how fast a thermodynamically favourable reaction will go. Look at the reaction profiles below; the overall energy change is the same in each case.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:0em;">
 <img src="../images/page25-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Note that the backward reaction, products<img src="../images/page25-4.jpg" alt="images"/>reactants, has a different (and higher) activation energy in both these cases.</p>
</aside>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">A low value of <i>E</i><sub>a</sub> will normally correspond to a rapid reaction, a high value of <i>E</i><sub>a</sub> to a slower one. A reaction may be extremely favourable in overall energy terms, but very slow at low temperatures. For example, the equilibrium constants for the oxidation of glucose or magnesium are both large, but these substances are remarkably unreactive to oxygen at room temperature. The reaction rates are very slow because the activation energies are high.</p>
<p class="baindent">There are two ways of speeding reactions up. <i>Firstly</i> we can heat the reactants so that a higher proportion of them have the activation energy on collision. This will give a higher proportion of successful collisions and therefore a faster reaction. This can be seen on the Maxwell&#x2014;Boltzmann diagram (overleaf) which shows the distribution of kinetic energy in molecules at two different temperatures. <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>

</aside>
</figcaption></figure>

<p class="banoindent">You can see that at <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>,the higher temperature, a higher proportion of molecules has the activation energy, <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>, or greater.</p>
<p class="baindent"><i>Secondly</i> we can add a <i>catalyst</i> to the reaction mixture. The catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway, involving a different set of bond breakings and makings, which has a lower activation energy. See <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_29">p. 29</a>.</p>
<p class="baindent">Notice that the <i>overall energy change and the equilibrium constant, K, are unchanged</i>. Looking back to the Maxwell&#x2014;Boltzmann diagram above, we can see that if we lower <i>E</i><sub>a</sub> we will increase the proportion of molecules with the activation energy or greater, without changing the temperature.</p>
<p class="baindent">If we wish to oxidize glucose completely in the laboratory we can heat it in air until it burns.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page26-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">However, every cell in our bodies can achieve this oxidation, at <i>body temperature</i>, through a series of reactions, each one of which uses a specific catalyst or enzyme. Another example is:</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page26-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Both manganese(IV) oxide and the enzyme catalase in liver will make the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide solution go faster, but catalase does it about a million times faster than manganese(IV) oxide.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Kinetics and rate equations. Rate determining steps</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Looking at kinetics shows us which factors influence the rates of chemical reactions. We have already seen qualitatively how increasing temperature can raise the rate of reaction by increasing the proportion of molecules with enough energy to react&#x2014;the activation energy (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_24">p. 24</a>). In the same way reactant molecules are more likely to collide if there are more of them about in a given volume. One would expect more <i>concentrated</i> reactants to react faster. The exact dependence of the rate of a reaction on the concentration of the reactants is found <i>by experiment</i> and is expressed in a <i>rate equation</i>.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page26-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Initial rate is proportional to [A]<sup>x</sup>[B]<sup>Y</sup>: Rate= <i>k</i>[A]<sup>x</sup>[B]<sup>Y</sup></p>

<p class="banoindent">Here <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are powers that are found <i>by experiment</i>. They do not necessarily bear any relationship to the balanced chemical equation at all, in marked contrast to equilibrium constants.</p>
<p class="baindent">Let us take as an example the reaction</p>

<p class="banoindent">The iodine does not appear in the equation at all. With all the powers in we would write</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page27-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The reaction is then said to be <i>first order</i> with respect to propanone, <i>first order</i> with respect to hydrogen ions, and <i>zero order</i> with respect to iodine. It is <i>second order</i> (1 + 1 + 0) overall, because the sum of all the powers in the rate equation is 2.</p>
<p class="baindent">The proportionality constant <i>k</i> in the rate equation is known as the <i>rate constant</i> and is a characteristic of a particular reaction at a given temperature.</p>
<p class="baindent">The mathematical relationship between <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>, the temperature <i>T</i>, and the rate constant <i>k</i> for a reaction is given by the Arrhenius equation:</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page27-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Increasing <i>T</i> makes <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>/<i>RT</i> smaller and therefore e<sup>&#x2013;<i>E<sub>a</sub>/RT</i></sup> gets larger, and <i>k</i> gets larger.</p>
<p class="baindent">For many reactions it is possible to devise experiments which allow us to <i>deduce</i> the experimental rate equation. What does it tell us?</p>
<p class="baindent">The actual sequence of bond breaking and making in the reaction is likely to take place in a number of stages, some fast and others slow. The slowest stage will act as a bottle-neck for the reaction and dictates the overall rate, so it is called the <i>rate-determining step</i>.</p>
<p class="baindent">The substances involved <i>in or before the rate-determining step</i> will appear in the rate equation for the reaction.</p>
<p class="baindent">For example, the nitration of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene has first order kinetics.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">The exponential factor, e<sup>&#x2013;<i>E<sub>a</sub>/RT</i></sup>, is the fraction of molecules possessing at least the activation energy <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>. This corresponds to the area to the right of the <i>E</i><sub>a</sub> vertical line on the diagram on <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_26">p. 26</a>.</p>
<p class="indent2" style="margin-left:2em;"><i>A</i> is the frequency factor. It can be expressed as the product <i>PZ</i>, where <i>P</i> is a steric factor and <i>Z</i> is the total number of collisions per second of the reactant molecules.</p>

<p class="banoindent">The rate is proportional to [HNO<sub>3</sub>], but is <i>independent</i> of the concentration of trimethylbenzene.

The rate of the slow step dictates the rate of reaction. Nitration is discussed further on <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_70">p. 70</a>.</p>

At this point we are poised on an energy maximum from which it is downhill in any direction, either back to C&#x2013;Br and OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> or on to C&#x2013;OH and Br<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. The energy we have invested so far is the <i>activation energy</i>, <i>E</i><sub>a</sub>. We refer to this maximum energy (downhill either way) state as the <i>transition state</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">There is an overall charge of &#x2013;1 on the transition state, which is shown with two partial negative charges (&#x03B4;&#x2013;) in the diagram. See <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_12">p. 12</a> for the shapeof TS.</p></aside></figcaption>

<p class="banoindent">Transition states cannot be detected. We presume they are there because of the energy barrier.</p>
<p class="baindent">You can create a model for this by partially inflating one of those &#x2018;sausage&#x2019; balloons with separate panels as in (1).</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page28-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Now squeeze the air into the second panel. Part-way through this process you will suddenly feel that the balloon is poised (2). A tiny extra squeeze sends the air on into the next panel (3); a slight relaxation lets it back into the first (1). This in-between position (2) is like the transition state. If you let the balloon go, the air always goes to one end or the other. But the balloon has got to go through the &#x2018;transition state&#x2019; if the air is to be shifted from one end to the other.</p>
<p class="baindent">Now we can extend this idea to a balloon with three panels, the <i>reaction</i> being to get the air from the left hand panel into the one on the right. You <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a>will have noticed that the reaction happens in two stages with the air-in-the-middle (5) being an <i>intermediate</i> stage. Each step in squeezing the air across will have a &#x2018;transition state&#x2019; as before. On an energy profile it would look like this.</p>

<p class="banoindent">Each step has its own <i>activation energy</i> and its own <i>transition state</i>.

<p class="banoindent">So far in this section we have only asked two simple questions about our reactions.</p>
<p class="baindenthanging1">1. Is the reaction likely to go on thermodynamic (or energy) grounds?</p>
<p class="baindenthanging1">2. If the answer to the first question is yes, will the reaction go at a reasonable rate?</p>
<p class="banoindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;"><a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="banoindent">Now suppose that there is more than one set of possible products. The reaction of A + B can go to give either C + D or E + F as products. Which will we get and why? Let us look at the reaction profiles.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">We should get the most energetically favourable products, E + F in this case, if all the reactions have reached equilibrium. This would be <i>thermodynamic control</i>. Even if the reactions were not at equilibrium the activation energy for A + B going to E + F is smaller than that for A + B going to C + D. As a result the A + B to E + F reaction is also the faster. A + B to E + F is favoured on both thermodynamic (energy) and kinetic (rate) grounds.</p>
<p class="baindent">Now we will look at another possibility. Suppose the activation energy for A + B going to C + D were <i>less</i> than that for A + B going to E + F. What products would we get then?</p>
<figure style="margin-left:2em;">
 <img src="../images/page30-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Here the thermodynamically controlled product at equilibrium will be mostly E + F, but the reaction rate to C + D will be faster (kinetic control). Keeping the temperature down will give mostly C + D, because few molecules will have enough energy for the E + F reaction. Raising the temperature gives enough energy for both reactions and their reverse; that is, they will be at equilibrium and we will get mostly E + F (thermodynamic control). An example of this is the sulphonation of naphthalene. <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Sulponation is useful because it introduces the acidic SO<sub>3</sub>H group, which is easily converted by neutralization into salts. e.g. SO<sub>&#x2013;</sub><sub>3</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent2" style="margin-left:2em;">This means that the resulting molecules are more likely to be water-soluble (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_15">p. 15</a>). Many detergents have long hydrocarbon tails with &#x2013;SO<sup>&#x2013;</sup><sub>3</sub> end-groups.</p></aside>

<p class="banoindent">Which is the lower energy product? Which is produced by the faster reaction? Check your understanding by working out the probable products in the special case where the activation energies for the two possible reactions are the same. You can assume that all the reactions involved are reversible.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Look up the boiling points of ethanol, ethanal, and ethanoic acid, and see why this works. Rationalize the pattern in these boiling points (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_15">p. 15</a>).</p></aside>
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="banoindent">Ethanol is readily oxidized to ethanal by heating with acidified potassium chromate(VII). Ethanal is even more readily oxidized under the same conditions. The problem is how to get a good yield of ethanal. The solution is to remove it from the mixture, by distillation, as soon as it is formed. Plants and animals go one better by using, as catalysts, enzymes specific for the first reaction but not the second. These are known as alcohol dehydrogenases. <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 2 Mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="baindent">Changing solvent can also lead to different products.</p>
<figure>

<p class="banoindent">We can prepare either the alcohol or the alkene by changing the conditions. Look also at the two ways of brominating methylbenzene on <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_78">p. 78</a>.</p>
