<h1 class="main"><b>Series Editor&#x2019;s Foreword</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Students starting chemistry courses at university have a wide range of backgrounds, and consequently each individual&#x2019;s elementary knowledge of the subject tends to be fragmented differently. Ideally all chemistry students should start their university courses with the same elementary knowledge base. This Oxford Chemistry Primer is designed to draw the subject together to provide a concise introduction to organic chemistry. It should stimulate young people reading chemistry at advanced level in school, and serve to excite still further the student&#x2019;s interest in the subject during the transitional period between school and university.</p>
<p class="indent">This primer will be of interest to chemistry schoolteachers and all who aspire to serve an apprenticeship in chemistry at university.</p>
