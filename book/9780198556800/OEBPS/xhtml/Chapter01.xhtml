<h2 class="h2">1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Organic chemistry began as the chemistry of living things, like yeast, moulds, mushrooms, willow trees, and whales. It is based on the compounds of carbon, whose molecules are the essence of organic chemistry. From fuels through pain-killers and antibiotics to vitamins, they fascinate us. How are they constructed? How can we make them? Why do they behave the way they do? What can we make from them? How do we make molecules which are going to affect biological systems in the way we want, with minimal side-effects?</p>

<p class="baindent">Before we can begin to answer these questions we need to understand the ways in which atoms join together to form molecules. In later chapters we will explore the ways in which a molecule&#x2019;s architecture affects its chemistry, and how we exploit this to make new compounds.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">The abbreviated way of drawing organic molecules is explained on <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_7">pp. 7</a> and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_11">11</a>.</p></aside>

<h2 class="h2">1.2 Atoms</h2>
<p class="banoindent">Chemical reactions are the result of bond breaking and bond making, involving the most energetic, outer shell electrons of atoms. Before we can discuss bonding we need to have some idea of how electrons are distributed in separate atoms, particularly carbon atoms.</p>
<p class="baindent">The electronic configuration of a carbon atom in its ground state, or lowest energy state, is 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>. The terms s and p describe the types of orbital in which these electrons are found, an orbital simply showing the probable distribution of electron density. <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 Molecules</a></p>
<h3 class="bah3"><span class="bold">s Atomic orbitals</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">Each s orbital can hold a pair of electrons and is spherically symmetrical. The diagram shows the region in which an s electron is most likely to be found.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">p Atomic orbitals</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">In the same way the electron density in a p orbital is shown as two pears end to end. p Orbitals are <i>not</i> spherically symmetrical and there are three of them, of equal energy, mutually at right angles, in each main shell.</p>

<p class="banoindent">The electrons in a p orbital are most likely to be found somewhere within the &#x2018;double pear&#x2019; region. On average they will be further from the nucleus than electrons in the corresponding s orbital.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.3 Bonding</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">&#x03C3; Bonds</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The simplest case is hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>. The two singly occupied s orbitals on two hydrogen atoms combine to form one bonding orbital in H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;"><i>Two</i> atomic orbitals combine to form <i>two</i> molecular orbitals, but only one is occupied and bonding.</p></aside>
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="banoindent">Bonds like these, where two half-filled orbitals on neighbouring atoms combine to give a bonding molecular orbital with high electron density <i>between</i> the two nuclei involved, are called sigma or &#x03C3; bonds. This is the normal single bond.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Making four single bonds to carbon</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">If a carbon atom remained in its ground state in a molecule it could form only two covalent bonds, using its two unpaired p electrons, and it would still have only six electrons in its outer shell.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page2-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 1 Molecules</a> It is energetically more favourable to promote one of the 2s electrons into the vacant p orbital. The four half-filled orbitals can then combine with half-filled orbitals on four other atoms (e.g. H) to form <i>four equivalent covalent bonds</i>. The carbon atom makes four bonds and so will share eight electrons in its outer shell (two electrons per bond).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;">Again the eight atomic orbitals combine to form eight molecular orbitals, of which four are occupied and bonding.</p>
<p class="indent2" style="margin-left:1em;">In general <i>n</i> atomic orbitals combine to form <i>n</i> molecular orbitals, of which <i>n</i>/2 are occupied and bonding.</p>
</aside></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">The energy for the promotion, about +400 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, is more than repaid by the bond energy (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_10">p. 10</a>) from making four bonds instead of two.</p>
<p class="banoindentt"><i>Methane</i>. In methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, the four equivalent half-filled orbitals on carbon overlap with the half-filled s orbitals of four hydrogen atoms to give four new bonding molecular orbitals, each containing a shared pair of electrons. We have made four new &#x03C3; bonds (see right).</p>
<p class="banoindentt"><i>The shape of methane</i>. Mutual repulsion of the electron pairs in these molecular orbitals or bonds leads to their pointing to the corners of a tetrahedron. This is the geometry for maximum separation of electrons and maximum bond angles (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_11">p. 11</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Making multiple bonds to carbon: &#x03C0; bonds</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">There are other ways in which the four half-filled orbitals of carbon can be combined, allowing carbon to make double or triple bonds to another atom.</p>
<p class="banoindentt"><i>Double bonds</i>. Three of the four half-filled orbitals are used to form <i>three</i> equivalent &#x2018;hybrid&#x2019; orbitals (called sp<sup>2</sup>) leaving <i>one</i> half-filled p orbital to form one other bond.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page3-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">In ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, each carbon atom makes three &#x03C3; bonds, using the three (sp<sup>2</sup>) &#x2018;hybrid&#x2019; orbitals.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page3-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="banoindent"><a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Molecules</a> If the remaining half-filled p orbitals on the two carbon atoms are parallel, they can combine to form a new bonding orbital: a &#x03C0; (pi) bond. The shared electron pair is most likely to be found in the two sausage-shaped lobes on either side of the line joining the two nuclei.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page4-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">&#x03C0; Bonds are always associated with a &#x03C3; bond directly between the nuclei, giving a &#x2018;hamburger&#x2019; look to the electron density diagram.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page4-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">Together the &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; bonds make a double bond between the two carbon atoms.</p>
<p class="banoindentt"><i>The shape of ethene</i>. The principle of mutual repulsion of electron pairs helps to explain why the three atoms bonded to each carbon are in a trigonal planar arrangement (flat, propeller-like), with bond angles of about 120&#x00B0;. Ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is a flat or planar molecule.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page4-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">This diagram shows each shared pair of electrons as a line but makes no distinction between the &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; contributions to the double bond, which is fundamental to an understanding of the reactions of ethene (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_58">p. 58</a>). We will consider the implications of &#x03C0; bonding on the shapes of molecules later in this chapter (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_12">p. 12</a>). Similar &#x03C0; bonds occur in the carbonyl group, C=O, in aldehydes, ketones, esters, and so on. The geometry is again planar with bond angles of about 120&#x00B0; (see left).</p>
<p class="banoindentt"><i>Triple bonds</i>. Two of the half-filled orbitals on carbon form <i>two</i> equivalent &#x2018;hybrid&#x2019; orbitals (called sp) leaving <i>two</i> half-filled p orbitals to form two &#x03C0; bonds.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Delocalized &#x03C0; bonds</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">More than two adjacent p orbitals can combine to form a set of molecular orbitals where the electron pairs are shared by more than two atoms. These form &#x2018;delocalized&#x2019; &#x03C0; bonds. The methanoate ion HCOO<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, for example, can be drawn as either</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;">A single conventional structure does not adequately describe the methanoate ion. Instead of the &#x2018;cloudy&#x2019; picture, the methanoate ion can be described using the two conventional structures. Neither of these contributing structures actually exists but the true structure of the methanoate ion lies in between them. This method of description is called &#x2018;resonance&#x2019; and is denoted by double-headed arrows between the contributing structures, e.g.</p>

<p class="indent2" style="margin-left:1em;">Normal C&#x2013;O and C=O bond lengths are about 0.14 and 0.12 nm respectively. Both carbon-to-oxygen bonds in the methanoate ion have a length in between these values: 0.13 nm.</p>

<figure>
 <img src="../images/page6-4.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="banoindent">Dissimilar nuclei will have a differing attraction for the shared pair which results in an unsymmetrical distribution of electron density and a permanent slight separation of charge, a <i>dipole</i>. This dipole can be measured, and for a liquid its magnitude can be related to the solvent properties. H&#x2013;Cl is actually <img src="../images/page6-5.jpg" alt="images"/> because the chlorine has a greater attraction for the shared pair than does the hydrogen. This gives a small separation of charge, the partial charges being shown as &#x03B4;+ and &#x03B4;&#x2013;. The bond is said to be polarized. The presence of nonbonded pairs on only one of the atoms may also contribute to this dipole.</p>

<p class="baindent">For larger molecules (like the yellow dyes) showing every bond is cumbersome, and we usually restrict them to <i>functional groups</i> (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_8">p. 8</a>), <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 1 Molecules</a>grouping the other atoms together in such a way as to make the structure clear.</p>

Confirm this for yourself using molecular models. The isomers differ in the direction in which they rotate the plane of plane polarized light; otherwise their physical properties are the same. They are identical in chemical reactivity except in cases where shape and symmetry are critical, most notably in reactions with other optical isomers including enzymes (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_85">p. 85</a>). In simple cases we can recognize a molecule with optical isomers by the presence of one or more <i>asymmetric</i> carbon atoms, that is, a carbon atom bearing four different substituents.

<h2 class="h2">1.6 Intermolecular attractions</h2>
<p class="banoindent">There are a number of ways in which separate molecules can attract each other. These affect physical properties such as melting point and boiling
point as well as solubility.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Dipole&#x2014;dipole attractions</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">The permanent dipoles (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_6">p. 6</a>) in molecules will attract each other, following the general principle that opposite charges attract, e.g. propanone.</p>
<figure>
 <img src="../images/page15-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="banoindent">This is a weak attraction (only a few kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>; compare with the energy of covalent bonds in <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a>). This weak attraction is enough to account for the relative boiling points of propanone and butane, which have a similar
number of electrons altogether. Remember that in going from liquid to gas it is only those bonds <i>between</i> molecules that are broken.</p>
<p class="baindent">The attraction of molecules with permanent dipoles (<i>polar molecules</i>) for fully charged ions helps to explain the solubility of compounds like sodium chloride in water.

<h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Van der Waals forces</span></h3>
<p class="banoindent">A second type of weak attraction occurs between molecules which do not possess permanent dipoles. A rationale for this kind of attraction is that at any instant the electrons around even a symmetrical molecule may be unsymmetrically distributed, producing a temporary tiny dipole. This could induce a similar dipole in a neighbouring molecule. All these interactions give net attraction and are called <i>van der Waals forces</i>. The more electrons, the better!</p>
<p class="baindent">The more &#x2018;contact&#x2019; the attracted molecules can have with each other the stronger the forces are likely to be. The tiny dipoles can get close enough to interact in molecules which can lie easily side by side. So straight chain

<h2 class="h2">1.7 Solubility</h2>
<p class="banoindent">This has been mentioned already in this chapter. Substances will mix completely, or a solute will dissolve in a solvent, as long as the sum of the attractions between molecules <i>after</i> mixing is equal to or more than that <i>before</i>. Where there is little change in the attractions during solution there will be no barrier to the mixing. This is the basis of the &#x2018;like dissolves like&#x2019; principle.</p>
<p class="baindent">Short chain alcohols and carboxylic acids, which are hydrogen bonded before mixing, will dissolve in water (also hydrogen bonded), with plenty of hydrogen bonding after mixing.</p>
<p class="baindent">Propanone, with dipole/dipole attractions before mixing, will dissolve in water because of the possibility of <i>new</i> hydrogen bonds after mixing (see right).</p>
<p class="baindent">Compounds like hexane and benzene, whose molecules have no permanent dipoles, can mix freely because both possess van der Waals attractions before and after. But hexane, with van der Waals attractions, will not dissolve in water because, if it did so, some of the hydrogen bonding in the water would have to be sacrificed. Hexane molecules would physically get in the way with no compensating new attractive forces to make up for the loss.</p>

<p class="banoindent">Even for alcohols and carboxylic acids in water, a balance is struck between the effects of the &#x2018;soluble&#x2019; ends, &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>OH (hydrogen bonding) and the &#x2018;insoluble&#x2019; ends, &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;CH<sub>3</sub> (interference with hydrogen bonding). Alcohols and carboxylic acids with short hydrocarbon side-chains do dissolve in water, but as the chain length increases they become less and less soluble. The energy gain at the polar end is gradually outweighed by the loss at the lengthening nonpolar end.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">The hydrogen bonds being broken are worth about &#x2013;30 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Forming the extra new van der Waals attractive interactions, at about &#x2013;4 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, is not enough to make the whole process energetically favourable.</p>
<p class="indent2" style="margin-left:2em;">There is more to solubility than just these enthalpy changes, but the necessary consideration of entropy is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
