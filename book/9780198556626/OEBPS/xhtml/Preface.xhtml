<p class="fmnoindent">Boron and silicon compounds are well established in organic synthesis and a bewildering array of reactions involving these elements is reported every year. The small number of pages traditionally allotted to these elements in one-volume textbooks now fails to emphasize their importance and their wide range of uses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">This short text is intended to introduce the student of synthetic organic chemistry to the reactions of organoboron and organosilicon compounds which have been exploited by organic chemists, and to illustrate how these reactions have been applied to problems in organic synthesis. It is hoped that the chemistry described in this slim volume will encourage students to consult the more comprehensive reference texts and reviews available. These are listed in the bibliographies at the end of each section.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In view of the importance currently attached to the synthesis of homochiral organic molecules, examples which illustrate the use of organoboron and organosilicon compounds in this area are included where appropriate.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Finally, many thanks to Michael J. Harrison, M. Elena Lasterra&#x2013;Sanchez, K. Gail Morris, Stephen P. Saberi, Matthew M. Salter, Gary J. Tustin, and K. Winky Young, who proof-read the manuscript.</p>
