<p class="fmnoindent">Modern synthetic organic chemistry allows the synthesis of virtually any desired complex molecular structure. Central to the synthetic chemist&#x2019;s armoury are reagents derived from boron and silicon, which can be used to effect a wide range of structural changes.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry, and contain only the essential material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. In this first primer of the series Sue Thomas has produced an excellent account of two enormous topics which are described in a very easy to read and student-friendly fashion. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
