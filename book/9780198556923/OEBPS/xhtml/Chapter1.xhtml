</aside>
<p class="noindent">This book is about macrocyclic chemistry. But what is macrocyclic chemistry? This is a very reasonable question &#8211; but like most reasonable questions it is not one which is so easy to answer. Obviously a macrocycle is a large cyclic molecule, and with the emphasis of this book and the prejudiced eyes of a coordination chemist, a macrocyclic ligand should contain donor atoms which may form coordinate bonds with metal centres. For the coordination chemist, a good working definition is that a macrocycle is a cyclic molecule with three or more potential donor atoms in a ring of at least nine atoms. By this criterion, ethylene oxide <a href="#fig1.1"><b>1.1</b></a>, 1,4-dithiane <a href="#fig1.1"><b>1.2</b></a>, cyclotetradecane <a href="#fig1.1"><b>1.3</b></a> and cyclooctatetraene <a href="#fig1.1"><b>1.4</b></a> (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>) are not macrocycles, whereas molecules such as cyclam <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.5</b></a>, porphyrin <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.6</b></a>, 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.7</b></a> and dibenzo-18-crown-6 <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.8</b></a> fit the definition (<a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>). Although the definition is pragmatic and empirical, it essentially means that a macrocyclic ligand can bind a metal centre <i>within </i>the central cavity. If the cyclic molecule is too small, or if there are no donor atoms, it does not fit this criterion. Obviously, it is not possible to be religious in the definition. Although <a href="#fig1.1"><b>1.4</b></a> contains no conventional donor atoms, it could certainly present four &#960;-aceeptor olefin sites to an electron rich metal centre.</p>

<p class="indent">In this book the synthesis and coordination chemistry of macrocyclic ligands will be described. The coordination behaviour of macrocycles is no different in principle from that of open-chain polydentate ligands, although in practice, the unusual and often unexpected properties of the systems justify their being given special treatment. Some of these aspects will be developed in <a href="#ch1.3">Section 1.3</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Some nomenclature</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nomenclature is always problematic. It is <i>always</i> possible to devise a fully systematic I.U.P.A.C. name for an organic ligand. Very often that I.U.P.A.C. name is so long and unfriendly, that, although strictly correct, it is cumbersome and no longer conveys the information in a useful manner. This is frequently the case with macrocyclic ligands. As an example, the I.U.P.A.C. names for <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.5</b></a> and <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.8</b></a> are 1,4,8,11 -tetraazatetracyclodecane and 2,5,8,15,18,21-hexaoxatricyclo[20.4.0.0<sup>9</sup>,<sup>14</sup>]hexacosa-l(22),8,11,13,23, 24-hexaene respectively. Not surprisingly, these complicated names are not often used and the majority of macrocyclic ligands have trivial names. Thus, <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.5</b></a> is almost universally known as cyclam (<i>cyclic amine</i>) whilst <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.8</b></a> is called dibenzo-18-crown-6. The &#8216;crown&#8217; nomenclature of the latter compound relates to the conformation adopted by the macrocyclic ether, which resembles a crown. <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> shows the conformation of the parent 18-crown-6 molecule emphasizing this structural feature. The name further conveys that the macrocyclic ring contains 18 atoms and six oxygen donors. These compounds are generically known as <i>crown ethers.</i></p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">A variety of semi-systematic methods of nomenclature have developed which are both useful and self-evident in their application. For example, compound <a href="#fig1.9"><b>1.9</b></a> is <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>&#8242;,<i>N</i>&#8243;,<i>N</i>&#8244;-tetramethylcyclam whilst <a href="#fig1.10"><b>1.10</b></a> is 15-crown-5. Another notation that we shall use is related to that used for crown ethers and indicates the size of the ring, the number and the type of donor atoms, and any substituents that are present. In this system, <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.5</b></a> is called [14]aneN<sub>4</sub> and <a href="#fig1.9"><b>1.9</b></a> is 1,4,8,1 l-Me<sub>4</sub>-[14]aneN<sub>4</sub>. In general, this book will use whatever <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Introduction to macrocyclic chemistry</a>nomenclature is unambiguous and most appropriate for the compounds being discussed, rather than adopting a uniformly consistent approach.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.3">
<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Why are macrocyclic ligands of interest?</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is probably true to say that the study of macrocyclic ligands resulted in a renaissance of inorganic coordination chemistry. This rather bold statement is not intended to imply that macrocyclic ligands <i>per se</i> are unique but rather that their appearance occurred at the time in which new theoretical and physical techniques were being developed to allow a better understanding of the structures and reactivity of coordination compounds. Having said that, for much of the past thirty years, coordination compounds of macrocyclic ligands have been the subject of investigation in their own right. The successes of these investigations have changed the way in which we think about coordination chemistry and represent the genesis of supramolecular chemistry and nanochemistry.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Macrocyclic complexes are usually thermodynamically and kinetically more stable than complexes with related non-cyclic ligands.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Initially, much of the impetus was in the synthesis of macrocyclic ligands and complexes and this lead to the development of highly efficient synthetic routes to large ring compounds. It is still a source of wonder that such large rings can be prepared specifically and in high yield! In later stages, the properties of the macrocyclic complexes themselves became the centre of attention. It was certainly the case that the majority of macrocyclic complexes were both kinetically and thermodynamically more stable than analogous compounds with non-cyclic ligands, and this resulted in an enormous effort, and no little controversy, in trying to understand the origins of these effects.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, the high stability of macrocyclic complexes has been utilized in the construction of models for metalloproteins and in a wide range of technological applications. Particular interest has centred upon the use of macrocyclic ligands for the selective extraction of metals and the development of hydrometallurgical methods to replace conventional, but environmentally damaging, pyrometallurgy.</p>
<p class="indent">The study of macrocyclic ligands and their complexes allows us to probe many of the more subtle aspects of the reactivity of coordination compounds which would not be possible in less stable complexes with non-cyclic ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, macrocyclic chemistry is fun! The structures of the molecules are unusual and attractive, very often unexpected results are encountered, and when the synthetic routes have been optimized remarkable large molecules may be prepared in high yields from the most unlikely small molecule precursors.</p>
<p class="indent">What are the successes of macrocyclic chemistry? In one sense, the greatest success is in the understanding of macrocyclic chemistry itself! At the beginning of the 1960&#8217;s, the properties of macrocyclic coordination compounds were genuinely regarded as different and unusual. As the understanding of these compounds developed, so did our view of coordination chemistry in general.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The clinical use of macrocyclic ligands to bind radioactive metals for chemotherapeutic applications or of paramagnetic complexes with lanthanoids as imaging agents is expected to become routine over the next few years.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous microelectronic devices and sensors based upon the use of macrocyclic ligands for the detection, amplification or recognition of metal ions have been proposed or fabricated. In the more sophisticated devices, the binding of a metal ion triggers some mechanical or optical change within the system.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, macrocyclic ligands are not purely a laboratory phenomenon and the development of synthetic macrocyclic chemistry has resulted in an increased understanding of the functions and properties of naturally occurring biological macrocycles.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Macrocyclic ligands and complexes are widespread in biology and it is no exaggeration to state that life as we know it could not exist in the absence of such molecules. Macrocyclic ligands based upon the porphyrin ring system <a href="#fig1.2"><b>1.6</b></a> and close structural relations such as corrin are ubiquitous. Iron complexes of these ligands are involved in processes as divergent as electron transport, dioxygen transport and dioxygen storage. The various chlorophylls are responsible for the absorption of light and the initiation of electron transfer processes in green plants which ultimately lead to the oxidation of water to dioxygen. Oxygen donor macrocycles such as nonactin are involved in the active transport of alkali metal ions, the control of the ionic balance within cells, the transmission of neural impulses, and represent a class of widely used antibiotics.</p>
<p class="indent">One obvious use of simple synthetic macrocycles is to try to make compounds which will behave in a similar manner to the biological molecules, but which possess simpler structures and which may be studied to give a better understanding of the function of the naturally occurring species. Such simple compounds can act as <i>structural</i> models which reproduce spectroscopic or other features of the biological molecule or as <i>functional</i> models which replicate the biological and chemical reactivity. It is probably fair to say that the success in preparing structural models has been outstanding but that in devising functional model systems has only been moderate.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>Preorganized</i> means that the donor atoms are held in the correct spatial positions for coordination to a metal.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A more subtle aspect of macrocyclic coordination chemistry lies in trying to model metal-binding sites in proteins which are not formally macrocyclic. A protein can be regarded as a very large, reasonably preorganized, multidentate ligand. The relatively well-defined spatial arrangement of the donor atoms at the metal binding domain could be reproduced by a macrocyclic ligand with equivalent donor atoms arranged in a similar manner. Once again, this approach to making model compounds has been very successful for structural analogues but, as yet, functional models are few and far between.</p>
<a id="page_5" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 5, Introduction to macrocyclic chemistry</a>
<p class="indent">Current efforts are directed towards the design of macrocyclic systems which are capable of acting as fully functional enzyme mimics and which can catalyse a particular reaction in a highly specific manner.</p>
