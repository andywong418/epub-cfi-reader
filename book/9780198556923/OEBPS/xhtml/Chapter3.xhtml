<h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">This short chapter will introduce some of the methods which are used for the synthesis of macrocyclic ligands. It does not intend to provide a rigorous introduction to the organic synthetic methods employed but will merely give an overview of the strategies adopted.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.1 Non-templated syntheses of free ligands</h2>
<p class="noindent">The meaning of the expression &#8216;non-templated&#8217; will become clear in the next chapter. For the time being, we note that it refers to the traditional approach to the synthesis of coordination compounds in which the final step of the reaction involves the reaction of a pre-formed organic ligand with an appropriate metal source. It is a pre-requisite of this approach that the organic ligand must be stable and isolable and the first step in much contemporary coordination chemistry involves time-consuming ligand synthesis.</p>

<p class="indent">The majority of macrocyclic ligands of interest to the coordination chemist may be categorized as having <i>medium</i> or <i>large</i> rings. Although organic synthetic methods for the preparation of <i>small</i> and <i>normal</i> sized rings are well-developed and highly specific, the same cannot be said for routes to medium and large rings. What are the problems associated with the synthesis of such compounds?</p>
<p class="indent">The first factor to consider is the ring strain. This arises when the cyclic structure requires non-optimal bond angles and bond lengths and when a conformation is forced upon the ring such that unfavourable steric interactions occur between substituents. For example, a three membered ring will have internal angles close to 60&#176;, which is considerable smaller than the angle typically associated with <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon atoms. For rings containing 12 or more atoms, the structures are sufficiently flexible that ideal bond lengths and angles may be obtained in strain-free conformations and the ring strain is essentially zero.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Macrocyclic ligands of interest to coordination chemists are essentially strain free.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The dominant factor controlling the synthesis of large ring compounds is entropic. Although large ring compounds may be prepared, in principle, from any number of components, in the majority of cases, the final reaction step involves the cyclization process in which two ends of a chain, bearing mutually reactive functionalities, come together to create the ring-forming bond (<a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). Even if the stoichiometry of the reaction involves two or more components, unless concerted reactions are involved, which is not<a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Synthetic aspects 1. The free ligands</a> usually the case with large rings, a sequential reaction pathway means that the cyclization step will resemble the process presented in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>.</p>

<figcaption style="width:100%;"><b>Fig. 3.1.</b> A schematic view of the cyclization step involved in macrocycle synthesis. The filled and open circles represent mutually reactive functional groups. The first step involves the adoption of a conformation in which the two reactive groups are close to one another and in the correct orientation for reaction. Finally, the new bond is formed and the macrocycle is formed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The problem is illustrated in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a> &#8211; before the cyclization reaction can take place, the two reactive groups must be brought close to one another. Unless there are special secondary interactions within the chain, or unless highly preorganized or rigid systems are involved, the extended conformation is more likely than that which leads to reaction. In other words, it is relatively unlikely that a reactive group will meet the reaction partner at the other end of its own molecule &#8211; it is far more likely that it will meet a reactive functionality of a second molecule. The results of this entropic constraint is that the formation of polymeric species will be a significant alternative pathway to the desired macrocyclization reaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">A high dilution reaction with 0.1 mmol of a hydrolytically unstable compound in one litre of solvent would only require 1.8 mg of water to completely destroy the reactant &#8211; that is only 0.0002% (w/v) of water in the solvent!</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">One widely adopted method that avoids these problems involves the use of <i>&#8216;high dilution&#8217;</i> reaction conditions. The probability of a molecule meeting a second molecule decreases as the concentration decreases; therefore, the more dilute the solution, the better the ratio of macrocycle to polymer. Typical high dilution reactions involve milligrams or tens of milligrams of reactants in solvent volumes of the order of litres! It is also usually necessary to ensure that the reactants are mixed very slowly and special apparatus is required which allows very slow, consecutive, addition of reactants to the reaction solvent over hours or days. Many of the reactive precursors are water sensitive and it is essential to work under strictly anhydrous reaction conditions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2 The ring-formation reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">By definition, the macrocyclic ligands contain donor atoms. These are very often atoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus or sulfur which are either more electronegative than carbon or which may readily be converted to anions which can act as nucleophiles. Accordingly, much of the synthetic methodology for the preparation of free ligands is based upon intramolecular or intermolecular nucleophile-electrophile reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">A typical example is seen in the formation of some mixed donor atom sulfur-arsenic macrocycles. The key reactive functionalities are electrophilic CH<sub>2</sub>Hal and nucleophilic thiolate groups. The reaction of <a href="#mol3.1"><b>3.1</b></a> with sodium sulfide under high dilution conditions yields the <i>As</i><sub>2</sub><i>S</i> macrocycle <a href="#mol3.1"><b>3.2</b></a> whilst reaction with HS(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SH and KOH gives the <i>As</i><sub>2</sub><i>S</i><sub>2</sub> species <a href="#mol3.1"><b>3.3</b></a>. In these<a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Synthetic aspects 1. The free ligands</a> cases, the yields of the macrocyclic ligands are respectable (25-45%), although this is not always true for high dilution reactions. Similar reactions are used for the preparation of thiacrown ethers and related mixed donor atom ligands containing sulfur.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">A hint that the reactions are not quite so simple as indicated is seen in the supposedly complementary reaction sequences 1 and 2 in <a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>. These reactions give very different ratios of the [1+1] and [2+2] macrocycles. The reaction conditions involve treatment with sodium or potassium hydroxide to deprotonate the thiols, and this is a classical case where an apparently simple reaction may in fact be exhibiting a sodium-template effect. We will say no more at this point.</p>

<p class="indent">The preparation of cryptands is usually performed under high dilution conditions. The final few steps of a typical synthesis of [2.2.2] are presented in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>. In this case, the electrophile of choice is not an alkyl halide but an acid chloride. The reaction of the acid chloride with the amine groups of the diazacrown gives an intermediate amide that is subsequently reduced by BH<sub>3</sub>.thf. The cryptand is obtained in about 50% yield and the synthetic method may be extended to the preparation of cryptands with various numbers of oxygen donors within the bridges.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3 When high dilution is not necessary</h2>
<p class="noindent">In some cases, it is not necessary to use high dilution reactions for the synthesis of macrocyclic ligands. If rigid subunits are to be incorporated, the various acyclic intermediates may be pre-organized in the correct conformation for cyclization. Sometimes these reactions are quite spectacular. An early example is seen in the reaction of pyrrole with ketones in the presence of acid, which gives excellent yields of the macrocycle <a href="#mol3.6"><b>3.6</b></a> in a [4+4] cyclization reaction. Similar reactions are observed with furans to give <a href="#mol3.6"><b>3.7</b></a>; the reactions are sometimes so favoured that they are explosive.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The tosylate group 4-MeC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> serves multiple roles in these reactions. Firstly, it is used to protect the secondary amine of <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.8</b></a> and central amine of TsO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NTs(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OTs. Secondly, it provides the leaving groups which are lost from TsO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NTs(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OTs and thirdly it activates the terminal NH groups of <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.8</b></a> such that deprotonation is possible under moderate conditions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Surprisingly, the usual routes to tetraaza macrocyclic ligands also involve reactions which do not require high dilution conditions, even though rigid substructures are not present. In the synthesis of the tetraazamacrocycle <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.10</b></a>, the key intermediate is the tri-<i>N</i>-tosylated species <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.8</b></a>. The two terminal NH groups are acidic as a result of the ability of the electron-withdrawing tosyl group to delocalize the negative charge of the anion. The reaction of the dianion with the tosylate TsO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NTs(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OTs occurs under normal concentration conditions to give the tetra-<i>N</i>-tosylated compound <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.9</b></a> in good yield. Deprotection of <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.9</b></a> by stirring in concentrated sulfuric acid gives <a href="#fig3.5"><b>3.10</b></a> in good yield (<a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>). Similar reactions may be used to prepare other tetraaza macrocyclic ligands as well as macrocycles incorporating more than four nitrogen donors. Exactly why these reactions proceed under normal concentration conditions is not fully clear, but it seems likely that the bulky tosylate groups play some role in pre-organizing the open chain precursors. As always, the involvement of strong bases which introduce alkali metal cations into the reaction mixture leaves the possibility of template effects open.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondary interactions may be important in controlling the course of a cyclization reaction and may allow otherwise unexpected reactions to proceed successfully at &#8216;normal&#8217; concentrations. The reaction of [Hen]<sup>+</sup> salts with acetone gives respectable yields of <a href="#fig3.6"><b>3.12</b></a>. The detailed mechanism is not certain, but it is likely that the cyclization step involves an intermediate species such as <a href="#fig3.6"><b>3.11</b></a> in which hydrogen-bonding stabilizes the required conformation (<a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">This macrocycle is known as the Curtis macrocycle after its discoverer and will be encountered again in the next chapter. This macrocycle is also of significance in that it introduces another type of reaction which is of particular importance in macrocyclic chemistry &#8211; the formation of an imine from an amine and a carbonyl compound. Imines are good <i>&#960;</i>-acceptor ligands and imine macrocycles are extremely important in stabilizing unusual oxidation states. Imine macrocycles are very often prepared using <i>template reactions</i> (see <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.4 The crown ethers &#8211; a case study</h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">Pedersen was awarded the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1987 together with D.J. Cram and J.-M. Lehn</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The synthesis of the crown ethers and the recognition of their unique properties played a very important role in the development of macrocyclic chemistry. The compounds were discovered and developed by C.J. Pedersen. The original discovery was purely accidental and followed the isolation of 0.4% of dibenzo-18-crown-6 from the reaction of catechol and C1(CH2)20(CH2)2C1 (<a href="#fig3.7">Fig 3.7</a>). Subsequent optimization of the reaction conditions lead to yields of the order of 45%. Pedersen recognized that alkali metal salts behaved strangely in the presence of this, and other, crown ethers and commenced a systematic investigation of their properties.</p>
<figure id="fig3.7" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0100.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="width:100%;"><b>Fig. 3.7.</b> The original synthesis of dibenzo-18-crown-6.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The basic synthetic strategy for crown ethers remains similar to the original Pedersen synthesis although it is more logical to try to use a [1+1] strategy rather than the original [2+2] condensation. The basic strategy is the nucleophile-electrophile approach presented earlier and relies upon the reaction of a diol or diphenol with a bis(electrophile). The electrophile is usually a chloro or bromo compound or a tosylate. The reactions require strong bases to be present in order that the alcohols are deprotonated and their nucleophilicity increased. The strategy applied to the synthesis of 18-crown-6 is illustrated in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">These reactions do not require excessively high dilution and it is pertinent to ask why high yields of the desired crown ethers are obtained. The answer to this question leads us neatly into the next chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The condensation of Cl(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl with HO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH in the presence of base could give the [1+1] product 12-crown-4, the [2+2] product 24-crown-8 or higher cyclic or acyclic [n+n] oligomers. The yields of the two crown ethers were found to be dependent upon the base that was used. With LiH as base, considerably more of the smaller 12-crown-4 was obtained whilst with NaOMe, the major product was 24-crown-12. Hole-size arguments suggest that 12-crown-4 is a better ligand for lithium than for sodium and raises the possibility of the coordination of the metal ion to the product or the intermediates controlling the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar effects are observed in the synthesis of 15-crown-5 from Cl(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl with HO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH in the presence of base. A number of significant observations were made. Firstly, the yield of 15-crown-5 was at a maximum when NaOH was used as the base. Indeed, yields of the order of 40% were reported. We established in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> that sodium cations were the best match for the cavity in 15-crown-5. The use of LiOH or KOH resulted in much reduced yields of the desired crown ether (4% and 20% respectively). Even more significantly, the use of a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide as base, which has a similar base strength to the metal hydroxides, gave virtually no crown ether. Once again, the role of the metal ion needs to be clarified.</p>
<p class="indent">Why should these cyclizations proceed at high concentrations? It is suggested that the metal cation, which is capable of binding to the hard oxygen donor atom, pre-organizes the intermediate so that cyclization is favoured. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a> for the formation of 18-crown-6 with a potassium salt as base. With this observation we end this chapter and consider its further implications in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
