<p class="noindent">To date, we have assumed that coordination chemistry is limited to inorganic cations. However, we have also stated that the interaction of Group 1 metal ions with crown ethers and cryptands has a significant electrostatic component and this suggests that organic cations such as ammonium ions might also be bound by macrocyclic ligands.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">With ions such as [NH<sub>4</sub>]+, [RNH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and [R<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> there is also a possibility of forming hydrogen bonds to appropriate donors. In fact, the crown ethers have been found to form complexes with these ions in which spatially directed hydrogen bonds determine the specificity. With 18-crown-6, three of the oxygen atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding to [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> or [RNH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cations (<a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). The complexes are quite stable and may be isolated in the solid state or as solution species. The determined stability constants for the complexes of ammonium ions with 18-crown-6 in methanol have lg <i>K</i> values in the region of 4 ([NH<sub>4</sub>]I, lg <i>K</i> = 4.27; [MeNH<sub>3</sub>]I, lg <i>K</i> = 4.25; [EtNH<sub>3</sub>]I, lg <i>K</i> = 3.99; [PhNH<sub>3</sub>]Br, lg <i>K</i> = 3.80). It is even possible to use additional hydrogen bond acceptors in side-chains to provide a fourth binding site for the [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cation, <a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.1</b></a>. A simple extension to bis(crown)ethers such as <a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.2</b></a> allows the binding of biologically important polyammonium ions of the type [H<sub>3</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">Once three dimensional ligands are envisaged, it is possible to design an encapsulating ligand for the [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cation such that all of the hydrogen bonds are endocyclic. This is achieved in the ligand <a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.3</b></a> which is known as a <i>spherand</i> and which binds [NH<sup>4</sup>]<sup>+</sup> with in the cavity (<a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). It is not essential to use nitrogen atoms as the hydrogen bond acceptors and even the cryptand [2.2.2] binds ammonium ions. Interestingly, the binding of [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> <a id="page_85" class="page">85, Other aspects of macrocyclic chemistry</a>to [2.2.2] is less precisely defined than with <a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.3</b></a> and the cation can rotate within the cavity of the cryptand.</p>
<p class="indent">Crown ethers and cryptands are being investigated for the selective binding and transport of ammonium compounds in the same way that have been used for the Group 1 and Group 2 metal ions. One unusual application is seen in the enantioselective binding of one of the two enantiomers of chiral ammonium salts [R*NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (where R* is a chiral alkyl residue) by chiral crown ether derivatives such as <a href="#mol7.4"><b>7.4</b></a>.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Other cations may also be bound by macrocyclic ligands and this unusual area of coordination chemistry is likely to increase in the future. Typical examples of hydrogen-bonded interactions include those of [H<sub>3</sub>O]<sup>+</sup> with <a href="#mol7.5"><b>7.5</b></a> in which three of the oxygen donors participate in hydrogen bonding and the guanidinium complex <a href="#mol7.4"><b>7.6</b></a> with benzo-27-crown-9. In this latter adduct, six of the nine oxygen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonding.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h2 class="h2">7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Binding of anions</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is also possible to expand our definition of coordination chemistry to include the design of ligands for anions. Once again, the principal interactions that we will use are based upon hydrogen bonding. However, in contrast to the binding of organic cations, where the ligand acted as the hydrogen bond acceptors and the guest as the hydrogen bond donor, the situation is usually reversed in anion binding. Furthermore, in order to maximize electrostatic interactions it will be beneficial to have cationic hosts and cyclic polyammonium salts (that is to say, protonated polyaza macrocycles and cryptands) fulfil these requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">For simple monatomic anions such as chloride the ideal hosts would be spherical and a good example is found with ligand <a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.3</b></a> This ligand acted as a hydrogen bond acceptor and formed four hydrogen bonds with [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>.However, in its protonated form [H<sub>4</sub><a href="#mol7.1"><b>7.3</b></a>]<sup>4+</sup> it functions as a hydrogen bond donor and binds chloride ion. However, much simpler hosts may be used and representative examples include <a href="#mol7.7"><b>7.7</b></a> and <a href="#mol7.7"><b>7.8</b></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to design ligands with selectivity for particular halide ions based upon their coordination preferences. The cryptand <a href="#mol7.9"><b>7.9</b></a> may be hexaprotonated at the secondary amines and the hexacation forms 1:1 complexes with fluoride, chloride and bromide anions. The coordination <a id="page_86" class="page">86, Other aspects of macrocyclic chemistry</a>geometry about the larger chloride and bromide ions is octahedral with six hydrogen bond contacts between the halide ion and the ammonium N-H. However, the smaller fluoride ion only hydrogen bonds to a total of four N-H groups, three from one end and one from the other end of the cryptand (<a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>).</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="mol7.7"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0233.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The cryptand <a href="#mol7.9"><b>7.9</b></a> has an elongated shape that persists after hexaprotonation and this suggested that it might be possible to bind linear anions and this was demonstrated by the formation of a 1:1 adduct in which an N<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup> azide anion is bound within the cavity.</p>

<p class="indent">Particular interest has focused upon the binding and molecular recognition of carboxylates and phosphates and numerous ligands have been designed to optimize interactions with these anions. Cations derived from simple polyaza macrocycles such as <a href="#mol7.10"><b>7.10</b></a> and <a href="#mol7.10"><b>7.11</b></a> have proved to be effective in binding a range of such anions.</p>

<p class="indent">It has even been possible to use the binding of phosphates to macrocycles of this type to develop catalysts for the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a process of obvious interest in furthering our understanding of biological phosphoryl transfer processes. The hexaprotonated form of the azacrown <a href="#mol7.12"><b>7.12</b></a> has proved to be an effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of ATP and other polyphosphates. It is thought that the macrocycle plays a number of roles; firstly, hydrogen bonds from the ammonium groups to the phosphate oxygen atoms serve both to bind the polyphosphate, to activate the ligand towards nucleophilic attack and to bind it in a conformation such that attack by one of the ligand nitrogen atoms becomes possible. A schematic view of the bound polyphosphate is give in <a href="#mol7.13"><b>7.13</b></a> (charges have been omitted for clarity).</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3<span class="space">&#160;</span> Biocatalysis by macrocyclic complexes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The high thermodynamic and kinetic stability of macrocyclic complexes of transition metals has resulted in considerable interest in their use as catalysts. In particular, ligands such as cyclam offer the opportunity of tuning the redox properties of metal centres through ligand substitution and also leaving two axial sites available for the binding of substrates.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous catalytic processes based upon transition metal complexes of porphyrin and phthalocyanine ligands have been described. These ligands are particularly important in oxidation reactions involving molecular dioxygen or other simple oxidizing agents and very often involve iron, manganese or cobalt complexes. Much of this work has been directed towards an understanding of the functioning of porphyrins in biological systems.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure ><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0239.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A few examples of synthetic catalytic systems will serve to emphasize the utility of porphyrin ligands. A variety of iron porphyrin complexes, includingvery simple systems such as [Fe(tpp)Cl] (tpp = <i>meso</i>-tetraphenylporphyrin) are effective in the oxidation of alkanes, alkenes or arenes using PhIO as the primary oxidant. Alkanes are converted primarily to alcohols whilst alkenes give mixtures of epoxides and allylic alcohols. The key step in the reaction is thought to be the conversion of the iron(III) starting material to a formal iron(V) (actually an iron(IV) porphyrin cation) oxo species (<a href="#eqn7.1">Eqn. 7.1</a>).</p>

<a id="page_88" class="page" style="width:70%;">88, Other aspects of macrocyclic chemistry</a>
<p class="noindent">Analogous reactions with manganese(III) and molybdenum(V) porphyrins are also known.</p>
<p class="indent">However, a number of simpler ligands have also been used in attempts to reproduce biological catalysis and a few examples will be given here. Further examples are to be found in the companion text <i>Biocoordination Chemistry</i>. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyses the hydration of carbon dioxide (<a href="#eqn7.2">Eqn. 7.2</a>) and contains zinc(II) at the active site. The coordination number of the zinc is thought to vary between four and five in the catalytic cycle and one of the ligands is a water molecule which is deprotonated with a pK<sub>a</sub> close to seven under physiological conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Complexes of the ligand <a href="#mol7.14"><b>7.14</b></a> are obtained from template condensations of 2,6-diacetylpyridine with H<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> NMe(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> NH<sub>2</sub> in the presence of metal ions. The zinc complex [Zn(<a href="#mol7.14"><b>7.14</b></a>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2+</sup> contains a five coordinate zinc centre with one axial water molecule. The <i>pK<sub>a</sub></i> of the coordinated water molecule closely resembles that of the metalloenzyme and the complex shows very modest catalytic activity for the reaction in <a href="#eqn7.2">Eqn. 7.2</a>. Zinc complexes of the macrocycle <a href="#mol7.14"><b>7.15</b></a> have also been used as models for the active site of carbonic anhydrase and, although they are not particularly effective for the hydration reaction they reproduce a number of the dynamic features associated with a change in coordination number from four to five and also interact with thiocyanate SCN<sup>&#8722;</sup>. This latter ion is frequently used as a model for carbon dioxide as it possesses the same linear geometry.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was introduced in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a>. At the time of its structural elucidation it was thought remarkable that a cobalt(III) complex could form stable Co-C bonds in aqueous solution under physiological conditions. It was thought that the macrocyclic ligand was important and numerous cobalt(III) macrocyclic complexes were prepared in attempts to reproduce this behaviour. The studies proved to be rather too successful &#8211; the vast majority of macrocyclic ligands are able to give complexes containing stable Co<sup>III</sup>-C bonds, but in retrospect it turns out that the majority of non-cyclic ligands are also capable of such stabilization. Nevertheless, there is a large variety of macrocyclic derivatives containing organometallic cobalt(III) centres which reproduce some of the features of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemerythrin and hemocyanin are both dioxygen carrier proteins found in various types of invertebrates. The dioxygen-binding sites contain two iron or two copper centres respectively. Much effort has been expended in the preparation of model dinuclear complexes which reproduce the spectroscopic (if not the chemical) properties of these metalloproteins. Some of the most successful models have used the very simple ligand triazacyclononane and <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a> shows a dinuclear iron complex of this ligand which reproduces many of the structural features of haemerythrin. The key features are the presence of two bridging carboxylate ligands together with a bridging oxo ligand. More recent work with triazacyclononane has provided models for a range of other iron and copper metalloproteins. Some derivatives of <a id="page_89" class="page">89, Other aspects of macrocyclic chemistry</a> triazacyclononane have found commercial application as ligands in manganese-based oxidation catalysts.</p>

<p class="indent">We conclude this section by noting a number of additional biological processes in which metal complexes of macrocyclic ligands are involved. Because so many biological processes involve iron complexes, very sophisticated mechanisms have evolved for the control of iron metabolism. Some aerobic bacteria have developed extremely effective ligands known as <i>siderophores</i> for the binding of iron. These iron(III) complexes of these ligands are very stable (lg <i>K</i> &#62; 30). The ferrichromes are one class of siderophore and consist of 18-membered ring oligopeptide macrocycles bearing appended hydroxamate groups. Three deprotonated hydroxamate groups bind the iron as iron(III) and are so effective that the bacteria can leach iron from stainless steel. A different macrocyclic ligand called enterobactin is used by enteric bacteria. Once again amino acids provide the macrocyclic structure, but in enterobactin the iron is bound by three catechol substituents. This compound has the highest known binding constant for iron(III) with a lg <i>K</i> value in the region of 52! Because the macrocyclic core is derived from (chiral) amino acids, the absolute stereochemistry at the metal centre (<i>&#916;</i> or <i>&#923;</i>) is predetermined. Naturally occurring enterobactin gives a &#916; iron complex.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> Concluding remarks.</h2>
<p class="noindent">This book has given no more than an overview of macrocyclic coordination chemistry. Some indication of the range of ligands which have been studied has been given, together with key features of the structural and reaction chemistry of the complexes that are formed. Throughout the book, various applications have been briefly discussed although these have not been collected together into a single chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">It is probably true that macrocyclic chemistry is currently in a consolidation phase. The basic synthetic strategies are well-established and the coordination chemistry is well-understood. Much of the current effort in the area is related to optimizing properties of interest and the fabrication of devices incorporating macrocyclic ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Is macrocyclic chemistry any different from other areas of coordination chemistry? Probably not - but it has been responsible for a change in the way in which inorganic chemists think about the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">And as I said at the beginning, macrocyclic chemistry is, above all, fun.</p>
