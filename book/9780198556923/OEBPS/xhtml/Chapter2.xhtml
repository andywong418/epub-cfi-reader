<p class="noindent2">The chelate effect states that complexes with polydentate ligands will be more stable than complexes with similar monodentate ligands.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Ammonia and amines have been important ligands in coordination chemistry since the time of Werner. Early in the development of the subject, it was found that complexes with polydentate, chelating ligands were subjectively and quantitatively more stable than complexes with monodentate ligands and this phenomenon was described as the <i>chelate effect.</i> The effect was found to be sequential and the stability increased as more donors were incorporated into the polydentate ligands. A typical sequence of stabilities is presented in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> leads to an obvious question, which will be discussed in detail in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>. Are complexes with cyclam more stable than those with the open-chain tetradentate ligand?</p>
<p class="indent">As a result, a vast range of macrocyclic ligands incorporating varying numbers of nitrogen atoms in rings of various sizes have been prepared, although the majority contain four donors (<a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.1</b></a>). These macrocycles, typified by cyclam, are known as the <i>tetraazamacrocycles.</i> Rings with greater or smaller numbers of donor atoms are less important, with the exception of the small macrocycle tacn which has a rich and interesting chemistry.</p>

<p class="indent">Varying the number of methylene spacer groups within the structure <a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.1</b></a> allows ring size effects to be studied - for example, cyclam may be compared with cyclen. The basic structure <a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.1</b></a> has been modified in numerous ways. Substituents may be introduced at nitrogen or carbon. Rings may be linked together through spacer groups or fused. Functional substituents may be incorporated to give additional donor sites or sites which may undergo other types of reaction. Such systems are often described as &#8216;pendant arm&#8217; macrocycles.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, pendant arm macrocycles have been prepared with some specific application in mind &#8211; in other words, the macrocyclic core provides a central structure upon which additional functionality may be built. An example is <a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.2</b></a> which is readily prepared by the reaction of cyclam with acrylonitrile followed by reduction of the terminal nitrile residue. The exocyclic amino groups are capable of binding to additional metal ions, or to the metal ion within the macrocycle and may also be protonated.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitrogen donors are not limited to <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized amines and a vast number of macrocyclic ligands based upon imine or pyridine donors have been prepared and studied. Once again, this represents an extension of the known chemistry of open-chain ligands to cyclic systems. Typical examples include the mixed imine-amine ligand <a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.3</b></a> and the pyridine macrocycle <a href="#mol2.1"><b>2.4</b></a>. Once again, numerous highly functionalized derivatives have been prepared.</p>
<p class="indent">The ligands may be neutral, anionic or (less commonly) cationic. Anionic ligands may result from deprotonation of NH or other acidic groups and include the fully conjugated systems <a href="#mol2.5"><b>2.5</b></a> and <a href="#mol2.5"><b>2.6</b></a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In general, these nitrogen donor macrocycles exhibit a similar coordination behaviour to their open-chain analogues and form complexes which often resemble, but are significantly more stable than, familiar compounds with amines, imines or pyridine donors. This means that the coordination chemistry of these nitrogen donor macrocycles will be dominated by the <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>transition metals, the lanthanoids and the actinoids. One of the enjoyable aspects of macrocyclic ligands is the possibility of imposing unusual coordination numbers or geometries upon metal centres as a result of the preorganized structure. Ligand <a href="#mol2.7"><b>2.7</b></a> has been designed to impose a pentagonal planar donor set onto a metal centre whilst <a href="#mol2.7"><b>2.8</b></a> asks what happens when a reasonably flexible ligand presenting seven donor atoms interacts with a metal centre.</p>

<p class="noindent">As mentioned in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>, numerous naturally occurring and biologically important macrocycles are based upon the porphyrin ring system. It is this feature, together with the substantially different properties associated with the rigid, highly preorganized, macrocycles which lead us to treat these compounds separately from other nitrogen donor ligands. A closely related, but synthetic macrocycle is phthalocyanine, which incorporates the four nitrogen donors of the porphyrin, but replaces the <i>meso</i> carbon atoms, between the five membered rings, by nitrogen atoms. In addition, each five membered ring has a fused benzo group attached. Although these macrocyclic ligands are just special examples of nitrogen donor ligands, the enormous number of examples and the huge literature justify their special treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The porphyrin ring system is ubiquitous in nature and iron-porphyrin complexes are involved in most aspects of dioxygen binding, transport and metabolism in the higher organisms. Closely related compounds play critical roles in the crucial electron-transfer processes associated with respiration and are involved in many of the most important metabolic oxidation and reduction processes. The iron complexes are associated with proteins in the so-called <i>heme</i> (or <i>haem)</i> proteins. The iron complex of protoporphyrin IX incorporates many of the structural features which are found in the iron complexes associated with the heme proteins.</p>
<p class="indent">The interest in porphyrin derivatives lies in the preparation of model compounds which might mimic the biological species which are involved in electron-transfer and dioxygen-activation processes. The synthesis of simple porphyrins such as meso-tetraphenylporphyrin, from benzaldehyde and pyrrole in the presence of Lewis acids is facile. Like porphyrins, phthalocyanines and their complexes are highly coloured, and numerous <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a> derivatives have found applications as pigments or dyestuffs. Once again, the synthesis of the parent phthalocyanine ring system is facile, and simply heating phthalonitrile with metal salts leads directly to metal complexes.</p>

<p class="indent">Much synthetic effort has been expended on the preparation of macrocyclic complexes which bind dioxygen in a similar manner to the heme proteins such as hemoglobin or myoglobin. Although cobalt and nickel complexes have been used successfully, the majority of such studies concentrate upon iron compounds and one such model system is seen in <a href="#mol2.9"><b>2.9</b></a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">&#181;-oxo means that an oxygen atom is in a bridging position between two metal centres.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the major difficulties associated with the modelling of dioxygen binding by iron(II) complexes is the irreversible formation of dinuclear iron(III) &#181;-oxo bridged species (<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). The picket fence porphyrins were prepared with bulky substituents to prevent such reactions occurring. When the axial ligand L is a substituted imidazole, the picket fence porphyrins are able to bind dioxygen in a reversible manner that closely resembles the behaviour of the natural hemoproteins.</p>

<p class="indent">Other biologically important macrocyclic ligands are based upon the structurally related corrin ring system. The corrin system is a partially reduced derivative of porphyrin, in which one of the <i>meso</i> carbon atoms has been replaced by a direct interannular C&#8211;C bond. This ring system is found in the Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> group of cobalt complexes. In Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> itself the cobalt has a cyanide ligand attached to one of the axial sites and a heterocyclic nitrogen donor of one of the substituents of the corrin in the other. This is shown in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. The cyanide ligand arises during the isolation of the compound and the biologically active coenzyme contains a C-bonded organic group. The macrocyclic system is capable of stabilizing an organometallic compound in aqueous, physiological conditions!</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">A closely related macrocycle is found in the chlorophylls, which are the magnesium complexes responsible for the harvesting and conversion of light energy to chemical energy in the photosynthetic apparatus of green plants. In these compounds, the porphyrin structure is further elaborated by the fusion of an additional five-membered ring to the periphery of the macrocycle. The long chains are important in the orientation of the molecules within the entire photosynthetic apparatus.</p>

<p class="indent">Porphyrins and phthalocyanines form complexes with most of the elements in the periodic table, regardless of their metallic or non-metallic character. The study of the coordination chemistry of these <i>N</i><sub>4</sub> donor ligand gives valuable insights into bioinorganic chemistry and also provides some of the more successful examples of biomimetic systems. The structural development of such macrocyclic ligands has exercised the skills and imagination of many synthetic chemists as they try to reproduce the complexities of biological systems under <i>in vitro</i> conditions. In part, the interest in these systems stems from their remarkable chemical and thermal stability and derivatives are now finding applications as components in systems designed for molecular electronics and photonics (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Crown ethers</h2>
<p class="indent">The cyclic polyethers (crown ethers) were introduced in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a> and form a large family of ligands with varying ring sizes and numbers of donor atoms. Ring sizes vary from the 12-membered macrocycle 12-crown-4, <a href="#mol2.10"><b>2.10</b></a> through 15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6 to compounds with 11 or more oxygen atoms, such as 33-crown-11, <a href="#mol2.10"><b>2.11</b></a>.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="mol2.10"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0024.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<a id="page_12" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 12, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>
<p class="indent">The crown ethers were an accidental discovery, but it was soon noticed that Group 1 compounds exhibited very strange properties in the presence of the poly ethers. For example, when solutions of 18-crown-6 or dibenzo-18-crown-6 in benzene are shaken with solid potassium permanganate, some of the salt dissolves to give a coloured solution (&#8216;purple benzene&#8217;). In the absence of the crown ether, KMnO<sub>4</sub> is completely insoluble in benzene. The metal ion coordination chemistry of the crown ethers is predominantly associated with the elements of Groups 1, 2 and 3, although a wide range of other complexes are known. The structures of the crown ethers, and their coordination behaviour are reminiscent of those of antibiotics such as nonactin and it should be remembered that the cyclic polyethers are potentially extremely toxic and biologically active compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, considerable structural development is possible and numerous derivatives with innocent or functional substituents are known. Crown ethers with fused benzo rings (for example, dibenzo-18-crown-6) are commonly encountered and it is found that the solubility properties vary considerably with substitution. The majority of crown ethers are based upon the &#8211;OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O&#8211; motif, but series of compounds are known in which some or all of the subunits are replaced by generic &#8211;O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>O&#8211; groups.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">Not all crown ethers are crown-shaped!</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Although they are still termed crown ethers, many of the larger members of the group are highly flexible and do not necessarily adopt the archetypal &#8216;crown&#8217; conformation. A typical example is seen in the severely twisted solid state structure of tetrabenzo(b,e,q,t)-30-crown-10 (<a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). Although crown ethers and azamacrocycles have many structural features in common, their coordination behaviour is almost mutually exclusive. In addition, more crown ethers containing large rings and large numbers of donor atoms are known, and have been studied, than azamacrocycles.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">As mentioned, structural development is possible and numerous derivatives of crown ethers have been prepared, usually with the aim of modifying the binding of Group 1 or 2 metal ions or with the intention of designing systems whose response to an external stimulus is modified in the presence of these metal ions. A typical example is <a href="#mol2.12">2.12</a> in which the binding of Group 1 metals to the crown ether is likely to modify the photochemical <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization of the diazo linker &#8211; or alternatively, the binding of the metal ions could be <i>switched</i> by the <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Cryptands and cavitands and encapsulating ligands</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the same way that macrocyclic ligands are related to open-chain ligands, it is possible to expand the structures into the third dimension to give species which are capable of <i>encapsulating</i> a metal ion or other species. Early examples of such ligands were the so-called <i>cryptands</i> (which form metal complexes called <i>cryptates</i>). This nomenclature arises from the concept of incarcerating a metal ion within the cavity of the ligand. These are extensions of the crown ethers and which make use of bridgehead nitrogen atoms to attach additional functionality, leading to a bicyclic system. The cryptands are named according to the number of oxygen donor atoms which are present in the bridges; thus, <a href="#mol2.19"><b>2.19</b></a> is known as [2.2.1] and <a href="#mol2.19"><b>2.20</b></a> as [2.2.2]. Numerous related ligands such as <a href="#mol2.19"><b>2.21</b></a> which combine nitrogen and oxygen donors have been prepared. The coordination chemistry of cryptands is primarily associated with Group 1 and Group 2 elements although they also have a rich anion coordination chemistry. Compound <a href="#mol2.19"><b>2.21</b></a> is a curiosity, a &#8216;what if&#8217; ligands &#8211; what happens if a ligand which binds a Group 1 metal (the diazacrown) is combined with one which binds transition metals (the 2,2&#8242;- <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>bipyridine)? One of the problems with these ligands relates to the role of the bridgehead nitrogen atoms. Although they have been drawn such that the nitrogen lone pair appears to be directed into the macrocyclic cavity, the equilibrium conformation of the free ligand may differ, in which case conformational changes are necessary if the nitrogen atoms are to be involved in binding metal ions.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>Host-guest</i> interactions are a very important part of contemporary chemistry. Concepts of <i>molecular recognition</i> spring from interactions of this type.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Although their detailed coordination chemistry is beyond the scope of this book, it is worthwhile introducing a number of miscellaneous oxygen containing ligands at this point. These compounds form complexes with Group 1 and other metals, but interest in them lies more often in the binding and recognition of organic compounds. These molecules represent molecular <i>hosts</i> which can bind a variety of <i>guest</i> molecules. Early examples were the spherands <a href="#mol2.22"><b>2.22</b></a> which possess ether oxygen atoms at each end of a tube-shaped molecule (<a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>); the six oxygen atoms of <a href="#mol2.22"><b>2.22</b></a> provide an <i>O</i><sub>6</sub> donor set and lithium and sodium ions are bound very strongly in the centre of the molecule. A related host structure is found in the calixarene family of molecules. These are molecules formed from the condensation of a phenol with formaldehyde in the presence of base and contain from 4 to 8 aromatic rings. A typical example is the calix[6]arene <a href="#mol2.22"><b>2.23</b></a>. Although the calixarenes certainly interact with Group 1 metal ions, they are more studied because of their ability to incorporate organic guests within the, moderately, hydrophilic cavity. The calixarenes are, like the spherands, cup- or tub-shaped molecules (<a href="#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>). However, the calixarenes are not conformationally fixed, and a large number of conformations are possible in which the mutual orientation of adjacent rings may be described by 'up-up' or 'up-down' arrangements of the phenolic hydroxy groups leading to a specialized nomenclature(<i>cone, partial cone, alternate </i>etc.).

<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">Many metalloproteins contain two or more metal centres in close proximity; hemerythrin contains two Fe centres, hemocyanin two Cu, a range of <i>iron-sulfur</i> proteins contain two, three, four or more Fe centres in combination with sulfide ions, the photosynthetic dioxygen evolving centre contains four Mn, laccase contains three Cu <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Inorganic chemists are frequently interested in controlling and modifying the interactions between two or more metal centres. Very often, the impetus comes from a desire to understand the functioning of polynuclear sites within metalloproteins or to optimize electron transfer or energy transfer processes in artificial systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Two approaches are immediately apparent; two macrocycles may be covalently linked together to so as to bring two bound metal centres into close proximity, or a large macrocyclic ligand may be designed which will bind two metal ions within the same cavity.

<p class="indent">Using this approach, it is relatively easy to estimate the <i>hole-size </i>(radius of the available cavity) for simple ligands such as the tetraazamacrocycles and crown ethers. The radius <i>r</i> that we have measured consists of that of the available cavity <i>r</i>(H) plus the radius of the donor atom <i>r</i>(D). The radii of donor atoms are known (we use Pauling covalent radii here although some workers advocate van der Waals radii) and simple subtraction yields the hole-size. The basic method is presented in <a href="#fig2.16">Fig. 2.16</a> for cyclam. By studying a range of cyclam ligands and complexes, <i>r</i> values between 1.90 and 2.10 A corresponding to <i>r</i>(H) of 1.18 to 1.38 &#197; are obtained.</p>

<p class="indent">Why was it necessary to give a range of values for the hole size? One of the principal problems is related to the conformation of the flexible macrocyclic ligand. If the salt [H<sub>2</sub>cyclam][ClO<sub>4</sub>]2 is studied, two N...N distances of 4.223 and 3.968 &#197; are observed giving <i>r</i>(H) of 1.395 and 1.260 A respectively. Which should we take? Two series of nickel(II) complexes with cyclam are known. In the first, the nickel is six-coordinate and octahedral with the cyclam occupying the equatorial sites and two additional axial ligands above and below the cyclam, whereas in the second a low-spin square-planar nickel(II) lies in the macrocyclic cavity and no axial ligands are present. The diameter of the cavity in <i>trans</i>-[Ni(cyclam)Cl2] is 4.134 &#197; (<i>r</i>(H) <a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>= 1.35 &#197;) whereas in low-spin [Ni(cyclam)][ZnCl<sub>4</sub>] it is 3.828 &#197; (<i>r</i>(H) = 1.19 &#197;). The flexibility of the ligand allows the nitrogen donors to move to give optimal metal-nitrogen distances. Whilst it is reassuring to have our feeling that low-spin nickel(II) is &#8216;smaller&#8217; than the high-spin ion, these measurements bring the first hint that it will only be possible to define an unambiguous hole-size for a completely rigid ligand.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>Exocyclic</i> means that the lone pairs of the donors are oriented away from the central cavity. <i>Endocyclic</i> means that the lone pairs are oriented into the cavity.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">What can we do to compare cyclam with cyclen? If the distance between the nitrogen atoms is measured for the hydrochloride salt of cyclen, a radius of about 2.6 &#197; (<i>r</i>(H) = 1.9 &#197;) is obtained, suggesting that cyclen is larger than cyclam! In this hydrochloride salt, cyclen adopts a conformation in which the nitrogen atoms &#8216;point outwards&#8217; in an exocyclic mode (<a href="#fig2.17">Fig. 2.17</a>). Clearly it is necessary to compare similar conformations of the ligands if the comparison is to be meaningful. If the hydrate of cyclen is taken, which has two endocyclic and two exocyclic nitrogen atoms, <i>r</i>(H) values of 1.31 to 1.42 A are obtained - the same as cyclam! In fact, because cyclen does not form directly analogous complexes to cyclam, it is very difficult to quantify our &#8216;feeling&#8217; that cyclen is smaller than cyclam using crystallographic data. The best way to obtain an estimate for cyclen is to draw a best-fit circle through the nitrogen donors of the ligand in a hypothetical conformation in which they are endocyclic and planar.</p>
<p class="indent">The simple approach discussed above does allow us to evaluate the effect of substituents. A comparison of <i>trans</i>-[Ni(cyclam)Cl<sub>2</sub>] with <i>trans</i>-[Ni(<a href="#mol2.42"><b>2.42</b></a>)F<sub>2</sub>] indicates an increase in hole-size from 1.34 to 1.41 &#197; upon introduction of the methyl substituents, an effect that may be traced to steric interactions between the substituents and the axial ligands.</p>

<p class="indent">The crown ethers present a much wider series of ligands which allow us to probe hole-size effects in more detail. It is necessary to modify the method of determination, because ligands such as 15-crown-5 do not have any diametrically opposed oxygen atoms. It is better to define the hole-size as the radius of the best fit circle through the donor atoms. However, even this method has its problems if the conformation of the free ligand or of the ligand in a particular complex is markedly non-planar. Our ideas of hole size are really only valid for a planar or near-planar set of donor atoms. Fortunately, many simple crown ethers do form complexes with the donor sets approaching planarity. Once again, we have to take into account the conformation of the ligands in the complex, rather than that in the free ligands. Some typical values are given in Table 2.1. The uncertainties are great and it is clearly not a useful concept to talk about a <i>unique</i> hole-size for a particular ligand.</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly the presence of mixed donor atoms will further complicate the calculation of the hole-size, as will significant deviations from planarity or the introduction of unsaturated bonds into the ring structure. With mixed donor macrocycles it will be necessary to take into account the varying covalent radii of the donor atoms. The introduction of unsaturation will normally be beneficial, as it reduces the number of conformations which are available. Furthermore, any additional ligands or anions coordinated to the metal ion are likely to perturb the metal-ligand distances and geometry. Various attempts have been made to more fully quantify the concept of hole-size with varying degerees of success. We will now take the <i>concept</i> and see what the consequences for coordination chemistry are, without going into details of these calculations.

<p class="noindent">As discussed above, a given ligand has a loosely defined cavity available for binding guest ions or molecules. We might expect to find the best binding of the guest if its fit into the macrocyclic cavity is optimal. In terms of metal coordination chemistry, this refers to the ability to form metal-ligand bonds with the optimal bond lengths and with the distribution of the donor atoms in a favourable geometrical arrangement about the metal. Furthermore, these optimal metal-ligand interactions should be achieved without the introduction of unfavourable steric interactions within the ligand framework.</p>

<p class="indent">What exactly does <i>r</i>(H) refer to and what does it tell us? As we decided to use covalent radii for the donor atoms it is appropriate to choose covalent radii for the metal centres, even though these may not be the intiuitive values to use for complexes containing metal ions! However, equivalent results aie obtained if we choose to use van der Waals radii for the donors and ionic radii for the metal ions. We commence our discussion with crown ethers and then extend the observations to macrocyclic ligands with other donor sets.</p>
<p class="indent">As mentioned previously, the crown ethers form complexes primarily with alkali and alkaline earth metal ions. We can now try to match the sizes of the crown ethers to Group 1 and Group 2 metal ions. The smallest crown ether, 12-crown-4 is more-or-less compatible with the lithium cation and a series of 1:1 complexes with lithium salts are known. However, the lithium ion is a little too large for the cavity and typically lies somewhat above the mean plane of the four oxygen donors. In the salts [Li(12-crown-4)X] (X = Cl or SCN) the anion is also coordinated to the lithium giving a five-coordinate square-based pyramidal geometry. It is rather like the argument about the chicken and the <i>egg</i> to ask if the lithium rises out of the plane because of the axial ligand or whether the axial ligand binds because the metal ion sits above the macrocycle. A similar effect is seen with 15-crown-5 and Na<sup>+</sup>, and the sodium cation lies somewhat above the five oxygen donors in the complex [Na(benzo-15-crown-5)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]I. The lithium lies about 0.93 &#197; above the <i>O</i><sub>4</sub> least-squares plane in [Li(12-crown-4)Cl] whilst the sodium is <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>0.75&#228; above the O5 least-squares plane of the macrocycle in [Na(benzo-15-crown-5)(H<sub>2</sub>0)]I (<a href="#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">When the metal ion is a little too large for the macrocyelie cavity, we expect to see it sitting above the donor set, as indeed we do in the lithium and sodium complexes above where the fit is not perfect. An extension of this pattern leads to a second structural motif, in which two of the macrocyelie ligands sandwich the metal ion. This type of complex is found in the complex [Na(12-crown-4)2][ClO<sub>4</sub>] in which the average O-Na bond length is 2.5&#197; and the sodium lies close to the mid point (1.5&#197;) between the two <i>O</i><sub>4</sub> best planes (<a href="#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>). Similar arguments lead to the prediction of sandwich complexes between potassium ions and 15-crown-5 and this indeed occurs in complexes such as [K(15-crown-5)2]I.</p>
<p class="indent">However, lest we become overconfident, a few cautionary words are necessary. Although Li<sup>+</sup> ions are approximately the right size for 12-crown-4, and we have seen above that 1:1 complexes may be isolated, a second <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Types of macrocyclic ligand and their complexes</a>series of Li:12-crown-4 complexes may be isolated. These contain sandwich [Li(12-crown-4)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cations (<a href="#fig2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>). It is not even completely correct to state that the sandwich structures result when the metal ion is too large for the macrocyclic cavity. Even though Cs<sup>+</sup> cations are significantly larger than the cavity in 18-crown-6, it is possible to obtain complexes which contain the [Cs(18-crown-6)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> sandwich cation (<a href="#fig2.21">Fig. 2.21</a>). An example is seen in the compound [Cs(18-crown-6)<sub>2</sub>]Na which contains the rather unusual sodide Na<sup>&#8211;</sup> anion; the function of the cation is to stabilize this rather reactive anion. However, it is also possible to obtain a 1:1 complex of CsSCN with 18-crown-6 in which the caesium lies slightly above the best plane of the six oxygen donors and is also coordinated to the nitrogen of the thiocyanate (<a href="#fig2.22">Fig. 2.22</a>). It is becoming clear that the structure and stoichiometry of the isolated solid state species is very dependent upon the stoichiometry of the reaction and the presence of any additional anions which may coordinate to the metal ion. As always, it should be mentioned at this point that the isolation of a particular solid state species says nothing <i>a priori</i> about any solution species which might be present, nor indeed about the relative stabilities of any solution species.</p>

<p class="indent">What happens if the metal ion is too small for the bonding cavity of the macrocycle? Without any need to quantify the hole size, if Cs<sup>+</sup> is too large for 18-crown-6 and K<sup>+</sup> is the correct size, then it is likely that Na<sup>+</sup> will be too small for the bonding cavity. A number of possible things could happen. Only some of the donor atoms might be bonded to the metal ion, or in the case of a dramatic mismatch in the hole-size and the size of the cation, two or more metal ions might be incorporated. Another possible consequence is that the macrocyclic ligand undergoes a radical conformational change to adopt some sort of a folded conformation which optimises the metal-donor atom distances. A series of complexes containing {Na(18-crown-6)} cations are known, but the structures are very variable (<a href="#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a>). In the cases of a salt with a porphyrinatoiron(III) complex anion the very distorted structure shown in <a href="#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a> a is found with Na-0 bond lengths varying from 2.364 &#197; to 2.800 &#197;, whereas in [Na(18-crown-6)(H<sub>2</sub>O)](SCN) the distorted cation shown in <a href="#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a> b is formed in which the folding of the ligand generates six approximately equal Na-0 bonds. In contrast, the change of the anion to a ruthenium cluster leads to the cation shown in <a href="#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a> c with five short and one long Na-0 bonds. This latter structure approximates to what we might expect, with one of the oxygen atoms &#8216;folding&#8217; over to encompass the sodium cation.</p>

<p class="indent">The situation with cryptands is a little easier, although even here it is not possible to unambiguously define a hole-size.

How can this be? In the case of the potassium complex, the K-0 distances are in the range 2.776 - 2.791 &#x00C5; and the nitrogen atoms have a significant interaction with the potassium ions (K-N, 2.874 &#x00C5;). The binding of the non-optimal metal ions, sodium, rubidium and caesium, is achieved by the introduction of significant amounts of strain within the ligand structure. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig2.31">Fig. 2.31</a> which shows the conformation of the ligand in the complexes [K([2.2.2])]I and [Cs([2.2.2])](SCN). The strain may be analysed, <i>inter alia,</i> in terms of the relative angles which the two triangles defined by the oxygen donor atoms at each end of the ligand make with one another. A consequence of this twisting of the two <i>O</i><sub>3</sub> donor sets is the elongation of the cryptand; in [K([2.2.2])]I the non-bonded N...N distance along the long axis of the cation is 5.748 &#x00C5; whereas in [Cs([2.2.2])](SCN), the twisting lengthens this to an N...N distance of 6.095 &#x00C5;.</p>

<p class="indent">Similar effects are observed with the tetraazamacrocyclic ligands. The hole-size of cyclam is more-or-less ideal for nickel(II) ions.

This is in accord with the experimental observations that both four-coordinate and six-coordinate nickel(II) complexes are formed. The ligand is sufficiently flexible that small conformational changes allow the optimisation of the nickel-nitrogen distances. Thus, in square-planar [Ni(cyclam)]I<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#fig2.32">Fig. 2.32</a> a) in which the iodide anions are not coordinated to the metal, the Ni-N distances lie between 1.940 and 1.959 &#x00C5; whereas in the octahedral complex <i>trans</i>-[Ni(cyclamm)Cl<sub>2</sub>] in which the two chloride ligands occupy the axial sites the Ni-N distances are between 2.066 and 2.067 &#x00C5; (<a href="#fig2.32">Fig. 2.32</a> b).</p>

<p class="indent">Before finishing the discussion of cyclam and related ligands, it is worthwhile making some additional comments on the conformation of the ligands.

<p class="indent">Finally, we consider the consequences of hole-size mismatch with rigid and relatively inflexible ligands such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The extensive derealization in the ligands means that a planar conformation is favoured on electronic grounds. The basic donor set consists of four nitrogen atoms within a 16-membered ring for both ligands. Our usual hole-size analysis leads to values of <i>r</i>(H) in the range 1.1 - 1.35 &#x00C5;. This suggests that the cavity is approximately the correct size (although perhaps a little small) for first row transition metal divalent cations or Li<sup>+</sup>. Coordination of porphyrins or phthalocyanines to metal ions normally involves the doubly deprotonated dianionic forms of the ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Compounds such as {Li<sub>2</sub>(pc)} (H<sub>2</sub>pc = phthalocyanine) must formally contain two lithium cations and a pc<sup>2&#8722;</sup> anion; however, there is not sufficient room for two lithium ions within the macrocyclic cavity and the compound should be formulated as Li[Li(pc)]. The [Li(pc)]<sup>&#8722;</sup> anion is known in a number of salts and is essentially planar (<a href="#fig2.35">Fig. 2.35</a> a). In contrast, the complex [Ni(tpp)] (H<sub>2</sub>tpp = <i>meso</i>-tetraphenylporphyrin) is decidedly concave, presumably as a result of a mismatch between the cavity size and the metal ion (<a href="#fig2.35">Fig. 2.35</a> b). This sort of deviation is to be expected if the metal ion is a little too small for the cavity. Support for this comes from the observation that larger, second row metal cations, give rise to essentially planar complexes, as seen, for example, in [Ru(tpp)(CO)(EtOH)]. However, this analysis is certainly over-naive, as the octahedral complex [Ni(tpp)(py)<sub>2</sub>] (py = pyridine) contains a near-planar nickel-porphyrin core.</p>
