<h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">It would be impossible to discuss the reactivity of macrocyclic complexes in detail in a book many times this length, let alone within one Chapter. However, I hope that this Chapter will leave the reader with a taste for the various types of reaction which are possible.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Axial substitution reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the simplest reactions which could be envisaged is the exchange of axial ligands X and Y in a macrocyclic complex [ML(X)(Y)]<sup>n+</sup> (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). The high kinetic and thermal stability of macrocyclic complexes means that it is possible to design systems in which no competitive displacement of the macrocyclic ligand occurs. Even with chelating open-chain ligands such high specificity is hard to find. As a result, macrocyclic complexes have been used for a number of fundamental investigations into the mechanism of substitution of ligands in transition metal complexes. The majority of studies have involved cobalt(III) complexes of tetraaza macrocyclic ligands. By using large numbers of complexes with different X and Y axial ligands and with different incoming ligands it is possible to probe very precisely such things as the <i>trans effect</i> in octahedral complexes. Another advantage of such systems is that there is usually no stereochemical change in the course of the reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Much of the interest in transition metal complexes of porphyrins and related ligands is coupled with the important biological roles that these compounds play. Naturally, numerous synthetic porphyrins have been<a id="page_70" class="page">70, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> prepared which are intended to model such biological functions as the binding of dioxygen. This is, of course, just a special case of a ligand displacement reaction, where the incoming ligand is a dioxygen molecule and the leaving ligand is a solvent (usually water).</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, there has also been much interest in the synthesis of simpler, non-porphyrin macrocycles which also give complexes which can bind dioxygen reversibly. Surprisingly large numbers of compounds are now known which bind oxygen with varying degrees of efficiency and varying degrees of reversibility. Although complexes with open-chain ligands are of increasing importance, many of the earliest and still the most efficient, systems are based upon macrocycles.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed earlier, the problem is in avoiding the irreversible formation of <i>&#956;</i>-oxo complexes. One of the approaches that has been developed involves the linkage of two macrocycles together such that dioxygen can generate a bridging peroxo or superoxo ligand between two metal centres, but which are sufficiently rigidly linked that the metal centres cannot close up to permit the formation of a <i>&#956;</i>-oxo bridge. Cobalt(II) and iron(II) complexes of ligands such as <a href="#mol6.1"><b>6.1</b></a> have been found to reversibly bind dioxygen under specific conditions.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="mol6.1"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0191.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Related mononuclear systems have also been prepared and shown to bind dioxygen. In these case, the trick is to place a bulky strap over the top of the macrocycle such that dimerization to give <i>&#956;</i>-oxo compounds is not possible. One such example is the ligand <a href="#mol6.2"><b>6.2</b></a>, which forms an iron(II) complex which can bind dioxygen. Macrocycles of this type have been called <i>lacunar</i> ligands.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reactions of the coordinated macrocyclic ligand</h2>
<p class="noindent">The high stability of macrocyclic complexes means that it is often possible to perform reactions upon the coordinated ligand which would lead to decomposition of the complex if open-chain ligands were used. These reactions may be used for the subsequent structural development of the macrocyclic ligand to incorporate additional functionality or to develop three-dimensional cage structures from two-dimensional cores.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the very simplest reactions that might be envisaged is the alkylation of a nitrogen donor, to convert a secondary amine to a tertiary amine. If this reaction is attempted on the free amines, it is not usually possible to halt the reaction at the monoalkylation stage and significant amounts of quaternized ammonium salts are obtained. In a coordinated amine, the metal acts as a protecting group and prevents the formation of the quaternized compound. A typical example of an alkylation reaction is seen in the methylation of the complex [Ni(cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup> with methy iodide to give [Ni(Me<sub>4</sub>cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup>. The interest in this reaction lies in the fact that the product is not the same as that obtained from the reaction of nickel(II) salts with Me<sub>4</sub>cyclam. The direct reaction with Me<sub>4</sub>yclam gives a complex with the conformation in <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a> a (which has <i>RSRS</i> absolute stereochemistry at the nitrogen centres) whereas the alkylation of [Ni(cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup> gives the favoured <i>RSSR</i> diastereomer seen in <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a> b (see also p. 29). The methyl substituents have a significant steric influence and Me<sub>4</sub>yclam tends to form five coordinate complexes with a single axial ligand (<a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps more interesting are reactions of the carbon framework of the macrocyclic ligand with electrophiles. Numerous examples of such reactions are known, many of which are based upon macrocycles such as the ligand in <a href="#fig6.3"><b>6.3</b></a> which contains the diaza analogue of a <i>&#946;</i>-diketonate. A typical reaction is shown in <a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a> in which the nickel(II) complex <a href="#fig6.3"><b>6.3</b></a> is methylated at the nucleophilic carbon of the ligand. The ligand in <a href="#fig6.3"><b>6.3</b></a> has been explicitly drawn in the deprotonated form, and it is the neutral nickel(II) complex of the double-deprotonated ligand that is usually isolated. The closely related complex <a href="#mol6.4"><b>6.4</b></a> deprotonates readily to give <a href="#mol6.4"><b>6.5</b></a> and has been shown to have a<a id="page_72" class="page">72,, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> <i>pK</i><sub>a</sub> of 6.45 which indicates that the methylene protons are significantly activated upon coordination.</p>

<p class="indent">Exploiting the reactivity of these nucleophilic carbon sites in macrocyclic ligands opens up an entire range of chemistry. Reactions are not limited to the use of simple alkylating agents and the reaction of <a href="#mol6.6"><b>6.6</b></a> with ethyl acrylate leads to the <i>C</i>-functionalized complex <a href="#mol6.6"><b>6.7</b></a>. In contrast, when cyclam or [Ni(cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup> are reacted with ethyl acrylate or acrylonitrile, reaction occurs at the amines to give mixtures of <i>N</i>-functionalized compounds.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="mol6.6"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0200.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">It is even possible to acylate macrocyclic complexes of this type and these reactions give an entry into compounds such as <a href="#mol6.1"><b>6.1</b></a> and <a href="#mol6.2"><b>6.2</b></a>. The acylation of <a href="#mol6.6"><b>6.6</b></a> with MeCOCl gives the doubly acylated complex <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.8</b></a> in good yield. If this new complex is now reacted with strong alkylating reagents such as MeSO<sub>3</sub>F, a new complex containing two enol ether functionalities <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.9</b></a> is obtained. This compound is electrophilic and reaction with amines results in the displacement of methanol and the formation of a <i>bis</i>(enamine) <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.10</b></a>. It is compounds such as <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.9</b></a> and <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.10</b></a> which are important in the capping reactions to give <a href="#mol6.1"><b>6.1</b></a> and <a href="#mol6.2"><b>6.2</b></a>. A typical example is seen in the preparation of the capped macrocyclic complex <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.11</b></a> which maybe obtained from the reaction of <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.9</b></a> with octane-1,8-diamine or <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.10</b></a> with 1,8-dibromooctane (<a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>). The ability of the iron(II) and cobalt(II) complexes of these ligands to bind dioxygen has been mentioned earlier. Complex <a href="#mol6.2"><b>6.2</b></a> is formed from the sequential reaction of <a href="#fig6.4"><b>6.9</b></a> with piperazine followed by 1,3-bis(bromomethyl)benzene.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not even necessary for an external electrophile to be involved, and in extreme cases additional ligands bound to the metal centre may react with the macrocyclic framework. A good example of this is seen in the reaction of the complex [Fe(<a href="#mol6.12"><b>6.12</b></a>)(MeCN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with a mild base such as triethylamine. Deprotonation of the methylene groups yields nucleophilic carbon centres which undergo an intramolecular reaction with the acetonitrile ligands to generate <a href="#mol6.13"><b>6.13</b></a> which contains a six-coordinate octahedral iron(II) centre. Interestingly, the solid state structure of the complex reveals that the final structure has a <i>cis</i> arrangement of the functionality derived from the original acetonitrile ligands.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, it must be noted that it is possible to perform conventional &#8216;organic&#8217; electrophilic substitution reactions upon aromatic rings if the macrocyclic complexes are sufficiently stable. A typical example is seen in the bromination of the aromatic ring of <a href="#fig6.5"><b>6.14</b></a> upon reaction of bromine (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>). The reaction is thought to proceed by an initial <i>N</i>-bromination followed by an intramolecular bromine atom transfer.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In addition to reaction of the ligand with electrophiles, unsaturated macrocyclic complexes can also react with nucleophiles. Some of the best examples are found in the reactions of imine ligands. We have previously mentioned that imine formation is a stepwise process and that aminols are involved as intermediates:</p>
<figure style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0206.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure id="mol6.15"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0205.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridization at the central carbon in the aminol and the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridization in the imine mean that the conformations associated with the two compounds will differ and we have seen examples of this in ring contraction reactions. In particular, the aminol will be non-planar whereas the imine can participate in planar conjugated structures. The change from the imine to the aminol results in an effective reduction in hole size. Many examples are known in which reactions expected to give imine macrocycles give ligands in which an aminol is present. In other cases, imine ligands react with water or alcohols to generate <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridized centres. For example, nickel(II) ions are slightly too large for the cavity in <a href="#mol6.15"><b>4.22</b></a> and reaction of the [Ni(<a href="#mol6.15"><b>4.22</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> complex with alcohols in basic conditions generates complexes of <a href="#mol6.15"><b>6.15</b></a> in which the addition of two alcohol molecules to the imine bonds results in the formation of a smaller, non-planar bonding cavity. A mixture of the various diastereomers is expected.</p>
<a id="page_75" class="page" style="width:70%;">75, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a>
<p class="indent">In some cases these reactions may be synthetically useful in the structural development of a macrocyclic ligand. The complex [Ni(<a href="#mol6.15"><b>4.22</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> is activated to attack by nucleophiles as a results of the hole-size of the ligand being slightly too large for the metal ion. If a diol is reacted with [Ni(<a href="#mol6.15"><b>4.22</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> it should be possible to use the reaction for the preparation of capped systems. A typical example of such a reaction is presented in <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a> in which the diol incorporates additional axial donor capacity. In this case, the stereochemistry at the two new <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridized centres is defined, since the capping group must lie above a face of the macrocycle.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Demetallation and metal exchange reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">When template reactions were discussed in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>, it was mentioned that it was found that cyclization reactions were very often template metal ion specific. It is sometimes possible to demetallate the template products to give free ligands which may then be coordinated to the metal of choice. This approach is limited to ligands which are stable and also to those which do not undergo subsequent reactions under the demetallation conditions. Furthermore, as we saw in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>, hole-size effects may result in rearrangement in the second coordination step.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the high kinetic and thermodynamic stability of macrocyclic complexes (see <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>) it is necessary to use forcing conditions to remove metal ions from the complexes. For example, to demetallate [Ni(cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup>complexes it is necessary to use concentrated cyanide solutions. Similarly, to remove the copper(I) centres from catenates, treatment with cyanide is required. This latter reaction leaves the metal-free interlinked rings. In the case of the cobalt(III) sepulchrates formed by the template condensation of [Co(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> with formaldehyde and ammonia, it has proved to be impossible to remove the metal ion from the ligand. Unsaturated ligands, in particular those containing imine bonds, may react with good nucleophiles such as cyanide.</p>
<p class="indent">In some cases it is possible to remove metal ions under relatively mild conditions. This is often the case with complexes of Group 1, 2 or 12 metal ions or in cases where the metal ion is poorly matched to the ligand binding<a id="page_76" class="page">76, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> cavity. Although it is impossible to remove cobalt from cobalt-sepulchrate complexes, mercury(II) complexes of the related cage ligand <a href="#ch6mol2.27"><b>2.27</b></a> may be demetallated by treatment with chloride. In this case, the mercury is removed as the [HgCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#8211;</sup>ion. Phthalocyanine may be prepared from the dilithium complex Li[Li(pc)] by reaction with water or dilute acid. As the dilithium compound is very conveniently prepared from 1,2-dicyanobenzene this represents a useful synthesis of the metal-free ligand. Another example where chloride ion is used to remove a metal ion from a macrocyclic complex is found in the demetallation of [Ni(<a href="#mol6.16"><b>6.16</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> &#8211; the nickel(II) ion is too small for the cavity and it is thus labilized and may be removed as [NiCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#8211;</sup> upon treatment with HCl.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In exceptional cases, template reactions result in the formation of free ligands. Although nickel(II) acts a template for the formation of [Ni(<a href="#mol6.16"><b>2.7</b></a>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)2]<sup>2+</sup> from the bis(hydrazine) and glyoxal, other transition metal cations are ineffective. However, [H<sub>2</sub>(<a href="#mol6.16"><b>2.7</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> is obtained from the template condensation in the presence of SnMe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>; presumably as a result of a hole-size mismatch between the macrocycle and the dimethyltin(IV) cation, the initial product is labile and deposits tin(IV) oxide. Subsequent reaction of the free ligand with transition metal or even Group 1 metal ions results in the formation of the desired complexes of <a href="#mol6.16"><b>2.7</b></a>.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="mol6.16"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0210.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">One other approach which has been adopted involves the <i>exchange</i> of one metal ion for another without the formal isolation of the metal&#8211;free ligand. Zinc, cadmium and mercury complexes have all been used in this way, as have complexes with Group 2 and Group 1 metal ions. One of the problems with phthalocyanine chemistry is the insolubility of the free ligand in almost all solvents. In contrast, the dilithium derivative Li[Li(pc)] is soluble in solvents such as acetone and is a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of other phthalocyanine complexes:</p>
<p class="indent1"><img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0207.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">In earlier chapters a number of examples of macrocyclic ligands obtained from the template condensation of <i>&#945;,&#969;</i>-dicarbonyl compounds with <i>&#945;,&#969;</i>-diamines have been described. Once again, these reactions are rather sensitive to the template metal ion and not all transition metal ions are effective.<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77,, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> However, metal ions such as lead(II) and barium(II) have been found to be effective in the formation of the [2+2] products and subsequent treatment with first row transition metal ions results in transmetallation processes, although in many cases rearrangement of the ligand also occurs. Such an example is the condensation of <a href="#mol6.17"><b>6.17</b></a> with 2,6-diacetylpyridine in the presence of barium(II) gives a barium complex of <a href="#mol6.17"><b>6.18</b></a>. This latter compound itself is of some interest; the Ba<sup>2+</sup> ion is too small for the cavity of the [2+2] macrocycle and a ring-contraction occurs by the addition of the central secondary amine to an imine bond to give an 18-membered ring macrocycle. Subsequent reaction with copper(II) salts results in a reversal of this ring contraction to give <a href="#mol6.17"><b>6.19</b></a> as a dinuclear [Cu<sub>2</sub>(<a href="#mol6.17"><b>6.19</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> complex.</p>

<p class="indent">It was recognized very early on that tetraaza macrocyclic ligands were capable of stabilizing nickel(III) and copper(III) oxidation states and the metal(III) complexes are readily accessible by chemical or electrochemical oxidation of the metal(II) species. The exact redox potential is very dependent upon the structure of the ligand with nickel(II)/(III) potentials ranging over a span of about 2 V for structurally related tetraaza macrocyclic ligands. There are the expected hole-size effects although it is not easy to rationalize the variation &#8211; nickel(III) is less favoured in both 13- and 15-membered rings than in cyclam, even though nickel(III) is a smaller ion than nickel(II). In general, anionic macrocyclic ligands stabilize higher oxidation states better than neutral ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Cobalt complexes of the tetraaza macrocycles show the expected cobalt(II)/(III) redox processes and the complexes [Co(L)X<sub>2</sub>]<sup>n+</sup> show a marked dependence upon the axial ligands. Both outer sphere and inner sphere electron transfer reactions have been observed with cobalt complexes. The cobalt(II)/(III) potential is also very dependent upon the hole-size of the ligand, representing the differing ionic radii of the two oxidation states.</p>

<p class="indent">It is also possible to observe metal-centred reductions to give unusual oxidation states using these saturated macrocyclic ligands.

<p class="indent">The more rigid ligands and the encapsulating ligands are also interesting. The cobalt(III) complex of <a href="#ch6mol2.25"><b>2.25</b></a> is obtained directly from the reaction of [Co(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> with formaldehyde and ammonia. With &#8216;normal&#8217; ligands, cobalt(III) complexes are kinetically inert, but cobalt(II) is labile and in aqueous solution, reduction of cobalt(III) compounds is expected to lead to the formation of [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. In the case of the sepulchrates, the cobalt(II) ion is trapped within the cage and the reduction product is [Co(<a href="#ch6mol2.25"><b>2.25</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup>, which undergoes <i>no</i> metal ion exchange of coordinated cobalt(II) with [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. A number of other unusual oxidation states, such as silver(II), have been stabilized within sepulchrate and related ligands. The ability of crown ethers and cryptands to react with alkali metals to give electrides or sodides has been commented upon earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps even more remarkable is the behaviour of copper(I) catenates in which a copper(I) ion is bound to two interlocked rings (see <a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>). In some of these compounds a reversible copper(I)/(0) process is observed to give a stable copper(0) catenate which does not eliminate copper metal!</p>
<p class="indent">When unsaturated ligands are involved the discussion becomes a little more complicated and it is necessary to distinguish between &#8216;formal&#8217; and &#8216;actual&#8217; oxidation states. A good examples provided by zinc(II) porphyrin complexes. These compounds exhibit two oxidation and two reduction processes corresponding to formal oxidation states of +III, +IV, +1 and 0 respectively. As the known chemistry of zinc is almost exclusively that of<a id="page_79" class="page">79,, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> the divalent state, these assignments seem unlikely. The problem lies in the unsaturation within the ligand. The porphyrin ligand (H<sub>2</sub>L)has a delocalized <i>&#960;</i>-bonding system with both filled <i>&#960;-</i> and low-lying empty <i>&#960;</i>*-orbitals. The oxidation processes correspond to the removal of electrons from the ligand <i>&#960;</i>-orbitals to give ligand cations L<sup>+</sup> and L<sup>2+</sup> rather than from the metal orbitals. Similarly, the reductions involve the placing of electrons into the ligand <i>&#960;*</i>-orbitals to give radical anions L<sup>&#8211;</sup> and L<sup>2&#8211;</sup>. The difficulty comes when the zinc ion is replaced by a metal ion such as iron which can also undergo redox reactions. The problem comes in correlating the observed reduction potentials to particular electronic arrangements. For example, does the first oxidation process of an iron(II) porphyrin complex correspond to the formation of an iron(III) complex [Fe<sup>III</sup>(L)]<sup>+</sup> or an iron(II) ligand cation [Fe<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>+</sup>)]? It is necessary to perform ESR or M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic studies in order to determine whether the unpaired electrons are localized on the metal centre or the ligand and in many cases the answers are not unambiguous. It is certainly the case that iron(I), iron(II), iron(III), iron(IV) and possibly iron(V) and iron(VI) can exist within porphyrin and related ligands. As the understanding of the electronic subtlety of porphyrin-iron complexes is crucial to an understanding of the functioning of such compounds within biological systems it is unfortunate that so many ambiguities exist. The problem is exacerbated when the dioxygen adducts of these systems are considered &#8211; there are now additional ambiguities in the electronic state of the dioxygen (singlet neutral dioxygen ligand, triplet neutral dioxygen ligand, superoxide or peroxide).</p>

<p class="indent">The problem is easily understood. Conventional wisdom says that to stabilize low oxidation state transition metal complexes, <i>&#960;</i>-acceptor ligands with low-lying <i>&#960;</i>*-orbitals should be used. Overlapping of metal orbitals with the ligand <i>&#960;</i>*-orbitals allows the back-donation of electron density to the ligand, thus stabilizing a low oxidation state metal centre. However, if the ligand is a very good <i>&#960;</i>-acceptor, then it is possible that the <i>&#960;</i>*-levels will lie below the metal <i>d</i> orbitals. If this is the case, then reduction will involve the addition of electrons to the ligand <i>&#960;</i>* orbitals rather than the metal <i>d</i>orbitals.</p>
<p class="indent">In many cases, the design of macrocyclic ligands has optimized the stabilization of low oxidation states to such an extent that an ambiguity exists. Studies of the metal complexes of planar pentadentate macrocyclic ligands such as <a href="#ch6mol2.7"><b>2.7</b></a> or <a href="#mol6.20"><b>6.20</b></a> reveal that the effects are very subtle. In some cases the nickel(II) complexes are reduced to [Ni<sup>I</sup>(L)] species, in other cases to nickel(II) [Ni<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>&#8211;</sup>)] complexes. The localization of the electron may be altered by using electron-releasing or electron-accepting axial ligands in addition to making changes in the structure of the macrocyclic ligand itself.</p>
<p class="indent">In a final twist to this story, let us return to redox inactive metal ions. With saturated ligands, we saw that the most likely site for redox reaction was at a metal ion. We also saw that with metal ions such as zinc(II) which only have one common oxidation state (other than zero), ligand-centred processes were possible with ligands such as porphyrins. What happens with saturated ligands and redox inactive metal centres? Actually, we have already seen one of the consequences of this combination in the formation of sodide<a id="page_80" class="page">80,, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> or electride complexes from the reaction of Group 1 metals with crown ethers or cryptands. In a final example, we consider ligand <a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a> which is an analogue of a cryptand which contains six nitrogen donors and which is a good <i>&#960;</i>-acceptor ligand as it contains three 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine units. This ligand forms a normal complex cation [Na(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a>)]<sup>+</sup> with sodium bromide in which the sodium cation is within the cryptand. Electrochemical reduction leads to the sequential formation of [Na(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a>)], [Na(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a>)]<sup>&#8211;</sup> and [Na(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a>)]<sup>2&#8211;</sup>. The cavity in the ligand is not large enough to contain a neutral sodium atom or a sodide anion and the crystal structural analysis indicates that the compounds should not be formulated as electrides. In these compounds, the electrons are localized on the 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine ligands and a more appropriate formulation of [Na(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a>)]<sup>2&#8211;</sup> would be [Na<sup>+</sup>(<a href="#mol6.21"><b>6.21</b></a><sup>3&#8211;</sup>)].</p>

<p class="indent">The discussion above should indicate that it many cases it is not really meaningful to describe an oxidation or reduction process as being metal- or ligand-centred. However, in the next section we will encounter redox reactions which are unambiguously ligand-centred in that they involve a change in the structure of the ligand as opposed to the placing of electrons in ligand <i>&#960;</i>*-orbitals or the removal of electrons from <i>&#960;</i>-orbitals.</p>

<p class="noindent">To date we have considered redox reactions in terms of the addition or loss of electrons &#8211; it is also convenient to think in terms of the addition or loss of hydrogen or oxygen atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous examples are known in which macrocyclic ligands undergo this type of redox process. Direct hydrogenation reactions of both free ligands and metal complexes are possible, although reactions of the free ligands are perhaps more common. The Me<sub>6</sub>cyclam ligand <a href="#mol6.22"><b>2.42</b></a> is obtained by the catalytic hydrogenation of the Curtis macrocycle <a href="#mol6.22"><b>4.7</b></a>, whilst hydrogenation of dibenzo-18-crown-6 gives dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 <a href="#mol6.22"><b>6.22</b></a>. It is, however, possible to reduce [Ni(<a href="#mol6.22"><b>4.7</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> directly to [Ni(<a href="#mol6.22"><b>2.42</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> using dihydrogen and a platinum catalyst. The reduction of the double bonds introduces new stereocentres and in many cases mixtures of the possible diastereomers are obtained.</p>

<p class="indent">Many macrocyclic ligands have been designed for the preparation of iron, cobalt and nickel complexes which might bind dioxygen. We have already mentioned that one of the problems with such model complexes is the formation of dinuclear <i>&#181;</i>-oxo compounds. Another reaction pathway which can cause difficulties is oxygen atom transfer to the coordinated ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">The cobalt(III) complex of <a href="#mol6.23"><b>6.23</b></a> provides a good example of this as it is not likely that dioxygen can enter the cage to interact with the metal ion directly. Oxidation of [Co(<a href="#mol6.23"><b>6.23</b></a>)]<sup>3+</sup> with dioxygen in the presence of activated charcoal as a catalyst results in reactions of the encapsulating ligand. The first step is a dehydrogenation to form an imine <a href="#fig6.7"><b>6.24</b></a> and subsequent reaction involves oxygen atom incorporation to form a bis(amide) complex <a href="#fig6.7"><b>6.25</b></a> (<a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The formation of imines is a common consequence of reaction with oxygen and numerous dehydrogenation products of macrocyclic complexes have been prepared deliberately or through serendipity. The macrocyclic complex <a href="#mol6.26"><b>6.26</b></a> is obtained from the template condensation of the bis(hydrazone) of diacetyl, MeC(=NNH<sub>2</sub>)C(Me)=NNH<sub>2</sub>, with formaldehyde. Reaction of <a href="#mol6.26"><b>6.26</b></a> with air leads to the fully conjugated complex <a href="#mol6.26"><b>6.27</b></a> containing a new dianionic ligand. The driving force for the reaction would seem to be the formation of the aromatic 18-membered ring. A consequence is a &#8216;rotation&#8217; of the ligand such that different nitrogen donor atoms are used in <a href="#mol6.26"><b>6.27</b></a> to the starting material <a href="#mol6.26"><b>6.26</b></a>.</p>

<p class="indent">A range of other oxidizing agents may be used and when the scope of these reactions is considered it is seen that the rationalization in terms of conjugation above was perhaps naive. For example, the iron(II) complex [Fe(<a href="#mol6.22"><b>4.7</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> is oxidized to [Fe(<a href="#mol6.28"><b>6.28</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> upon aerial oxidation. In this case, there has been no rotation of the ligand, but the two original imine double bonds have migrated. In contrast, the oxidation of [Ni(<a href="#mol6.22"><b>4.7</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> by nitric acid leads sequentially to the non-conjugated compounds [Ni(<a href="#mol6.28"><b>6.29</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup> and [Ni(<a href="#mol6.28"><b>6.30</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent">A final possible outcome of an oxidation reaction is the dimerization of two macrocycles to give a new dinucleating system and an example of this is given in <a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>. The starting cobalt(III) complex reacts with dioxygen in alkaline conditions to form a new dicobalt(III) complex. The first step of the reaction is undoubtedly deprotonation of the active methylene group with a<a id="page_83" class="page">83, Reactivity of macrocyclic complexes</a> subsequent dimerization to a dihydro compound which is dehydrogenated to give the observed product. Remarkably, the axial ligands are retained in this reaction.</p>
