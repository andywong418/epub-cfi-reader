<p class="fmnoindent">Macrocycle chemistry is perhaps the most substantial innovation within coordination chemistry in recent years. From these ligands, metal-organic compounds have attained an art-form, with the trefoil knot perhaps the most elegant of these shapes. The new slant on coordination chemistry that these ligands have provided have allowed us to examine the basis of metal-ligand complexes in a new light.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of current understanding of inorganic chemistry. Ed Constable here provides an authorative description of the basis of macrocycle coordination chemistry, ranging from ligand synthesis, metal selectivity, coordination geometries to reactivity. This book is a mine of detailed information that should be invaluable to third- or fourth-year undergraduate or for postgraduate courses in modern coordination chemistry.</p>
