<p class="noindent">The simplest method of preparing a metal complex is to treat the ligand of choice with a derivative of the metal of choice in an appropriate solvent. This is the traditional method of coordination chemistry and is highly effective when the rate of complexation of the ligand is reasonably fast and when the ligand itself is stable under the reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, this approach is used for the synthesis of the majority of complexes of crown ethers, aza and thia macrocycles, many mixed donor ligands and ligands such as porphyrin and phthalocyanine.</p>
<p class="indent">One point of some importance is the rate of coordination of the ligand to the metal, which may be quite slow, and long reaction times are necessary before equilibrium is reached.</p>
<p class="indent">The nature of any anions which are present is also of some importance and we saw in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> that crown ether complexes with alkali metal ions exhibited structures which varied if anions were coordinated to the metal centres. Similarly, the reaction of nickel(II) chloride with cyclam in aqueous solution gives an equilibrium mixture containing yellow square-planar [Ni(cyclam)]<sup>2+</sup> and blue [Ni(cyclam)Cl<sub>2</sub>] species. The ratio of the square-planar to octahedral complexes depends upon the anion and also upon the temperature and solvent. Recrystallization of the reaction mixture may selectively enrich one of the compounds in the solid state.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the direct combination method allows the preparation of some unique and interesting compounds. The crown ethers possess hard oxygen donors, and although we normally think of their coordination chemistry in terms of Groups 1 and 2, they also form complexes with lanthanoids and (less commonly) with <i>d</i>-block metal ions. A typical example will illustrate some of the features of direct combination reactions. Europium(III) compounds are of interest as they are luminescent and many applications are being investigated in which europium complexes are components of photoresponsive molecular machines. The hydrogenation of dibenzo-18-crown-6 gives the saturated dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 ligand <a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a>. The reaction of <a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a> with Eu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> gives a luminescent compound containing the [Eu(<a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a>)(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cation (<a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>). However, the counter-ion is not the nitrate that might be expected but the [Eu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2&#8722;</sup> anion and the complex has the overall stoichiometry ([Eu(<a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a>)(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>])<sub>2</sub>[Eu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]. Numerous other crown ether complexes with lanthanoids are known and are invariably prepared by direct reaction of the metal salt with the desired ligand.</p>

<p class="indent">This latter compound raises a general point regarding the relationship between stoichiometry and structure. The fact that a compound contains a metal centre and a macrocyclic ligand does not necessarily mean that the metal is to be found within the macrocyclic cavity. A good example is found in the compound (<a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(O)<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> obtained from <a href="#mol4.1"><b>4.1</b></a> and uranyl salts.

<p class="indent">Even if the metal is coordinated to the macrocycle, it is not necessarily within the cavity. We have seen some examples in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> where a metal ion lies above the macrocyclic cavity, but sometimes more extreme cases are found. It is constructive to consider the behaviour of [14]aneS<sub>2</sub> with mercury(II) compounds. The 1:1 adduct with mercury(II) Perchlorate contains the cation [Hg([14]aneS<sub>4</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2+</sup> in which the metal ion is more or less within the macrocyclic cavity. A 1:1 adduct is also formed with mercury(II) iodide, but in this case a polymer is formed in which HgI<sub>2</sub> units are bonded to one sulfur donor of each of two macrocyclic ligands. Each [14]aneS<sub>4</sub> ligand has two exocyclic bonds to mercury (<a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> a). It is also possible to isolate 2:1 adducts such as [Hg<sub>2</sub>([14]aneS<sub>4</sub>)Cl<sub>4</sub>] in which each mercury centre is four coordinate and bonded in an exocyclic manner to two sulfur atoms from the macrocycle (<a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> b).</p>

<p class="noindent2">Na<sup>&#8722;</sup> is the sodide ion.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">There are a number of rather unusual applications of direct coordination reactions of crown ethers and cryptands. Although it is usual to think of alkali metals having a cationic chemistry because of the low first ionization energy (492 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for sodium), these elements also have favourable electron attachment energies (&#8722;53 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for sodium). This value of &#8722;53 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> might seem to be rather modest, but should be compared with a value of &#8722;73 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for the formation of the hydride ion. This suggests that salts containing anions such as Na<sup>&#8722;</sup> might be isolable if suitable counterions are available. This is indeed the case, as illustrated in <a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. The treatment of solutions of Group 1 metals in ammonia or other inert solvents with crown ethers or cryptands results, in suitable cases, in the formation of alkalide salts. The alkalide salts are very air- and water- sensitive but are otherwise relatively stable. The compounds themselves have beautiful metallic appearances.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The constitution of solutions of Group 1 metals in ammonia and related solvents is very concentration dependent, but under some conditions they are best regarded as containing solvated M<sup>+</sup> cations and solvated electrons. Is it possible to isolate compounds in which the anion is simply an electron? Once again the answer is yes, and the reaction of caesium with 18-crown-6 gives a compound of stoichiometry {Cs(18-crown-6)<sub>2</sub>}. The X-ray structure reveals a sandwich [Cs(18-crown-6)<sub>2</sub>] unit with normal Cs-0 distances for a Cs<sup>+</sup> cation. The compound is an <i>electride</i> in which the counter ion is an electron and correct formulation is [Cs(18-crown-6)<sub>2</sub>] <sup>+</sup>e<sup>&#8722;</sup>.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A related use of cryptands is in the formation of discrete salts containing Zintl ions. Zintl phases are typically formed from the reaction of Group 1 elements with Group 14 or 15 elements and contain main group cluster anions. A typical example is the compound Na<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>11</sub> which is a metallic looking solid. Treatment with the cryptand [2.2.2] allows the isolation of the discrete salt [Na([2.2.2])]<sub>3</sub>[Sbn] (<a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the applications of macrocyclic ligands are based upon direct coordination interactions. Examples include the design of ligands for the selective extraction of removal of specific metal ions and the development of sensors for specific metal ions. In the case of extraction, the usual approach is to treat an aqueous solution containing the metal ion of interest mixed with other metal ions with a solution of the ligand in a non-aqueous phase. Hopefully, selective binding of the metal ion to the ligand will occur and the metal of interest will be selectively extracted into the non-aqueous phase.<a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> Subsequent back-extraction into the aqueous phase, usually by a change in the pH or halide ion concentration of the aqueous phase, allows the metal to be isolated. The detection of Group 1 ions can be achieved if a crown ether bears some other functional group which registers the change on passing from the free ligand to the complex. A typical example of a ligand designed as such a sensor is seen in <a href="#mol4.2"><b>4.2</b></a>; in this ligand the ferrocene shows a well-resolved and reversible Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox process. This redox process is expected to change upon the binding of a cation to the crown ether.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The template effect was discovered in the 1960&#39;s and has been widely used for the synthesis of macrocyclic complexes ever since.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">We saw in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3.1">Section 3.1</a> that one of the problems with the synthesis of macrocycles was the conformation control in bringing the two ends of a chain together in the final cyclization step. The <i>template effect</i> is a widely used strategy which circumvents these problems. In essence, the method involves the incorporation of additional donor atoms into the chain and performing the cyclization reaction in the presence of a metal ion which can coordinate to these. The idea is that the metal ion will coordinate to the donor atoms and pre-organize the various intermediates in the conformation required to give the desired cyclic products. This is shown schematically in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> and a specific example was introduced in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig4.5" style="width:70%;">

<figcaption style="width:100%;"><b>Fig. 4.5.</b> A schematic view of the cyclization step involved in a templated macrocycle synthesis. The filled and open circles represent mutually reactive functional groups and the squares are additional donor atoms. The binding of the metal to the donor atoms pre-organizes the ligand into the conformation required for cyclization.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Template reactions may involve any number of reactants, although [1+1] or [2+2] cyclization reactions are probably the most common. It is very often found that the metal ion remains coordinated to the macrocycle and that a metal complex is obtained directly (although this was not the case in the reaction presented in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>).</p>
<a id="page_43" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 43, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">One of the first deliberate template reactions is presented in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>, and this serves to illustrate a number of the important features. Firstly, the metal ion remains coordinated and a nickel(II) complex of the <i>N</i><sub>2</sub><i>S</i><sub>2</sub> macrocycle is obtained. Secondly, the ring forming reactions are usually similar to those used in metal free syntheses &#8211; in this case the electrophile-nucleophile strategy is adopted. Thirdly, and in this case most importantly, it is not possible to perform this reaction in the absence of a metal ion as the required reactant <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> cannot be isolated. Attempts to obtain <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> from the reaction of biacetyl (MeCOCOMe) with H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SH result in the formation of polymers and the cyclic species <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.4</b></a>. However, if the biacetyl is reacted with the nickel(II) complex of H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SH, or nickel(II) salts are reacted with the cyclization product <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.4</b></a>, the nickel(II) complex of <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> is obtained directly. This emphasizes a very important point &#8211; it is possible to use template reactions when the organic precursors themselves are not stable or when the metal-free macrocyclic ligand cannot be prepared.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Imines are electrophilic. The empty <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals have a greater coefficient at carbon and this is the favoured site of attack. Upon coordination to an electron-rich transition metal ion, back-donation of electrons results in an increasing electron density within these orbitals and nucleophilic attack is disfavoured. The result is that imines are very often stabilized upon coordination to a metal ion.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The metal ion plays a number of roles in the above reaction. The stabilization of the acyclic intermediate <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> is achieved in a number of ways. As a free ligand, <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> possesses nucleophilic thiol and electrophilic imine groups and cyclization arises by attack of the thiol upon the carbon of the imine to give <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.4</b></a>. When <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> is coordinated to the nickel(II), the nucleophilicity of the thiolate is reduced because it is bonded to an electropositive centre, the thiolate is constrained so that it cannot approach the imine, and the imine is made less electrophilic by the back-donation of <i>d-</i>electron density into the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals. The metal also pre-organizes the two thiolate groups so that they are correctly oriented for reaction with the electrophilic 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene to give the macrocyclic ligand. One of the more subtle effects of the metal ion is to reduce the <i>reactivity,</i> and hence increase the <i>selectivity,</i> of the thiolate groups. Thus, although the cyclization reaction is substantially slower than the reactions leading to <a href="#mol4.3"><b>4.4</b></a>, the selectivity for the macrocyclic product is very high.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of template reactions are obvious (good yields, obtaining metal complexes directly, mild reaction conditions), but it must be stressed<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> that there are also disadvantages. The major disadvantage is that not all metal ions will act as a template for a desired reaction and it is often a rather imprecise art in finding the correct metal ion. This creates rather obvious problems if you are interested in the iron complexes of a macrocyclic ligand but only nickel functions as a template. Although metal exchange reactions are sometimes possible, these are usually controlled by the Irving-Williams order of stability in which nickel(II) complexes are close to the maximum stablization. The conditions required to remove metal ions from macrocyclic complexes can often lead to fragmentation of fragile ligand systems and it is not always possible to convert templated products to the free ligands.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure>
<img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0117.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another disadvantage is that it is not always possible to predict exactly what the product might be. In the reaction in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>, only the [1+1] macrocyclic product is likely on steric grounds, but we saw in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3.4">Section 3.4</a> that the reaction of Cl(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl with HO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH gave varying amounts of 12-crown-4 and 24-crown-8 depending upon the base used. Although we can now recognize this as a template reaction, it seems that the coding inherent in the matching of the metal ion size to the macrocyclic cavity is relatively weak. A particularly impressive example of template effects in the synthesis of crown ethers is seen in the oligomerization of oxirane (ethylene oxide) by BF<sub>3</sub> in the presence of various Lewis acidic metal salts. In the absence of the metal salts, the yields of cyclic oligomers are low, with 1,4-dioxan dominating the products. However, when the metal salts are present, good yields of crown ethers are obtained and there is a good relationship between the hole-size and the metal ionic radius (<a href="#fig4.7">Fig 4.7</a>).</p>

Pyridine aldehydes and ketones are widely-used carbonyl compounds in such reactions as they incorporate additional donor capacity within the macrocyclic ring and a typical example of a template reaction of this type is presented in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>.

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Types of template effect</h2>
<p class="noindent">Two different types of template effect have been described. The first is the <i>kinetic template effect.</i> In this, the metal plays essentially the role which we have assigned it above. The function of the metal is to control the stereochemistry in the intermediates such that cyclization is the favoured pathway. Implicit in the kinetic template effect is the concept that the macrocycle of interest is not formed from the same reactants in the absence of <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> a template. The reaction presented in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a> is an example of the kinetic template effect.</p>
<p class="indent">The second type of template effect which has been described is known as the <i>thermodynamic template effect.</i> In a reaction of this type, the macrocyclic product is formed, along with other species, in the absence of the templating metal ion. The function of the metal ion is to coordinate to the macrocycle and to remove it from the equilibrium mixture. The formation of the nickel(II) complex of the Curtis macrocycle is an example of the thermodynamic template effect, as we saw in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a> that the free macrocycle could be obtained in a metal-free reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Two types of template effect may be described. However, in many cases the mechanistic details of the reactions are not known in detail.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Whilst these two types of template effect appear very clear in principle, the majority of template reactions have not been investigated in sufficient detail to allow a precise classification. The interest in template reactions is more often preparative rather than mechanistic and detailed studies of the mechanism of such reactions are few and far between.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have already seen the influence of the metal ion over the product distribution in the formation of crown ethers from oxirane. In this section we look at hole-size effects involving transition metal ions.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the best examples arise from the choice of [1+1], [2+2] or [n+n] products in reactions of the type presented in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>. The condensation of 2,6-diacetylpyridine with H<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> in the presence of nickel(II) salts yields [Ni(<a href="#mol4.11"><b>4.11</b></a>)]<sup>2+</sup>, a complex of the [1+1] macrocycle which is approximately the correct size for the nickel(II) ion. When the same reactants are condensed in the presence of silver(I) salts, a different reaction occurs. The silver(I) ion is too large for the cavity in the [1+1] macrocycle, and the product of the reaction is a disilver complex of the [2+2] macrocycle <a href="#mol4.11"><b>4.12</b></a> Although the above rationalization appears satisfactory, it is not really clear why the [2+2] macrocycle is formed, as the silver ion is actually too small for the cavity of <a href="#mol4.11"><b>4.12</b></a>, and this results in the formation of a <i>dinuclear</i> complex.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The more these systems are studied, the less predictable they become. For example, the condensation of 2,6-diacetylpyridine with H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CHOHCH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> in the presence of manganese(II) might be expected to yield a [2+2] macrocyclic system; however, the product of the reaction is the tetramanganese complex of the [4+4] macrocyclic ligand <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#mol2.39"><b>2.40</b></a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> we noted that it was not possible to define an unambiguous hole-size for a macrocyclic ligand. It is worth emphasizing this point again. In choosing a template ion for a desired reaction, it seems logical to select a metal ion which is the correct size for the cavity of the new macrocycle. For example, the 12-membered macrocyclic ligand <a href="#mol4.13"><b>4.13</b></a> is expected to be too small for nickel(II) on the basis of the hole-size and a different metal ion would be expected to act as a template. However, the template condensation of <a href="#mol4.13"><b>4.14</b></a> and <a href="#mol4.13"><b>4.15</b></a> proceeds smoothly in the presence of nickel(II) salts. The explanation lies in the ability of the flexible macrocycle to adopt a folded conformation in the complex [Ni(<a href="#mol4.13"><b>4.13</b></a>)Br<sub>2</sub>], in which the two bromide ligands occupy <i>cis</i> positions.</p>

<figcaption style="width:100%;"><b>Fig. 4.11.</b> A dramatic rearrangement that occurs when <a href="#fig4.11"><b>4.16</b></a> is treated with cobalt(II) salts. The driving force is the formation of a macrocyclic cavity which can accommodate cobalt(II).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">One of the more intriguing aspects of macrocyclic chemistry is the ability of the ligands to undergo substantial rearrangement to give optimal metal-binding cavities. Many examples of such rearrangements are known, but those involving the condensation of &#x03B1;,&#x03C9;-diamines with dicarbonyl compounds are particularly well-studied. The 18-membered [2+2] macrocyclic<a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> ligand <a href="#fig4.11"><b>4.16</b></a> is prepared in a metal-free condensation of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxaldehyde with 1,2-diaminobenzene. The cavity is too large for a first-row transition metal ion and reaction with cobalt(II) salts in methanol results in a ring-contraction to give <a href="#fig4.11"><b>4.17</b></a>. The addition of the methanol results in a distortion of the ligand from planarity, but this is not enough to optimize the cavity for the cobalt(II) ion and a second step involving an intramolecular attack of the amine on the imine occurs to generate the smaller 15-membered ring macrocycle (<a href="#fig4.11">Fig. 4.11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the rearrangements are so drastic that it is hard to recognize the original structural components in the product! For example, when 2,6-diacetylpyridine (instead of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxaldehyde) is reacted with 1,2-diaminobenzene, the product is <a href="#mol4.18"><b>4.18</b></a> rather than the analogue of <a href="#fig4.11"><b>4.16</b></a> with methyl groups. This is believed to be a result of steric interactions between the methyl groups and the phenyl <i>ortho-protons.</i> Treatment of <a href="#mol4.18"><b>4.18</b></a> with copper(II) salts leads to <a href="#mol4.18"><b>4.19</b></a> which contains a 15-membered macrocyclic ring.</p>
<figure id="mol4.18" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556923_0136.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">It should be apparent from this discussion that many of the reactions of imine macrocycles are, to some extent, reversible. This suggests that it should also be possible to interconvert [1+1] and [2+2] macrocycles by treatment with an appropriate metal ion. Once again, a considerable degree of subtlety is exhibited in these reactions. Compound <a href="#fig4.12"><b>4.20</b></a> is a cyclic trimer of 2-aminobenzaldehyde and upon reaction with nickel(II) salts it rearranges to give nickel(II) complexes of the cyclic trimer <a href="#fig4.12"><b>4.21</b></a> and the tetramer <a href="#fig4.12"><b>4.22</b></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The trimer <a href="#fig4.12"><b>4.21</b></a> behaves like a rigid analogue of triazacyclonane and forms complexes in which it occupies the <i>facial</i> positions in an octahedron. The complex [Ni(<a href="#fig4.12"><b>4.21</b></a>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> is of some interest as it is chiral (<a href="#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>). Although the water ligands exchange with bulk water extremely rapidly, the rate of racemization is extremely slow and the resolved complex may be kept in solution for several months with negligible loss of optical activity. The tetramer behaves as a planar tetradentate ligand resembling a porphyrin or a phthalocyanine and forms square-planar or octahedral complexes in which it occupies the equatorial sites.</p>

<p class="noindent">The template reactions that we have considered so far are simple in that it is possible to make a reasonable guess what the product will be, although as we have seen above, hole-size mis-matches may lead to rearrangements. In this section we will consider some less intuitive template reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">The prototype reaction involves the copper(II) complex <a href="#fig4.13"><b>4.23</b></a> with formaldehyde and nitroethane, which yields <a href="#fig4.13"><b>4.24</b></a> (<a href="#fig4.13">Fig. 4.13</a>).

<p class="indent">The primary use of such reactions is the preparation of transition metal complexes of encapsulating ligands.

If the same reaction is performed with [Co(Hdmg)<sub>3</sub>] (H<sub>2</sub>dmg = HON=C(Me)C(Me)=N(OH)), the product is the cobalt(III) complex <a href="#mol4.29"><b>4.29</b></a> in which the metal ion is trapped within a new encapsulating ligand.

The reaction proceeds by the formation of an imine followed by nucleophilic attack by the adjacent amino group. The metal ions preorganize the ligands so that the three-dimensional encapsulating ligand is formed in good yield. A natural consequence is that the metal ion is trapped within the ligand.</p>

<p class="indent">Numerous examples of such condensations are known, but perhaps the most spectacular are those described by Sargeson and his co-workers.

The<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> encapsulating ligand that is formed is known as a <i>sepulchrate,</i> and the yields are remarkably good.

If enantiomerically pure <i>&#x0394;</i>-or <i>&#x039B;</i>- [Co(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> is used in these reactions, a single diastereomer of <a href="#fig4.14"><b>4.31</b></a> is obtained.

<p class="noindent">A final example of a template effect illustrates the elegance of the method and the high degree of control which may be exerted. A <i>catenane</i> is a molecule in which two or more rings are inter-linked, in a manner resembling a daisy chain. The problem in the synthesis of such molecules by conventional methods comes back to the conformational control that we discussed in the previous chapter. In order to form a catenane rather than two separate, non-linked, rings it will be necessary to have an intermediate state in which one of the rings has formed and the second open-chain precursor is threaded through this ring. This arrangement is called a <i>rotaxane.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Extremely elegant approaches have been developed for the synthesis of catenanes, but the most successful involve the use of copper(I) templates. A tetrahedral metal complex containing two didentate ligands is the key to the synthesis. If the two didentate ligands have reactive functionality which can<a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Synthetic aspects 2. The complexes</a> react with another reagent to give a macrocycle it should be possible to chose the correct didentate ligand and the correct reagent such that two ends of the same ligand are linked together. This leads to the metal-coordinated catenane, called a <i>catenate.</i> This is the approach which has been developed by Sauvage and co-workers and is illustrated in <a href="#fig4.15">Fig. 4.15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">When the correct combination of reagents is taken, the yields of the catenane can be very high. It is even possible to remove the metal ion from the catenate by reaction with cyanide to leave the inter-linked metal-free catenane (or <i>catenand</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">The product in <a href="#fig4.15">Fig. 4.15</a> is called a <i>2-catenane</i> because it contains two inter-linked rings. Developments of this strategy have allowed the synthesis of 3-catenanes and higher analogues. Perhaps the most elegant extension of this synthetic method is seen in the synthesis of a molecular knot about transition metal templates. The product <a href="#fig4.16"><b>4.35</b></a> in <a href="#fig4.16">Fig 4.16</a> is a <i>trefoil knot</i> and the synthesis follows from the correct orientation of the ligand about two copper centres so that reaction with the bis(electrophile) leads to the knotted rather than any of the possible catenanted or macrocyclic products.
