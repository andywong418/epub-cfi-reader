<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> we considered oxidation of the heteroatoms N, P, S and Se and saw that these nucleophilic elements were easily oxidised by electrophilic oxidising agents. For completeness, we will now consider the reverse reaction, i.e. reduction of heteroatom-based functional groups. In nearly all such cases the reduction reaction manifests itself as a reduction in the number of oxygen atoms attached to a particular heteroatom. You will meet all manner of different reducing agents in the following chapters and I have attempted to include one of each of the most important classes in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. For example, you will come across reducing agents that deliver H<sub>2</sub> (either directly or stepwise as H<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) to a compound. Other reducing agents will add electrons to a substrate and there are yet more subtle reducing agents, with an affinity for oxygen, which will deoxygenate certain compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of nitro groups to amines</h3>
<p class="noindent">Aromatic nitro compounds (such as nitrobenzene) play a pivotal role in the synthesis of substituted arenes partly because they direct electrophilic aromatic substitution so powerfully. Also remember that one can substitute a nitro group <i>via</i> reduction to an amine and formation of a diazonium salt with HNO<sub>2</sub>. It is useful, therefore, to be able to reduce a nitro group to an amine and heterogeneous hydrogenation with a transition metal catalyst (usually platinum or palladium) is best in this regard, <a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>. </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">In general terms, both aromatic and aliphatic nitro groups are easy to reduce, often without affecting other functionality.</p>
<p class="indent">We will discuss catalytic hydrogenation later on (Chapter 7) but at this point it is sufficient to note that hydrogen gas is dissociatively adsorbed onto the surface of the metal. Subsequent adsorption of the nitro compound onto the metal is followed by addition of two hydrogen atoms to the nitro group: this process is repeated until the fully reduced amine is formed, <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of amine-<i>N</i>-oxides to amines</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is possible to use catalytic hydrogenation (or reactive metals in acid) to deoxygenate amine-<i>N</i>-oxides to the corresponding amines. The <i>N</i><i></i>-oxide of pyridine is important in synthesis because it activates the pyridine ring to electrophilic aromatic substitution at the C-4 position; it is important, therefore, that the <i>N</i>-oxide can be reduced at the end of a synthetic sequence. The example shown in <a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a> involves the reduction of both an amine-<i>N</i>-oxide and a nitro group at the same time. </p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of azides (RN<sub>3</sub>) to amines (RNH<sub>3</sub>)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The azide ion (N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is an incredibly good nucleophile and this may be attributed to its small size, negative charge, and, being a stabilised anion, lack of basicity. If one wishes to introduce nitrogen into an organic compound <i>via</i> a displacement reaction then the use of N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is very effective. Quite often it is useful to be able to reduce the azide so formed to an amine and several methods have been developed, <a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>. Perhaps the most useful is reduction with hydrogen using a palladium or platinum catalyst, which gives very high yields of amine. As you will see later, such hydrogenation conditions will also reduce alkenes to alkanes very well indeed. A nice solution to the problem of reducing azides to primary amines in the presence of an alkene has been found which involves a modified catalyst that does not reduce alkenes at all (we shall cover this catalyst, known as Lindlar&#x2019;s catalyst, later on). </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Lindlafs catalyst consists of palladium on a calcium carbonate support. Lead is added to deactivate (poison) the catalyst and make it ineffective at reducing alkenes. Amine additives such as quinoline also aid in poisoning the catalyst.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig6.5">
<img src="../images/fig6.5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.5</p>
<p class="indent">Another method of reducing azides that is particularly useful involves reaction with triphenylphosphine and water, <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>. Initial attack of the phosphine onto the azide yields a phosphazide <b>1</b> which then decomposes <i>(via</i> loss of nitrogen) to a phosphine imide. Subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphine imide gives an amine and triphenylphosphine oxide (so, in this sequence the azide has been reduced and the triphenylphosphine oxidised).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">As you might expect, this reducing method does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of N-O bonds in oximes and hydroxylamines</h3>
<p class="noindent">The N-O single bond in both oximes and hydroxylamines can be cleaved reductively with hydrogen and a metal catalyst (platinum is best). These are useful reactions because the starting materials can be made <i>via</i> 
the cycloaddtion of nitrile-<i>N</i>-oxides or nitrones to alkenes. </p>
<a id="page_48" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 48, Reduction of heteroatoms attached to carbon</a>
<p class="indent">For example, reaction of nitrile-<i>N</i>-oxide <b>2</b> gave heterocycle <b>3</b> which was then reduced, <a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>. Presumably, addition of hydrogen across the N&#x2013;O bond gave a hydroxy imine <b>4</b> which was hydrolysed to the ketone <i>in situ.</i> This chemistry was developed as a potential route to the natural product gephyrotoxin.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Nitrile-<i>N</i>-oxides are normally formed <i>in situ</i> by dehydration of a nitro compound or elimination from an &#x03B1;-halo oxime.</p>

After reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride, the N&#x2013;O bond in <b>6</b> was cleaved under standard conditions. The hydroxy-amine product from reduction then cyclised (<i>via</i> intramolecular displacement of the OSO<sub>2</sub>Me group) to a bicyclo compound that was eventually converted into the alkaloid supinidine.</p>

<p class="noindent">Compound <b>7</b>, known as FR66979, is a potent antitumour antibiotic which is capable of crosslinking strands of DNA, <a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>. Studies on the mechanism of action of this compound have revealed that it requires reduction of the N&#x2013;O bond <i>in vivo</i> in order to display its biological activity. So, reductive cleavage of the N&#x2013;O bond of FR66979 leads to a rearrangement process that eventually produces compound <b>8</b>, which is a potent electrophile capable of reacting with the bases of DNA. Although the mechanism of bioreduction is not known it could involve a metal-ion-containing enzyme.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Cleavage of N&#x2013;S bonds: reduction of sulfonamides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The N&#x2013;S bond of a sulfonamide may be reductively cleaved with reactive metals in the presence of a proton source, <a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>. Typical conditions are sodium in liquid ammonia or sodium amalgam in buffered methanol. As this process liberates the parent amine, sulfonamides are often used as protecting groups for secondary amines.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig6.10">
<img src="../images/fig6.10.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.10</p>
<p class="indent">A plausible mechanism which explains the reduction involves addition of an electron to the sulfonamide to form a radical anion which may cleave to yield a nitrogen-based anion and a sulfur-based radical (this will then be reduced again), <a href="#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>. Subsequent protonation of the nitrogen anion <i>in situ</i> forms the corresponding amine.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The suitability of sulfonamides as protecting groups is enhanced by the observations that they are normally stable to basic hydrolysis and relatively inert to hydrogenation. So, selective deprotection of other functional groups can be achieved in the presence of these derivatives.</p>

<p class="noindent">Reduction of a phosphorus&#x2013;oxygen double bond (for example, reducing a phosphine oxide to a phosphine) is not a particularly common reaction, and there is not a great deal of work in this area. Remember that the P&#x003D;O bond is very strong, which does not help matters. However, reducing agents such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> and, in particular, alane (AlH<sub>3</sub>) have recently been shown to be effective for this transformation, <a href="#fig6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>.</p>
