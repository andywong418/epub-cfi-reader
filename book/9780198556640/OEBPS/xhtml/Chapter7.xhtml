<h3 class="h3"><b>Heterogeneous hydrogenation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of a transition metal catalyst to promote addition of hydrogen to an organic compound can be traced back to experiments performed by Sabatier in 1897. Modem procedures involve a transition metal catalyst (Rh, Pt, Pd are the most common) adsorbed onto a solid support (such as carbon or alumina). Although elevated pressures and temperatures invariably increase the rate of such hydrogenations, the reactions usually proceed in a satisfactory manner at room temperature under one atmosphere of H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">So, reaction of an alkene with hydrogen gas and one of the above catalysts results in reduction of the &#x03C0;-bond and formation of an alkene, <a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>. The stereospecific reduction of <i>E</i>- and <i>Z</i>-<b>1</b> shows that the addition of hydrogen occurs in a <i>syn</i> fashion.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Remember that hetereogeneous catalysts are insoluble in the reaction medium.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig7.1">

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.1</p>
<p class="indent">However, the amount of <i>syn</i>-addition that is observed is usually somewhat less than complete, as witnessed by low selectivity during the reduction of 2, <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is interesting to note that the selectivity for <i>cis-</i><b>3</b> was improved to 96:4 using Pt catalysis and 300 atmospheres of hydrogen gas. Levels as high as 98:2 were obtained with osmium or iridium catalysts.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_53" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 53, Reduction of carbon&#x2013;carbon double and triple bonds</a>
<p class="indent">The mechanism by which hetereogeneous hydrogenation proceeds is complex and difficult to study as the reaction takes place on the surface of the metal (and the nature of this surface varies with the different catalysts used). A working model for the hydrogenation process assumes that first H<sub>2</sub> is dissociatively adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, <a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>. Alkene &#x03C0;-bonds may also be adsorbed onto the metal, forming complexes which are anchored at two points. Subsequent addition of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed species leaves an intermediate which is referred to as a half-hydrogenated state <b>4</b>. All that remains is addition of a second atom of hydrogen onto the other carbon atom and the reduced product then can dissociate from the catalyst. As one face of the alkene is adsorbed onto the metal and both hydrogen atoms then transfer from the metal to the &#x03C0;-system, this model explains why the addition of H<sub>2</sub> is <i>syn.</i></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Extensive studies of the rates of hydrogenation of alkenes reveal that highly substituted alkenes are reduced more slowly than less substituted alkenes (R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub> &#x003C; RCH&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub> &#x003C; RCH&#x003D;CHR &#x003C; RCH&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub>). This ordering may be related to the observation that steric hinderance around the &#x03C0;-bond hinders adsorption onto the metal surface.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig7.3">
<img src="../images/fig7.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.3</p>
<p class="indent">Now, the unexpected phenomenon regarding <i>apparent</i> lack of complete <i>syn</i>-addition of hydrogen (see <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>) may be explained if we suppose that all steps except for the last of this sequence are reversible. So, the half-hydrogenated state may revert back to the fully adsorbed state as well as adding another atom of hydrogen to become product. However, if one of the R groups has a suitably positioned hydrogen atom then this reversion need not occur in the direction from which it came, <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>. Consider the half-hydrogenated state of compound <b>2</b> (from <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>); this may revert back to the original compound or, alternatively, to two other alkenes <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Of course, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> will then be hydrogenated under the reaction conditions, but there is no reason why they should give exclusively <i>cis</i>-<b>3</b> as products. This process of alkene migration is common under hydrogenation conditions and can often go unnoticed especially when each isomer of the starting material gives the same product on reduction.</p>

<a id="page_54" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 54, Reduction of carbon&#x2013;carbon double and triple bonds</a>
<p class="indent">Adding more hydrogen to the metal surface is an obvious tactic for reducing double-bond migration with respect to hydrogenation. As hydrogen becomes more abundant on the metal surface, the half-hydrogenated state will add a second atom of hydrogen more rapidly than it reverts back to the fully adsorbed state. This explains why increasing the hydrogen pressure for the reaction shown in <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a> increases the <i>cis</i> selectivity by reducing the amount of double-bond migration.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The most commonly used solvents for hydrogenation are methanol and ethanol, which are capable of dissolving sufficient amounts of hydrogen.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Homogeneous hydrogenation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst ([Ph<sub>3</sub>P]<sub>3</sub>RhCl) <b>7</b> is a most useful (soluble) metal complex for the homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes. So, addition of hydrogen to a red solution of <b>7</b> promotes the formation of (yellow) complex <b>8</b>, by oxidative addition of hydrogen and dissociation of a bulky phosphine ligand from the metal, <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>. In fact, dissociation of a phosphine ligand opens up a coordination site for the alkene to attach itself to the metal. The next step in the mechanism involves the concerted addition of a metal-hydrogen bond across the coordinated alkene to form complex <b>9</b> (both atoms are added in a <i>cis</i> fashion to the alkene). Finally, reductive elimination ensues, forming a second carbon-hydrogen bond and generating <b>10</b> which adds hydrogen to become <b>8</b> and so continues the catalytic cycle.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig7.5">
<img src="../images/fig7.5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.5</p>
<p class="indent">Sterically hindered alkenes are reduced more slowly with this catalyst and, unlike homogeneous hydrogenation, scrambling of the double bond does not occur during the reduction process. These properties make Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst ideal for the selective hydrogenation of unhindered alkenes, <a href="#fig7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Stereoselectivity in the hydrogenation of alkenes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Consider hydrogenation of alkene <b>11</b>: under normal homogeneous or heterogeneous hydrogenation conditions addition of hydrogen to both faces of the alkene will occur in equal proportions and the product will be racemic. Now, if it were possible to incorporate a chiral (non-racemic) ligand into the hydrogenation mixture then, in principle, discrimination between the two (enantiotopic) faces could take place and the product form as a single enantiomer.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg55.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of homogeneous hydrogenation is easier to study than that of heterogeneous reduction and most effort has gone into developing chiral ligands (normally replacements for triphenylphosphine) for this process. Both rhodium and ruthenium metals work rather well, and a general-purpose chiral ligand is BINAP (commercially available as either enantiomer).</p>
<p class="indent">The facial selectivity of hydrogenation has its origins in the formation of a complex between the metal, BINAP and alkene. Complexes with each of the two faces of the alkene are diastereoisomeric by virtue of the chiral ligand and it is hydrogenation of these diastereoisomeric complexes at different rates that determines the stereoselectivity of the product. Although the precise details by which the chiral ligand exerts its influence have been studied in detail, they will not be covered here.</p>
<p class="indent">So, reduction of the alkene <b>12</b> using catalytic Rh(I) and catalytic (<i>S</i>)-BINAP gives the product as essentially a single enantiomer, <a href="#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>. It should be noted, however, that not all types of alkene can be reduced successfully with this catalyst and ideally the alkene should have both an electron-withdrawing group and a group with a chelating carbonyl (OAc, NHAc, etc.) on one of the alkene carbons.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">BINAP is a bidentate ligand for transition metals. It is chiral by virtue of the fact that the rings do not lie coplanar; it has axial chirality.</p>

<p class="indent">This leads to a rather interesting problem: how can we accomplish the partial reduction of alkynes to alkenes? Any solution that we find should be capable of controlling the geometry of the alkene formed so that we can prepare either <i>cis-</i> or <i>trans-</i> alkenes from any particular alkyne.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_7.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Formation of <i>cis</i>-alkenes from alkynes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the best known method for the partial reduction of alkynes to alkenes is heterogeneous hydrogenation with Lindlar&#x2019;s catalyst (which we have seen before in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> as a means of reducing azides). Lindlar&#x2019;s catalyst is essentially palladium that has been poisoned with lead and an amine (typically quinoline) so that it is ineffective at reducing alkenes.</p>
<p class="indent">Bearing in mind that the mechanism for reduction with Lindlar&#x2019;s catalyst is similar to that shown in <a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>, it should come as no surprise to note that the two hydrogens are added to the alkyne in a <i>cis</i> fashion, and the result is formation of a <i>cis</i>-(<i>Z</i>)-alkene <b>15</b>, <a href="#fig7.11">Fig. 7.11</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Amine additives deactivate the catalyst by binding onto active sites on the metal surface. This binding is in direct competition with both the alkyne and alkene product, and it reduces the catalyst&#x2019;s effectiveness. The additives may also aid rearrangement of the catalyst surface to a less active morphology.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Hydroboration of alkynes</i></p>

Concerted addition of an H<sub>2</sub>B-H bond across the alkyne &#x03C0;-system <b>16</b> results in formation of a vinyl borane, <a href="#fig7.12">Fig. 7.12</a>. This addition occurs twice more until each of the B-H bonds has been replaced by a B-C bond. In a second step the vinyl borane <b>17</b> is treated with acetic acid at low temperature and the carbon-boron bond is replaced (with retention of configuration) by a carbon-hydrogen bond to form a <i>cis</i>-alkene with high stereoselectivity.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Partial reduction of aromatic compounds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Birch reduction is particularly useful and unique in its ability to accomplish the partial reduction of aromatic compounds. Electrons are the reducing agent and again these come from the group I metals sodium, lithium or potassium in liquid ammonia (all are accompanied by a characteristic blue colour). So, reduction of benzene with sodium, ammonia and <i>t</i>-BuOH at low temperature (-78&#x00B0;C) will form the dihydro-product in good yield, <a href="#fig7.14">Fig. 7.14</a>. The two alkene units in the reduced compound are not in conjugation with each other, which appears a little odd at first. The mechanism for reduction is similar to that for the partial reduction of alkynes and enones and involves sequential addition of an electron, followed by protonation of the radical anion species so formed.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The non-conjugated position of the two alkenes in the product is determined by the regioselectivity of protonation of pentadienyl anion <b>20</b>. Only protonation at the middle carbon will do, as protonation at either end would give the conjugated product. Why do pentadienyl anions protonate faster at the middle carbon than at the ends? This is a difficult question to answer intuitively, but calculations have shown that the central carbon has a higher concentration of electron density than the end carbons. So, <i>kinetic</i> protonation at the most electron rich site gives the observed regioselectivity.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The situation becomes more complicated when substituted aromatic compounds are reduced under Birch conditions, <a href="#fig7.15">Fig. 7.15</a>. As you can see, electron-rich compounds such as anisole and toluene give products where the substituent is conjugated with one alkene.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.15</p>
<p class="indent">The regiochemistry observed in the Birch reduction of substituted aromatic compounds has its origins in the protonation of the radical anion formed after addition of a single electron to the aromatic &#x03C0;-system. Factors to think about during the protonation of such radical anions are (i) which carbon is the site of highest electron density; (ii) what is the stability of the radical formed upon protonation? Consider <b>21,</b> <a href="#fig7.16">Fig. 7.16</a>, which must protonate preferentially at C-2 rather than at C-1 or C-4 to give the observed products. Protonation takes place at the carbon with the highest electron density and can be explained simply by considering that canonical <b>21b</b> is a truer picture of reality than <b>21a</b> because a negative charge is less stable adjacent to oxygen (<b>21a</b>, X &#x003D; OMe) where it experiences repulsion from the two lone pairs, or at a tertiary carbon (<b>21a</b> X &#x003D; CH<sub>3</sub>). Again, protonation of the pentadienyl anion formed later on occurs on the central carbon atom.</p>

<p class="indent">Similar mechanistic reasoning can be put to use here, when we consider that protonation of radical anion <b>22</b> is most favourable at C-4 as it leaves behind a radical that is stabilised by conjugation with the carbonyl group. Furthermore, addition of another electron forms a stable anion adjacent to a carbonyl group (i.e. an enolate), <a href="#fig7.18">Fig. 7.18</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If one limits the amount of alcohol that is added to the Birch reduction of <b>23</b> (i.e. reaction with excess sodium, ammonia and <i>one</i> equivalent of <i>t-</i> BuOH) then the enolate formed has no proton source to quench it (as the one equivalent of alcohol has been used up in protonating the radical anion). Under these conditions, the enolate can be alkylated by addition of another electrophile (E<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is commonly an alkyl halide).

<p class="noindent">Both carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic rings can be completely reduced with hydrogen and metal catalyst in a manner similar to that of non-aromatic alkenes, although conditions tend to be more forcing (one is losing aromaticity after all). Some transition metals are better than others for this purpose and this author recommends platinum, rhodium and ruthenium as effective catalysts.</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism of the reduction is presumed to be analogous to that outlined for the reduction of alkenes and should produce cyclohexadienes and cyclohexenes as intermediates, although these are not isolated.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">While palladium catalyst can be used for reducing aromatic compounds, it is rather inactive and so is useful for reducing alkenes in the presence of aromatic rings.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The situation becomes more interesting when substituted aromatic compounds are reduced by hydrogenation, as stereogenic centres are formed in the process. As we would expect one face of an aromatic ring to be adsorbed onto the metal surface, and subsequent addition of hydrogen to come from the metal, we would predict that <i>cis</i>-diastereoisomers would be formed preferentially. This is indeed the case, although the level of stereoselectivity is not always as high as that shown in <a href="#fig7.22">Fig. 7.22</a>.</p>
