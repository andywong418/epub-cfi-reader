<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">It seems sensible to include the redox chemistry of some common heteroatoms in this book as the functional groups that are so formed are extremely useful in organic synthesis.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.1">
<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation of nitrogen</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to introduce the oxidation reaction in earnest we should consider the reaction of an amine with an oxidant: what could be simpler? Unfortunately, the oxidation of amines can be a complicated reaction when primary and secondary amines are involved. However, we shall not consider these reactions in detail as the products (which are imines, nitroso compounds, nitro compounds, and oximes) are difficult to produce selectively. Instead, let us concentrate on the oxidation of tertiary amines to give the corresponding <i>N</i>-oxide. You should have no trouble in assigning this transformation as an oxidation because the product from the oxidation of <b>1</b> clearly contains more oxygen than it did before the reaction, <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. The mechanism of this reaction is illustrated by the oxidation of N-methylmorpholine with hydrogen peroxide and involves nucleophilic attack of the amine lone pair of electrons onto the peroxide, breaking the relatively weak oxygen-oxygen bond. Loss of a proton then furnishes the amine-<i>N</i>-oxide plus water, <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. Remember the structure of <i>N</i>-methylmorpholine-<i>N</i>-oxide <b>2</b> as it is an important oxidant in its own right (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) We can also see that the oxidant (hydrogen peroxide is a very simple and efficient oxidant for this purpose) is reduced to water, thus completing the redox cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that amine-<i>N</i>-oxides are zwitterionic structures in which there is effectively no &#x03C0;-bonding between the oxygen and the nitrogen (this is because nitrogen has no empty orbitals available for such &#x03C0;-bonding). </p>

<p class="indent">In comparison with aliphatic amines, the oxidation of heterocyclic aromatic amines is less easy to accomplish with hydrogen peroxide&#x2014; probably as a consequence of the trigonal nitrogen&#x2019;s reduced nucleophilicity. The best way to accomplish the oxidation of pyridines (for example) is to utilise <i>meta</i>&#x2013;chloroperbenzoic acid (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). As might be expected, electron-rich pyridines are more easily oxidised than electron-deficient ones. One must also be cautious about the oxidation of 2- and 2,6-substituted pyridines as the extra steric hindrance introduced by the <i>ortho</i> groups retards oxidation. This oxidation is quite a useful reaction as pyridine-<i>N</i>-oxides have a rich chemistry of their own&#x2014; not least of which is the ability to allow electrophilic aromatic substitution on the heterocycle.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Recently a new oxidant has appeared which catalyses the (otherwise) slow reaction of a pyridine with hydrogen peroxide. Methyl trioxorhenium (MTO) very successfully promotes the oxidation of a range of both electron-rich and electron-deficient pyridines. The active oxidant may be the peroxy complex shown (formed from MTO and H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>) which adds oxygen to the pyridine nitrogen.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxidation of amines using a chiral oxidant</h3>
<p class="noindent">The combination of an oxidising agent with a chiral (non-racemic) ligand and a transition metal catalyst results in the formation of a chiral oxidant. And, as might be expected, chiral oxidants are capable of controlling the stereochemistry of an oxidation reaction (this will be treated in more detail in instances where a new stereogenic centre is formed during an oxidation reaction). However, another possibility for stereochemical control arises, even in oxidations that do not result in the formation of a new stereogenic centre. Consider the case of a substrate for oxidation that is itself chiral (and racemic). Here, one enantiomer of the substrate may well react with a chiral oxidant at a different rate than the other. In an ideal world, we would be able to stop the reaction at 50&#x0025; conversion and recover a single, unreacted, enantiomer of substrate together with 50&#x0025; of product which would be the oxidised (and therefore chemically different) form of the other enantiomer. This process is called kinetic resolution and is exemplified in <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. In this case, one enantiomer of the racemic amine <b>3</b> is unreactive while the other is oxidised to its <i>N</i>-oxide. Take note of the reagents used to construct the chiral oxidant: <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide (source of oxygen), diisopropyl tartrate (chiral ligand) and titanium tetraisopropoxide (metal catalyst). A powerful chiral oxidant arises from the formation of an ordered complex between the metal, ligand and peroxide and it is this complex that is responsible for the kinetic resolution.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation of phosphorus</h2>
<p class="noindent">A pattern of reactivity similar to that of nitrogen can be observed in the oxidation of phosphorus&#x2013;containing compounds. However, as phosphorus is lower down the periodic table than nitrogen it is generally more easily oxidised, as it is more nucleophilic. Consider the oxidation of phosphines to their corresponding oxides (<a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>). This reaction is affected by the steric hindrance around the phosphorus atom and so triphenylphosphine is stable in the atmosphere and requires a reagent such as hydrogen peroxide or manganese dioxide to produce triphenylphosphine oxide. On the other hand, trimethylphosphine is many times more reactive and will oxidise with just air itself. As might be expected, tributylphosphine displays reactivity somewhere between the two extremes.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig2.4">

<p class="caption">Fig. 2.4</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The P-O bond length in triphenylphosphine oxide is rather short (1.43&#x00C5;) suggesting the presence of substantial p&#x03C0;-d&#x03C0; back-bonding between the oxygen and empty d orbitals on the phosphorus. Thus, the double-bonded structure shown is a valid representation of the structure of phosphine oxides as well as the zwitterionic canonical (reality is somewhere between the two).</p>

<p class="indent">Phosphine oxides are useful intermediates in alkene synthesis as a-alkoxy phosphine oxides undergo a <i>syn</i> elimination when treated with base. This sequence of events was utilised very successfully in the synthesis of <i>trans-</i> cycloctene from the epoxide (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Although not strictly under the purview of this book (no carbon&#x2013;phosphorus bonds are involved&#x0021;) there is another oxidation of a phosphorus&#x2013;containing group that is particularly useful to organic chemists. The phosphoramidate intermediates shown are used in the solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides. Two sugar units are conveniently joined <i>via</i> reaction of a phosporamidate linkage with a free hydroxyl group (catalysed by a weak acid), <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Oxidation of heteroatoms attached to carbon</a> <a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>. After coupling, the phosphite triester product is oxidised with aqueous iodine to yield a phosphate triester which is now ready for coupling with another sugar unit (after deprotection of the P<sup>1</sup> protecting group). A mechanism for this oxidation is shown below. At the end of the synthesis, deprotection of all the phosphate ester protecting groups (P<sup>2</sup>) takes place in one step to reveal the corresponding phosphate linkers between the sugars.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation of sulfur and selenium</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is the oxidation chemistry of sulfur and selenium that deserves the most attention in this chapter. Both of these elements appear in functional groups with varying levels of oxygenation; as might be expected, they are both rather readily oxidised, with selenium being more easily oxidised than sulfur. We shall begin with the oxidation of thiols and selenols.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Formation of disulfides and diselenides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Selenols (RSeH) are not normally stable in air as they are readily oxidised to the corresponding diselenide (RSeSeR) by molecular oxygen. Thiols are somewhat more stable, although they too can be oxidised (to disulfides, RSSR) by oxygen if a base is present.</p>
<a id="page_10" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 10, Oxidation of heteroatoms attached to carbon</a>
<p class="indent">Other oxidising agents such as hydrogen peroxide, manganese dioxide, and chromium trioxide may be used for the preparation of symmetrical disufides from thiols, although care must be taken to avoid overoxidation of the disulfide product. A nice way of obtaining unsymmetrical disulfides is shown in <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>. Thus, reaction of ethane thiol with diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) furnishes a 1:1 adduct <b>4</b> which can then be treated with another (different if need be) thiol. Nucleophilic attack of this thiol onto the sulfur atom of the adduct ensues and the product disulfide is produced in excellent yield. Note that in the overall reaction the two thiols have been oxidised (one hydrogen atom has been removed from each sulfur) and that DEAD has been reduced.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The oxidation of sulfides by air in the presence of base may proceed <i>via</i> the thiolate anion. This then undergoes a single electron transfer reaction with triplet oxygen to give a sulfur radical which can then dimerise.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Formation of sulfoxides and selenoxides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Oxidation of sulfides and selenides can give good yields of their corresponding oxides (namely, sulfoxides and selenoxides). Just like the phosphine oxides mentioned earlier, there is a reasonable amount of p&#x03C0;-d&#x03C0; back-bonding in these species. There are many different oxidising agents which have been used for the oxidation reaction including hydrogen peroxide, <i>m</i>-CPBA, sodium periodate (NaIO<sub>4</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), <a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. Although oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides can be accomplished in the presence of other oxidisable groups such as pyridines and alkenes (with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), care must always be taken to ensure that excess oxidant is not present, otherwise overoxidation of the sulfoxide to the sulfone can occur. The mechanism of oxidation with <i>m</i>-CPBA involves nucleophilic attack of the sulfide onto the peracid: if this is to be believed then there should be a correlation between the nucleophilicity of a sulfide and its ease of oxidation. This is indeed the case and, for example, dialkyl sulfides are oxidised more rapidly than their more hindered (and electronically deactivated) diaryl counterparts. </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Sulfoxides and selenoxides are tetrahedral in shape, with two carbon groups, an oxygen and a lone pair of electrons at the four vertices. When the two carbon groups are nonequivalent (R &#x2260; R&#x2019;) then the sulfoxide is chiral (and configurationally stable).</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Oxidation of sulfides using a chiral oxidant</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Oxidation of unsymmetrical sulfides to the corresponding sulfoxides involves the formation of a new stereogenic centre (at sulfur). All of the oxidising reagents listed in <a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a> are achiral and therefore give a racemic mixture of products. However, oxidation using a chiral oxidant can give high selectivity for formation of a single enantiomer of product, <a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>. In the case shown it is the (&#x002B;)-(<i>R,R</i>)-diethyl tartrate (DET)/ titanium tetraisopropoxide/ <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide oxidising system that again proves to be very efficient at producing enantiomerically pure products.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Production of enantiomerically pure selenoxides is more difficult than that of the corresponding sulfoxides: this is because selenoxides are thought to racemise when exposed to water.

<h3 class="h3">Formation of sulfones and selenones</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sulfur and selenium are each a part of another, even more oxidised functional group that is important in organic synthesis: these are named sulfones (RSO<sub>2</sub>R) and selenones (RSeO<sub>2</sub>R) respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">It is fortunate that the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides can be controlled so as to stop at the sulfoxide stage. This is because the oxidation of sulfoxides to sulfones is generally slower than the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides (by a factor of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>3</sup>). This reactivity difference is to be expected with oxidants such as <i>m</i>-CPBA which are electrophilic&#x2014; sulfoxides are bound to be less nucleophilic than sulfides as they are more hindered and also have an electron-withdrawing oxygen attached to the sulfur atom. So, if we want to complete the oxidation of sulfides to sulfones then we need to add excess oxidant, <a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>. </p>

<p class="indent">The relative rates of oxidation of sulfides and sulfoxides are reversed if one uses potassium permanganate as an oxidant. Presumably, this (negatively charged, MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) oxidant is acting as a nucleophile, preferring to react first with an electrophilic sulfoxide rather than a sulfide. Using this reagent it is possible to oxidise sulfoxides to sulfones in the presence of a sulfide, <a href="#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>. Compare this with the result obtained with <i>m</i>-CPBA at 0&#x00B0;C. Note that both the <i>bis</i>-sulfoxide and the mono-sulfone can be oxidised to the <i>bis</i>-sulfone by reaction with excess <i>m</i>-CPBA at elevated temperatures.</p>

<p class="indent">The oxidation of selenides to selenones (<i>via</i> a selenoxide) is rather a difficult one to achieve and it appears to be the general instability of selenoxides (as noted above) that is mostly to blame. Perhaps the easiest group of selenones to prepare and study are those substituted with two aryl groups ((&#x03B2;-elimination of any selenoxide intermediate is therefore precluded). <a href="#fig2.14">Figure 2.14</a> shows some examples of selenone formation by oxidation of selenoxides. The direct conversion of aryl-alkyl selenides to selenones can be achieved with pertrifluoroacetic acid (CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>H).</p>
