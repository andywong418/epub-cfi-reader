<p class="noindent">There are many functional groups based on multiple bonds between carbon and either oxygen or nitrogen. We have already dealt with the oxidation chemistry of some of these functional groups and this chapter will show you some of the corresponding reduction reactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of nitriles</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nitriles (or cyano groups) contain a strong triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. In terms of reactivity, nitriles are susceptible to nucleophilic attack and therefore reduction of these groups is easily effected by &#x2018;hydride&#x2019; reducing agents. Let&#x2019;s take the partial reduction of nitriles as an example. Reaction of nitriles with DIBAL-H (one equivalent) is an effective way of transforming nitriles to imines and thence to aldehydes by hydrolysis, <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism involves addition of the Al-H bond across the triple bond of the nitrile (this may be concerted) to form complex<b> 1</b>. This complex is not normally isolated but usually hydrolysed in a second step to furnish the corresponding aldehyde.</p>
<p class="indent">Complete reduction of nitriles to amines can be achieved readily with a powerful reducing agent such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>. In the example shown two equivalents of hydride add to the triple bond forming a species that formally has two negative charges on nitrogen (of course this dianion is stabilised by coordination to the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation and the AlH<sub>3</sub> species formed from AlH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>). Protonation of this dianion (this will occur on quenching the reaction during work-up) then forms a primary amine.</p>

<p class="noindent">The carbon&#x2013;nitrogen double bond of an imine is readily reduced by hydride reducing agents such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride, <a href="#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>.

<p class="caption">Fig. 8.3</p>
<p class="indent">One interesting way of increasing the reactivity of imines towards reduction is to employ acid to protonate the imine nitrogen. Imines are particularly sensitive to this type of activation because nitrogen is a basic atom. This observation has given rise to a useful method of forming and reducing imines <i>in situ</i>; the overall transformation of carbonyl group to imine and then to amine is known as reductive amination, <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>. The condensation with acetone is a particularly useful method of putting an <i>isopropyl</i> group on nitrogen: certainly much better than (slow) S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of an amine and <i>iso</i>propyl bromide which will have problems of elimination and over-alkylation.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The ketone is not reduced at an appreciable rate under these conditions because the pH is not low enough to protonate it.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Clearly, if this method is going to work then we require a reducing agent (formally a source of H<sup>-</sup>) that will not react as a base in the presence of an acidic medium. Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN) is a deactivated borohydride reagent that fits the bill nicely because it is compatible with reductions at pH 3-6 and is also sufficiently unreactive to avoid reducing the carbonyl group. Thus, primary amines can be converted to secondary, and secondary amines to tertiary, <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>.</p>

<p class="caption" id="fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</p>
<p class="indent">On occasion it can be difficult to control the reaction of primary amines so that they stop at the secondary amine stage. The main difficulty stems from the ability of the secondary amine product to react further <i>via</i> an iminium ion (this is positively charged and reactive), <a href="#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>. In fact this facet of amine chemistry can be put to good use in a <i>double</i> reductive alkylation whereby primary amines are converted directly to tertiary amines: both alkyl groups that are introduced have to be the same and an excess of carbonyl compound will be required. Reductive methylation, using formaldehyde, is probably the most common use of this reaction, <a href="#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>. Of course, it is not possible to over-alkylate the amine and form quartemary ammonium salts as the tertiary amine products (e.g. <b>2</b>) cannot condense with another mole of formaldehyde.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have already discussed the complete reduction of pyridines in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. It is, however, possible to reduce partially the pyridine nucleus (and other related heterocycles) with hydride reducing agents. Pyridine itself does not react with NaBH<sub>4</sub> unless electron-withdrawing groups are attached to activate the heterocycle to nucleophilic attack. So, reduction of <b>3</b>, <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a> with NaBH<sub>4</sub> in ethanol gives the tetrahydropyridine <b>4</b>; a plausible mechanism is shown which involves the intermediacy of a 1,4-dihydropyridine (in the mechanism shown, ethanol can act as the H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> source).</p>

<p class="noindent">The reduction of aldehydes to primary alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols is normally easy to accomplish using sodium borohydride or lithium <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Reduction of carbon-heteroatom double and triple bonds</a> aluminium hydride. Let&#x2019;s consider NaBH<sub>4</sub> first as this mild reducing agent can react with aldehydes and ketones without reducing carboxylic acids, esters or amides, <a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>. The mechanism of reduction certainly involves addition of hydride from BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> to the carbonyl group and the developing charge on the oxygen is quenched by reaction with the alcohol solvent.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is noteworthy that sodium borohydride reacts with alcohols (e.g. MeOH) to give alkoxyborohydrides of varying composition. Each of these species is able to donate hydride to a carbonyl group and generally the more oxygen ligands on boron then the more reactive the reducing agent.</p>

<p class="indent">Lithium aluminium hydride acts in the same manner as sodium borohydride but is many times more reactive. The mechanism by which LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduces carbonyls is different to that shown above for borohydride. First, activation of the carbonyl with the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation is essential to initiate reduction. Addition of hydride to the activated carbonyl ensues and the negatively charged oxygen that results from this process is stabilised by coordination to both Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and AlH<sub>3</sub>, <a href="#fig8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The importance of Lewis acid activation of the carbonyl is underscored by the observation that in the presence of a crown ether that binds Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, reduction of ketones with LiAIH<sub>4</sub> is very slow.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A fundamentally different way of reducing aldehydes and ketones utilises hydride transfer from a secondary alcohol. The Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reduction involves reaction of a carbonyl with Al(O<i>i</i>-Pr)<sub>3</sub> in <i>i</i>-PrOH solvent, <a href="#fig8.12">Fig. 8.12</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The reaction is presumed to proceed <i>via</i> a six-membered cyclic transition state with internal hydride transfer. Moreover, this reaction is an equilibrium which is shifted to the product side by using excess <i>i</i>-PrOH or by removing the volatile acetone by-product. Aluminium alkoxides are good reagents for the Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reduction because they are only weakly basic and so avoid complications arising from the condensation reactions of aldehyde or ketone enolates.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The equilibrium established in the Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reduction may be reversed by using Al(O/-Pr)<sub>3</sub> and excess acetone. The result is a method of oxidising primary and secondary alcohols known as the Oppenauer oxidation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A related hydride transfer from lithium amides can also be observed: a common by-product from the attempted enolisation of aldehydes by LDA is the primary alcohol.

<p class="h4"><i>Selectivity in the reduction of aldehydes, ketones and enones</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Reduction of &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated ketones can lead to problems derived from a lack of regioselectivity during hydride attack. For example, reduction of cyclopentenone by sodium borohydride can lead to two products, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, <a href="#fig8.14">Fig. 8.14</a>. The allylic alcohol <b>6</b> derives from 1,2-attack of hydride onto the ketone, while the fully reduced compound originates from 1,4-attack, tautomerism of the enol and further reduction of the ketone product. Clearly, some means of controlling this regioselectivity is required if the reaction is to be used successfully. To this end, an important modification of sodium borohydride was made by Luche who added CeCl<sub>3</sub> to a methanolic solution and observed complete 1,2-selectivity: so it is possible to reduce the ketone but not the conjugated alkene. Remember the opposite regioselectivity is possible, i.e. that sodium in liquid ammonia reduces the alkene selectively, rather than the ketone (see <a href="Chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Luche showed that Ce<sup>&#x002B;</sup> promotes the reaction between methanol and NaBH<sub>4</sub> forming alkoxyborohydrides <i>in situ.</i> These reducing agents may themselves react with a selectivity that is different from that of the parent NaBH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">Another useful reaction which involves the combination of CeCl<sub>3</sub> and sodium borohydride is the selective reduction of ketones in the presence of aldehydes, <a href="#fig8.15">Fig. 8.15</a>. At first this seems counterintuitive as aldehydes are more reactive electrophiles than ketones and, if anything, it should be possible to reduce aldehydes rather than ketones: so, how is this selectivity achieved? The answer does indeed lie in the increased reactivity of aldehydes relative to ketones and has its origins in the formation of hydrates from the aldehyde (facilitated by cerium trichloride) and not from the ketone. This means that the aldehyde is &#x2018;protected&#x2019; against reduction <i>in situ</i> and so only the ketone can react with borohydride in the normal manner: presumably the aldehyde is regenerated from the hydrate during aqueous work-up.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="h4"><i>Stereoselectivity during ketone reduction</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Reduction of a ketone within a chiral compound normally gives rise to diastereoisomers: steric effects can dominate reductions with the hydride reducing agent approaching a carbonyl from the least hindered face, <a href="#fig8.16">Fig. 8.16</a>. Other factors such as chelation between the substrate and the reducing agent can also influence the facial selectivity upon reduction.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.16</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years there have been advances in the use of enantiomerically pure reducing agents to impose stereoselectivity during the reduction of ketones. Under normal circumstances, reduction of a prochiral ketone leads to a racemic mixture of secondary alcohols. However, modification of the reducing agent with a chiral (non-racemic) ligand changes this outcome and the production of secondary alcohol as single enantiomers is now commonplace, <a href="#fig8.17">Fig. 8.17</a>. One of the more useful chiral reducing agents is the CBS oxazaborolidine devised by Corey; the chiral ligand <b>8</b> derives from proline. Compound <b>8</b> has the ability to accelerate the reduction of ketones by diborane and one of the advantages of this reagent is that it may be used as a catalyst with only very small amounts required for a reduction. The source of &#x2018;hydride&#x2019; for the reduction comes from diborane or catecholborane, which must be used in stoichiometric amounts.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg68.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent2">The oxazaborolidine complex <b>8</b> is both Lewis acidic (at boron) and Lewis basic (at nitrogen). This feature of the catalyst, which is essential to its activity, is exaggerated by the cyclic nature of the ring system which is too constrained to allow ideal overlap between the nitrogen lone pair and a p orbital on boron.</p>

<p class="indent">The chiral catalyst <b>8</b> exerts its influence by binding to both borane and the ketone substrate, <a href="#fig8.18">Fig. 8.18</a>. In binding both partners the catalyst activates the ketone and borane to reduction and this follows <i>via</i> a six-membered transition state. The formation of a single enantiomer of alcohol product has its origins in the ordered binding between Lewis acidic <b>8</b> and the ketone; this is most favourable on the oxygen lone pair opposite the larger of the two groups attached to the ketone. Moreover, both reagents bind to the relatively unhindered <i>exo</i> face of the bicyclo ring of the catalyst, so creating an environment for selectivity during the hydride transfer step.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Reduction of carbonyl groups in nature</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Nature routinely reduces carbonyl groups during the biosynthesis of all sorts of natural products (fatty acids and carbohydrates are just two examples from many). The enzymes that are used for this process require a co-factor called NADPH, <a href="#fig8.19">Fig. 8.19</a>. Although this is a complicated looking structure it is only the dihydropyridine portion of the molecule that need concern us.</p>
<a id="page_70" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 70, Reduction of carbon-heteroatom double and triple bonds</a>
<p class="indent">The mechanism by which NADPH reduces carbonyl compounds is similar to that shown for sodium borohydride, with the dihydropyridine ring acting as a source of hydride. It has been shown that only one of the two hydrogen atoms at the C-4 position of the dihydropyridine ring is removed during reduction and that reduction of ketones (even unnatural ones) frequently gives products with high enantiomeric excess. This degree of control need not be surprising in the presence of enzymes which are capable of controlling stereochemistry with consummate ease.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reduction of esters</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reduction of esters to primary alcohols is a straightforward task that is best accomplished by a powerful reducing agent such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> (alternatives include <i>i</i>-Bu<sub>2</sub>AlH and LiBH<sub>4</sub>); NaBH<sub>4</sub> is not reactive enough to accomplish the reduction of simple esters. Under such reaction conditions, hydride addition to the carbonyl gives a tetrahedral intermediate (stabilised by coordination to aluminium and lithium) that collapses to form an aldehyde and (as aldehydes are more reactive than esters) this is quickly reduced to the corresponding alcohol, <a href="#fig8.20">Fig. 8.20</a>. It is interesting to note that the aluminate species formed <i>in situ</i> by replacement of hydride ligands by oxygen ligands (e.g. R&#x2019;OAlH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) are also active reducing agents, but in this case they are <i>less</i> potent than the parent LiAlH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Esters may be partially reduced to aldehydes if one equivalent of a hydride nucleophile is added at low temperature. In practice, DIBAL-H (1 eq.) in toluene is most often used for such selective reductions. It is important that the tetrahedral intermediate formed upon addition of &#x2018;H<sup>-</sup>&#x2019; does not collapse <i>in situ</i> or else the resulting aldehyde will be reduced again; this can be rather difficult to control. Of course, on work-up, treatment with a proton source and warming, the tetrahedral intermediates derived from these compounds will collapse to form an aldehyde. So, reduction of esters <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> with DIBAL-H (or the isotopically labelled DIBAL-D) gave two aldehydes in reasonable to excellent yield, <a href="#fig8.21">Fig. 8.21</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Factors which stabilise the tetrahedral intermediate help to prevent its collapse and further reduction; so, the tetrahedral intermediate 11 is expected to be especially stable due to chelation between the alkoxide counter-ion and the <i>N</i>-Boc group.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another related reaction is the partial reduction of lactones to cyclic hemiacetals, known as lactols. This reaction is also best accomplished with DIBAL-H at low temperature, <a href="#fig8.22">Fig. 8.22</a>. During the reduction of lactones, collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate would expel an alkoxide in an intramolecular sense. Clearly there is not as much entropic advantage in opening a ring as there would be in expelling a separate molecule of alkoxide and so the partial reduction of lactones is usually an efficient process.</p>

<p class="indent">A more convenient way of reducing acids to primary alcohols involves prior activation of the acid as a mixed anhydride or acid chloride followed by reduction of this reactive intermediate with sodium borohydride, <a href="#fig8.24">Fig. 8.24</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Both anhydrides and acid chlorides are particularly electrophilic and so this two-step procedure is an excellent way of reducing acids in the presence of esters. The mixed anyhdride shown in <a href="#fig8.24">Fig. 8.24</a> is most reactive at the C&#x003D;O that originally belonged to the carboxylic acid: the other carbonyl is not as electrophilic because of overlap of the C&#x003D;O &#x03C0;-system with electrons on two oxygen atoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) is a useful reagent for the reduction of acids to primary alcohols. However, unlike hydride donors such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, this reagent reacts faster with acids than it does with esters, <a href="#fig8.25">Fig. 8.25</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The initial reaction of a carboxylic acid with borane evolves hydrogen to produce acyloxy boranes. Unlike the carboxylate salts mentioned earlier, such boron complexes are particularly reactive towards excess reducing agent and reduction to the aldehyde and then alcohol ensues. The reason for the enhanced reactivity of acyloxy boranes, relative to esters and acids, may have its origins in an overlap of the oxygen lone pair with the empty p-orbital on boron. This effect should in turn reduce the effectiveness of the overlap between the oxygen lone pair and the adjacent &#x03C0;-system of the C&#x003D;O bond.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<h3 class="h3">The reduction of amides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reduction of amides with strong hydride donors such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> does not follow the same pattern as that observed for esters and acids. Instead of an alcohol being formed, the product is an amine: i.e. LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is a means of deoxygenating amides, <a href="#fig8.26">Fig. 8.26</a>. Several groups are tolerated in this reduction (as long as they do not react with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> themselves) and both acyclic and cyclic amides (lactams) are good substrates.</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism of this reduction involves coordination of a lithium cation to the amide carbonyl, thus activating it to nucleophilic attack by AlH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate can now expel the oxygen atom (rather than the nitrogen atom which is a poor leaving group) with the incipient negative charge being stabilised by the oxophilic Li and Al. The iminium ion that results from this process will be reduced rapidly by LiAlH<sub>4</sub> thus forming an amine, <a href="#fig8.27">Fig. 8.27</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Borane is also a very good reagent for deoxygenating amides to furnish amines. However, borane is a strongly Lewis acidic reducing agent that reacts fastest with nucleophilic carbonyl groups. So, it should come as no surprise to find that amides can be reduced to amines in the presence of the ostensibly more reactive ester group. Other selective reductions are possible with this reagent, <a href="#fig8.28">Fig. 8.28</a>.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Partial reduction of amides</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Amides can be partially reduced to aldehydes if the tetrahedral intermediate formed after addition of hydride can be stabilised (this is analogous to the partial reduction of esters). In this scenario, work-up with a proton source <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Reduction of carbon-heteroatom double and triple bonds</a> yields a hemiaminal which hydrolyses to form an aldehyde. However, there is not a general-purpose reducing agent capable of achieving the transformation of amides to aldehydes. Perhaps the best reagent available is the ATE complex <b>12</b>, derived from the addition of BuLi to DIBAL-H, <a href="#fig8.29">Fig. 8.29</a>. Sodium in liquid ammonia also has some use in this reaction. However, neither reagent is useful for the reduction of primary or secondary amides.</p>

<p class="indent">One good way of reducing amides selectively involves the formation of Weinreb amides, <b>13</b>, <a href="#fig8.30">Fig. 8.30</a>. These derivatives react with either LiAlH<sub>4</sub> or DIBAL-H at low temperature and form stable, chelated intermediates. So, on work-up, the corresponding aldehydes are formed in high yields.</p>
