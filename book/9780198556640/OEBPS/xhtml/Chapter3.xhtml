<p class="noindent">The oxidation of carbon&#x2013;carbon &#x03C0;-bonds can yield several useful functional groups. Many oxidising agents have been developed for this purpose and we shall consider the most useful ones below. In fact, one of the main advantages of oxidising alkenes is that the product distribution can be controlled, and a particular functional group formed, simply by the choice of oxidant.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.1">
<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation of alkenes to form epoxides</h2>
<p class="noindent">Epoxides are the cyclic ethers that may be formed from the reaction of an alkene with an oxidising agent, <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>. Remember that epoxides are electrophiles and that (when protonated) they react with nucleophiles such as water. The product from this reaction is a 1,2-
 (or vicinal diol). We can consider the 1,2&#x2013;diol as a single functional group, see page 5, which is in oxidation level 2. As the epoxide furnishes the 1,2-diol simply by the addition of water, we can consider this functional group as also being in level 2. Therefore, the transformation of an alkene (oxidation level 1) to an epoxide is rightly considered as an oxidation reaction and the acid catalysed reaction of an epoxide with water is a sideways move within oxidation level 2.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The reaction of epoxides with a nucleophile takes place with inversion. The nucleophile approaches the C-O bond that is to be broken from behind so that its electrons can overlap with the C-O &#x03C3;* orbital. You can consider this displacement an example of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction where the normally unreactive ether bond is broken so as to relieve strain present in the three- membered ring.</p>

<p class="indent">The most useful reagent for effecting the alkene-epoxide oxidation is <i>meta-</i> chloroperbenzoic acid, <i>m</i>-CPBA. The reaction is thought to proceed <i>via</i> a single (concerted) step which involves nucleophilic attack of the alkene &#x03C0;-electrons onto the peracid, <a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>. Evidence in favour of this mechanism centres around the observation that epoxidation of alkenes with <i>m</i>-CPBA is stereospecific (see the oxidation of <i>E-</i> and <i>Z</i>-1). Remember that even though the oxidations shown in this figure form single diastereoisomers, the epoxide products are mixtures of enantiomers.</p>

<p class="noindent2">A study of the rate of alkene epoxidation with the related peracid CH<sub>3</sub>COOOH has shown the following relative rates: CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (1); RCH&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (24); RCH&#x003D;CHR and R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (500); R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CHR (6500); CR<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub> (&#x003E;6500).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As we have just seen, <i>m</i>-CPBA is an electrophilic reagent and, accordingly, reacts well with nucleophilic alkenes. This means that the more alkyl groups that are substituted on the alkene the better (the extra steric bulk introduced by an alkyl group is orthogonal to the direction of approach of the oxidant and clearly does not do much to slow the reaction down). Using this facet of peracid chemistry it is possible to oxidise more-substituted alkenes in the presence of less-substituted ones, so long as we do not use more than 1 equivalent of oxidant, <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.3</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, alkenes that are conjugated with a carbonyl group are epoxidised much more slowly (as they are electron-deficient) and either forcing conditions (m-CPBA at high temperatures) or use of the more electrophilic reagent CF<sub>3</sub>COOOH as an alternative oxidant is recommended.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A recently developed oxidant is dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) which is capable of oxidising alkenes to the corresponding epoxides in high yield. This (electrophilic) reagent is at its best when forming sensitive epoxides that are not stable to other oxidising conditions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now consider an alkene unit in a molecule that is chiral&#x2014;the two faces of the double bond are non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and the two possible epoxides formed from oxidation of the alkene are diastereoisomers.

In these examples, oxidation with <i>m</i>-CPBA leads to the most hindered epoxide, <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>.

<p class="indent">As mentioned earlier, epoxidation of electron-deficient alkenes is slow with peracids and, moreover, unsaturated ketones can react with peracids in a different way (see the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, <a href="Chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). An alternative approach to oxidisng such electron-poor substrates would be to use a <i>nucleophilic</i> oxidant. Alkaline solutions of hydrogen peroxide suit this role nicely. Under basic conditions, hydrogen peroxide (pKa &#x2248; 12) is deprotonated and the anion <b>(HOO<sup>-</sup>)</b> is a very good (soft) nucleophile towards electron-deficient alkenes, <a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>. The enolate that results from attack by <b>HOO<sup>-</sup></b> can now act as a nucleophile towards the peroxide, breaking the weak <b>0-0</b> bond and displacing hydroxide anion.</p>

<p class="indent">Beware when using these oxidising conditions on acyclic enones; the reaction is not stereospecific, as we saw with <i>m</i>-CPBA. Instead, the reaction is now a stereoselective one and both isomers of enone give predominantly one isomer of epoxide.

<p class="h4"><i>Transition metal catalysed epoxidation of alkenes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The use of transition metals in conjunction with organic peroxides has yielded a very useful set of oxidising agents (see for example the oxidation of <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Oxidation of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds</a> amines and sulfides, <a href="Chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). These oxidants show amazing selectivity for the oxidation of alkenes with an allylic hydroxyl group. So, for an example, consider the oxidation of geraniol which contains two trisubstituted alkene units. These alkenes are not, however, identical as the C-2,3 alkene is electron deficient compared to the C-6,7 alkene (the former alkene has an allylic oxygen group withdrawing electrons inductively through the sigma system). The combination of <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide and catalytic amounts of vanadium complexes (VO(acac)<sub>2</sub> is best) leads to the formation of just one epoxide, that derived from epoxidation of the C-2,3 alkene, as shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The reason why the vanadium-catalysed epoxidation is so specific for allylic alcohols is that a complex is formed between the hydroxyl group, transition metal and hydroperoxide; therefore the oxidant is nicely placed to epoxidise the adjacent double bond. Note that the peroxide ligand is bound to the metal in a bidentate fashion: this is so that the by-product from the oxidation, f-butyl alcohol, can be stabilised by coordination to the metal.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.8</p>
<p class="indent">The stage is now set for introduction of another level of control&#x2014; that of enantioselectivity. If we use the principal ingredients from the process described above (<i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide and a transition metal catalyst) in conjunction with a chiral ligand, then a <i>chiral</i> oxidant is formed, <a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>. Titanium tetraisopropoxide is the most effective transition metal complex and diethyltartrate (DET) is the best chiral ligand (DET is readily available as either enantiomer). The reaction that ensues between an allylic alcohol and this oxidant is similar to that described for vanadium&#x2014;with one important difference. The chiral ligand is able to enforce the formation of essentially a single <i>enantiomer</i> of epoxide product. This reaction is an extremely useful way of introducing absolute stereochemistry into a synthetic sequence and is known as the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig3.9">
<img src="../images/fig3.9.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.9</p>
<p class="indent">Alkenes with all sorts of substitution patterns will work well in this epoxidation, although 1,2-<i>cis</i>-disubstituted alkenes do not always give high enantioselectivity. The reaction is particularly useful because it uses catalytic quantities of transition metal&#x2014; a typical stoichiometry for this reaction is: Ti(O<i>i</i>-Pr)<sub>4</sub> (0.1 eq.); <i>t</i>-BuOOH (2 eq.); DET (0.12 eq.); allylic alcohol (1 eq.).</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the reaction has been studied in detail and is quite complicated. The salient features of the reaction are that the metal, ligand, oxidant, and substrate form a complex which is the direct precursor to the epoxide, just as we saw with the vanadium-catalysed oxidation. Of course the fact that the alcohol complexes to both the metal and the oxidant is the reason that only allylic alcohols are epoxidised.</p>
<a id="page_17" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 17, Oxidation of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds</a>
<p class="indent">The structure of the active complex is almost certainly a dimer in which each titanium atom behaves independently. So, let&#x2019;s consider one metal atom only to rationalise the stereoselectivity, <a href="#fig3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>. Look at the allylic alcohol complexed to the titanium on the right-hand side of the dimer; the alkene adopts a conformation whereby it can lie above the active oxygen of the peroxide. As we have seen before, the peroxide is bound in a bidentate mode to the transition metal. The transition structure <b>A</b> (which leads to the formation of one enantiomer) is favoured over the structure <b>B</b> (which would lead to the other enantiomer). This is because of unfavourable steric interactions in <b>B</b> between the allylic alcohol and the ester group (E) of the ligand and also with the <i>t</i>-butyl group of the peroxide.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The Sharpless epoxidation is so reliable that a general rule has been developed to help chemists decide which enantiomer of DET will produce which epoxide. Draw the allylic alcohol in the orientation illustrated and (-)-DET will epoxidise it from the top face and (&#x002B;)- DET from the lower face.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Addition to alkenes <i>via</i> epi-ions</h2>
<p class="noindent">You should have come across the reaction between an alkene and a halogen (Br<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>) to give a vicinal dihalide. Perhaps the most useful member of the halogens for this purpose is bromine, which adds readily to most alkenes, <a href="#fig3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>. This reaction proceeds <i>via</i> the intermediacy of an epi-ion (called a bromonium ion in this case) which is opened in a second step by reaction with bromide ion. Opening of the epi-ion takes place with inversion of configuration (just like the opening of epoxide that we saw earlier). This means that the overall reaction is stereospecific. </p>

<p class="noindent2">We can prove the existence of bromonium ions&#x0021; The bromonium ion shown below has been prepared from the corresponding alkene and is quite stable. This species cannot be attacked easily by a nucleophile due to steric hindrance around the back of the C-Br bonds. The Br<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> counterion is a product of the addition of Br to Br<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg18.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Formation of the bromonium ion is rate determining in these reactions and in this step the alkene acts as a nucleophile towards electrophilic bromine. Consequently, as an alkene becomes more substituted (and therefore more electron rich) it is brominated more rapidly, just like epoxidation. Approximate relative rates of bromination are CH<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (1); RCH&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (61); RCH&#x003D;CHR (2000); R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (5400); R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CHR (1.3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup>); CR<sub>2</sub>&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub> (1.8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup>).</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, if we add a halogen to an alkene in the presence of an external nucleophile (usually in the form of the solvent) then another pathway can be followed as the epi-ion is opened by the additional nucleophile (if this is solvent then it will be present in a much greater concentration than X<sup>-</sup> which cannot compete as a nucleophile). <a href="#fig3.12">Figure 3.12</a> illustrates this point with iodine as the halogen and methanol as both solvent and nucleophile. Just like the bromination reaction which preceded it in this section, the reaction is a stereospecific one.</p>

This product reacts further with excess silver benzoate (the Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation helps to make iodide into a better leaving group) to give the final product. The stereochemistry of this product tells us that the displacement of iodine occurred with retention of configuration and double inversion is the culprit&#x0021; </p>

<p class="indent">We will mention in passing here some other oxidation reactions that proceed (i) <i>via</i> an epi-ion and (ii) result in the introduction of oxygen, so as to conform to our definition of oxidation given earlier. PhSeCl reacts with alkenes, in manner reminiscent of Br<sub>2</sub> described earlier. In these cases, the alkene attacks the more electropositive end of the electrophile (<i>ie</i>. selenium rather than chlorine) to form an epi-ion which can be attacked either by chloride ion or by an external nucleophile, <a href="#fig3.15">Fig. 3.15</a>. The stereochemistry of the product shows that the nucleophilic attack took place with inversion. As you might imagine, this generalised sequence gives access to a wide variety of alkanes substituted with two adjacent heteroatoms.</p>
<p class="indent">One issue that we have so far avoided is that of regiochemistry; i.e. which carbon of the unsymmetrical epi-ion <b>4</b> will be attacked by a nucleophile? Fortunately, a general rule can be formulated which states that the nucleophile will attack the <i>most</i> substituted end of the epi-ion. At first sight this may seem counterintuitive as the greater substitution at this carbon would be expected to slow down the rate of nucleophilic attack. However, one must remember that the most substituted end of the epi-ion can sustain the greater positive charge and is therefore the most attractive to nucleophiles in a S<sub>N</sub>1 like reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is only one really reliable method of oxidising alkenes to form <i>syn-</i>1,2-diols and that involves osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) as an oxidant. Both oxygens in the diol derive from one molecule of osmium tetroxide and these are delivered to the alkene in essentially one step. This addition is another classic example of a stereospecific oxidation: stereochemistry in the alkene starting material <i>(cis</i> or <i>trans)</i> is transferred to stereochemistry in the product, <a href="#fig3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>. <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Oxidation of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds</a> Contrast the <i>syn</i>&#x2013;diol product <b>5</b> with the <i>anti</i>-diol product <b>6</b> one would obtain from the same alkene by epoxidation and subsequent hydrolysis with aqueous acid.</p>
<p class="indent">Osmium tetroxide is quite expensive and so conditions were developed that enabled it to be used as a catalyst: workers at the Upjohn company found that 5 mol&#x0025; osmium tetroxide was sufficient to oxidise an alkene if a stoichiometric amount of <i>N</i>-methylmorpholine-<i>N</i>-oxide (NMO) was used to reoxidise the transition metal <i>in situ.</i> This reaction works rather well and so has become known colloquially as the Upjohn reaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It has been found that more substituted alkenes react fastest with osmium tetroxide thus leading to the notion that the oxidant plays an electrophilic role in the reaction. Approximate relative rates of reaction are RCH&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub> (1); RCH&#x003D;CHR (1.2-3); RRC&#x003D;CHR (5); R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub> (30).</p>

<p class="indent">Some years ago it was noted that an amine additive speeds up the dihydroxylation reaction by about one to two orders of magnitude: this effect is related to the fact that amines coordinate to osmium tetroxide and form (18-electron) complexes. Several amines have been examined in the role of accelerating ligand and quinuclidine is one of the best for speeding up an otherwise slow reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The exact mechanism of osmium tetroxide oxidation is a contentious one. Two schools of thought exist, one of which advocates a [3&#x002B;2] addition of OsO<sub>4</sub> to the alkene in one step&#x2014; this leads directly to an osmate ester which is hydrolysed (and oxidised) to liberate the diol, <a href="#fig3.17">Fig. 3.17</a>. Another possible mechanism involves the addition of the alkene across the osmium oxygen double bond to form an unstable osmaoxetane intermediate: this may rearrange to the same osmate ester as proposed for the [3&#x002B;2] mechanism. Recent studies have shown that both mechanisms may be operative, depending on the exact reaction conditions employed. </p>

<p class="indent">Sharpless has recently developed conditions which lead to control of the <i>enantioselectivity</i> of the dihydroxylation reaction. The accelerating effect of an amine ligand during the dihydroxylation reaction is crucial to the success of Sharpless&#x2019; chemistry. Use of a <i>chiral</i> amine enabled osmium tetroxide to add to one face of the alkene over the other, leading to diol products with high levels of enantioselectivity, <a href="#fig3.19">Fig 3.19</a>. The best chiral amines are based on two alkaloids, dihydroquinidine <b>(DHQD)</b>, which produces one enantiomer of the diol product, and dihydroquinine <b>(DHQ)</b>, which gives the other: although these amines are not enantiomers, their structures are very nearly mirror images of each other and, to all intents and purposes, they behave as enantiomers in the dihydroxylation reaction. Both <b>DHQD</b> and <b>DHQ</b> are obtained from natural sources and are readily available.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">Many alkenes have been oxidised using these conditions and generally diol products with very high enantiomeric excesses are obtained. For example, mono-, 1,1-di- and <i>trans</i>-disubstituted alkenes give diols with 90-99&#x0025; ee. Perhaps the least useful class of alkenes for this chemistry are <i>cis-</i> disubstituted alkenes which lead to poor (40&#x2013;60&#x0025; ee) levels of stereoselectivity. However, most trisubstituted and some tetrasubstituted alkenes are also good substrates and give products with very high enantiomeric purities.</p>
<p class="indent">The origins of the stereoselectivity that these chiral catalysts enforce are not confirmed, but it is clear that the (chiral) amine binds to osmium tetroxide <i>via</i> its <i>tertiary</i> amine and in so doing enables the oxidant to discriminate between the two enantiotopic faces of the alkene. Remember also that the chiral amine speeds up the reaction considerably; this means that the background reaction of osmium tetroxide on its own (which would lead to racemic products) is not competitive with the enantioselective one. The general phenomenon whereby a ligand accelerates a catalytic reaction is extremely useful in organic synthesis.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The oxidation of (E)-stilbene to the corresponding diol can be accomplished with OsO<sub>4</sub>, NMO and (DHQ)<sub>2</sub>PHAL to give the diol shown in &#x003E; 99&#x0025; ee. This reaction can be performed easily on a kilogram scale.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Singlet oxygen oxidation of dienes to 1,4-diols</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Oxygen that is present in air is a triplet diradical that participates in radical reactions with organic compounds. However, irradiation of triplet oxygen in the presence of a sensitizer generates singlet oxygen which behaves as 0&#x003D;0. So, [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with dienes generates a peroxide that is usually reduced to form a <i>cis</i>-1,4-diol, <a href="#fig3.22">Fig. 3.22</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A sensitizer is a compound that effectively absorbs the incipient light and is excited. Its excited state then transfers energy to triplet oxygen, so forming the singlet state, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The oxidation of alkenes to form ketones can be achieved by reaction with palladium(II) salts and oxygen; the name of the reaction derives from the company that developed the prototype reaction, that of ethylene to acetaldehyde. The sequence involves addition of PdCl<sub>2</sub> to an alkene in water, <a href="#fig3.23">Fig. 3.23</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">While terminal alkenes give predominantly the ketone isomer rather than the aldehyde product, such control of regiochemistry is not always easy to achieve with 1,2-disubstituted alkenes.</p>

<img src="../images/fig3.23.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.23</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, increasing substitution on the alkene seems to retard the rate of oxidation (1,2-disubstituted alkenes are approximately five times slower in the reaction than terminal alkenes). This difference in rate can be used for selective oxidation in synthesis; compound <b>7</b> was subsequently used in a synthesis of muscone, <a href="#fig3.24">Fig. 3.24</a>. </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Muscone is used in the perfumery industry and its natural source is the musk deer. Synthesis seems to offer a much better route to this compound&#x0021;</p>

<p class="indent">As the reaction proceeds, and the alkene is oxidised, palladium(II) is reduced to palladium(O). As palladium is quite expensive, a method was developed for the <i>in-situ</i> oxidation of Pd(0) back to Pd(II) so that only catalytic amounts of the transition metal are required.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Re-oxidation of Pd(0) is achieved by the addition of Cu(ll) salts and by performing the reaction in the presence of air. The following generalised reaction is thought to ensue, Pd(0) &#x002B; 2Cu(ll) &#x2192; Pd(ll) &#x002B; 2Cu(l). Fortunately, Cu(l) is then reoxidised itself back to Cu(ll) by oxygen, so continuing the cycle.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the Wacker process is a matter for debate, but it is interesting to note that deuterium-labelling studies on the ethylene to acetaldehyde reaction have shown that all four hydrogen atoms in the product originate from the starting alkene and not from the solvent. The following figure shows the key parts of one mechanism that is consistent with the labelling work, <a href="#fig3.25">Fig. 3.25</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The &#x03C0;-bonds of alkynes are reasonably susceptible to oxidation, and give products rather like those from alkenes. However, alkynes are in a higher oxidation level than alkenes and the products are going to be more highly oxidised than those from the corresponding alkene. A useful transformation is that of an alkyne into a 1,2-diketone and, while a variety of oxidants (O<sub>3</sub>, KMnO<sub>4</sub>) will accomplish this task, the mixture of RuO<sub>2</sub> (catalytic) and NaIO<sub>4</sub> appears to be the most general, <a href="#fig3.26">Fig. 3.26</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">RuO<sub>2</sub> is not the active oxidant in this reaction; rather it is oxidised by periodate to RuO<sub>4</sub> which is a powerful oxidising agent often generated <i>in situ.</i> We will come across this reagent combination later in the book.</p>
