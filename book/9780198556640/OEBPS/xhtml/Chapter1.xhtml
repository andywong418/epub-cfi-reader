<p class="noindent">If we look at the multitude of varied and interesting reactions that constitute organic chemistry, it is possible to classify a great many of them as either oxidation or reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction is a theme that runs through the very core of organic chemistry and it is difficult indeed to think of a synthesis (either in the laboratory or in nature) which does not use such a reaction at one stage or another.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1">
<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>What are oxidations and what are reductions?</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before we examine details of the oxidation and reduction process it is instructive to consider some definitions which will serve us well later on.</p>
<p class="indentt"><b>Oxidation</b> of an organic subtrate may be defined as:</p>
<p class="indent1">The addition of oxygen,</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>OR</i></p>
<p class="indent1">The removal of hydrogen,</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>OR</i></p>
<p class="indent1">The removal of electrons , from that compound.</p>
<p class="indentt">Similarly, <b>reduction</b> can be defined as:</p>
<p class="indent1">The removal of oxygen,</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>OR</i></p>
<p class="indent1">The addition of hydrogen,</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>OR</i></p>
<p class="indent1">The addition of electrons, to an organic substrate.</p>

<h3 class="h3">General introduction to oxidation states and levels</h3>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps you will have come across the concept of oxidation states in inorganic chemistry, where metals can be placed into a variety of different categories depending upon how many electronegative ligands they are bonded to. For example, the chromium in chromium trioxide is easily categorised as being in the &#x002B;6 oxidation state, while manganese in manganese dioxide is in the &#x002B;4 oxidation state. This method of characterising metals is often quite useful when examining the reactivity of various complexes. For instance, the osmium atom in osmium tetroxide is formally in the &#x002B;8 oxidation state (we assign this by giving the osmium atom &#x002B;1 for every bond to a more electronegative element). This high state means that the complex is quite likely to be a good oxidising agent as osmium can commonly exist in the &#x002B;3 or &#x002B;4 oxidation state; this is the case and osmium tetroxide is a useful oxidant which we shall come across later. However, we should not imagine that because osmium is in the &#x002B;8 oxidation state there are actually Os (8&#x002B;) <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Introduction</a> ions in solution, waiting to be reduced: if there were, then osmium tetroxide would be the world&#x2019;s best Lewis acid and this is not the case.</p>
<p class="indent">The classification of organic compounds into oxidation states is more difficult and inconsistencies abound; and although one can devise a system for achieving this classification, it is not particularly useful to organic chemists. For example, the simplest way to assign an oxidation state to a particular carbon atom is to count the ligands around it and give the carbon &#x002B;1 for every element more electronegative than carbon; 0 for every other carbon atom; -1 for every hydrogen atom. Using this system we shall consider hexane. C-1 of hexane has an oxidation state of -3 (-1 &#x002B; -1 &#x002B; -1 &#x002B; 0) while the C-2 of hexane has an oxidation state of -2 (-1 &#x002B; -1 &#x002B; 0 &#x002B; 0). Clearly there is a problem here as most organic chemists would not think of these two carbon atoms as being in different oxidation states. Therefore, we need a more flexible (and also less precise) method of classifying different carbon atoms which will be useful to us as synthetic chemists. Importantly, it should classify various carbon atoms in groups which are of similar reactivity with respect to redox reactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxidation levels in organic chemistry</h3>
<p class="noindent">Organic chemists find it convenient to place functional groups into five different categories (or levels) depending upon the level of oxidation contained within. These are rather broad definitions and there is some scope for ordering compounds within each level according to the rule described above: however, this need not concern us.</p>
<p class="indent">It should also be noted that we are concerned with ordering of functional groups themselves and that these are mostly (but not exclusively) centred around one carbon atom&#x2014; alkenes and alkynes are obvious exceptions to this. Multi-functional organic compounds may therefore contain carbon atoms which are themselves in several different oxidation levels.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1.2.1">
<p class="h4"><i>Level 0</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The lowest oxidation level for carbon is 0 (which we shall call the hydrocarbon level). The carbon of methane and each of the carbons of butane are contained within this level, <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>. Note that each carbon has <i>zero</i> bonds to elements more electronegative than itself.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1.2.2">
<p class="h4"><i>Level 1</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The next oxidation level is 1 (which we shall call the alcohol level). In this category are carbon atoms which have <i>one</i> bond to an electronegative atom, <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Introduction</a> such as alcohols, thiols, alkyl halides, alkyl nitro compounds and amines. We shall also include the alkene functional group here, <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>. It is also appropriate to include benzene as being in level 1.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The classification of alkenes in level 1 and alkynes in level 2 can seem surprising at first glance. However, consider that an alkene is readily transformed to an alcohol (level 1) under aqueous acidic conditions (of course the regiochemistry of this step depends on the alkene and the conditions used). Such addition of water constitutes neither an oxidation or a reduction (think about the elements of water, H<sub>2</sub> and O, cancelling each other out in a redox sense). The reverse process also illustrates this point as reaction of <b>1</b> with a dehydrating agent (say P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) gives an alkene. So, we can see that the alkene is equivalent to an alcohol and is rightly placed in level 1. Remember that in this case the oxidation level is equally shared between the two carbon atoms.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1.2.3">
<p class="h4"><i>Level 2</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The third oxidation level, 2 (which we shall call the ketone oxidation level), contains carbon with <i>two</i> bonds to electronegative atoms, such as acetals, thioacetals, and geminal dihalides. As an obvious extension of this, we shall also include aldehydes, ketones, and imines. This grouping also contains alkenes that are substituted with one electronegative atom, such as enol ethers; the alkyne functional group is also in this level, <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1.2.4">
<p class="h4"><i>Level 3</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Level 3 (the carboxylic acid level) contains carbon with <i>three</i> bonds to electronegative atoms and includes the carbon of CHC1<sub>3</sub>, and ortho-esters (e.g. CH(OMe)<sub>3</sub>). We shall also include esters and amides, together with imidates and nitriles here, <a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>. </p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;font-size:90%" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The same principle applies for an alkyne; clearly an alkyne is an alkene from which hydrogen has been removed (oxidation) and should therefore be in a level higher thanl. Hydration of an alkyne with aqueous mercuric chloride yields a ketone showing that level 2 is the correct one. The reverse reaction is not particularly easy to perform but it can be achieved in a few steps without either an oxidation or a reduction.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Level 4</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the most oxidised level of carbon is 4 (carbon dioxide level). Obviously, carbon bonded to <i>four</i> electronegative ligands, such as in carbon tetrachloride, is included. As long as we have four bonds to electronegative atoms, we can have a mix of singly and doubly bonded groups such as ureas (e.g. NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>), carbamates (e.g. NH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R), and carbonates (e.g. (MeO)<sub>2</sub>CO). We would also want to add cyanamide (NH<sub>2</sub>CN) to this category; finally, carbon dioxide, disulfide and oxysulfide are also included, <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.5</p>
<p class="indent">The important point to remember is that one can move <i>within</i> a particular level by performing chemistry that is classified as neither an oxidation nor a reduction. However, you will find that it is not possible to move <i>between</i> levels without performing a reduction (to move down levels) or an oxidation (to move up levels).</p>
<p class="indent">It is also essential that you understand that these levels are rather loose definitions meant as a teaching aid rather than as being a comprehensive and rigorous classification of all known organic functional groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Some examples follow to help you understand this cataloguing.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider <i>n</i>-butane, <b>2</b>, <a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>. If one were to perform a free radical chlorination then it is possible to isolate 2-chlorobutane. One carbon of the butane skeleton has now been oxidised to the alcohol level (and therefore we should consider chlorine as an oxidising agent). If we take 2-chlorobutane and react it with aqueous acid then the result is formation of 2-butanol <i>via</i> a nucleophilic substitution. We are simply moving within a level during this reaction as both starting material and product are in level 1; therefore this is not a redox reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">2-Butanol can, however, be oxidised further (change to level 2) by reaction with chromium trioxide; the product from this reaction is butanone. Note, chromium(VI) is reduced to chromium(IV) in the process. Reaction of the ketone with methanethiol and HgCl<sub>2</sub> gives the corresponding thioacetal in a reaction that maintains the oxidation level at the functionalised carbon (starting material and product are both in level 2).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig1.6">

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.6</p>
<a id="page_5" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 5, Introduction</a>
<p class="indent">Study this example and you should be able to see another guiding principle concerning redox reactions, namely that <i>for every oxidation there is a corresponding reduction in the system</i> (in step one chlorine gas is reduced to chloride and in step three chromium is reduced) and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine another set of reactions, starting with valeronitrile, <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>. Acid catalysed hydrolysis of the nitrile under standard conditions is merely a sideways move within level 3; the final step is a reduction, using LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. In fact, reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alcohol with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> shows that it is possible to jump more than one level at a time as the starting material is in level 3 and the product is in the 1 oxidation level.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig1.7">

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.7</p>
<p class="indent">The concluding example in this chapter is designed to illustrate how we can classify functional groups that span more than one carbon atom, <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>. Elimination of bromide <b>3</b> with a base is neither an oxidation nor reduction and can be seen as a sideways move within oxidation level 1. However, reaction of the product from the elimination reaction, an alkene, with bromine leads to an addition reaction that we shall discuss in more detail later. Suffice it to say at this point that the product is a vicinal dibromide <b>4</b> which is not in the same oxidation level as the alkene from which it originated&#x2014; we have performed an oxidation on the alkene (<a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>). In fact, we can classify <b>4</b> as containing one functional group (a vicinal dibromide) in the 2 oxidation level. Now, consider elimination of two moles of HBr from the dibromide (use a strong base) to form alkyne <b>5</b>. This is just a sideways move within level 2.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.8</p>
<p class="indent">We need to be careful in trying to take this idea too far: for example, it is not helpful to think of 1,3-dibromopropane in the same way as we have classified 1,2-dibromopropane. In 1,3-dibromopropane, the two functional groups behave, to all intents and purposes, independently and the molecule should be classified as having two functionalised carbons, each in level 1. On the other hand, we have seen that the two functional groups in <b>4</b> can react in unison to form an alkyne: it is this ability that makes their joint classification in level 2 possible.</p>
