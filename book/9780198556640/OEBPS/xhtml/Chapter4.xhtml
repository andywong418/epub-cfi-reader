<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters we have not really stretched the definition of oxidation fully, as we have mainly considered reaction of polarisable electrons (such as lone pairs on heteroatoms or alkene systems) with electrophilic oxidising agents, so increasing the oxygen content of the substrate. What about removal of hydrogen from an organic compound&#x2014; surely this definition of oxidation has some useful manifestations in organic synthesis? During the course of an oxidation, hydrogen can be removed in three ways, as either H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, H<sup>*</sup>, or H<sup>-</sup>; we shall cover examples of these processes in this chapter. Normally, it is beneficial to have a functional group which stabilises the carbon left behind by such removal of hydrogen; so I consider the hydrogen atom that is lost (in whatever guise) activated by the functional group.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1">
<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation adjacent to oxygen</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is the most useful and widespread area of oxidation in this chapter, as it encompasses the alcohol &#x2192; aldehyde &#x2192; carboxylic acid sequence that is used so often in synthesis.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1.1">
<h3 class="h3">Oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones</h3>
<p class="noindent">Consider the transformation of an alcohol into a carbonyl group; this reaction is loss of hydrogen (dehydrogenation) of an alcohol. And, as befits such an important reaction, there are many reagents which will achieve this oxidation: this is a good thing as it means that there are always plenty of oxidants to try when oxidising an unstable or unreactive molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#x2019;s begin with chromic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> which is made <i>in situ</i> by the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O and CrO<sub>3</sub>). This reagent is normally used in conjunction with sulfuric acid and as such this mixture is a powerful oxidant, <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The combination of CrO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and acetone solvent is called the Jones reagent. Functional groups such as alkenes, which are acid-sensitive and potentially oxidisable, are usually left untouched under these conditions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Primary alcohols are oxidised to aldehydes by the Jones reagent and secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones. Yields are variable for the first transformation because over oxidation of an aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid (RCOOH) normally occurs <i>in situ.</i> In fact it is much more common to use the Jones reagent to transform primary alcohols directly into carboxvlic acids.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig4.1">

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.1</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In general it is easier to stop the Jones oxidation of primary alcohols at the aldehyde stage if the R group in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a> is unsaturated.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_26" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 26, Oxidation of activated carbon-hydrogen bonds</a>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of this oxidation is thought to entail the initial formation of a complex between the alcohol and the chromium(VI) reagent: this is known as a chromate ester, <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>. The second stage of oxidation involves a breakdown of this complex to liberate a carbonyl compound and a reduced chromium(IV) complex.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig4.2">

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.2</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This mechanism gives us a clue as to how aldehydes are oxidised to carboxylic acids with chromic acid. Formation of a small amount of hydrate <i>in situ</i> would give a substrate which could be oxidised to an acid <i>via a</i> chromate ester.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg26.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In general, formation of the chromate ester is fast and it is the second step, the breakdown of this ester, that is rate determining. Experimentally it has been shown that more hindered secondary alcohols oxidise faster than less hindered ones: this is because hindered chromate esters collapse more quickly to relieve steric strain. Using this rationale, we can understand why, in the oxidation of secondary alcohols attached to a six-membered ring, axial alcohols (which are relatively hindered) are oxidised to ketones about three times faster than the equatorial isomers.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1.1.1">
<p class="h4"><i>Oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">So, the transformation of a primary alcohol into an aldehyde can be seen as a problem: how do we avoid over oxidation to a carboxylic acid?</p>
<p class="indent">Two solutions to this problem, based on chromium(VI) chemistry, are (i) pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) and (ii) pyridinium dichromate (PDC). Both of these reagents (used in a non-aqueous solvent such as dichloromethane) give excellent yields of ketones from secondary alcohols and aldehydes from primary alcohols. Presumably, the success of these reagents is attributable to their compatibility with anhydrous conditions where no water is present to hydrate the aldehyde product and so lead to over oxidation.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the most general solution to the problem is the Swern reaction which involves reaction of a primary alcohol with triethylamine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and oxalyl chloride (COCl)<sub>2</sub>, all at low temperature, <a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. This mixture is particularly adept at transforming primary alcohols into aldehydes. There are many good reasons for the popularity of this reaction and these include the use of mild conditions, volatile by-products and lack of over oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Both PCC and PDC can be prepared in the laboratory.</p>

<a id="page_27" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 27, Oxidation of activated carbon-hydrogen bonds</a>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the Swerm oxidation involves reaction of DMSO with oxalyl chloride to form an activated species <b>1</b>, <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>. The alcohol to be oxidised is then added to compound <b>1</b> and nucleophilic attack at the positively charged sulfur ensues to form <b>2</b>; this collapses to form the carbonyl compound. The mechanism by which <b>2</b> collapses has been shown to involve initial deprotonation adjacent to sulfur (forming ylid <b>3</b>) and subsequent intramolecular proton abstraction. Note that as the alcohol is oxidised DMSO is reduced to dimethyl sulfide (Me<sub>2</sub>S).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Another advantage of the Swem oxidation is that the formation of aldehydes with &#x03B1;-stereogenic centres takes place without appreciable rac&#x00E9;misation (this is something that can occur with other oxidising agents due to &#x00E9;nolisation under acidic or basic conditions).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The active species in the Swern reaction,<b> 1</b>, can also be prepared by the reaction of dimethyl sulfide with chlorine.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.4</p>
<p class="indent">An additional method of accomplishing the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation involves the Dess-Martin periodinane, <b>4</b> <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>. This mild oxidant is easily prepared on a large scale from o-iodobenzoic acid, potassium bromate and acetic anhydride, and is a reliable and selective reagent (for example it does not oxidise sulfides or alkenes). Using wet CH<sub>2</sub>C1<sub>2</sub> as a solvent increases the rate by which alcohols are oxidised and was essential, for example, in the oxidation of the hindered secondary alcohol <b>5</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig4.5">
<img src="../images/fig4.5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.5</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism by which the periodinane acts is not known with certainty, but involves initial exchange of an acetate ligand on iodine with the alcohol functionality to give <b>6</b>, <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>. This intermediate then collapses to form the carbonyl compound, reduced iodine compound and acetic acid.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.6</p>
<p class="indent">Another convenient method for oxidising alcohols to aldehydes or ketones utilises the perruthenate ion (RuO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>). TPAP (tetra-n-propylammonium perruthenate) is a commercially available, organic-soluble oxidant which has been used to effect oxidation in complex molecules without disturbing other functional groups, <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>. Aldehydes bearing a labile &#x03B1;-stereogenic centre can be prepared without scrambling of stereochemistry. One of the advantages of this oxidant is that it can be used as a catalyst (typically 5 mol&#x0025;) in conjunction with an excess of NMO (used to re-oxidise the ruthenium <i>in situ,</i> compare with OsO<sub>4</sub>). This reagent combination is efficient in large-scale synthesis as long as the reaction is kept free of moisture.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Ruthenium tetroxide is a particularly strong oxidising agent which frequently oxidises primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and cleaves alkenes. Perruthenate ion, which may be considered as a reduced form of RuO<sub>4</sub>, is a milder and more selective oxidising agent.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Selective oxidation of allylic and benzylic alcohols to carbonyl groups</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Manganese dioxide is a useful reagent for oxidising primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. However, under normal conditions MnO<sub>2</sub> is not sufficiently reactive to oxidise saturated alcohols and so only hydroxyl groups that are further activated by an adjacent unsaturated group (e.g. an alkene or an aromatic ring) are transformed. The resulting selectivity can be useful in organic synthesis, <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.8</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The key to a successful oxidation with manganese dioxide is the preparation of an active form prior to use. This is best done by treatment of MnO<sub>2</sub> with basic potassium permanganate, followed by heating.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The reaction has been suggested to proceed <i>via</i> formation of a manganese ester complex such as <b>7</b>, followed by hydrogen atom abstraction (i.e. a radical mechanism). Finally, cleavage of the oxygen-manganese bond provides a carbonyl compound and a reduced manganese(II) complex. Breakdown of <b>7</b> could reasonably be assumed to proceed <i>via</i> a pathway similar to that described for the collapse of chromate esters, <a href="#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>. However, radicals have been implicated in this particular reaction, thus leading to the modified <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Oxidation of activated carbon-hydrogen bonds</a> scheme shown below: whatever the precise mechanism for this step, the outcome is the same.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">If hydrogen atom abstraction were the rate-determining step in the oxidation, then we would expect it to be faster for allylic and benzylic alcohols as the incipient radical is stabilised by orbital overlap with the adjacent &#x03C0;-system. This explains the observed rate difference for such substrates. </p>

<p class="noindent">We have already seen that the Jones reagent (CrO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>) is capable of oxidising primary alcohols directly into carboxylic acids, <i>via</i> the intermediacy of an aldehyde. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to note that aldehydes themselves may be efficiently converted into carboxylic acids with a number of oxidising species (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, KMnO<sub>4</sub>).

<p class="indent">A neat method of converting aldehydes into nitriles (these can of course be hydrolysed to carboxylic acids in a separate step) involves formation of an oxime by reaction with hydroxylamine and then subsequent dehydration with acetic anhydride.

<p class="indent">Oxidation at an allylic position is a useful transformation in organic synthesis.

<p class="indent">Selenium dioxide is a unique reagent that will transform alkenes into allylic alcohols in one step, <a href="#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>. Conditions have been developed which utilise <i>t</i>-BuOOH as a re-oxidant for selenium, thus allowing the use of catalytic amounts of SeO<sub>2</sub>.

The resulting allylic radical then reacts with bromine to form an allylic <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Oxidation of activated carbon-hydrogen bonds</a> bromide plus a Br radical. The reaction is then propagated by further hydrogen atom abstraction by the bromine radical, forming HBr in the process. The scheme is completed nicely by the observation that HBr reacts with NBS to form Br<sub>2</sub>; so NBS acts as a slow releasing agent that generates a low concentration of Br<sub>2</sub> at any given time.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, these low concentrations of Br<sub>2</sub> are crucial in preventing addition of Br<sub>2</sub> to the alkene and allow allylic substitution to compete successfully. The non-polar solvent also disfavours bromination of the alkene by Br<sub>2</sub> <i>via</i> a bromonium ion (as this polar reaction gives rise to charged intermediates and, not surprisingly, these are disfavoured in CCl<sub>4</sub>).</p>

The overall equation for conversion of an amino acid (alanine is shown as an example) to a keto acid (pyruvate in this case) is illustrated below and is called transamination with glutarate/ketoglutarate as a reaction partner, <a href="#fig4.22">Fig. 4.22</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Obviously, amino acids are ingested whenever one eats protein; although the amino acid monomers from protein are recycled, excess material is degraded. Other biosynthetic pathways that require the oxidation of an amino group to a carbonyl may use similar chemistry.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The enzymes that catalyse the transamination pathway are, not surprisingly, called transamidases and they use pyridoxal phosphate as an essential co-factor. The co-factor is tightly bound by the enzyme in the active site where it can participate in the ensuing reaction. In essence, the primary amine group of an amino acid (say alanine) condenses with the aldehyde functional group of <b>9</b>, <a href="#fig4.23">Fig. 4.23</a> (compare with <a href="#fig4.21">Fig. 4.21</a>). Rearrangement ensues and the imine <b>10</b> that is so formed can then be hydrolysed to a keto&#x2013;acid (namely pyruvate).</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly, if an amino acid is oxidised then pyridoxal must be reduced (to pyridoxamine in this case). In order that pyridoxal may be used again, pyridoxamine is subsequently re-oxidised <i>in vivo</i> in another process which is essentially the reverse of <a href="#fig4.23">Fig. 4.23</a> but which involves the keto-glutarate to glutamate couple.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidation of phenols: formation of quinones</h2>
<p class="noindent">Oxidation of a phenol can give rise to a quinone <i>via</i> removal of the two hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen: this is clearly a dehydrogenation (which is one of our definitions of oxidation). The hydrogen atoms that are removed are benzylic and, therefore, activated by the aromatic ring.</p>

<p class="indent">Quinones are important compounds that are used in dyestuffs and are also found in many natural products. There are three main methods for synthesising quinones that will be considered here:</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.5.1">
<h3 class="h3">Oxidation of hydroquinones</h3>
<p class="noindent">The oxidation of 1,2- or 1,4-dihydroxybenzenes (these are also known as hydroquinones) to quinones is usually an easy oxidation to accomplish. In keeping with this observation there are many oxidants that can be used to prepare quinones. Two of the most useful are silver carbonate (silver 1&#x002B; is reduced to silver metal) and activated manganese dioxide, <a href="#fig4.24">Fig. 4.24</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.24</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, it is easier to oxidise hydroquinones that are substituted with electron-donating groups. Consequently, hydroquinones that are substituted with electron-withdrawing groups are more difficult to oxidise. Clearly, electron-deficient quinones are easily reduced to the corresponding hydroquinone and so can be used as oxidising agents themselves. For example, (excess) 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanoquinone, DDQ, <a href="#fig4.25">Fig. 4.25</a>, is capable of dehydrogenating the diol shown (-3H<sub>2</sub>) to a quinone.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Oxidative demethylation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The transformation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene into a quinone could rightly be considered in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, as it involves an oxidative cleavage of a carbon&#x2013;oxygen sigma bond; however, I have included the reaction at this juncture so that you can appreciate it as another method of forming quinones.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">CAN is a good one-electron oxidant. During this process the cerium 4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion gains an electron and is so reduced to cerium 3<sup>+</sup>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">So, reaction of <b>11</b> with ceric ammonium nitrate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> or CAN] is a useful method of forming the corresponding quinone, <a href="#fig4.26">Fig. 4.26</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The use of <sup>18</sup>O labelled water in this oxidation (<a href="#fig4.26">Fig. 4.26</a>) confirmed that the oxygen atoms on the quinone come from the water solvent and do not originate from the starting material.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of reaction involves the loss of two electrons from the aromatic ring (two molecules of CAN are reduced in this scheme) and nucleophilic attack onto the cation by two moles of water. Loss of methanol (x 2) completes the sequence and produces the quinone.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.5.1.2">
<p class="h4"><i>Oxidation with introduction of oxygen</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Phenols with one hydroxy group may also be oxidised to quinones by the introduction of another oxygen atom. The best reagent for achieving this transformation is Fremy&#x2019;s salt (<b>12</b>, <a href="#fig4.27">Fig. 4.27</a>). This stable free radical reacts with phenol to produce the corresponding 1,4-quinone (rather than the 1,2- quinone) in good yield. In terms of mechanism, the first step is presumed to be hydrogen atom abstraction by <b>12</b> to give a benzylic (and therefore stabilised) radical; this may then combine with another mole of Fremy&#x2019;s salt to give <b>13</b>. This recombination pathway occurs more readily at C-4 than at the more hindered C-2 position, <a href="#fig4.27">Fig. 4.27</a>. Finally, elimination of the electron-deficient nitrogen occurs so furnishing a quinone.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Oxidation of phenols (with Fremy&#x2019;s salt) that are blocked at the C-4 position leads to 1,2-quinones.</p>
