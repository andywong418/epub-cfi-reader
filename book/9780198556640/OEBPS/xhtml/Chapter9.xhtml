Here you will find examples of reductions which cleave purely &#x03C3;-bonds and also reactions which cleave both &#x03C3;- and &#x03C0;-bonds.</p>

<p class="noindent">Amines that are substituted with a benzyl group (Bn or PhCH<sub>2</sub>) may be broken by reduction with hydrogen and a transition metal catalyst, <a href="#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a> (the benzylic carbon&#x2013;nitrogen bonds that are cleaved are shown with a dotted line). In practice, this property of the benzyl group means that it is often used as a protecting group for amines and occasionally amides. Generally, tertiary amines are easier to deprotect this way than secondary, which in turn are more reactive than primary amines. See <a href="#fig9.5">Fig. 9.5</a> for an outline of the mechanism for removal of a benzyl group.</p>

<p class="noindent">In common with the nitrogen functionality discussed earlier, benzyl derivatives are often used as protecting groups for oxygen-based functional groups, most notably protection of alcohols as benzyl ethers and carboxylic acids as benzyl esters. Removal of these groups may be achieved by reduction with hydrogen and a transition metal catalyst (palladium on charcoal is probably the most widely used). <a href="#fig9.4">Figure 9.4</a> shows the cleavage of a benzyl ester and the double hydrogenolysis of a benzylidene acetal.</p>

<p class="indent">Hydrogenolysis is preceded by adsorption of the aromatic group onto the surface of the catalyst (of course, adsorbed hydrogen atoms are also present on this surface). Bond breaking may then occur <i>via</i> nucleophilic attack of a chemisorbed hydrogen in a manner reminiscent of an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction: this mechanism would explain why acid promotes hydrogenolysis (as it makes the heteroatom into a better leaving group) and also why some hydrogenolysis reactions proceed with inversion of configuration.</p>

This group is stable to hydrolysis and most oxidising and reducing agents: amines are normally protected by reaction with CbzCl (i.e. ClCOOCH<sub>2</sub>Ph).

<h3 class="h3">Cleavage of non-benzylic carbon-oxygen bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">So, it is relatively easy to cleave a benzylic carbon-oxygen bond. What about C-0 bonds that are not part of a benzylic system? We shall cover this topic by examining ways of deoxygenating various types of alcohols: this process illustrates the most important methods of C-0 bond cleavage and is frequently used in synthesis.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_9.2.2.1">
<p class="h4"><i>Deoxygenation of alcohols under ionic conditions</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the easiest method of deoxygenating alcohols involves formation of a good leaving group, such as a toluenesulfonate (OTs) derivative, and subsequent displacement with hydride using LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. The reaction involves nucleophilic attack of AlH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> on carbon (the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation acts as a Lewis acid to assist the toluenesulfonate group in leaving), <a href="#fig9.8">Fig. 9.8</a>. As befits an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, this process is sensitive to steric factors and works best with primary alcohols: secondary alcohols react slowly and tertiary alcohols are clearly inert to displacement and show competing elimination.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig9.8">
<img src="../images/fig9.8.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.8</p>
<p class="indent">One obvious way of deoxygenating tertiary alcohols would involve elimination to an alkene, followed by hydrogenation. However, a neat one- step procedure has been developed that uses hydride transfer from a silane (Et<sub>3</sub>SiH is often used) in the presence of acid, <a href="#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Deoxygenation of alcohols under radical conditions</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the most general method of reductive cleavage of a hydroxyl group involves radicals and is known as the Barton-McCombie reaction. First, alcohols are converted into their xanthate ester derivatives (NaH, CS<sub>2</sub>, Mel) and these are then reacted with tributyltin hydride in hot solvent such as benzene: the resulting radical chain reaction is shown in <a href="#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>. Initiators can be added to form small amounts of Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn&#x2022;, although the reaction usually proceeds without them.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig9.10">
<img src="../images/fig9.10.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.10</p>
<p class="indent">While such radical-mediated deoxygenation reactions work very well for both primary and secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols are not normally good substrates because the xanthate ester undergoes a concerted elimination (the Chugaev reaction) at the elevated temperatures required for deoxygenation with tributyltin hydride, <a href="#fig9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">An ingenious modification of the Barton&#x2013;McCombie reaction allows vicinal diols to be reduced <i>via</i> formation of a thionocarbonate, <a href="#fig9.12">Fig. 9.12</a>. Reduction of this carbonate with tributyltin hydride is rather similar to that shown earlier. In this case, after radical addition, the thionocarbonate collapses to expel the more substituted (and more stable) carbon radical and so this chemistry is a predictable method of reducing one hydroxyl group from a vicinal diol.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Deoxygenation of epoxides to alkenes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Alkenes may be produced from epoxides <i>via</i> a complete deoxygenation process; clearly this is opposite to the epoxidation of alkenes discussed in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. Bearing in mind their strong affinity for oxygen, it should come as little surprise to note that phosphorus reagents are particularly effective for deoxygenating epoxides; for example, both Ph<sub>3</sub>P and (EtO)<sub>3</sub>P will deoxygenate epoxides. A nice method of transforming epoxides to alkenes with high levels of stereospecificity was reported in the 1970s by E. Vedejs who used LiPPh<sub>2</sub> to open epoxides. Subsequent reaction <i>in situ</i> with methyl iodide (this reacts with a lone pair on phosphorus rather than the alkoxide which is stabilised by an O-Li bond) forms a betaine. Cyclisation ensues and extrusion of MePh<sub>2</sub>P&#x003D;O forms an alkene (compare with the Wittig reaction).</p>
<p class="indent">The reaction is stereospecific because the epoxide opens with strict inversion and the elimination is <i>syn</i> periplanar, see the conversion of a <i>trans-</i> epoxide into a <i>cis</i>-alkene, <a href="#fig9.13">Fig. 9.13</a> (see also <a href="Chapter2.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>, page 8). Limitations of the LiPPh<sub>2</sub> reagent are that it will react as both a nucleophile and a base with other functional groups such as esters and ketones. Sterically hindered epoxides are also slow to react under these deoxygenation conditions.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Because both the epoxidation of alkenes and the deoxygenation of epoxides are sterospecific, one can use the oxidation/reduction protocol to invert the geometry of an alkene. So, imagine converting a <i>cis</i>-alkene to <i>cis</i>-epoxide (<i>m</i>-CPBA) and thence to a frans-alkene with Ph<sub>2</sub>PLi/ Mel.</p>

<p class="indent">The difference in selectivity with DIBAL-H versus RED-Al<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> has its origins in the different complexes that each makes with the alcohol, prior to epoxide opening. For example, RED-Al<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> contains a negatively charged aluminium, like LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, and will make an ATE complex with an alcohol. This can then deliver a hydride intramolecularly to the nearest carbon atom to produce a 1,3-diol. On the other hand, DIBAL-H will form a neutral complex that cannot deliver hydride in an intramolecular fashion. Subsequent coordination of the Lewis acidic aluminium to the epoxide oxygen seems to promote regioselective intermolecular nucleophilic attack (by more DIBAL-H) at C-3 forming a 1,2-diol. The factors that give rise to this sense of regioselectivity may be stereoelectronic in origin.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Wolff-Kishner reduction is an interesting method of reducing aldehydes and ketones to methyl or methylene groups respectively. The original procedure involved reaction of a carbonyl group with hydrazine to form a hydrazone and this was then reacted with hydroxide at elevated temperatures to form the reduction product. Subsequent modifications to this protocol have enabled formation of the hydrazone <i>in situ</i> rather than in a separate step. So, the Huang-Minlon modification of the Wolff-Kishner involves reaction of a carbonyl compound, hydrazine, KOH and ethylene glycol at high temperatures, <a href="#fig9.17">Fig. 9.17</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Bearing in mind the order of reactivity mentioned earlier, it is possible to discriminate between two dissimilar halogens within the same compound, <a href="#fig9.25">Fig. 9.25</a> (the weaker carbon&#x2013;halogen bond is cleaved). Of course, it is also possible to selectively reduce halogens that give rise to stabilised radicals, see <b>12&#x2192;13.</b></p>

<h3 class="h3">Reductive fission of alkyl halides using reactive metals</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some metals are effective at reducing carbon-halogen bonds <i>via</i> electron-transfer processes. Reductive cleavage involves addition of an electron to a C&#x2013;X bond followed by cleavage to form a carbon-based radical and a halide anion, <a href="#fig9.26">Fig. 9.26</a>. Further reduction of the radical to a carbanion ensues and this may then be protonated <i>in situ.</i></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Of course, one could draw the bond cleavage (<a href="#fig9.26">Fig. 9.26</a>) to give a carbanion and X* which would then be reduced to X<sup>-</sup>. In this case it seems sensible to form the anion on the more electronegative atom (i.e. X). Although in some systems the particular mode of bond cleavage is debatable, you should remember that after addition of two electrons, the net outcome is the same.</p>

<p class="indent">Several metals are effective in this role and all are capable of being electron donors (e.g. Li, Na, Mg, Zn, Sm). So, reduction of the following organo-halogen compounds can be achieved under a variety of different conditions, <a href="#fig9.27">Fig. 9.27</a>, which all consist, essentially, of a source of electrons (the metal) combined with a source of protons (e.g. ROH, NH<sub>3</sub>, HOAc).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9.27</p>
<p class="indent">The reductive cleavage of a halogen adjacent to a carbonyl group is particularly favourable. In these cases, one may draw a mechanism which involves direct addition of electrons to the C&#x003D;O, followed by expulsion of a leaving group to form a stabilised radical. This radical can then be reduced by addition of another electron and protonation of the resulting enolate completes the sequence and forms the reduced product, <a href="#fig9.28">Fig. 9.28</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This particular reduction works well for the cleavage of a host of leaving groups other than the halogens (i.e. X&#x003D; OH, OAc, PhS).</p>

<p class="noindent">Consider the reductive cleavage of carbon&#x2013;halogen bonds shown in <a href="#fig9.27">Fig. 9.27</a>; then it should come as little surprise to note that carbon&#x2013;sulfur bonds in <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Reductive cleavage reactions</a> sulfides, sulfoxides and sulfones may also be cleaved with a reactive metal and a suitable proton source, <a href="#fig9.29">Fig. 9.29</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the best ways to completely reduce a sulfur-containing group is to use Raney nickel and <a href="#fig9.30">Fig. 9.30</a> shows the hydrogenolysis of sulfides, sulfoxides and sulfones. Raney nickel consists of fine particles of nickel metal that are prepared from a nickel/aluminium alloy that is heated with sodium hydroxide. Raney nickel of differing activity may be produced by variation in the conditions used during preparation. Although active Raney nickel will reduce carbon&#x2013;carbon multiple bonds, one can often cleave carbon&#x2013;heteroatom bonds without hydrogenation by using a deactivated form of the catalyst.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The preparation of Raney nickel leaves the metal with hydrogen already adsorbed onto the surface. Therefore, reactions using this catalyst need not be performed under an atmosphere of hydrogen.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Conversion of a carbonyl group to a thioacetal, followed by hydrogenolysis with Raney nickel, is another way to completely reduce a C&#x003D;O under essentially neutral conditions (compare with the basic conditions of the Wolff-Kishner and the acidic conditions of the Clemmensen reduction).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The reductive cleavage of carbon-selenium bonds can also be accomplished with Raney nickel.</p>

<p class="indent">This reaction works best if the radical formed from C&#x2013;S bond cleavage is tertiary or stabilised by conjugation. The mechanism for the reduction is analogous to that shown earlier for reduction of carbon&#x2013;halogen bonds.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reductive cleavage of cyclopropane rings</h2>
<p class="noindent">The partial &#x03C0;-character of C&#x2013;C bonds within cyclopropane rings means that they may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis, <a href="#fig9.32">Fig. 9.32</a>. With alkyl substituents present on the ring, it tends to be the least hindered bond that is broken; this regioselectivity can be used to prepare geminal dimethyl groups.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig9.32">
<img src="../images/fig9.32.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.32</p>
<p class="indent">It has been postulated that rupture of the cyclopropane ring takes place on the catalyst surface and a doubly adsorbed species is formed. Presumably, transfer of hydrogen from the metal to the carbons ensues to form the geminal dimethyl group.</p>
<p class="indent">Cyclopropanes that are activated by virtue of being adjacent to a carbonyl group can also be cleaved with reactive metals such as sodium or lithium in ammonia, <a href="#fig9.33">Fig. 9.33</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig9.33">
<img src="../images/fig9.33.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.33</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism probably starts with addition of an electron to the electron-deficient carbonyl group to form a radical anion; this may then cleave to expel a carbon-based radical and form an enolate, <a href="#fig9.34">Fig. 9.34</a>. Under these reducing conditions, the carbon-based radical will be reduced further to an anion and, finally, protonation of both the anion and the enolate (either <i>in situ</i> or with an external proton quench) forms the observed product.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In some cases, the most substituted cyclopropane bond is cleaved during ring opening, forming the most stable radical. However, other factors may influence the regioselectivity of this ring cleavage, most notably the ease of overlap between the rc-system of the radical anion and the relevant orbitals of the cyclopropane, see <b>14</b>&#x2192;<b>15</b>.</p>
