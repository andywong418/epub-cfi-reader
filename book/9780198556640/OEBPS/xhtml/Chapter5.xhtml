<p class="noindent">In this chapter we shall concentrate on reactions which lead to cleavage of carbon-carbon single (and multiple) bonds and the introduction of new bonds between carbon and an electronegative element, such as oxygen. For completeness we will also consider a similar process which leads to the cleavage of bonds between carbon and other electropositive elements such as boron or silicon.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxidative cleavage of alkenes using ozone</h3>
<p class="indent">Clipping an alkene to furnish two carbonyl compounds is most readily carried out with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>): the four substituents that were attached to the alkene end up as substituents on the two new carbonyl containing compounds. This reagent is extremely specific for alkenes and so ozonolysis can be performed on multi-functional compounds without fear of oxidising (for example) alcohols, esters or aromatic rings, <a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Cleavage of an alkene takes place in two stages: first, the alkene (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> or MeOH are good solvents) is cooled to low temperature and ozone is passed through the solution. This gives rise to an ozonide (<i>vide infra</i>) which is then decomposed in a separate step using dimethylsulfide.</p>
</aside>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.1</p>
<p class="indent">Ozone is an electrophilic reagent and so reacts fastest with electron-rich alkenes. However, the differences in rate for ozonolysis of alkenes with varying numbers of alkyl groups are small and it is not usually possible to distinguish between them. What is possible, however, is the oxidation of an alkyl-substituted alkene in the presence of a carbonyl-substituted (and therefore very electron-deficient) alkene, <a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig5.2">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.2</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism by which alkenes react with ozone has been studied in some detail, <a href="#fig5.3">Fig 5.3</a>. In the first stage, ozone participates in a cycloaddition reaction with the alkene. This pericyclic reaction involves four &#x03C0; electrons <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Oxidative cleavage reactions</a> from ozone and two from the alkene and is therefore allowed under the Woodward-Hoffmann rules (as long as it is suprafacial). And, as ozone is a [1,3] dipole, the reaction may be classified as a [1,3] dipolar cycloaddition. The resulting complex (primary ozonide) is unstable and collapses <i>via</i> another pericyclic reaction; this time it is a reverse [1,3] cycloaddition which cuts the ozonide in another way. A carbonyl compound and a carbonyl ylid are formed by this path and these may combine with either the solvent, path A, or with each other, path B.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig5.3">
<img src="../images/fig5.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.3</p>
<p class="indent">The peroxides and secondary ozonide formed by this mechanism are almost never isolated but instead are decomposed <i>in situ</i> by the addition of dimethyl sulfide (Me<sub>2</sub>S) or trimethyl phosphite ([MeO]<sub>3</sub>P), <a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>. In this process either the sulfur or the phosphorus additive is oxidised and the ozonide or peroxide reduced to the corresponding carbonyl compound.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig5.4">
<img src="../images/fig5.4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.4</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to decompose secondary ozonides in a variety of ways. For example, reaction with sodium borohydride, instead of Me<sub>2</sub>S, reduces the ozonide to give alcohols, <a href="#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>. Conversely, one can also cleave certain ozonides by oxidising them with hydrogen peroxide to form carboxylic acids.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxidative cleavage of aromatic rings</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already come across ruthenium tetroxide as a powerful oxidant capable of transforming alkynes into 1,2-diketones. This oxidant will also <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Oxidative cleavage reactions</a> cleave alkenes in a manner reminiscent of ozone (remember that RuO<sub>4</sub> is made <i>in situ</i> by the oxidation of <b>RuCl<sub>3</sub> </b>or RuO<sub>2</sub> with NaIO<sub>4</sub>). Another useful oxidation that ruthenium tetroxide promotes is the cleavage of aromatic rings to yield carboxylic acids: both carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic rings can be cleaved, <a href="#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>. Clearly, this cleavage reaction cannot be performed in the presence of other easily oxidisable groups such as alkenes or alcohols.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Cleavage of 1,2-diols using periodate</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">1,2-Diols can be oxidatively cleaved to carbonyl compounds by sodium periodate in methanol (sometimes periodic acid H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub> is used instead). This reaction is mild, high yielding and extremely specific for diols that are adjacent to each other, so making it useful in organic synthesis, <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>. It does not matter if the diol unit is part of a ring or not: cleavage occurs just the same. Imagine cleaving a polyhydroxylated substrate (such as the carbohydrate glucose) with excess periodate, <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>. Each 1,2-diol will be cleaved and then each &#x03B1;-hydroxy carbonyl group will be cleaved again&#x2014; this method is, therefore, one of the best ways of selectively degrading sugars.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">You have seen NalO<sub>4</sub> before, as a reagent for oxidising sulfides to sulfoxides and selenides to selenoxides. Unfortunately, these easily oxidisable groups will interfere with the diol cleavage reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism of such cleavage reactions involves formation of a chelate between the periodate and the diol; this may then collapse as shown, forming two carbonyl compounds and reducing iodine in the process, <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>.

<p class="h4"><i>Formation and cleavage of 1,2-diols in one step</i></p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that <i>cis-</i> 1,2-diols are easy to make from alkenes using osmium tetroxide (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). If we combine osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate in one reaction vessel then an interesting reaction ensues First, osmium tetroxide transforms the alkene into a 1,2-diol and, second periodate cleaves the 1,2-diol into a dicarbonyl compound (as described above <a href="#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>). Even better is the fact that catalytic osmium tetroxide can be usec in this sequence because the periodate acts as a re-oxidant for the osmium regenerating osmium tetroxide <i>in situ.</i> So, we can consider the mixture ol osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate as an alternative to ozonolysis.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Lead tetraacetate is another reagent that will cleave 1,2-diols and is often used instead of periodate. Although the mechanism by which it acts is probably similar, it is less important that the diol forms a chelate and so compound 1 <i>would</i> be cleaved slowly into a diketone with this reagent.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Cleavage of carbon-carbon single bonds adjacent to a carbonyl group (the Baeyer-Villiger reaction)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a peracid results in an oxidative cleavage of one of the substituents attached to the carbonyl group; this is known as the Baeyer-Villiger reaction. <i>m</i>-CPBA or trifluoroperacetic acic (CF<sub>3</sub>COOOH) are the best known reagents and the latter is particularly effective at oxidising unreactive substrates.</p>

<a id="page_41" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 41, Oxidative cleavage reactions</a>
<p class="indent">In order to understand how more complex systems behave, it is instructive to consider the mechanism of the oxidation. It is clear that the reason behind the specific cleavage of sigma bonds adjacent to carbonyls is related to the fact that peracids can act as nucleophiles towards the C&#x003D;O group, <a href="#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>. As one would expect, formation of the adduct <b>2</b> is preceded by initial protonation of the carbonyl group (so increasing its electrophilicity). Now comes the step that actually cleaves the carbon-carbon sigma bond; this involves the lone pair on the hydroxyl group of <b>2</b> assisting a carbon atom to migrate towards the peroxide linkage. In so doing, the weak O-O bond is cleaved and a stabilised oxy-anion formed as a leaving group. In fact it is accepted that the migration step is rate determining and this explains why CF<sub>3</sub>COOOH, which leads to the expulsion of a particularly stable leaving group CF<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>, is so good at promoting the reaction.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.11</p>
<p class="indent">What happens when we oxidise unsymmetrical ketones using the Baeyer-Villiger reaction? Clearly two products are possible, depending upon which carbon atom migrates. Consider oxidation of <i>t</i>-butylethyl ketone <b>3</b>, <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>. Migration of the ethyl group would lead to compound <b>4</b>, and migration of the <i>tert</i>-butyl group to <b>5</b>. Fortunately, the migration process is a rather predictable one and an order of migrating group ability has been constructed. This order places <i>more-substituted</i> carbon as the <i>best</i> migrating group and CH<sub>3</sub> as the worst migrating group (tertiary carbon &#x003E; secondary &#x2248; aryl &#x003E; primary &#x003E; methyl). This means that <b>5</b> would be the expected product from the reaction shown in <a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>, and this is indeed the case.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This mechanism is supported by the oxidation of <sup>18</sup>O labelled benzophenone. The product ester incorporates the label exclusively in the doubly bonded oxygen.</p>

<p class="indent">Several examples of this type of selectivity are shown in <a href="#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13</a> where you can see a phenyl group competing for migration (and winning) over that of a methyl and an ethyl group (Ph &#x003E; Me, Ph &#x003E; Et). However, as the phenyl group is approximately equal in migrating ability to an <i>iso</i>-propyl group, mixtures are formed (Ph ~ <i>i</i>-Pr) and, indeed, the <i>tert</i>-butyl group is even better at migrating than a phenyl (<i>t</i>-Bu &#x003E; Ph). Moreover, aldehydes normally react <i>via</i> hydrogen migration, thus forming a carboxylic acid in the process. </p>

</figure>
<p class="caption" id="fig5.13">Fig. 5.13</p>
<p class="indent">The reason behind the order of migratory aptitude is unclear. It appears that more substituted carbons migrate (to an electron-deficient oxygen) because they can better sustain a partial positive charge (remember that tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary, etc.). Moreover, it is likely that the regiochemistry of rearrangement is influenced by the greater relief of steric strain that accompanies migration of a bulky group and also by stereoelectronic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">What happens if the carbon that migrates is a stereogenic centre? Again, this aspect of the Baeyer-Villiger reaction has been studied in some detail and carbon migrates with retention of configuration, <a href="#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>. Although stabilisation of positive charge is important, simplistically, carbon migrates with its pair of electrons. So, for example, in the oxidation of <b>6</b>, the carbon that migrates keeps its substituents in the same configuration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidative cleavage of carbon-boron and carbon-silicon bonds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Bonds between boron (and silicon) and carbon may also be cleaved oxidatively in a process that is rather similar to the Baeyer&#x2013;Villiger reaction. Remember that both boron and silicon are more electropositive elements than carbon and so we can consider the transformation of C&#x2013;B (and C&#x2013;Si) into C&#x2013;0 as an oxidation.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common way to make C&#x2013;B bonds is to add the H&#x2013;B bond across an alkene (hydroboration with BH<sub>3</sub>). Reaction of the products from a hydroboration reaction with alkaline hydrogen peroxide causes the C&#x2013;B bond to rupture and migrate onto oxygen, <a href="#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is interesting to note that the sequence of hydroboration followed by hydrogen peroxide treatment does not constitute either an oxidation or a reduction (both starting material and product are in oxidation level 1). We can consider this two-step process as a reduction (addition of B-H, to be covered later on) followed by an oxidation, which gives no overall change in oxidation level.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The cleavage reaction is initiated by attack of <sup>-</sup>OOH on boron (the nucleophile can add to the empty p-orbital on boron). The resulting complex is negatively charged and, in order for the boron to regain neutrality, a carbon attached to the boron undergoes migration onto the peroxide linkage, displacing <sup>-</sup>OH in the process. Hydrolysis of the resulting boron-oxygen bond occurs readily and the product is an alcohol. </p>
<a id="page_43" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 43, Oxidative cleavage reactions</a>
<p class="indent">The carbon-boron bond can be oxidised further than an alcohol and directly into a carbonyl group by reaction with a stronger oxidant than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, namely chromic acid (H<sub>3</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>), <a href="#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Carbon-silicon bonds may also be cleaved oxidatively in a manner similar to boron. In order for the reaction to work, it is necessary to have an electronegative substituent (such as oxygen or fluorine) on the silicon to increase its electrophilicity. So, compound <b>7</b> cannot be cleaved to the alcohol until the phenyl group on silicon has been replaced by a fluorine by protodesilylation with HBF<sub>4</sub>, <a href="#fig5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>. A plausible mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of the anion of <i>m</i>-CPBA onto the electrophilic silicon atom. This process generates a negatively charged ATE complex of silicon. In a reaction reminiscent of that described for the oxidation of C&#x2013;B bonds, the carbon attached to silicon migrates onto the peroxide linkage, displacing a carboxylate leaving group and restoring electrical neutrality to silicon. Hydrolysis of the oxygen&#x2013;silicon bond occurs readily to yield the alcohol product.</p>

<p class="noindent">A useful method of oxidising carbon-halogen bonds involves reaction of alkyl halides with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of a base (usually NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or Et<sub>3</sub>N): this is known as the Kornblurn oxidation, <a href="#fig5.17">Fig. 5.17</a>. In the reaction shown, benzyl bromide (carbon in oxidation level 1) is oxidised to benzaldehyde (level 2). The reaction initiates with nucleophilic attack by the sulfoxide oxygen onto the carbon-halogen bond in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. You have seen the product of this displacement <b>8</b> before&#x0021; It is a sulfonium ion, last seen as an intermediate in the Swern oxidation (<a href="Chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). Not surprisingly, <b>8</b> collapses to give a carbonyl compound and dimethyl sulfide&#x2014; deprotonation is effected by the base which is added to the system.</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.17</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is instructive to consider the fate of the DMSO used in the reaction. <a href="#fig5.17">Fig. 5.17</a> shows that it is reduced to dimethylsulfide as the alkylhalide is oxidised. There is no reason why we should not think of this reaction as a method of reducing sulfoxides to sulfides&#x0021;</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If we are to expect the Kornblurn reaction to work well then it is clear that the alkylhalide used must be able to undergo displacement easily; consequently this oxidation is effective at transforming activated alkylhalides (i.e. carbon-halogen bonds adjacent to alkenes, arenes and carbonyl compounds) into aldehydes and ketones. A modification of the reaction, reported by Kornblurn, involves treatment of a primary, unactivated, alkylhalide with silver tosylate (presumably to first make the corresponding tosylate), followed by DMSO and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> as before, <a href="#fig5.18">Fig. 5.18</a>.</p>
