<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Tony Cox presents a clearly written, basic introduction to <i>Quantum Theory</i>&#x2014;a subject which underpins the thinking behind all modern physical chemistry. The book explains in simple terms those basic ideas of quantum theory and its applications in describing the structure of atoms which are essential knowledge for any undergraduate chemist. This primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
