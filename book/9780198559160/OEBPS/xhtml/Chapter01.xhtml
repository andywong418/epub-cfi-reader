<h1 class="main"><b>1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Electromagnetic Waves and photons</b></h1>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">What we call <i>classical physics</i> is a body of ideas that developed slowly during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It deals with diverse phenomena, including the motion of material bodies according to Newton&#x2019;s Laws, and the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and waves, such as light. These are linked by some central concepts. Physical systems possess energy, the amount of which is conserved as it passes between different forms. In classical physics there is no restriction on the value of the energy of systems. Another central assumption is that of strict <i>determinism</i>: classical systems follow precise mathematical laws, so that if we have enough information about their present state, we can predict as accurately as we like what will happen to them in the future.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;">The word <i>quantum</i> is originally Latin, meaning <i>how much?</i> Its plural is <i>quanta</i>.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">By the year 1900, it was possible to believe that physics was almost fully understood. Certainly, there were a few small gaps. The nature of atoms and molecules was still mysterious, and so were the ways in which radiation interacts with matter. But to many physicists these appeared to be minor details, easy to fill in when more information was available, and not likely to entail major new ideas. Within a few years, however, this optimistic view was shattered. The &#x2018;small gaps&#x2019; came to seem fundamental, and a radically new theory was required to fill them. One discovery was that the energy in a system may be restricted to certain discrete values, rather than the unrestricted range allowed in classical theory. The idea of a <i>quantum</i>&#x2014;a certain definite amount of energy&#x2014;was to provide the name for the new theory. As the understanding of energy quanta developed, other classical concepts also had to be abandoned or modified. The clear distinction between material bodies with definite positions, and waves spread out in space, was one such casualty. The most fundamental change of all was that the strict determinism of classical physics no longer applies in the quantum theory. Systems change in ways which cannot be predicted precisely; only the probability of different events can be predicted. A familiar example is the radioactive decay of an atom. Although we may know the probability that a given atom will decay in a given time, the quantum theory denies the possibility of ever being able to predict exactly <i>when</i> it will decay.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Classical physics remains an excellent approximation to much of the behaviour of bodies on a macroscopic scale. It is in the microscopic realm that the quantum theory is essential. The behaviour of electrons in atoms and molecules, and the nature of the chemical bond, are among the problems that classical physics is unable to describe. It was only following the development of the quantum theory that chemists could really use physical ideas to provide a satisfactory understanding of their own problems. <a id="page_2" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 2, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:1.5em;">There are several reasons for starting this account with a discussion of electromagnetic radiation. Historically, it was in this area that the quantum theory first developed. It is easier here to understand the evidence for the theory, and to appreciate some of its paradoxical consequences, than it is in the quantum theory of matter. The applications of the <i>light-quantum hypothesis</i>, as it was first called, also provide key pieces of evidence for the quantization of energy in atoms and molecules. Studies of the absorption and emission of radiation&#x2014;the field of <i>spectroscopy</i>&#x2014;and of the effect of light on chemical reactions&#x2014;<i>photochemistry</i>&#x2014;are very important areas of modern chemistry, in which the quantum nature of radiation is crucial.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This section reviews some basic ideas on the properties of waves, and is an introduction to the wave properties of radiation discussed later.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Basic formulae and definitions</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:.5em;">A wave is a disturbance which travels and spreads out through some medium. Examples include ripples on the surface of water, vibrations in a string, and vibrating electric and magnetic fields (light waves). The wave disturbance can take many mathematical forms, but the simplest is the sinusoidal wave shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig11">Fig. 1.1</a>. This illustrates how the displacement of the medium (<i>y</i>) varies with position (<i>x</i>) at three successive times.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">At any particular time, the displacement varies with position according to</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Superposition and interference</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:em;">Suppose that the waves reaching some point in space originate from two different sources. The <i>principle of superposition</i> states that the total wave displacement at that point is the sum of those caused by each individual wave. As a first example, consider the situation where a wave is reflected back on itself. The reflected wave has an equation similar to <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-3">eqn 1.3</a>, but with the sign of <i>x</i> changed, corresponding to a reverse direction of travel. The combined (forward plus reflected) wave displacement is therefore</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:1em;">The wave described by <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-6">eqn 1.6</a> is different from that discussed above. The displacement varies sinusoidally in space and time, but the positions of maximum and minimum displacement do not move. It is known as a <i>standing wave</i>, as opposed to the travelling wave illustrated in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig11">Fig. 1.1</a>. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig12">Figure 1.2</a> shows a standing wave at three successive times. The points of zero displacement are called <i>nodes</i>, and those where the displacement is maximum, <i>antinodes</i>. Standing waves are formed in vibrating strings which are fixed at one or more points. They form the basis for musical instruments</p>

<figcaption style= "margin-left:0em; text-align:left;width:85%; margin-top: 0.5em;"><b>Fig. 1.3</b> Illustrating the interference of two waves, spreading from different centres. Light and dark rings represent the &#x2018;crests&#x2019; and &#x2018;troughs&#x2019; of each wave. Regions of constructive interference (where crests of each wave coincide) and of destructive interference (where crests of one wave overlap with troughs of the other) can be seen.</figcaption>
</figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A second example of the superposition principle is the phenomenon of wave interference. This is illustrated qualitatively in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig13">Fig. 1.3</a>, in a two-dimensional picture of waves spreading from two different centres. The light and dark circles represent the peaks and troughs of the waves at one moment in time. In some places the waves are in phase with each other, with peaks and troughs coinciding. This is <i>constructive interference</i>; where the total amplitude is the sum of those from each wave. At other places, however, the waves are out of phase, with peaks of one coinciding with troughs of the other. In this situation of <i>destructive interference</i>, the total amplitude is the sum of terms of different sign, and will be zero if the two individual amplitudes are equal. <a id="page_4" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 4, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electromagnetic waves</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This section reviews the evidence for the wave nature of light and of X-rays, and then puts these two forms of radiation into the context of electromagnetic radiation in general.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>The wave nature of light</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">In the seventeenth century Newton argued that light was composed of particles, whereas Huygens favoured a wave theory. During the following two centuries an overwhelming body of experimental evidence appeared to show that Huygens was correct, because light was found to display the interference effects expected for waves. One of the simplest such experiments is that of <i>Young&#x2019;s slits</i>, illustrated in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig14">Fig. 1.4</a>. Light from a source passes through the very narrow slit <i>S</i><sub>1</sub><i></i> in the first screen, to the second screen containing two closely spaced slits <i>S</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>3</sub>. When it reaches the third screen, it does not illuminate this equally, but produces a series of light and dark bands, or &#x2018;fringes&#x2019;.</p>
<figure class="figure-bh" id="fig14">
<img src="../images/fig1.4.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-left:4.6em;"/>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:2em;width:89%;"><b>Fig.1.4</b> A schematic representation of the Young&#x2019;s slits experiment. Light coming through the narrow slit <i>S</i><sub>1</sub><i></i> then passes through both of the closely spaced slits <i>S</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> The intensity of light reaching the screen on the right varies periodically with position, as illustrated.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:1.5em;">The only reasonable interpretation of this observation is that it is an interference effect shown by waves. Light reaches the final screen from two sources, <i>S<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>3</sub></i> in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig14">Fig. 1.4</a>. At some points on the screen, the two sets of waves are in phase, and interfere constructively giving high intensity; at other points they are out of phase, and their destructive interference gives low intensity. A more quantitative analysis can be made, using the dimensions shown in<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig14"> Fig. 1.4</a>. From Pythagoras&#x2019; theorem, we have</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Now <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-8">eqn 1.8</a> gives the difference of path length in the light coming from either slit <i>S</i><sub>2</sub><i></i> or <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> to a point on the screen. If the light waves emerging from these slits are in phase, then they will also be in phase at the screen if the path difference is a whole number of wavelengths, i.e.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Half-way between these positions, the path length will differ by an odd number of half wavelengths, and destructive interference will occur.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">It can be seen that if the dimensions of the apparatus are known, the spacing between the light and dark regions on the screen allows the wavelength of light to be determined. There are, however, two further requirements for the experiment to be successful, and they reinforce the interpretation. Firstly, the slits must all be very narrow. This means that all light reaching <i>S</i><sub>2</sub><i></i> or <i>S</i><sub>3</sub><i></i> from <i>S</i><sub>1</sub><i></i> has essentially the same path length. Secondly, for best effect, the light source must be <i>monochromatic</i>, producing light all of the same colour, and hence wavelength. With ordinary &#x2018;white light&#x2019; containing different wavelengths, the interference fringes coming from each wavelength will be in different places.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A wide variety of interference effects have been observed, some of which can be used for more accurate measurements than Young&#x2019;s slits. The experiments all demonstrate the wave nature of light, and show that the wavelength varies from 750 nm at the red end of the visible spectrum to 400 nm at the violet end. Knowing the velocity of light, <i>c</i> = 2.998 <b>&#x00D7;</b> 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the frequency can be worked out using <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-4">eqn 1.4</a>. It is extremely high, around 5 <b>&#x00D7;</b> 10<sup>14</sup>Hz. These very short wavelengths, and high frequencies, explain why the wave properties of light are not apparent in everyday life.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;">1 nm (called one <i>nanometre</i>) is 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> m, the normal unit used for the wavelength of visible light. For much shorter wavelengths the <i>picometre</i> (1 pm = 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup> m) and for longer wavelengths the <i>micrometre</i> or <i>micron</i> (1 mm<i> =</i>10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> m) are more appropriate. Some books use the non-SI <i>&#x00E5;ngstr&#x00F6;m unit(</i>&#x00C5;<i></i>), equal to 10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>m.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1em;margin-top:0.2em;">The <i>hertz</i> (Hz) is the normal unit of frequency, equal to one complete oscillation per second.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Radiation of longer and shorter wavelengths than those of visible light, known as infrared and ultraviolet respectively, was also discovered in the nineteenth century. Before putting these types of radiation in context, however, it is interesting to discuss another type, X-rays. <a id="page_6" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 6, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>X-ray diffraction</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">X-rays were discovered by Roentgen in 1895, using an apparatus which is essentially similar to that used today (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig15">Fig. 1.5</a>). Electrons are accelerated to high energy in a vacuum, and hit a metal anode. The X-rays produced pass through the walls of the vacuum tube, and can be detected by a photographic plate or some other means.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">As suggested by the name given to them, the nature of X-rays at first caused puzzlement. Their facility in passing through solid matter, and the fact that they are not deflected in electric fields, suggested that they carried no electric charge. Some of their properties, especially their ability to cause ionization of gases and solids (see below, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>) suggested a particle nature. It was discovered, however, that when scattered by crystals they showed <i>diffraction</i>, an interference phenomenon similar to that occurring with light. This shows that they must have wave properties, with wavelengths comparable to the spacing between atoms.</p>

A collimated (i.e. parallel) beam of X-rays hits a powdered sample, and X-rays scattered at different angles are detected.

<p class="indent3-ka1">If the interatomic distances in a crystal are known, diffraction experiments enable one to determine the wavelength of X-rays. They depend on the metal used for the anode of the X-ray tube: with copper, for example, a common source for diffraction experiments, a major part of the radiation emitted has a wavelength of 154 pm. This is 5000 times smaller than the wavelength of red light, and serves to illustrate the wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Crystal diffraction can be used to select X-rays of a required wavelength, but more often nowadays, the principle is used in reverse: knowing the wavelength of X-rays, the structures of crystals may be determined. The detailed principles involved are more complicated than discussed here, but X-ray diffraction is the single most important technique used to determine chemical structures.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>The electromagnetic spectrum</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0.3em;">Visible light and X-rays form two parts of a spectrum of radiation, which extends from very small wavelengths to very large ones. All these waves travel at the same velocity in a vacuum, although passing through matter slows them down to varying extents. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig18">Figure 1.8</a> shows the range of wavelengths and frequencies (related according to <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-4">eqn 1.4</a>), and the names given to radiation in different ranges. These types of radiation are produced in very different ways, and have very different properties. At the low-frequency (radio and microwave) end of the spectrum, oscillating fields can be deliberately produced at the appropriate frequency by electronic circuits. Shorter wavelengths correspond to frequencies which are much too high to produce or measure directly. Infrared and visible radiation is emitted by hot objects (e.g. filaments in electric light bulbs). Visible and ultraviolet radiation is produced in some chemical reactions, and also by passing electric discharges through gases. X-rays, as discussed above, are emitted when high-energy electrons hit solids. At the short-wavelength end, &#x03B3; radiation is produced in radioactive decay processes, when atomic nuclei disintegrate.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The emission of radiation by a hot body is particularly interesting. The distribution of wavelengths emitted depends to some extent on the composition, as different materials have differing abilities to absorb and emit particular wavelengths. Physicists imagine, however, an idealized case, known as a <i>black body</i>, which is able to absorb and emit all radiation equally well. Some familiar objects approximate to such a black body. They include the Sun (which of course is not at all &#x2018;black&#x2019; in the normal sense, as being very hot it emits an enormous amount of radiation). The distribution of radiation emitted by a black body depends only on its temperature. The <a id="page_8" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 8, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a>general form is shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig19">Fig. 1.9</a>. The wavelength scale depends on the temperature, and in fact the maximum in the distribution is at a wavelength (<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msub><mi>&#x03BB;</mi><mrow><mi>max</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) related to the absolute temperature by <i>Wien&#x2019;s Law</i>,</p>

A significant amount of radiation also falls outside the visible range, extending into the infrared and (to a smaller extent) the ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The Earth also emits radiation, but being much colder, this is at longer wavelengths. With an average surface temperature of 288 K (15&#x00B0;C), Wien&#x2019;s Law predicts at 10 &#x03BC;m, in the infrared. In fact much of the radiation emitted from the surface is absorbed by molecules (CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour) in the atmosphere. This leads to a more complicated emission spectrum, but the general principles of black-body radiation are nevertheless crucial in understanding the &#x2018;greenhouse effect&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">By the end of the nineteenth century it was realized that the wave theory of electromagnetic radiation could not by itself explain the form of the black-body radiation shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig19">Fig. 1.9</a>. In particular, it was predicted that the energy distribution should rise indefinitely as the wavelength became shorter, rather than falling to zero as found. This alarming prediction, known as the <i>ultraviolet catastrophe</i>, gave the first serious clue that the theory was in need of modification.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photons</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0.3em;">In 1900 Max Planck proposed a solution to the problem of black-body radiation described above. He suggested that when electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, energy can only be absorbed or emitted in certain discrete amounts, called <i>quanta</i>. Planck&#x2019;s theory will not be described here, as it is highly technical. In any case, Planck&#x2019;s proposal was timid compared with the theory that followed. He supposed that quanta were only important in absorption and emission of radiation, but that otherwise the wave theory did not need to be modified. It was Einstein who took a more radical step in 1905 (the year in which he published his first paper on the theory of relativity and on several other unrelated topics). Einstein&#x2019;s analysis of the <i>photoelectric effect</i> is crucial, and has led to a complete change in the way we think of light and other radiation.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>The photoelectric effect and Einstein&#x2019;s interpretation</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">When radiation of sufficiently short wavelength interacts with matter, electrons are emitted. This is the <i>photoelectric effect</i>. It can be observed in gases and solids, and with X-rays and &#x03B3;<i></i> rays, as well as with ultraviolet radiation. It was the phenomena observed with short-wavelength visible and ultraviolet radiation on solids, however, which were known in 1905. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig110">Figure 1.10</a> shows the apparatus used. Light or UV radiation falls on one electrode in an evacuated tube. If electrons are emitted, some will reach the second <a id="page_9" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 9, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a>electrode, and a small current can be measured. By applying a negative electric potential to the second electrode, or better, to a metal grid between the two electrodes as shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig110">Fig. 1.10</a>, electrons are repelled. Only electrons emitted with an energy greater <i>eV</i>, where <i>e</i> is the magnitude of the charge on an electron and <i>V</i> the negative potential, will reach the second electrode and so contribute to the current. By this means both the number of electrons can be measured (from the current) and their maximum energy (from the potential required to cut off the current). The following facts are observed:</p>
<p class="list2">(a) The emission of electrons begins immediately on illumination, without any period of delay.</p>
<p class="list2">(b) Increasing the intensity of illumination increases the number of electrons emitted, but has no effect on their energies.</p>
<p class="list2">(c) Decreasing the wavelength of radiation used increases the energies of electrons emitted.</p>
<p class="list2">(d) For wavelengths longer than a certain threshold (the value of which depends on the composition of the electrode), no electrons are emitted.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Viewed in the context of the wave theory of radiation, these observations raise some very difficult questions. If the energy in the radiation is spread out over the waves, how can one electron, in a tiny volume of space, gain enough energy to escape from the solid? Why is there no delay period while enough energy is accumulated? Why are not all electrons affected equally, to a much smaller extent? Why does the wavelength of radiation matter? To Einstein, these questions suggested a new theory. Based on Planck&#x2019;s idea, but going further, he suggested that the energy in light is not uniformly spread out as the wave theory suggests, but is concentrated in discrete units. He called these units <i>light quanta</i>, but we now use the word <i>photon</i>, coined by the chemist G. N. Lewis in 1922, to describe them. The energy in each photon is related to the wavelength and hence frequency of the radiation, through the equation</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;" id="eqn1-12"><span class="equno">(1.12)</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><math display='block' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mi>E</mi><mtext>&#x2003;</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>&#x2003;</mtext><mi>h</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow></math></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">where <i>v</i> is the frequency, and <i>h</i> is <i>Planck&#x2019;s constant</i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Using <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-12">eqn 1.12</a>, and the principle of energy conservation, the photoelectric effect can be explained without difficulty. Let &#x03A6; be the minimum energy required to liberate an electron from a particular solid, a quantity known as the <i>work function</i>. Then if each photon transmits its energy to just one electron, the maximum emitted energy must be</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;" id="eqn1-13"><span class="equno">(1.13)</span></p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This explains the observations concerning the wavelength of radiation used: shorter wavelengths, hence higher frequencies, give higher energies; beyond a critical wavelength, hence below a certain frequency (the value of which is proportional to &#x03A6;), the photons will have insufficient energy to liberate electrons. Increasing the intensity of light gives more photons, but does not change their individual energies. <a id="page_10" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 10, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Unlike Einstein&#x2019;s theory of relativity, his light quantum hypothesis was largely ignored for some years. Partly this was because the wave theory was so well established, and it seemed inexplicable that light could have particle-like properties as well. Also, the quantitative data needed to test <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-13">eqn 1.13</a> were not available at first. Gradually, however, the theory became established. Millikan, who also first measured the charge on an electron, verified Einstein&#x2019;s prediction more quantitatively, and determined a value of 6.56 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-34</sup> J s for Planck&#x2019;s constant. (The currently accepted value is 6.62608 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-34</sup> J s.) In 1913, Niels Bohr used Einstein&#x2019;s theory as a basis for his interpretation of the line spectrum of the hydrogen atom (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). There were also increasingly puzzling observations on the nature of X-rays, which suggested they also had wave- and particle-like properties.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The wave nature of X-rays in connection with their diffraction by crystals was discussed above (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>). Many other properties of X-rays suggest, however, that their energy is concentrated in quanta as Einstein proposed for light. They also produce photoelectrons, both in solids and in passing through gases, with properties similar to those found with light and UV radiation, except that their energy is much higher. The high voltages needed to produce X-rays can be explained in a similar way. If each X-ray photon is produced as a result of one electron striking the target in the X-ray tube, then we would expect this electron to need an energy at least equal to the photon energy. It was found by Duane and Hunt that the X-rays produced have a minimum wavelength, or maximum frequency, which depends on the energy of bombarding electrons in exactly the way predicted by Einstein&#x2019;s formula, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-12">eqn 1.12</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Some energy magnitudes and units</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:em;">Before discussing some important consequences of the quantum nature of light, it is useful to have an idea of the magnitudes of the energies involved. <a href="#eqn1-12">Equation 1.12</a> is more useful when expressed in terms of the wavelength, as this is what is normally measured, not the frequency. Using <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-3">eqn 1.3</a>, we have</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">For example, photons of yellow light, with a wavelength of 600 nm, each have an energy of about 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-19</sup> J. This is tiny by everyday standards. A bulb giving out 50 W of light power will emit more than 10<sup>20</sup> photons s<sup>-1</sup>, and it is hardly surprising that the quantum nature of this light is not usually apparent. Even with X-rays, having a much smaller wavelength and so larger photon energy, the flux from a normal source appears continuous for many purposes. <a id="page_11" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 11, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Other units are more convenient when we are dealing with individual photon energies. It is common to use the <i>electron volt</i> (eV), equal to the kinetic energy imparted to an electron when it is accelerated in a potential of 1 V. The conversion factor between electron volts and joules is numerically equal to the charge on an electron:</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Yellow light has a photon energy of 2 eV, and X-rays from a copper source, with a wavelength of 0.154 nm, a photon energy of about 8000 eV. This shows that at least 8000 V is needed to give electrons sufficient energy to produce these X-rays.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The energies discussed above, although small by macroscopic standards, are very significant at the level of individual atoms or molecules. This can be seen on multiplying them by Avogadro&#x2019;s constant, so as to give the energy per mole.

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Chemical bonds typically have energies of a few hundred kilojoules per mole, corresponding to a few electron volts per molecule. If a photon interacts with one molecule, even visible light of short wavelength may be able to break some chemical bonds, and UV and shorter-wavelength radiation should be even more powerful in this respect. The field of <i>photochemistry</i> studies this type of process. As an example, consider the photochemical dissociation of an oxygen molecule. The reaction is written</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">so as to indicate the involvement of the photon energy <i>hv</i>. The bond energy of O<sub>2</sub> is 498 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which is 5.2 eV per molecule. From <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-17">eqn 1.17</a> the required photon energy corresponds to a wavelength of 240 nm, which is far into the ultraviolet range. Longer-wavelength radiation, such as visible light, will not provide enough energy. Reaction 1.19 only happens in the upper atmosphere, as the short UV radiation required is absorbed by ozone (itself produced by the oxygen atoms reacting with more O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There is another unit often used in connection with the spectroscopic measurements discussed in the next section. The <i>wavenumber</i> is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength:</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">which is easier to use, because photon energy is directly proportional to the wavenumber. The SI unit for the wavenumber is m<sup>-1</sup>, but confusingly, spectroscopists use cm<sup>-1</sup> instead. For example, light of 500 nm wavelength is given a wavenumber of 20 000 cm&#x201D;<sup>1</sup>, rather than 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>. When using <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-21">eqn 1.21</a>, a conversion factor is needed, which may be applied <i>either</i></p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Photons and spectroscopy</b></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Spectroscopy is the study of how radiation interacts with atoms, molecules, or solids. It is an immensely important part of modern chemistry, used to identify substances and to investigate their structure and chemical bonding. The quantum theory is fundamental to understanding how it works. This section is intended to give a very brief idea of some of the principles.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">One important form of spectroscopy has developed directly from the photoelectric experiments described above. By making the electrons pass between two slits, with a deflecting electric field in between, their complete energy distribution can be measured, rather than just the maximum emitted energy as in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig110">Fig. 1.10</a>. This is known as <i>photoelectron spectroscopy</i>, and may be performed on gases or solids, with radiation in the UV or X-ray ranges of the spectrum. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig111">Figure 1.11</a> shows the type of apparatus used, and the spectrum obtained from a sample of solid CdO. A series of peaks is found, and the interpretation based on Einstein&#x2019;s theory is also shown. <a id="page_13" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 13, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>

(a) Schematic illustration of apparatus, comprising radiation source, sample, electron energy analyser and detector, all in a vacuum chamber, (b) Spectrum obtained from solid CdO, using X-rays of photon energy 1284 eV. (c) Interpretation of peaks in spectrum. The zero of energy in this scale corresponds to electrons with just sufficient energy to leave the solid; positive values are the kinetic energies of emitted electrons, negative values correspond to the binding energies of electrons in the solid.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Each peak in the spectrum, at electron energy <i>E</i>, comes from a level where an electron is bound by an energy <i>B</i> in the solid; then by analogy with <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-14">eqn 1.14</a>, we assume</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">What spectra such at that in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig111">Fig. 1.11</a> show is that electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids have a series of discrete binding energies, and <i>not</i> a continuous range of energies. The most loosely bound electrons are those associated with chemical bonding. More tightly bound electrons (with <i>B</i> in the range of tens up to hundreds or more electron volts) are ones too close to the nucleus of an atom to be involved in bonding. The observation of these &#x2018;inner-shell&#x2019; electrons gives direct evidence for the shell structure of an atom, which forms the basis for our interpretation of the periodic table of elements (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Most other forms of spectroscopy do not involve emission of extra particles such as electrons, but the straightforward absorption or emission of photons. These processes increase or decrease the energy of an atom or molecule, by an amount equal to the photon energy. The results all reinforce the conclusion of photoelectron spectroscopy that only discrete energy levels occur (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig112">Fig. 1.12</a>). For example, the <i>line spectra</i> of atoms, known since the early nineteenth century, only contain lines at certain well-defined wavelengths. The <i>quantization</i> of energy, not only in electromagnetic radiation but in material systems, is an inescapable conclusion of spectroscopy.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml#tbl12">Table 1.2</a> shows the wide range of radiation used in different types of spectroscopy. The kinds of energy level that are probed in these experiments also differ widely. Very low photon energies, in the radio frequency spectrum,<a id="page_14" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 14, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a>are appropriate to the minute energy splittings arising from the magnetic properties of nuclei when molecules are placed in a magnetic field. Microwave and infrared photons interact with the rotational and vibrational motion of molecules. In the visible and ultraviolet ranges, the different energy levels of bonding electrons are involved, and at higher (X-ray) energies, those associated with inner-shell electrons of atoms. At the &#x2018;top&#x2019; of the spectrum, &#x03B3; radiation accompanies high-energy processes occurring within atomic nuclei, for example in radioactive decay.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Most of these types of spectroscopy are of use in chemistry. The levels probed by low-energy photons are sensitive to the detailed structure of molecules, and can be used to help identify compounds that have been newly synthesized. Visible and UV spectroscopy is important in the study of chemical bonding. X-ray spectra are characteristic of particular atoms, and are important in some methods of chemical analysis. The application of the quantum theory to the appropriate types of energy levels is essential in all these applications. A few relevant examples will be given in later chapters.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> The statistical nature of photons</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The experimental evidence discussed so far in this chapter leaves no possible doubt for the dual nature of electromagnetic radiation. It does not however make it easy to understand. How can something behave sometimes as waves, sometimes as particles? This question will be raised again in connection with electrons and other microscopic particles in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, and the difficulties discussed in more detail there (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.4">Section 2.4</a>). At this point, it is appropriate to discuss some ideas which, without giving a complete answer, go part of the way towards one.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Let us return to the Young&#x2019;s slits experiment (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig14">Fig. 1.4)</a>. Normally when this is performed, the quantum nature of light is not relevant. The intensity <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a>of light is such that photons reach the final screen in very rapid succession, and they are not individually observed. There is no difficulty at all, however, in doing this experiment with individual photons. We use a very low light intensity, and replace the final screen with instruments that can detect individual photons. These might use the photoelectric effect (photo multipliers) or solid-state devices in which each photon is absorbed and energizes an electron sufficiently that a current can be detected. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig113">Figure 1.13</a> illustrates the type of result that would be obtained, in a situation where a portion of the screen is replaced by a bank of 50 detectors.</p>
<figure class="figure-bh" id="fig113">
<img src="../images/fig1.13.jpg" alt="img"/>
<figcaption class="figcaption1" style="margin-top:0.5em;">
<p class="noindent" style="width:90%;margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 1.13</b>An interference pattern, e.g. from the Young&#x2019;s slits experiment in Fig. 1.4, observed so that individual photons can be detected. The vertical scale shows the number of photons counted by each of a bank of 50 detectors. When only a few photons have arrived (a) they appear to be randomly distributed. As more come (b) and (c) the interference pattern predicted by the wave theory emerges, but only as a statistical effect.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Individual photons appear to arrive at entirely random times and positions. As more photons are counted, a pattern starts to emerge, and eventually, when we have enough, the interference fringes predicted by the wave theory can be seen. We know that, when the experiment is done with massive numbers of photons, the light intensity can be predicted by the wave theory. Under these conditions, therefore, the <i>number</i> of photons arriving at any point must be proportional to the wave intensity. On an individual basis, however, each photon appears to be unpredictable. All we can say is that the <i>probability</i> of a photon arriving at a particular point is proportional to the wave intensity. (Note that according to <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eqn1-5">eqn 1.5</a> this is the square of the wave amplitude.)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This probabilistic or statistical result is always observed in experiments where individual photons are counted. As the wave theory cannot do any better, we might ask whether there is some other theory, which <i>can</i> predict the exact behaviour of each photon, and tell us where and when it will arrive. The answer is &#x2018;No&#x2019;. We do not have such a theory, and the results of other, more sophisticated experiments, make it seem very unlikely that it could ever work. Statistics, rather than deterministic certainties, seem to be inescapable aspects of the dual behaviour of light. This conclusion was disturbing to the physicists who developed the quantum theory, and Einstein for one was never able to accept it. We shall return to these difficulties in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.4">Section 2.4.</a> <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Chapter 1: Electromagnetic Waves and photons</a></p>
