<h1 class="main"><b>Series Editor&#x2019;s Foreword</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">Understanding of the basis of periodicity and the nature of chemical bonding is fundamental to inorganic chemistry. All of our discussions of structure, physical properties, and chemical reactivity stem from these basics.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series will provide explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry. Mark Winter explains the fundamentals of chemical bonding in a clear and readable way. This particular primer is aimed at first-year university students and should provide them with a sound base to underpin later inorganic chemistry courses.</p>
