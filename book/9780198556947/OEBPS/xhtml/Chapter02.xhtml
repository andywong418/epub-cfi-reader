<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Covalent and ionic bonding</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two principal types of non-metallic chemical bonding, <i>covalent</i> and <i>ionic</i>. Ionic bonding occurs when a compound such as common salt, NaCl, adopts a lattice structure consisting of a regular array of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). The ions are held together largely by electrostatic forces between the cations and anions.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1916, Lewis suggested that a <i>covalent</i> bond is where two atoms are held together by a pair of electrons located between the two atoms. The two electrons are <i>shared</i> by the two atoms. For electronic bookkeeping purposes, in most molecules, each of the two atoms provides one electron each to the bond. This is the basis of the simplistic but useful <i>&#x2018;dot and cross&#x2019;</i> bonding representation. Since this concept was developed by Lewis, such structures are often called Lewis structures. The essence of this treatment is that atoms involved in covalent bonding should attain the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas. This is also true for ionic structures. In NaCl one electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine to make Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ions. Each ion attains the electronic structure of the nearest noble gas and it is these ions which make up the salt lattice structure.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Lewis bonding of H<sub>2</sub></h2>
<p class="noindent">The Lewis structure of H<sub>2</sub> is very simple. Each hydrogen atom has one electron. In the molecule H<sub>2</sub>, each hydrogen attains the electronic configuration of the next noble gas, in this case the helium duplet, by sharing the two electrons. This is represented as H:H, or more simply H&#x2014;H. This representation tells us that there are two electrons located between the two hydrogen nuclei, and that these two electrons form the bond holding the nuclei together. The interactions in H<sub>2</sub> are represented in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig 2.1</a>. Don&#x2019;t forget that the electrons are not really point charges. There are a number of interactions. The force interaction between two point charges varies with the square of the distance between them. The two protons are positively charged and repel each other. The two electrons are negatively charged and repel each other. However this is more than offset by the four proton&#x2013;electron attractions. These six interactions represent the net bonding in the system.</p>

<p class="indent">It is immediately apparent that as the number of atoms in a molecule increases and as the number of electrons increases, the situation become really rather complex. This model is flawed. Neither the protons or electrons are point charges. Nevertheless, the model is instructive. <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 2: Lewis molecular structures</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The octet rule and diatomic molecules</h2>
<p class="noindent">Lewis realized that most of the second period elements, in particular, are surrounded in covalent compounds by eight electrons. They do this by sharing electrons with neighbouring atoms. The number eight is the magic number because all the valence orbitals are fully occupied, although at the time the octet rule was first recognized, the reasons were not appreciated.</p>
<p class="indent">The fluorine atom has seven valence electrons and only requires one extra electron to attain the neon electronic structure. One way it can do this is by sharing an electron with another fluorine atom. The resulting molecule, written F&#x2014;F, demonstrates another point. It has six pairs of electrons that are <i>not</i> shared with other atoms. Such pairs of electrons are <i>lone pairs</i>. Not unreasonably, the lone pairs of electrons on adjacent fluorine atoms repel each other. The resulting interactions partially negate the bonding energy from the shared pair of electrons and the result is that the two fluorine atoms in F&#x2014;F are very weakly bound. This is one of the reasons that F<sub>2</sub> is so reactive.</p>

<p class="sidebar"><i>Lone pair</i>, a pair of valence electrons not shared with another atom</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Oxygen with its six valence electrons requires <i>two</i> electrons to attain the octet structure of neon. One way the oxygen atom can do this is to share <i>two</i> electrons with a neighbouring oxygen atom. This places <i>two</i> shared pairs of electrons between the two oxygen nuclei. This introduces the concept of <i>bond order</i>. Two electrons located between two atoms are defined as forming a <i>single bond</i>. Two pairs of electrons between two atoms constitute two bonds, that is, a <i>double bond</i>. The bond order in dioxygen is 2 and dioxygen is written O=O. Each oxygen atom has two lone pairs.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><img src="../images/page28-2.jpg" alt="images"/></p></aside>
<p class="indent">Nitrogen has five valence electrons and satisfaction of the octet rule therefore requires that it share <i>three</i> electrons with a neighbouring nitrogen atom. This means that dinitrogen is written &#x039D;&#x2261;&#x039D; to show the <i>triple bond</i> and the bond order is 3. Each nitrogen atom has just one lone pair.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><img src="../images/page28-3.jpg" alt="images"/></p></aside>
<p class="indent">The impression should now be forming that constructing Lewis structure diagrams is a matter of determining the total number of electrons possessed by the two atoms and arranging them so that the octet rule (or the duplet rule if one of the atoms is hydrogen) is satisfied for each atom.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, carbon monoxide contains carbon with 4 valence electrons and oxygen with 6, total 10. This is the same number of electrons possessed by the &#x039D;&#x2261;&#x039D; molecule (structure :&#x039D;&#x2261;&#x039D;:) and carbon monoxide has its ten electrons arranged in the same way (structure :C&#x2261;O:). Charged species are treated simply by adding a dot in the case of a monoanion, or subtracting a dot in the case of a monocation. Therefore cyanide, C&#x2261;N<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, and the nitrosonium cation, &#x039D;&#x2261;O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> are both 10-electron systems written with a triple bond between the two atoms. Molecules with the same number of component atoms and the same total electron count, such as N<sub>2</sub>, CO, CN<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, and NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> are said to be <i>isoelectronic</i>. One would expect there to be at least some similarities in their chemistries.</p>

<p class="noindent">Homonuclear diatomic molecule such as N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub> are symmetrical and therefore there cannot be a charge imbalance between the two atoms. The <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Chapter 2: Lewis molecular structures</a>sharing of electrons in this way is &#x2018;pure&#x2019; covalent bonding. Diatomic molecules such as HF are asymmetric and there is no reason, except by accident, for there <i>not</i> to be a charge imbalance between the two atoms. An <i>electronegativity scale</i> is a set of numbers which relates the power of an atom to attract electrons towards itself within a molecule. Elements which do this successfully are said to be very electronegative. Elements that do not do this well are weakly electronegative, or electropositive. There are a number of numerical electronegativity scales, such as the <i>Pauling scale</i> or the <i>Mulliken scale</i>, in common use. Elements towards the right and top of the standard periodic table are the most electronegative. Elements towards the bottom and left are least electronegative, or <i>electropositive</i>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Therefore in a diatomic molecule such as H&#x2014;F, the fluorine, being more electronegative, attracts more than its fair share of electron density. It does this at the expense of the less electronegative hydrogen. The consequence of this is that there is more electron density at the fluorine end of the molecule than at the hydrogen end. The bond is <i>polar</i>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Consider lithium fluoride, LiF. One way to satisfy the noble gas rule for <i>both</i> atoms is to completely transfer an electron from the very electropositive lithium to the very electronegative fluorine. Fluorine attains the electronic configuration of neon while lithium attains the configuration of helium. The Lewis representation of such an electron transfer is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msup><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo></msup><msup><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow><munderover><mrow><mo>:</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>:</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>..</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>..</mn></mrow></munderover></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup></mrow></math>. Removal of an electron from lithium corresponds to <i>ionization</i> and addition of an electron to fluorine is the reverse of <i>electron affinity</i>. The energy penalties for electron transfer are more than compensated by the electrostatic attraction between the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cation and F<sup>&#x2013;</sup> anion. This is <i>ionic bonding</i>. Ionic bonding is favoured, in particular, for those diatomic cases where one of the atoms is electropositive and the other very electronegative.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, however, the transfer of electrons is never complete. If a lithium cation is placed close to a fluorine anion, the electron clouds are distorted by the neighbouring charge. The electron cloud around the anion is distorted towards the cation. This amounts to a partial transfer of electron density back to the cation along the internuclear axis. Placing some charge density along the internuclear axis constitutes partial covalent bonding The consequence of this is that it is impossible to have a <i>pure</i> ionic bond since some distortion in the anion charge cloud always occurs. Looked at this way, diatomic ionic structures are an extreme form of polar bonding in which the bond is so polarized that electrons are almost completely transferred to the more electronegative atom. In practice, one can place any bond on a &#x2018;spectrum&#x2019; of bond types which varies from &#x2018;pure&#x2019; covalent bonding to &#x2018;pure&#x2019; ionic bonding with pretty well all molecules lying between the extremes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>The octet rule and polyatomic molecules</h2>
<p class="noindent">Extension of the Lewis model to polyatomic structures is relatively straightforward. One potential problem is knowing the connectivity of the molecule. Given an empirical formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N there is no way of knowing <a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Chapter 2: Lewis molecular structures</a>whether the structure should be MeC&#x2261;N: (methyl cyanide), MeNs&#x2261;C: (methyl isocyanide), or some other structure. Further, Lewis structures give no clue as to the geometry of the molecule in question.</p>
<p class="indent">The procedure for writing down the Lewis structure for a polyatomic molecule is to calculate the total number of valence electrons for all the atoms in a molecule, make any necessary compensation for charge, and arrange all the electrons around the component atoms (arranged in the correct connectivity) so that the octet rule (or duplet rule for hydrogen) is satisfied for each (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). Note that the Lewis representation of ethene successfully accounts for the double bond. Atoms in other molecules such as NH<sub>3</sub> do not share all their electrons. Nitrogen has a pair of electrons it retains for itself. Such a pair is termed a <i>lone pair</i>. Note that nitrogen still has an octet of electrons.</p>

<img src="../images/fig2.2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:left;">
<b>Fig. 2.2</b> Some examples of Lewis structures.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">There are a very few exceptions to the octet rule for the second period elements. In BF<sub>3</sub>, all the fluorine atoms attain the octet configuration but boron has only six. Molecules of this type are sometimes termed <i>electron deficient</i>. The octet rule is frequently adhered to by main group elements below the second period, but there is more scope for exceptions. So for the third period elements, in addition to the 3<i>s</i> and 3<i>p</i> orbitals there are a number of cases, such as PF<sub>5</sub>, where the electron count can expands beyond eight. This is often attributed to participation in the bonding by <i>d</i> orbitals.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-top:0.8em;margin-left:-1.8em;"> 
<b>Fig. 2.3</b> Lewis structures in which only the lone pairs on the central atoms are denoted.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">It is common to denote bonds by a line such as that in F&#x2014;F. The line corresponds to two electron dots in the diagrams above and is generally a more convenient representation than the dots. The two dots are retained for lone pairs, but lone pairs are often only denoted on the atom of interest in a molecule (<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). So in PF<sub>3</sub>, only the phosphorus lone pair is generally <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter 2: Lewis molecular structures</a>written and the fluorine lone pairs are left from the diagram.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Dative bonding</h2>
<p class="noindent">One way for the boron atom in an electron-deficient molecule such as BF<sub>3</sub> to attain the octet configuration is for it to acquire <i>two</i> electrons from another molecule. Ammonia is a good electron pair donor. The nitrogen shares its lone pair with boron in the <i>adduct</i> F<sub>3</sub>B&#x2190;NH<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>). The arrow &#x2192; is often, but not always, used to denote that one atom donates both electrons to the bond. A bond in which both electrons originate from one atom is a <i>dative covalent bond</i>. In this example, NH<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis base and BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid. The origin of the term dative is in the Latin <i>dare</i>, to give.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><i>Lewis bases</i>: electron donors</p>
<p class="sidebar"><i>Lewis acids</i>: electron acceptors</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In some ways the arrow symbolism is useful in that it might help electron accountancy. In others it is a hindrance in that the arrow suggests that in some way the bond is different from a shared electron-pair bond. It is not, both shared electron bonds and dative electron bonds are simply two-electron bonds. Once a bond <i>exists</i>, there is no way to distinguish any characteristic of that bond which is differs between the two types. Note the representation H<sub>3</sub>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup>&#x2014;B<sup>&#x2013;</sup>F<sub>3</sub> is also perfectly legitimate.</p>

It is possible to write down <i>two</i> reasonable dot structures to represent the structure of ethanoate. Which is correct? The answer is neither. Both structures <i>contribute</i> to the actual structure. The real structure is said to be a <i>resonance hybrid</i> of the two contributor structures. It is not a case of interconversion (so-called &#x2018;flickering&#x2019;) between the two structures.
