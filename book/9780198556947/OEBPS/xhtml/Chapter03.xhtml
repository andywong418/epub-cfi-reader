<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A <i>paramagnetic</i> molecule is one in which there is one or more unpaired electrons. In <i>diamagnetic</i> molecules all the electrons are paired.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">For many purposes, Lewis structures are an adequate description of bonding. They do have their problems however. The Lewis structure for O<sub>2</sub> has two oxygen atoms linked by four electrons, two for each bond. All the electrons are apparently paired, either in bonds or as lone pairs. This is an example where the Lewis representation of structures breaks down. It fails to account for the fact that O<sub>2</sub> has two unpaired electrons and is therefore paramagnetic.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that a bonding model, or any other model for that matter, is demonstrably wrong does not mean we must instantly consign it to the rubbish bin. The Lewis dot bonding representation is extremely useful, for instance, in the VSEPR method (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>) for calculating the shapes of main group compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">A more sophisticated model is required to account for the paramagnetism. In outlining such a model it is necessary first to examine the bonding in some simpler diatomic molecules, starting with the simplest possible molecule, H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, the positive ion of the H<sub>2</sub> molecule.</p></section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.2"> 
<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The simplest diatomic molecule: H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup></h2>
<p class="noindent">The Lewis structure of H<sub>2</sub> has two electrons holding the two nuclei together in a single bond. Shining light of an appropriate frequency on the H<sub>2 </sub>molecule results in one of the electrons in the H<sub>2</sub> molecule being ejected, with the resultant formation of the transiently stable ion H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. This is the simplest of all molecules. It consists of two protons held together by just a single electron. The bond order in the Lewis structure of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is therefore &#x00BD;. Clearly the single electron cannot hold the two protons together as well as the two electrons in H<sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, there is a bond, although it is weaker (255 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) than that in H<sub>2</sub> (430 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). It is also longer with an equilibrium bond length of 106 pm compared to that of H<sub>2</sub> which is 74 pm.</p>
<p class="indent">Conceptually the hydrogen atom is made up from a proton and an electron. The H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> molecule is made up from two protons and an electron. The electron in the H atom is located in an orbital centred on the proton. The way forward for H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is to place the electron in an orbital centred on the two protons. Instead of being in an <i>atomic</i> 1<i>s</i> orbital, the electron in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is in a <i>molecular orbital</i>. Unlike the hydrogen atomic orbital which is spherical, the orbital corresponding to the lowest energy level of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is cylindrically symmetrical about the H&#x2014;H axis.</p>
<p class="indent">Each point within a molecular orbital has an associated electron density just as atomic orbitals do. Some regions of space contain greater amounts of electron than others. The electron dot density cross-section plot (<a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>) <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>shows that the bulk, but not all, of the electron density resides in the region between the two nuclei. As for atomic orbitals, this is often inconvenient to represent on a diagram and so again a convention is needed to represent this. The same boundary convention already described for atoms is appropriate. The orbital in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> that holds the electron is vaguely blimp- or cigar-shaped and generally represented with a boundary sketch (<a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The plus sign on the orbital shows that the sign of the wave function &#x03C8; enclosed by the boundary is positive. This is the same sign convention used for atoms.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">So, in molecules, as in atoms, electrons reside in orbitals. An orbital, whether in an atom or a molecule is still an orbital, but their shapes are different and they are associated with more than one atomic nuclei. Orbitals associated with atoms are called <i>atomic orbitals</i> and those associated with molecules are called <i>molecular orbitals</i>. The description of molecules based on molecular orbitals is called molecular orbital (MO) theory. The resulting molecular orbitals are in many cases spread (<i>delocalized</i>) over the entire molecule.</p></section>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Interference in wave phenomena</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sound or light waves can interact in a constructive or destructive fashion. If a pair of loudspeakers is connected to the amplifier so that the terminals on one are reversed relative to the second, the result is a dead sound because as one speaker cone moves out, the other moves in. Some concert halls, and lecture theatres, are acoustically poor. One of the reasons for this is that as the sound bounces around, the reflected waves interact <i>destructively</i> with each other. Related effects can be produced with water. Throwing a pebble into a still pond generates a characteristic pattern of ripples. Throwing two pebbles in results in two ripple patterns which overlap with each other, in an idealized example perhaps as in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> (top).</p>

<p class="indent">At any particular point in the pond, two water ripples in phase with each <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>other mix or combine to make a bigger ripple, while if they happen to be out of phase (out of step) with each other, they cancel each other out. The calculation of the pattern representing the reinforcement of two ripples is relatively straightforward. Consider the two waves at the top of <a href="#fig3.3">Fig 3.3</a>. These waves are identical in terms of their amplitudes and wavelength. The amplitude of the resultant wave at any particular position is simply calculated by <i>adding</i> the amplitude of the two component waves. The resultant wave is shown to the right. This operation could be written as in <a href="#eqn_3.1">Eqn 3.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If the two waves happen to be out of phase, as in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> (bottom), the result of this addition is complete destruction and the result is the zero amplitude line to the right. The second (out-of-phase) wave is related to the first in the sense that at every point, the magnitude of the displacement is exactly the same, but that the direction or sign of the wave is opposite. Mathematically this is achieved simply by multiplying the first by &#x2013;1. This out-of-phase combination could be written as in <a href="#eqn_3.2">Eqn 3.2</a>.

<h2 class="h2">3.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>In-phase interaction of 1<i>s</i> orbital wave functions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Mathematically the behaviour of electrons in orbitals can be treated as a wave phenomenon, and the wave functions for two interacting orbitals on two different atoms interact with each other constructively or destructively. The wave functions used for atomic orbitals are not sine waves but this doesn&#x2019;t affect the principle of the matter.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest approach to analysing these interactions involves taking <i>linear combinations</i> of the constituent atomic orbitals. This involves mathematically mixing the valence atomic orbitals of the respective atoms. In <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>, two hydrogen atoms are placed at a bonding distance apart. The 1<i>s</i> wave functions interact. As for the water ripples above, the reinforcement at any particular point is calculated simply by adding the amplitude of the wave functions of the two hydrogen nuclei at that point together. The result of this addition is shown to the right.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an overlap in the middle (between the two nuclei). This is called the in-phase combination of two 1<i>s</i> orbitals. Mathematically, constructing the wave function for the in-phase combination of two H 1<i>s</i> orbitals involves adding the two functions together at each point in space (<a href="#eqn_3.3">Eqn 3.3</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Normalization constants</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is one further point to be made concerning the mixing of two (or more) orbitals. Mathematically there is no problem in simply adding together two wave functions, and then squaring to get a measure of electron density. Consider mixing a piece of red clay and a piece of yellow clay together. The result is an orange piece of clay, <i>but</i> one that is twice as big as the two component lumps. Something similar would happen on mixing two orbitals. The resulting orbital would be bigger than the component orbitals and in the case of orbitals this is not acceptable. It is therefore necessary to adjust the size of the orbital after mixing to make sure it is the expected size, that is, to ensure that when one electron is placed into the orbital, the total probability of finding the electron adds up to 1. Mathematically the resulting wave function is multiplied by a number less than one to achieve this result. Therefore the result of adding two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> wave functions together should be corrected by a multiplier, in this case <i>approximately</i> 1/&#x221A;2, to adjust the size of the orbital to the correct value.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that obtaining values of electron density from a wave function involves squaring the wave function. Since the wave function of the in-phase combination is expressed by <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub><i><sub>s</sub></i>(H<i><sub>a</sub></i>) &#x002B; <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub><i><sub>s</sub></i>(H<i><sub>b</sub></i>) , the square of this (<a href="#eqn_3.5">Eqn 3.5</a>) represents the electron density in the in-phase combination.</p>
<p class="indent">Normalization constants will be quoted where appropriate throughout the book, but usually without further comment. Later examples concern cases in which more than two wave functions are added together. In such cases the normalization constant will take some other value.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Out-of-phase interaction of 1<i>s</i> orbital wave functions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The process of linear combination of orbitals necessarily generates the <i>same number</i> of molecular orbitals as the number of component atomic orbitals. <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>The point about the same number of resultant molecular orbitals arising from mixing the atomic orbitals is important. If starting with two atomic orbitals (such as the two 1<i>s</i>&#x00B7;orbitals in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>), then <i>two</i> molecular orbitals must result. So far only one of the resulting orbitals has been mentioned, the <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbital which actually holds the electron in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. It is now time to consider the second molecular orbital of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">The out-of-phase combination for the two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals is generated mathematically by subtracting (or multiplying the second wave function by &#x2013;1 and adding the resultant wave function) the second wave function from the first at each point in space. The result of this operation is shown in <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a> and in <a href="#eqn_3.6">Eqn 3.6</a>. The size of the <i>normalization constant</i> (1/&#x221A;2) for the out-of-phase combination is the same as the in-phase case. Since squaring any negative number gives a positive number, although the wave function for the out-of-phase combination is negative in some regions, the electron density (<a href="#eqn_3.7">Eqn 3.7</a>) is always positive, as intuitively expected.</p>

<p class="indent">The out-of-phase wave functions also has cylindrical symmetry and is therefore a <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbital. If an electron is located in the out-of-phase combination orbital, the bulk of its density is situated remote from the internuclear region.

<p class="noindent">Without going into details here, it is possible to determine experimentally and to calculate the energy of the lowest energy orbital in the H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> molecule. It was seen earlier that the energy of an electron in a given atomic orbital on hydrogen can be calculated. It turns out that the energy of the molecular orbital is lower than the energies of the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital. Armed with this information, a schematic energy level diagram can be plotted. The bonding orbital is labelled &#x03C3; to indicate its cylindrical symmetry.</p>
<p class="indent">The two levels on the left and right of <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a> represent the &#x2018;energy level&#x2019; of the 1<i>s</i> orbitals in the H atom and H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion. The lower energy level in the centre represents the energy level of the lowest energy molecular orbital of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The half arrows represent the electron of the H atom and of the H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B; </sup>molecule. The amount of energy &#x0394;<i>E</i> by which the energy of the electron falls on going from atomic hydrogen to molecular H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> represents the bonding energy of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The calculated energy of the antibonding orbital is <i>higher</i> than the energy of the component 1<i>s</i> orbitals. This is therefore plotted above the component atomic energy levels. Note that this orbital is not occupied in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, but in related molecules (see below), it is occupied.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lewis structure representation of molecules has probably already instilled the idea that when <i>two</i> electrons hold two atoms together, the result <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>is <i>one</i> bond. Two electrons constitute a bond. In H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, there is a single electron holding the two nuclei together, so the bond order in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is &#x00BD;.</p>

Again, just the H 1<i>s</i> orbitals are involved, so the possible orbital overlaps are the same as in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The energy level framework of H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> above is still applicable. The antibonding level is included for completeness, but again it is unoccupied.</p>
<p class="indent">The two electrons are both located in the lower energy level (<a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>), but spin paired, just as in the building-up principle for atoms discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. In fact, the various rules used for the building up principle for atoms (Hund&#x2019;s rule, Pauli exclusion principle, etc.) all operate for molecules in just the same way that they operate for atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Since there are now two electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonding orbital, the bond order of H<sub>2</sub> is said to be one.</p>
<p class="indent">The two molecules H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> behave very differently in a magnetic field. The molecule H<sub>2</sub> is <i>repelled</i> by a magnetic field. This is known as <i>diamagnetism</i>. The molecule H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is <i>attracted</i> by a magnetic field. This is known as <i>paramagnetism</i>. The origin of the paramagnetism is the unpaired electron in H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>. All molecules, except H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, have an inherent diamagnetism but if there are unpaired electrons, the resulting paramagnetism outweighs the diamagnetism.</p>

There are three electrons in the H<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> ion. The first two occupy the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonding orbital.

<h3 class="sub"><i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital mixing</h3>
<p class="noindent">Just as two orbitals arise from the in- and out-of-phase mixing of two <i>s</i> orbitals, two arise from the mixing of two <i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals (<a href="#fig3.12">Fig. 3.12</a>). The resulting orbitals possess cylindrical symmetry and are therefore classified as <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbitals.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">When viewed along the intermolecular axis, a <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbital of any type looks like a &#x2018;s&#x2019; orbital.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Because of the sign properties of the wave function in <i>p</i> orbitals, and&#x2019; because a universal <i>z</i> axis is used rather than local axes for each atom, note that the in-phase combination is derived by multiplying the <i>p</i> orbital on the second atom by &#x2013;1 and adding the result to the <i>p</i> orbital on the first. If the atoms are identified as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> then this is written as in <a href="#eqn_3.8">Eqn 3.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The subscript <i>p</i> in the label <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> simply refers to the fact that the orbital is made up from <i>p</i> orbitals. The <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital constitutes a bonding interaction since its calculated energy lies <i>below</i> that of the component <i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals.</p>
<p class="indent">The out-of-phase combination (<a href="#eqn_3.9">Eqn 3.9</a>) is antibonding and labelled <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* since its calculated energy is above that of the component <i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals. Note that, as for the <i>&#x03C3;</i> bonding combination of H 1<i>s</i> orbitals in H<sub>2</sub>, the electron density in the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital is located between the two nuclei. Similarly, in the antibonding <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbital, the electron density is largely located away from the internuclear area.</p>

<p class="indent">The out-of-phase combination is shown in <a href="#fig3.14">Fig 3.14</a>. Again the resulting orbital has <i>&#x03C0;</i> symmetry, but it is antibonding since its calculated energy is greater than either of the component atomic orbitals. It is therefore denoted <i>&#x03C0;</i>*. The out-of-phase combination is written as <a href="#eqn_3.11">Eqn 3.11</a>. Again the subscript <i>p</i> can be included to explicitly denote its <i>p</i> orbital origins, as in <a href="#eqn_3.10">Eqn. 3.10</a>, but again this is not obligatory.</p>
<p class="indent">In this type of bonding there is little electron density in the region of the internuclear axis between the nuclei in <i>either</i> the in-phase or the out-of-phase combinations. The bonding interaction in the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbital comes from the two regions of electron density lying &#x2018;above&#x2019; and &#x2018;below&#x2019; the internuclear axis. The two lobes of the <i>&#x03C0;</i> interaction <i>together</i> constitute <i>one</i> orbital whereas the four lobes of the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* interaction <i>together</i> constitute <i>one</i> orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">The situation for the <i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals overlap is in appearance identical except that the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals arising from <i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals are at 90&#x00B0; to those of the <i>p<sub>x </sub></i>orbitals. Clearly by symmetry, the energies of the resulting <i>&#x03C0;</i> and <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals arising from <i>p<sub>y</sub></i> overlap are exactly the same as those arising from <i>p<sub>x</sub></i> overlap.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>&#x03C0;</i> bonding the nuclei are relatively exposed to each other. In addition, the overlap of the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals in this sideways fashion is less efficient than the end-to-end interaction of the <i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals. The consequence is that <i>&#x03C0;</i> bonding is often less strong than <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> bonding. Conversely, the destabilization of the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>orbital is less than the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>p</sub>* orbital.

<p class="indent">The energy of the 2<i>s</i> orbital is below that of the 2<i>p</i> orbital, hence the ordering shown. The 2<i>s</i> orbital is lower in energy because the 2<i>p</i> orbitals are more shielded from the nucleus than the 2<i>s</i> orbitals (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.17">Section 1.17</a>). A consequence of the 2<i>s</i> orbital starting lower than the 2<i>p</i> orbital energies is that the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>* orbital is at a <i>lower</i> energy than the bonding <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> bonding orbital. Just because an orbital is antibonding does not stop its energy being low and lying below the energy of bonding orbitals. The label antibonding indicates that the energy of that orbital is higher than those of <i>the component orbitals</i> of that antibonding orbital. If the component orbitals are themselves low in energy then the resulting antibonding orbitals may themselves be low in energy, and sometimes lower than other orbitals which are bonding relative to higher lying component orbitals.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Some of the necessary concepts are made clear in a pictorial approach. In <a href="#fig3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>, two different ways for an <i>s</i> orbital to overlap with a <i>p</i> orbital are shown. The left hand side shows an &#x2018;end-on&#x2019; overlap and the right a &#x2018;side-on&#x2019; overlap. In the end-on interaction, the sign of the wave function is the same in all regions and so there is only reinforcement. There is a net bonding interaction. For the side-on overlap there are two regions of interest. On one side, a unshaded area overlaps with an unshaded area. The signs of the wave function in both these regions are the same and there will therefore be a degree of reinforcement in this region. However, on the other side an unshaded region overlaps with a shaded region. The wave function signs are different and therefore there will be degree of destruction in this region. From the symmetry of the diagram, it is clear that the degree of reinforcement on the one side is <i>precisely</i> countered by the degree of destruction on the other side. Because of the symmetry of the interaction, there is no net bonding or antibonding effect. Orbital overlaps for which some degree of mixing is expected and some for which there is not are shown in <a href="#fig3.17">Figs. 3.17</a> and <a href="#fig3.18">3.18</a>.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">Armed with <a href="#fig3.15">Figure 3.15</a>, one can construct energy level diagrams for the first <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>row homodiatomic molecules Li<sub>2</sub> to Ne<sub>2</sub>. It is best to start at the right-hand side of the periodic table with the hypothetical Ne<sub>2</sub> since there are complications for the earlier elements.</p>
<p class="indent">When considering the bonding of the diatomics Li<sub>2</sub> to Ne<sub>2</sub>, strictly speaking, contributions from the 1<i>s</i> orbital overlaps should be included in the energy level diagrams, but they aren&#x2019;t. Why? As the nuclear charge on an atom builds up, the energy levels of all atomic orbitals drop. This is because the orbitals contract under the influence of the increasing nuclear charge. For the diatomics Li<sub>2</sub> to Ne<sub>2</sub>, the 1<i>s</i> orbital contracts sufficiently far to make its size so small that there is <i>relatively little</i> effective overlap with the 1<i>s</i> orbital of the second atom. Thus electrons in the 1<i>s</i> orbitals play relatively little part in the bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">For most purposes, it is only ever necessary to consider the valence orbital electrons as playing any part in the bonding and all non-valence orbitals can be omitted from the diagram. This is indeed the basis for making the distinction between core and valence electrons. Of course there is nothing wrong with writing them in, but it is not <i>necessary</i> to do so.</p>
<h3 class="sub">Energy level diagram for Ne<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">A stable molecule Ne<sub>2</sub> does not exist. Neon is a monoatomic gas. It is instructive to build up the energy level diagram in order to see why neon is monoatomic rather than diatomic. The electronic configuration of Ne is &#x005B;He&#x005D;2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>6</sup> meaning that there are eight valence electrons, and 16 in Ne<sub>2</sub>. These 16 electrons are fed in to the energy level diagram as in <a href="#fig3.19">Fig. 3.19</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">First, the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> orbital is bonding, but the bonding energy arising from its population is counteracted by equivalent energy increases experienced through population of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>*orbitals. Occupancy of these two orbitals taken <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>together make no net effect to the bonding. Secondly, for similar reasons, the four electrons of the two occupied <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals are counteracted by the those of the two occupied <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals. These eight electrons therefore make no net contribution to the bonding. Thirdly, the bonding effect arising from population of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbitals is counteracted by population of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbitals. The bond order is therefore 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; 2 &#x002B; (&#x2013;2) &#x002B; 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) = 0. The molecule does not exist, although a transiently stable Ne<sub>2</sub> species does exist through van der Waal interactions.</p>
<h3 class="sub">Energy level diagram for F<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">The electronic configuration of the fluorine atom is &#x005B;He&#x005D;2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>5</sup>, a total of seven valence electrons. Fourteen electrons therefore populate the energy level diagram of F<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#fig3.20">Fig. 3.20</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The bond order of F<sub>2</sub> is calculated as follows. Again the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>* electrons make no net contribution to the bonding. This is also true for the eight electrons that populate the <i>&#x03C0;</i> and <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals. This leaves just the two electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital. These are <i>not</i> counteracted by any electrons in the unoccupied <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbital. These two electrons alone are responsible for holding the two fluorine atoms together.</p>
<p class="indent">The bond order is therefore given by 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; 2 &#x002B; (&#x2013;2) &#x002B;1 = 1, which corresponds to the bond order of the Lewis structure. The structure predicted has no unpaired electrons, that is, F<sub>2</sub> is diamagnetic. The bond energy of F<sub>2 </sub>is 155 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which is actually rather low, while the F&#x2014;F bond length is 141.2 pm. An alternative way to arrive at the bond order is to apply formula 3.12, in which case the bond order is (8 &#x2013; 6)/2 = 1.</p>

<p class="noindent">Recall that the Lewis structure of O<sub>2</sub> predicts a double bond, but fails to account for its paramagnetism. If the molecular orbital energy level diagram representations are to be successful, then paramagnetism must be predicted.</p>
<p class="indent">The electronic configuration of the oxygen atom is &#x005B;He&#x005D;2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>4</sup>. The same energy level diagram as given above is applicable for O<sub>2</sub>, but there are now 12 electrons to feed into the diagram. Since there are two <i>fewer</i> electrons in the molecule relative to F<sub>2</sub>, the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals are no longer fully occupied.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebars"><i>HOMO</i> : the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital.</p>
<p class="sidebars"><i>LUMO</i> : the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The first ten electrons feed in up to the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals (<a href="#fig3.21">Fig. 3.21</a>). There are two more electrons to place and the next available place to put them is in the degenerate <i>&#x03C0;</i>* level. Hund&#x2019;s rule of maximum multiplicity requires that one electrons enters each of the two orbitals so that their spins are parallel. As a consequence, there are two unpaired electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbital. This energy level is the HOMO. The LUMO is the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">The bond order is calculated as follows. Again the contributions from the four electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>* cancel and they make no net contribution to the bond order. The <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbital contribution counts as &#x002B;2 from the four electrons in that degenerate level. The two electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbital contribute 2 &#x00D7; &#x2013;&#x00BD; = &#x2013;1, since the two <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals are each just half occupied. The <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital counts as &#x002B;1 and there are no electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* to counteract these bonding electrons. The bond order is therefore calculated as 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; 1 &#x002B; 2 &#x002B; (2 &#x00D7; &#x2013;&#x00BD;) = 2. Therefore O<sub>2</sub> has a net bond order of &#x002B;2.</p>

<p class="noindent2-b"><b>Fig. 3.21</b> Energy level diagram for O<sub>2</sub>. The two unpaired electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i>* level are those responsible for the paramagnetism of O<sub>2</sub>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent"> <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>This again agrees with that suggested by the Lewis structure, but now the bonding in this MO description is very different to that of the Lewis model. The bond order is the same in the end, but the MO description successfully accounts for the paramagnetism of O<sub>2</sub>, and also for the reactivity of O<sub>2</sub>, which behaves as though it is a diradical (having two unpaired electrons).</p>
<p class="indent">The bond energy for O<sub>2</sub> is found experimentally to be 493 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and the bond length is 120.7 pm. This is considerably stronger and shorter than F<sub>2</sub>. It is interesting that removal of an electron from O<sub>2</sub> results in O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B; </sup>whose bond length is 111.5 pm and bond energy is 643 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Inspection of the energy level diagram reveals that this electron is necessarily removed from the &#x03C0;* level. The bond order calculation for O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> is 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; 1 &#x002B; 2 &#x002B; (&#x2013;&#x00BD;) = 2&#x00BD;&#x00B7; This correlates with a shorter bond length in O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> relative to O<sub>2 </sub>while the loss of an antibonding electron also helps to account for the increased bond energy in O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> relative to O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h3 class="sub">Energy level diagram for N<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">There is a complication at N<sub>2</sub>. For the sake of simplicity, in all the energy level diagrams above, no indication was given of energy scale on the energy level diagram. Further, the fact that electrons in the constructed molecular orbitals <i>might interact with each other</i> was ignored. It was not necessary to include such interactions (although they are there) in the discussion of O<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> since the bond orders and energy level orderings are not affected.</p>
<p class="indent">At N<sub>2</sub> the repulsive interactions between electrons in the various <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbitals must be considered. These repulsions alter the shape of the orbital slightly from that when there are no interactions. Mathematically this is achieved by mixing in the mathematical description of other orbitals with the same symmetry.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider first the 2<i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and 2<i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbitals, which are both symmetry-related (<a href="#fig3.22">Fig. 3.22</a>.) and fairly similar in energy. They therefore interact with each other. The fact that the orbitals are not identical in shape and energy does not matter. The mixing results in a bonding and an antibonding combination.</p>
<p class="indent">When two orbitals with dissimilar energies are allowed to interact, two new orbitals arise. The lower of the two new orbitals is bonding and the higher is antibonding. The lower of the new orbitals is closer in its properties to the lower of the component orbitals. The higher of the new orbitals is closer in its properties to the higher of the component orbitals.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.23</b> The interaction (mixing) of <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub><sup>*</sup></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub><sup>*</sup></i> orbitals.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">The situation for the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> overlap is described by saying that the energy of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> orbital is lowered, in the sense that the lower of the two new orbitals is closer in its properties to the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> than to the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital. The lower of the two new orbitals is described as a modified <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> orbital. Similarly the energy of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital is said to be raised through its modification by interaction with the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> orbital. Both of the new orbitals still possess cylindrical symmetry, so it is in order to describe them as <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbitals. However, being a mixture of <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> orbitals, they are no longer quite <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbitals and so a numerical labelling system is used instead.</p>
<p class="indent">In a similar way, the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub>*</i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbitals also possess the correct symmetry to interact with each other (<a href="#fig3.20">Fig. 3.20</a>). The effect is to modify and <i>lower</i> the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>* orbital and to modify and <i>raise</i> the energy of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>* orbital.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.24</b> An energy level diagram for N<sub>2</sub>.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">There are no other orbitals of the correct symmetry for the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals to overlap with, so any further interactions for them are safely ignored. The results of these interactions when plotted (<a href="#fig3.24">Fig. 3.24</a>) for N<sub>2</sub> show a <i>different</i> <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>ordering for the energy levels in N<sub>2</sub> relative to those of Ne<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbitals are no longer exactly <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>, <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub>*, &#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>, and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>*, they are simply labelled <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>4</sub>. The important feature of this energy level diagram is that the modified <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i> orbital, &#x03C3;<sub>3</sub>, no longer lies <i>below</i> the <i>&#x03C0;</i> level. Instead it is moved <i>above</i> the <i>&#x03C0;</i> level. The consequence of this is that when following the building-up principle, the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals fill <i>before</i> the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub> orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">The calculation of the bond order for N<sub>2</sub> is carried out in exactly the same way as for O<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>. The four electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> orbitals correspond to the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i>* orbitals and more or less cancel each other out. The remaining six electrons occupy three bonding orbitals and are not counterbalanced by any electrons in their respective antibonding orbitals. The bond order calculation is therefore 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;l) &#x002B; 2 &#x002B;1=3. This is convenient since the bond order is the same as found in the Lewis structure.</p>
<h3 class="sub">Energy level diagram for C<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">The diatomic C<sub>2</sub> is not a species that can be put in a bottle, but it can be examined under special conditions. The electronic configuration of C is &#x005B;He&#x005D; 1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup><i>p</i><sup>2</sup>, so carbon possesses four valence electrons. The diatomic therefore has eight electrons with which to populate the energy level diagram. For this and all the remaining first row diatomics, the same energy level as used for N<sub>2</sub> is adequate (<a href="#fig3.25">Fig. 3.25</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig3.25">
<img src="../images/fig3.25.jpg" alt="images" style="margin-left:2em;"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.25</b> Energy level diagram for C<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">In this case, the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> orbitals more or less cancel each other out, and it is permissible to say that they make no net contribution to bonding. There are four electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals that are not counteracted by any electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;*</i> orbital. The bond order calculation is therefore 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; 2 = 2. The net bond order is two. In this case the double bond is composed of two <i>&#x03C0;</i> <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>bonds unsupported by a <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond. By comparison the double bond in ethene is made up from one <i>&#x03C3;</i> and one <i>&#x03C0;</i> bond.</p>
<h3 class="sub">Energy level diagram for B<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">The diatomic B<sub>2</sub> is also not a species that one can put in a bottle, but it also can be detected and studied. Boron possesses three valence electrons as a consequence of its electronic structure 1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>1</sup>. There are therefore six electrons to place into the energy level diagram (<a href="#fig3.26">Fig. 3.26</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Again the four electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> orbitals largely cancel each other out for the purposes of calculating the bond order. The only bonding electrons are the two unpaired electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i> level. The net bond order is therefore 1 &#x002B; (&#x2013;1) &#x002B; (2 &#x00D7; &#x00BD;) = 1. The bond order is 1, but in this case the bond is made up from two half-filled <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.26</b> Energy level diagram for B<sub>2</sub>.</figcaption></figure>
<h3 class="sub">Bonding in Be<sub>2</sub></h3>
<p class="noindent">The diatomic Be<sub>2</sub> is definitely not an isolable species but it can be detected and studied under special conditions. Beryllium has the configuration &#x005B;He&#x005D; 1<i>s</i><sup>2 </sup>and so there are four electrons to place into the energy level diagram (<a href="#fig3.27">Fig. 3.27</a>). These populate the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p class="indent">For Be<sub>2</sub> the bond order is therefore predicted to be zero, since the electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> levels cancel each other out. However, because of the asymmetry in the diagram for the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> levels, there is predicted to be a very slight bonding effect. However Be<sub>2</sub> has only been detected at very low temperatures and the bond energy is only about 4 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, which is too weak for a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; chemical bond. <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a></p>

<h3 class="sub"><b>Bonding in Li<sub>2</sub></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The diatomic molecule Li<sub>2</sub> is known in the gas phase. It has just two electrons to place in the energy level diagram (<a href="#fig3.28">Fig. 3.28</a>) arising from the electronic configuration of &#x005B;He&#x005D; 1<i>s</i><sup>1</sup>. These populate the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> level and the bond order is therefore 1. The molecule is predicted to be diamagnetic, as is the case.</p>
<p class="indent">The bond energy for gas-phase Li<sub>2</sub> (101 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) is considerably less than for H<sub>2</sub> (432 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). Also the bond length in Li<sub>2</sub> (267.3 pm) is very much longer than in H<sub>2</sub> (74.1 pm). Part of the reason for the length of the Li&#x2014;Li bond is the repulsion between the pairs of 1<i>s</i> electrons on each atom. Molecular orbital theory as outlined here shows that Li<sub>2</sub> is more stable than two Li atoms. In practice, when many lithium atoms come together, a more stable form of bonding is achieved in solid lithium metal.</p>

<b>Fig. 3.29</b> Graph showing orbital energies of the first row elements.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">An explanation as to why the energy level diagrams for Li<sub>2</sub> to N<sub>2</sub> show a different ordering of energy levels than O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and Ne<sub>2</sub> wopuld be useful. Why is it necessary to write the <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub> level above the <i>&#x03C0;</i> level for the earlier elements? Examine <a href="#fig3.29">Fig. 3.29</a>, a graph of the orbital energies for the 2<i>s</i> and <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>2<i>p</i> orbitals for the second period. The 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> energy levels start very close to each other on the left hand side of the periodic table and diverge towards the right. This is a consequence of the <i>2s</i> level dropping more rapidly in energy than the 2<i>p</i> level (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.17">Section 1.17</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">One of the factors that affects the extent to which energy levels mix is the closeness of their energies. If orbitals are close in energy, they mix to a larger extent. It is clear from <a href="#fig3.29">Fig. 3.29</a> that the 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> levels are much closer together for the earlier elements. In fact they are not more than 1200 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> apart for the elements Li to N, but at least 1600 kJ mol<sup>-1 </sup>apart for O, F, and Ne. Because of these energy differences 2<i>s</i>&#x2013;2<i>p</i> mixing is important for Li to N but can largely be ignored for O, F, and Ne.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">The principles developed above for homodinuclear molecules also operate for heterodinuclear systems. The main difference is that orbitals which overlap to form bonding and antibonding combinations do not usually start at the same energy. This gives the energy level diagrams a skewed appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">When the two overlapping orbitals are corresponding orbitals of the same element, their energies are necessarily identical. In this situation (<a href="#fig3.30">Fig. 3.30</a>, left), the overlap is at its greatest and &#x0394;<i>E</i><sub>cov</sub>, the measure of covalent bond energy is at a maximum. When one atom is more electronegative than the second, then the energy mismatch results in the orbital overlap being less efficient than in the homodinuclear case. In this case &#x0394;<i>E</i><sub>cov</sub> is smaller.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that the bonding between two dissimilar nuclei is weaker. Certainly the <i>covalent</i> bonding is less, but there is also an <i>ionic</i> contribution to the bonding. This may be very large. Consider a situation in which one of the atoms is <i>much</i> more ionic than the other. The orbital overlap diagram approaches the situation on the right of <a href="#fig3.30">Fig. 3.30</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2-b" style="margin-left:0.5em;text-indent:0.5em;text-align:justify;"><b>Fig. 3.30</b> Overlap between two orbitals of the same and dissimilar energies. In the centre, one atom is more electronegative than the second, while on the right, one atom is much more electronegative than the second.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">In a situation where dissimilar orbitals overlap, the bonding combination is more similar in appearance and energy to the lower energy contributing orbital, than to the higher energy contributing orbital. Corresponding to this, the antibonding combination is more similar in energy and appearance to the higher energy contributing orbital. This can be expressed differently by <a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a>saying that the bonding combination orbital is the lower energy contributing orbital, but somewhat modified. The antibonding combination therefore represents a modified orbital form of the higher energy contributing orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="#fig3.30">Fig. 3.30</a>, for two atoms in which the electronegative difference is great, it should be clear that the bonding combination orbital must therefore be, in essence, a very slightly modified atomic orbital from the more electronegative atom. If there is one electron in each of the contributing atomic orbitals before mixing, an electron is in effect transferred from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative atom. The situation approaches the formation of an ion pair in which there is a very small covalent contribution to the overall bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">The total bonding is expressed as a combination of a covalent contribution and an ionic contribution.</p>

<p class="noindent">In many cases the ionic contribution is very large. A situation in which this is the case would be the formation of an ion pair from sodium and chlorine.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lewis representation shows the complete transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine. The molecular orbital diagram (<a href="#fig3.30">Fig. 3.30</a>, right) would suggest that there is at least a small covalent contribution to the bonding.</p>

<p class="indent">If the difference in electronegativities of the two component atoms is less extreme then the covalent contribution to the total bond is larger and from the ionic contribution smaller. There is a &#x2018;spectrum&#x2019; of bond natures with all real bonding interactions lying between the two extremes of the purely covalent and the purely ionic.</p>
<h3 class="sub"><b>Hydrogen fluoride</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to construct an energy level diagram for HF it is necessary to have some idea as to the relative energies of the valence orbitals, 1<i>s</i> for hydrogen and 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> for fluorine. These are indicated approximately in <a href="#fig3.31">Fig. 3.31</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1<i>s</i> hydrogen orbital is well above the fluorine 2<i>s</i> orbital and to a lesser extent above the 2<i>p</i> level. The effect of the very large difference in energies between the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital and the fluorine 2<i>s</i> orbital is that there is approximately no interaction. This is despite the fact that two <i>s</i> type orbitals are permitted to overlap by their symmetry. However by symmetry, and because of the lesser energy difference, the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital does mix with the fluorine 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital. The result is a bonding and an antibonding level. By symmetry, the fluorine 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals are unable to interact with the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Two ways to denote that the fluorine atom carries a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge in HF.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">According to the earlier discussion, the <i>&#x03C3;</i>* orbital is largely an atomic hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital. The <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonding orbital is largely a fluorine 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital. In effect there is considerable transfer of electron density from hydrogen atom to fluorine. This results in a charge imbalance in the molecule, with the hydrogen end somewhat positive and the fluorine end somewhat negative. The 2<i>s</i>, 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>, and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals are all non-bonding, the 2<i>s</i> orbital because of an energy mismatch and the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals because there are no symmetry related orbitals with which they may interact. Note they are unused in <a href="#fig3.31">Fig. 3.31</a>. <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a></p>

<p class="indent">In constructing <a href="#fig3.31">Fig. 3.31</a> some liberties were taken. In reality, some small contribution should be considered from the fluorine 2<i>s</i> orbital, perhaps by slightly mixing it with the fluorine 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital (hybridization). Also, the energy of the non-bonding <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals (fluorine 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> atomic orbitals) in the HF need not lie <i>precisely</i> at the same level as the atomic orbitals in fluorine, after all, their environment is inside a <i>molecule</i> rather than an <i>atom</i>.</p>
<h3 class="sub"><b>Carbon monoxide, CN<sup>&#x2013;</sup></b>, <b>and NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Carbon, &#x005B;He&#x005D;<sup>2</sup><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>, possesses four valence electrons. Oxygen, &#x005B;He&#x005D;2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>4 </sup>possesses six valence electrons. An energy level diagram for carbon monoxide should therefore account for the placing of these ten valence electrons. Both carbon and oxygen have populated <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> orbitals and it is therefore appropriate to adapt the energy level diagrams used above for homodinuclear diatomics. The form of the energy level diagram is shown in <a href="#fig3.32">Fig. 3.32</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that the oxygen 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> orbitals are lower in energy than the carbon 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> orbitals. This is because of the greater effective nuclear charge for oxygen. The form of the diagram is therefore slightly asymmetric. The ordering of the energy levels in the diagram follows the same ordering as in the diagram for N<sub>2</sub>, which is, of course, also a 10-electron system. This correspondence of electronic configuration means that N<sub>2</sub> and CO are said to be <i>isoelectronic</i>. Both these two molecules are isoelectronic with other diatomics, notably CN<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Therefore the same ordering in the energy level diagram is applicable for these two molecules, the only differences being in the absolute values for the various energy levels. <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 3: Diatomic molecules</a></p>

<p class="indent">A closer examination of the bonding situation for CO will reveal that <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3 </sub>corresponds to an orbital that is largely a carbon-based lone pair. The <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> level is largely an oxygen lone pair with <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> being the carbon&#x2013;oxygen &#x03C3; bond. The <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals are unoccupied. From the point of view of the coordination chemistry of CO, the filled <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub> and empty <i>&#x03C0;</i>* orbitals are critical since they are involved in bonding interactions with various transition metal orbitals.</p></section>
