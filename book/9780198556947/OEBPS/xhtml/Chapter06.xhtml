<h1 class="main" style="width:70%;">6 The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</h1>
<p class="noindent">The concept in which two atomic orbitals are mixed by linear combinations into molecular orbitals (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) is not limited to diatomic molecules. For polyatomic molecules, some linear combinations of atomic orbitals delocalize over the <i>entire</i> molecule. It is the intention here to introduce some principles pictorially for a few simple molecules. The reader should be aware that the way to determine the form of molecular orbitals for anything other than simple molecules is <i>not</i> from a pictorial analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">As other books demonstrate, and has already been seen earlier, <i>symmetry</i> is extremely important in bonding theory. An understanding of the symmetry of a molecule is approached through a <i>group theory</i> analysis. A group theory analysis of the bonding in a molecule allows prediction of which combinations of atomic orbitals lead to bonding, antibonding, and nonbonding molecular orbitals. This is done in a non-pictorial fashion, and once the analysis is complete the results plotted to allow a visualization of the various orbital overlaps.</p>
<p class="indent">A group theory analysis does not give a prediction of the shape of a molecule. The VSEPR method is the simplest convenient predictor of molecular shape. Once the shape is assigned, a group theory analysis allows the determination of which linear combination of atomic orbitals are allowed for that shape. Neither does a group theory analysis allow a determination of the energies of the resulting molecular orbitals, only those which are possible. Quantum-mechanical calculations or experimental methods such as photoelectron spectroscopy are necessary in order to give an indication of the energy values of energy levels associated with particular molecular orbitals.</p>

<p class="noindent">An analysis of the molecular orbitals in BeH<sub>2</sub> illustrates some useful principles. A VSEPR analysis predicts a linear structure based upon two electron pairs. As before, the molecular axis is defined as the <i>z</i>-axis.</p>
<p class="indent">As always in this type of analysis, the aim is not to determine what processes occur on bringing two hydrogen atoms and one beryllium atoms together in some reaction vessel. It is to represent the bonding of a molecule, once formed, using an analysis based upon the atomic orbitals of the component atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">It is often convenient to examine first the peripheral atoms, the two hydrogens in this case, and to analyse their mutual interactions. It does not matter that the two hydrogen atoms are quite a distance apart. Since the wave <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>functions for the two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals have a value even at the distances involved in BeH<sub>2</sub>, there will be at least some interaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The discussion of <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> indicated how two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals interact in H<sub>2</sub>. The situation is similar for BeH<sub>2</sub>, but the <i>degree</i> of interaction is far less because of the greater distance. The result is an in-phase and an out-of-phase combination (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>), with little energy difference between the two. Each of the in-phase and out-of-phase combinations is a <i>single</i> orbital consisting of two lobes.</p>
<p class="indent">The two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals are now &#x2018;prepared&#x2019; for interaction with the beryllium atomic orbitals. The next step is to determine which beryllium atomic orbitals interact with the prepared in- and out-of-phase hydrogen orbitals. It is clear that the beryllium 2<i>s</i> orbital is set to interact with the in-phase combination orbital (<a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). On the other hand, the 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital is set to interact with the out-of-phase combination orbital (<a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>). In each case the interactions generate new in-phase and out-of-phase combinations. In <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>neither case are the diagrams drawn to scale. In each pair of interactions, the lower orbital is bonding and the upper orbital is antibonding.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">This leaves the beryllium 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals. Inspection shows that there will be zero overlap of these with whatever form the hydrogen orbitals are presented to them. This is illustrated for the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> orbital. The beryllium 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals are therefore unaffected by interaction with hydrogen orbitals and these orbitals <i>remain</i> as atomic, non-bonding, orbitals.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that all four orbitals generated through the interaction of the beryllium 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> orbitals with the hydrogen orbitals possess <i>&#x03C3;</i> symmetry. The two antibonding combinations are labelled <i>&#x03C3;</i>* as before. In addition it is convenient to distinguish the orbitals with the subscript labels <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> to indicate from which beryllium atomic orbitals they originate. Unfortunately it is rather common for textbooks to use a variety of nomenclature for such levels and the reader must therefore be aware of this potential for confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">All that remains is to plot the resulting interactions out on an energy level diagram. The pictorial analysis gives no real clue as to the order in which the various molecular orbitals should be written. In fact, it is not normally possible to write down such an order without a quantum-mechanical calculation or spectroscopie measurement, but the ordering in <a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a> is probably correct.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Lewis and hybrid valence bond descriptions of bonding, two equivalent localized Be&#x2014;H bonds are predicted. In the molecular orbital approach the situation is subtly different. There are four electrons distributed <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>over two bonding <i>&#x03C3;</i> orbitals, <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>p</sub></i>, giving the same total of two bonds. However the bonds are <i>molecular orbitals</i> delocalized over <i>three</i> atoms and the energy of each molecular orbital is clearly <i>different</i>.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">The first step is to define the coordinate axes. By convention and for convenience, the <i>z</i>-axis is drawn through the oxygen atom and along a line between the hydrogen atoms. The plane of the molecule is taken as the <i>xz</i> plane and the plane normal to the molecular plane as the <i>yz</i> plane.</p>
<p class="indent">The shape is correctly predicted to be bent by the VSEPR method As for BeH<sub>2</sub>, it is convenient to start be examining the interactions of the peripheral hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>). The resulting interactions are closely related to the BeH<sub>2</sub> situation, but the spine of the molecule is now bent.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 6.5</b> The in-phase and out-of-phase combination of the two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals in water as a preparation for interaction with the oxygen atomic orbitals.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">As for BeH<sub>2</sub> the way forward is to examine which of the oxygen atomic orbitals interact with these two hydrogen combination orbitals. In this case, two oxygen orbitals (the 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals) interact with the in-phase hydrogen combination. These are represented in <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">This presents a minor complication, and this is how to write down an energy level diagram showing the interaction between <i>three</i> (O 2<i>s</i>, O 2<i>p</i>, and 2H 1<i>s</i> in-phase) interacting orbitals. For our purposes it is sufficient to quote the result that if a number, call it <i>n</i>, of orbitals mix together, they do so in such a way as to form exactly the same number, <i>n</i>, of resulting molecular orbitals.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of mixing three orbitals, it is generally expected to form one strongly bonding orbital, one strongly antibonding orbital, and one orbital intermediate in nature (<a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>). This might be non-bonding or weakly bonding or weakly antibonding relative to the component orbitals. Only a <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>more detailed calculation or measurement is going to give the nature of the intermediate orbital more precisely.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 6.7</b> The interaction of two orbitals on one atom with another orbital.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">The situation for the oxygen 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> orbital is simpler and related to the interaction of the beryllium 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital with the hydrogen out-of-phase combination except that again the spine of the molecule is bent. The resulting bonding and antibonding combination orbitals (<a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>) are conveniently labelled <i>&#x03C3;<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>&#x03C3;*<sub>x</sub></i>. The remaining oxygen orbital, 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> is the orbital out of the molecular plane and it is not possible to write down any combination of hydrogen orbitals which display any net overlap with this orbital. The oxygen 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbital thus remains an oxygen atomic orbital in the water molecule and is non-bonding. To a first approximation, it will appear at the same level in the energy level diagram as in the atom.</p>
<p class="indent">As for BeH<sub>2</sub>, there are two bonding <i>&#x03C3;</i>-type molecular orbitals. Again their energies are different. The two equivalent electron lone pairs of the Lewis and valence bond models are replaced by two non-equivalent non-bonding molecular orbitals, delocalized in one case over the three atoms (<a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In addition, the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s,z</sub></i> non-bonding orbital, while labelled non-bonding to make a point, when calculated out is <i>marginally</i> bonding and also makes a contribution. This main lobe of this orbital is directed out along the <i>z</i>-axis and is effectively a lone pair, while the minor lobe directed between the <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>hydrogen atoms overlaps with the hydrogen in-phase pair combination to make a weak bonding interaction. The filled atomic 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbital makes the second lone pair. As in the Lewis and valence bond model there are effectively two lone pairs, but their nature is rather different in the molecular orbital model (<a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The relationship between BeH<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O</h2>
<p class="noindent">Both BeH<sub>2</sub> and OH<sub>2</sub> are molecules of an AX<sub>2</sub> type. In effect, BeH<sub>2</sub> is a special case of a general AB<sub>2</sub> molecule whose bond angle is 180&#x00B0;. It is instructive to examine the effect upon the energies of the four occupied molecular orbitals on moving from a linear AX<sub>2</sub> molecule towards a bent molecule with a bond angle of <i>&#x03B8;</i>&#x00B0;. <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a></p>


<p class="indent">The first point to notice is that there is a change of <i>z</i>-axis&#x0021; By convention, in a linear molecule (<i>&#x03B8;</i> = 180&#x00B0;) the <i>z</i>-axis is the molecular axis. Also by convention the <i>z</i>-axis in a bent molecule bisects the X&#x2014;A&#x2014;X bond. So the instant <i>&#x03B8;</i> becomes less than 180&#x00B0; the <i>x</i>-axis is relabelled <i>z</i> and <i>vice versa</i>. Confusing, perhaps, but that&#x2019;s the way it is.</p>
<p class="indent">In a linear molecule the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals (which are labelled the 2<i>p<sub>z </sub></i>and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals immediately the bond angle is made less than 180&#x00B0;) are non-bonding and degenerate. No matter what the bond angle, the 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbital is non-bonding, so its energy remains constant. However as soon as the bond angle falls below 180&#x00B0; the 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital (2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> when the bond angle is 180&#x00B0;) has a net overlap with the in-phase hydrogen 1<i>s</i> pair combination. When the bond angle is very close to 180&#x00B0; it is easy to see that the overlap is very small and that the energy of this bonding orbital must therefore be very close to that of the non-bonding 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbital. The overlap becomes better as the bond angle closes and so its energy drops. When the bond angle is less than 180&#x00B0;, this orbital is labelled <i>&#x03C3;<sub>z</sub></i>. In water, for which the bond angle <i>&#x2220;</i> H&#x2014; O&#x2014;H = 104.5&#x00B0;, this orbital is slightly bonding. The change of energies with bond angle for all the relevant orbitals can be plotted on a <i>Walsh diagram</i> (<a href="#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are other orbitals to consider however. Quantum-mechanical calculations also give values for the change in energy of the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>x</sub></i> (labelled <i>&#x03C3;<sub>z </sub></i>for <i>&#x03B8;</i> = 180&#x00B0;) and <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> orbitals. Significantly, the <i>&#x03C3;<sub>z</sub></i> orbital (<i>&#x03B8;</i> = 180&#x00B0;) rises in energy (is destabilized) as <i>&#x03B8;</i> falls (and is now labelled <i>&#x03C3;<sub>x</sub></i>). This is because of a decreasing overlap between the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> (&#x03B8; &#x003C; 180&#x00B0;) orbital and the two hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbitals as &#x03B8; falls. On the other hand, the bending process also results in a slight increase in the 1<i>s&#x2013;</i>1<i>s</i> overlap and this causes <i>&#x03C3;<sub>s</sub></i> to stabilize very slightly.</p>
<p class="indent">The geometry that will be adopted by the real AX<sub>2</sub> molecule will be that in which the <i>total</i> energy for <i>all</i> the electrons in that molecule is a <i>minimum</i>. For the linear BeH<sub>2</sub> only two of the orbitals in question are populated and the minimum is at <i>&#x03B8;</i> = 180&#x00B0;. For water in which all four orbitals are populated, it is a question of determining the bond angle for which the summed energies of the four populated orbitals is at a minimum. This occurs for <i>&#x03B8;</i> = 104.5&#x00B0;.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>z</i>-axis for BH<sub>3</sub> is taken as out of the plane of the molecule. One way to illustrate the results of a molecular orbital approach is as follows. Again the peripheral hydrogen orbitals are combined together to form a set of orbitals ready to present to the boron atomic orbitals. The situation for the hydrogen orbitals is less obvious than for water since there are three orbitals to mix rather than two. In fact, for a trigonal molecule such as BH<sub>3</sub>, these mix into <i>two</i> energy levels, the upper of which consists of a degenerate pair of orbitals (<a href="#fig6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>). The degenerate pair of orbitals look at first sight as though they should not be degenerate, but while formal group theory methods demonstrate that they are, it is beyond the scope of this book to show this.</p>

<p class="indent">It now remains to consider the mixing of each of these combination orbitals with the boron atomic orbitals. The first point is that the out-of-plane 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital cannot mix with any of these combination orbitals. The effective overlap is always zero. The boron 2<i>s</i> orbital is set to mix with the symmetric hydrogen combination (<a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>, left). There is a corresponding antibonding combination. The boron 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals each form bonding interactions with one of the degenerate pair of prepared hydrogen orbitals.

It is clear that each B&#x2014;F interaction consists primarily of a single bond. The extra <i>&#x03C0;</i> interaction is a bond spread between three B&#x2014;F <i>&#x03C3;</i> interactions.

<p class="indent">Experimental photoelectron spectroscopic data does suggest two distinct bonding levels for methane, and not one as would be expected from the valence bond model. Results such as this are one reason why the molecular orbital model is usually used when considering the spectroscopie properties of molecules.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">It is perfectly possible to construct an energy level diagram for benzene, however it is rather complex because each carbon has four valence orbitals and each hydrogen one, making 30 in total and a crowded diagram&#x0021; For most purposes the <i>&#x03C3;</i> and <i>&#x03C3;</i>* bond framework is relatively uninteresting and it is the interaction of the out-of-plane <i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals with each other that are most of interest from a reactivity point of view.</p>
<p class="indent">It is beyond the scope of this book to demonstrate a derivation of the forms of the various linear combinations of the out-of-plane <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals, but it is in order to illustrate the result. For benzene, the six atomic 2<i>p</i> orbitals combine to form six molecular orbitals. Two pairs of these are degenerate, meaning that there are four energy levels in total. There is a rather interesting <a id="page_90" class="page">Page 90, Chapter 6: The MO approach and polyatomic molecules</a>geometrical construction that can be used to illustrate (<a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>) the relative energy of these levels.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 6.19</b> Construction of a diagram to show the relative energy levels for the benzene <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">If a hexagon is inscribed inside a circle so that the vertices just intersect with the circle, and one vertex is placed at the lowest point of the circle, then the relative height of the other vertices above the lowest represents the relative energy of the other molecular orbital combinations. Each of the carbon 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals is populated by one electron. There are therefore six valence electrons in the <i>&#x03C0;</i> system. Inspection of the diagram above shows that these fit neatly into the lower three bonding levels, all of which are bonding. The molecular orbital picture of the bonding therefore involves one very bonding orbital and a degenerate set of two molecular orbitals that are also bonding, but less so. The linear combinations of carbon 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals for the bonding orbitals are illustrated in <a href="#fig6.20">Fig. 6.20</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The most bonding orbital shows no nodal planes other than that in the plane of the molecule. Each of the next lowest orbitals shows one out-of-plane node. While not illustrated, the pattern follows for the antibonding levels with the least antibonding level showing two nodes and the most antibonding showing three nodes.</p>
