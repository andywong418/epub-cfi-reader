<h1 class="main"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">This short book is intended to introduce some concepts of chemical bonding in a descriptive and essentially non-mathematical fashion. The coverage is not intended to be rigorous and is aimed at the student rather than the lecturer. It is therefore hoped that this short text will find a place <i>alongside</i> textbooks containing more detailed formal coverage and mathematical descriptions. A complementary discussion of the bonding in transition metal systems is included in a further title in this Primer series.</p>
<p class="fmindent">The electron density diagrams were calculated with the HyperCard&#x2122; program Hyperorbitals. I am very grateful to many people for their help during the preparation of this book, especially to Duncan Bruce, Alison Cherry, Bill Clegg, Mike Morris, and Barry Pickup for their comments and corrections of some of my misconceptions. I am also grateful to Douglas W. Franco of the Instituto de Fisica e Quimica de S&#x00E3;o Carlos-USP, Brazil, at where a large part of the manuscript was prepared.</p>
