<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series provides explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Mike Mingos has presented an alternative style of book giving a glossary of key terms and concepts within the subject. The choice of items is relevant to anyone starting an undergraduate course in chemistry and this book will be an essential companion to other text books. The rapid access to the core concepts will be invaluable to all students. This is achieved with the style one would expect from a writer who himself has contributed substantially to the way we think about inorganic chemistry.</p>
