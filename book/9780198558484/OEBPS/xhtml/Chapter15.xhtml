<h2 class="h2">Sandwich compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sandwich compounds have two planar cyclic ligands bonded through their faces to a metal atom. Some typical examples are illustrated in the margin:</p>
<p class="indent">For transition metal sandwich compounds the <i>effective atomic number rule</i> is commonly obeyed. Each C&#x2013;H fragment donates one &#x03C0;-electron for bonding and the metal contributes all its valence electrons for bonding. Examples, of this procedure are illustrated below.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In these complexes the organic cyclic ligands are behaving as &#x03C0;-Lewis donors to the metal ions.The lanthanides and actinides form sandwich compounds with C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub> but these do not conform to the effective atomic number rule. There are also examples of triple decker sandwiches, half sandwiches, and bent sandwiches as illustrated in the margin.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>Stability</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In everyday language a stable compound is one which may be stored unchanged in a container over a long period of time. In chemical terms a much more careful definition has to be adopted and it has to be specified whether the compound maintains its integrity for thermodynamic or kinetic reasons. The temperature dependence of the rates of reaction and the <i>free energies</i> of reactions also require that the conditions of stability must be defined precisely. For a specific compound MX there are a number of possible decomposition reactions which could lead to its decomposition without the intervention of any external reagents. Such reactions may be described as <i>intrinsic reactions</i> and they may have either positive or negative free energies of reaction associated with them. Alternatively, there are reactions involving external reagents and particularly those involving atmospheric gases and H<sub>2</sub>O which cause the decomposition of the compound. (Although N<sub>2</sub> is normally regarded as an inert gas there are compounds which are sufficiently reactive to react with it to form either dinitrogen compounds or nitrides.) These may be described as <i>extrinsic reactions</i> and may also have positive or negative free energies, but differ from intrinsic reactions because if the compound is isolated from the reactive gases or moisture then it will not decompose. For the intrinsic and extrinsic reactions the rates of the possible decomposition reactions, i.e. the activation energies for the reactions, are also important in deciding whether a compound has a long half-life. Kinetic effects are particularly prone to steric effects of ligands which hinder the attack of the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules on the central atom. The range of possibilities arising from the interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors is summarized in the following table.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>Steric effects</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Steric effects can play an important role in many areas of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>1. Unusual co-ordination numbers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Ligands which have large organic pendant groups screen the metal from the approach of other ligands and also limit the number of ligands which can be placed around the metal. Therefore lower co-ordination numbers are favoured.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>2. Multiple bond formation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The silicon analogue of ethene Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> cannot be isolated but when the Hs are replaced by bulky R groups, the compounds Si<sub>2</sub>R<sub>4</sub> are formed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>3. Stable radicals</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Group IV compounds in their (+3) oxidation state may be isolated because the following dimerization process is hindered if R is large:</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent"><i>4. Alternative co-ordination geometries</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The tetrahedron provides a more effective way of arranging four ligands around a metal to minimize the steric repulsions compared with the alternative square planar geometry. Therefore, larger ligands favour the tetrahedral geometry at the expense of the square-planar.</p>
