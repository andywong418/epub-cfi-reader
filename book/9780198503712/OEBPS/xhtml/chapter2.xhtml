<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The simple ultrasonic cleaning bath is by far the most widely available and cheapest source of ultrasonic irradiation for the chemical laboratory. It is for this reason that so many sonochemists begin their studies using cleaning baths. Unfortunately, despite its convenience it is not a particularly powerful source and so sometimes researchers can be disappointed with results. Nevertheless a lot can be achieved even with such a simple piece of apparatus.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.1">
<h1 class="h1"><b>2.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Bath construction</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">The construction of an ultrasonic cleaning bath is very simple&#x2014;a laboratory model generally consists of a stainless steel tank of rectangular cross-section with either one or several transducers (depending on bath size) firmly attached underneath the flat base. Generally piezoelectric transducers are used and these are bonded with epoxy resin. Some tanks, particularly the larger sizes, also have some form of thermostatted heater. A few modern laboratory-scale models have adjustable power but these are in a minority (<a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>). The frequency and power of an ultrasonic bath depends upon the type and number of transducers used in its construction. Generally the ultrasonic power available in a bath using modem piezoelectric transducers is of quite low intensity of the order of 1&#x2013;5 W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> with an operating frequency of<a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>approximately 40 kHz. There are a few variants on this design in that some baths operate at different (but fixed) frequencies. Some cleaning baths also operate with a &#x2018;frequency sweep&#x2019; of a few kHz about a central frequency. The sweep is designed to avoid standing waves in the tank. In this way every part of an article for cleaning is thus subjected to the cavitation zone since the nodes in the waves alternate in height from the base.</p>

<p class="indent">The smallest baths suitable for sonochemistry are of about 1.5-litre capacity and a single transducer is sufficient to drive this with a power rating of around 50 W. Larger systems up to 50 000 litres are commercially available, and employ an array of transducers on the base to introduce uniform power density into the liquid. A real problem when trying to reproduce work reported in the literature is that ultrasonic baths operate at frequencies and powers dependent upon the transducers employed and with geometries which are specific to the particular manufacturer. This means that it is difficult to make direct comparisons between studies done in different makes (or models) of ultrasonic bath.</p>
<p class="indent">The liquid in the bath will normally be water containing a small quantity of surfactant. This is termed the coupling medium because it acts as the conduit for ultrasonic energy from the transducers in the base into the water and thence into any container dipped in the water. When water is used the upper limit for operational temperatures cannot exceed 100 &#x00B0;C. A change in medium will allow a greater range of temperature to be studied but this will also result in a change in energy transfer from transducer to the contents of the reaction vessel. Temperature control in baths around ambient temperatures is poor because the passage of power ultrasound through the bath liquid generates a small amount of heat. The system can be operated under thermostatic control at temperatures above that which is reached on thermal equilibration of the bath under its normal working conditions. It is also vitally important to record the temperature inside the reaction vessel during sonication since this generally tends to be a few degrees above that of the bath itself due to ultrasonic heating through the walls of the immersed reaction vessel. Temperature control is dealt with in detail in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a> below.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>2.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Choosing the correct type of ultrasonic hath</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Not all commercially available ultrasonic cleaning baths are suitable for sonochemistry, and some baths, after extended usage, can lose power either through the denaturing of the piezoelectric transducer or a weakness in the transducer bonding to the base. The ideal bath must generate sufficient power to promote cavitation within the reaction vessel when it is immersed in the bath, i.e. enough power to penetrate the walls of the reaction vessel. Naturally the bath must also be large enough to accommodate the reaction vessel used.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is a bath available in the laboratory, it can easily be established whether it is suitable for sonochemistry by subjecting it to the foil test. The<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>bath should first be filled with water containing some 1 or 2 per cent surfactant&#x2014;this reduces the surface tension of the water and permits much more even cavitation in the bath water. Indeed when the bath contains just tap water a distinct change in &#x2018;pitch&#x2019; can be detected as the detergent is added (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.5">Section 2.5</a>). A piece of ordinary aluminium kitchen foil about six inches square should be dipped into the bath (it is best to avoid immersing fingers into the sonicated bath liquid). After 30 seconds remove the foil and if it is liberally perforated then the bath has passed its test and is powerful enough for sonochemistry.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.3">
<h1 class="h1"><b>2.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Setting up an ultrasonic cleaning bath for sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Although it is possible to use the bath itself as a reaction vessel this is seldom done because of the problems involved in corrosion of the bath walls and containment of any evolved vapours and gases. Normal usage therefore involves the immersion of standard glass reaction vessels into the bath [1]. This is of great importance, since conventional glass apparatus can simply be transferred into the bath&#x2014;this means that an inert atmosphere or a static pressure can be readily achieved and maintained throughout a sonochemical reaction which involves an ultrasonic bath.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Positioning the reaction vessel</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It is a common mistake in sonochemistry to assume that all that is required to achieve significant results is that the reaction vessel should simply be immersed in the water and the powers switched on. Consider the way in which the bath has been constructed. The ultrasonic transducer(s) will, most likely, be attached to the underside of the metallic base of the bath and the most intense power will be found directly above a transducer. However, the ultrasonic power in the bath liquid will not be uniform with distance from the base. This is because ultrasound, like any sound, passes through water in the form of a wave, and the wave will have positions of maximum amplitude at multiples of the half-wavelength of sound (<i>&#x03BB;</i>) in the medium. These distances may be calculated using the simple eqn (2.1).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The velocity of sound (<i>&#x03BD;</i>) through water is approximately 1500 ms<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> so that for a transducer operating at a frequency (<i>f</i>) of 40 kHz the wavelength of the ultrasound in water will be 3.75 cm. We may expect the maximum effect to occur at vertical intervals of 1.8 cm. This series of horizontal regions of high intensity can be located by sonicating a large piece of aluminium foil placed vertically in the bath. A number of distinct horizontal series of perforations appear after some 30 seconds immersion. Towards the base of the bath, close to the emitting surface, there is confusion in the standing wave pattern. In this nearfield region, the standing waves are much closer together (<a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). For<a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>larger baths where measurements can be taken at greater distances from the emitter the standing wave pattern reverts to half-wavelengths (see <a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Using a series of foil sheets the power regions of the bath can be quite accurately identified because the maximum perforations occur at maximum intensity.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally the reaction vessel should be located at the point where the maximum sonochemical effect can be achieved. Observation of the surface of the reaction solution during vertical adjustment of vessel depth will show the optimum position by the point at which maximum surface disturbance occurs. For a bath with a single transducer on the base this is a simple task since the reaction vessel must be located vertically above the single transducer. For a bath with multiple transducers the foil &#x2018;mapping&#x2019; technique can be used to locate the regions of most intense power for horizontal positioning before the depth is established. Another approach to the determination of the way in which the &#x2018;sonic energy&#x2019; is distributed within the bath is the use of thermistor probes [2]. Pugin has shown that the distribution of ultrasonic energy is not at all homogeneous by measuring the local temperature at different places in the sonicated media [3]. Maxima and minima appear, depending on the shape of the vessel, the liquid height, and the input power. Once the correct position for the reaction vessel has been identified it is a simple matter to arrange stands and clamps in order to locate it in the required position. Essentially this will act as a template for further reactions, since repeated use of the same vessel in the same location in the bath should give reasonably reproducible results.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Temperature control</b></p>
<p class="noindent">All ultrasonic baths warm up under the influence of the transducers in the base, and this creates certain problems in terms of both the effectiveness and reproducibility of the sonochemical results obtained. The simplest solution to the problem is to determine the &#x2018;equilibrium&#x2019; temperature of the bath (i.e. the maximum temperature which the water reaches and maintains when operating continuously under ambient conditions) and perform most reactions under these conditions. For small baths this is about 45 &#x00B0;C and so, before starting any experiments, it is advisable to fill it with hot water so that equilibrium temperature is attained in the shortest time possible. It is possible to thermostat the bath above this temperature using a heater. Such heaters are normally integrated into cleaning baths attached to the outside of the tank walls.</p>
<p class="indent">Three solutions are available to the problem of operating at room temperature or below:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(i) operate for very short periods with cold water in the tank (the temperature can be assumed to remain essentially constant for short bursts of sonication);</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(ii) circulate thermostatted cooling water through the tank; or</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(iii) add ice.</p>
<p class="indent">If the bath is equipped with a cooling coil or ice is used, it must be remembered that solids and inserts will disturb the normal propagation of ultrasound<a id="page_46" class="page">page 46, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>through the bath and so alter its characteristics. Whatever method is chosen for temperature control, it must be emphasised that it is the temperature inside the reaction vessel which must be monitored as this is often a few degrees above that of the bulk bath liquid itself.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.4">
<h1 class="h1"><b>2.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The design of the reaction vessel</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Once the bath has been chosen a reaction vessel of the correct design must be chosen. For normal chemical reactions, particularly those involving heat, round-bottomed flasks are utilised, but for sonochemistry in an ultrasonic bath the preferred vessel should be one with a flat bottom, e.g. a conical flask. The reason for this is that the energy is radiating vertically as sound waves from the base of the bath and this energy has to be transferred through the glass walls of the vessel into the reaction itself. The energy transference is much more effective when the sound impinges directly on the flat base of a conical flask rather than hitting the underside of a spherical container at an angle, since when this happens some energy will be reflected away. Another important consideration when using baths to perform sonochemical reactions is that it may be necessary to stir the mixture mechanically to achieve the maximum effect of the ultrasonic irradiation. This is particularly important when using solid &#x2013; liquid mixtures where the solid is neither dispersed nor agitated throughout the reaction by sonication alone and simply sits on the base of the vessel where it is only partially available for reaction. The reasons why additional stirring is so important in such cases is that:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(a) it ensures the reactant powder is exposed as fully as possible to the reaction medium during sonication; and</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(b) with stirring there will be no layer of powder on the base of the vessel which could produce considerable attenuation of the incident sound energy.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>A practical comparison of vessels for use with ultrasonic baths</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A round-bottomed flask was compared with two different sized conical flasks to illustrate the most appropriate vessel shape for use with an ultrasonic bath [4]. A small single transducer bath was used in this exercise, a Kerry Pulsatron 60. This bath operates at 38 kHz, is rated at 50 Watts, and has internal dimensions of 14 &#x00D7; 15 cm and a depth of 10 cm. In each experiment the flask was positioned for maximum sonochemical effect (see above).</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Homogeneous model</i></p>
<p class="noindent">As a model for a homogeneous reaction, the liberation of iodine by sonic irradiation of 4 per cent aqueous potassium iodide (50 cm<sup>3</sup>, containing 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup> carbon tetrachloride) was chosen. The reaction was monitored by periodically withdrawing aliquots and measuring any increase in the liberation of iodine by increases in its absorption spectrum at 351 nm. The results obtained at 30 &#x00B0;C (<a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>) illustrate the great importance of both the source<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>of ultrasound and the type of reaction vessel chosen for sonochemical studies.</p>

<figcaption>
<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 2.3</b> Dependence of iodine liberation on vessel shape</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For a reaction volume of 50 cm<sup>3</sup> a larger effect is obtained in a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> rather than a 100 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask. Both vessels present the preferred configuration for transfer of energy from the bath to the reaction media, i.e. a flat glass base at right angles to the propagating sound wave. The results suggest that the greater base area of the 250 cm<sup>3</sup> flask allows more power input to the system&#x2014;and hence a more effective sonochemical reaction. The use of a 100 cm<sup>3</sup> round-bottomed flask clearly results in a reaction which is inferior to either of these.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Heterogeneous model</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The heterogeneous system chosen was the reduction in particle size of commercial potassium carbonate (1 g) by sonication in dimethylformamide (50 cm<sup>3</sup>). Particle sizes were monitored using a Gallai instrument and the lower limit of particle size reduction was arbitrarily taken to be the point at which the mixture became too cloudy for the instrument to function properly (<a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Particle fragmentation using a 100 cm<sup>3</sup> vessel make it clear that to achieve optimum results mechanical stirring of the heterogeneous mixture is vital. The trend in results for particle size reduction in differently shaped vessels is the same as for the homogeneous reaction in that the flat-bottomed conical was more effective than the round-bottom flask. From these results it can be concluded that the flat bottom of a conical flask is the most effective shape for use in an ultrasonic bath, but that the best results are obtained with vessels where there is a large base area with respect to volume. Clearly stirring is essential for solid/liquid heterogeneous reactions.<a id="page_48" class="page">page 48, The ultrasonic cleaning hath</a></p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>2.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Laboratory demonstrations of the physical effects of ultrasound</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">The short experiments described below have been developed as demonstrations which have been used in lectures and seminars on sonochemistry. They are all of short duration and mainly show aspects of the mechanical effects of power ultrasound. In these examples the bath can be used from cold&#x2014;no special heating or thermostatting is required.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The effect of added detergent</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The bath was filled with pure distilled water and switched on. An audible sound is emitted from the tank due to metal vibrations and the subharmonic content of the ultrasonic source. After a short period during which the water is degassed the sound settles and becomes irregular in volume, the surface is often subject to erratic disturbance during this period. The addition of about 1&#x2013;2 per cent detergent changes the note of the sound and causes a more even and enhanced disturbance of the surface. The reasons for this have been explained above, i.e. the detergent has produced much better coupling between the ultrasonically reverberating base of the tank and the liquid medium contained in it. Hence the bath has become a much more reproducible source of ultrasound.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Ultrasonic degassing</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The cavitational effects which are the basis of sonochemical action are also the reason for the extremely effective use of ultrasound to degas liquids. Once the cavitation bubbles have been formed they fill with any dissolved gas. Such bubbles are not easily collapsed in the compression cycle of the wave due to the fact that they contain gas, and they will continue to grow on<a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>further rarefaction cycles, filling with more gas and eventually floating to the surface. Since the rarefaction cycles are taking place extremely rapidly (around 40 000 times per second using an ultrasonic bath), the bubbles grow so quickly that degassing appears to occur almost instantaneously. The simplest way to demonstrate the effect is to place a flask of sparkling water in an ultrasonic bath. The immediate result is that the liquid is caused to effervesce violently, and the effervescence drops immediately as the flask is removed only to be resuscitated on replacement in the bath.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative approach is to produce the gasified liquid from granular zinc metal in 4 M hydrochloric acid (125 cm<sup>3</sup>) in a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask. After the effervescence has started (about 30 seconds) the liquid becomes opaque with liberated hydrogen. When the flask is touched onto the surface of the water in the ultrasonic bath the cloudiness is cleared as a front which rises from the base. The process can be repeated as long as the zinc remains. It is also worth noting that the production of the gas at the metal surface also changes, from the very large number of tiny bubbles which generate cloudiness to larger bubbles in the ultrasonic field which rapidly rise to the surface leaving the liquid clear. Ultrasonic degassing has found applications in many areas. In its simplest form it is used to degas solvents for use in HPLC. The electroplating of metals invariably involves gas generation at one or other of the electrodes. The physical presence of the gas acts as a barrier to efficient passage of current (discharge of ions), ultrasound can improve electroplating and indeed general electrochemical processes by removing this gas &#x2018;barrier&#x2019; [5]. A somewhat different development involves use of ultrasonic equipment for the removal of volatile constituents in crude oil fractions, i.e. the &#x2018;degassing&#x2019; of low-boiling material such as methane and ethane [6].</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Reactions involving metal surfaces</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two types of reaction involving metals, one in which the metal is a reagent and is consumed in the process, and a second in which the metal functions as a catalyst. Metals which are ultrasonically irradiated in a solvent suffer considerable surface damage. This effect is caused by two possible processes:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(i) the implosion of cavitation bubbles formed from seed nuclei on the surface; or</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(ii) microstreaming of a jet of solvent onto the surface when a cavitation bubble collapses close to it.</p>
<p class="indent">The result of this pitting is to expose new, clean metal surface to the reagents and also to increase the effective surface area available for reaction. The perforation of foil (see above) is a perfect example of this effect. A clean piece of aluminium kitchen foil (15 &#x00D7; 5 cm) is placed vertically in the sonicated bath liquid and kept still for 30 seconds. On removal the foil shows perforations in lines parallel with the surface of the liquid. The horizontal rows corresponding to the areas of maximum cavitational effect at half-wavelength distances vertically through the bath liquid.<a id="page_50" class="page">page 50, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a></p>
<p class="h2"><b>Reactions involving powders</b></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the easiest processing operations in sonochemistry is the deagglomeration of powders. This can be demonstrated using blackboard chalk as the example of the powder. A few pieces of chalk are placed in water (150 cm<sup>3</sup>) in a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask. When the flask is dipped into the ultrasonic bath, clouds of chalk can be seen emanating from the surface of the solid. Very quickly the liquid becomes cloudy illustrating the way in which ultrasound can erode surfaces and break down agglomerated particles to a much smaller size.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Emulsion reactions</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Ultrasound is known to generate extremely fine emulsions from mixtures of immiscible liquids. One of the main consequences of these emulsions is the dramatic increase in the interfacial contact area between the liquids, i.e. an increase in the region over which any reaction between species dissolved in the different liquids can take place. This can be shown by placing some water (100 cm<sup>3</sup>) and methylcyclohexane (50 cm<sup>3</sup>) in a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask and dipping the flask into an ultrasonic bath. By carefully adjusting the depth of immersion the clearly defined phase boundary between the two immiscible liquids is seen to become agitated. On closer inspection this disturbance can be seen as a large number of tiny &#x2018;explosions&#x2019; at the interface effectively sending small jets of liquid from one phase into the other. Soon a cloudiness appears in the interfacial region and within a minute or so substantial emulsification will have been caused. The demonstration is made even more dramatic if water soluble dye is added to make the aqueous phase brightly coloured.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The separation of particles in an acoustic field</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This experiment uses a suspension of copper bronze. Copper bronze is finely divided copper with particle sizes between 50 and 100 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m (1 g in 100 cm<sup>3</sup> water containing 1 per cent detergent). The mixture is shaken and poured into a 100 cm<sup>3</sup> measuring cylinder to give a uniformly bronze coloured column of liquid. When the base of the cylinder is placed in the ultrasonic bath liquid the uniform suspension changes to a set of horizontal bright metallic lines at separated distances of the half-wavelength of the ultrasound in the solution (which is around 1.8 cm at 40 kHz) (<a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). These striations are produced because the copper bronze particles collect at the nodes of the sound waves in the water. This demonstrates a potentially useful application of ultrasound as a method of manipulating small particles in a liquid medium [7].</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Homogeneous generation of iodine</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Power ultrasound is capable of generating hydrogen peroxide from the fragmentation of water (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>). The peroxide will oxidise any iodide ions in solution to produce iodine. Since the power of an ultrasonic bath is not very great it is normally not possible to see the pale yellow colour generated by the small amount of iodine produced by the sonication of aqueous KI. It is, however, possible to detect the low level of iodine liberated through its reaction<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>with starch to produce the characteristic blue colour. Even this will take a considerable time to generate using a 40 kHz bath. The effect can be enhanced by the addition of a few drops of carbon tetrachloride to the KI solution. Place 4 per cent aqueous KI solution (100 cm<sup>3</sup>) in a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask and add a few drops of CC1<sub>4</sub> followed by soluble starch indicator (2 cm<sup>3</sup>). The flask is then immersed in the ultrasonic bath to a depth where the clear solution suffers maximum disturbance. Within one minute the blue starch/iodine colour will start to appear and this will deepen as the reaction proceeds.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>2.6</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Advantages and disadvantages of using an ultrasonic bath for sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Despite the fact that the cleaning bath is the piece of ultrasonic equipment most widely used by chemists it is not necessarily the most effective. The advantages and disadvantages are summarised below.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Advantages of using an ultrasonic bath in sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. It is the most widely available laboratory source of ultrasonic irradiation.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. A small cleaning bath is inexpensive.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The acoustic field is fairly evenly distributed throughout the bath liquid.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. There is no special adaptation of chemical apparatus required, conventional glassware can be used, which means that the addition of chemicals, an inert atmosphere, and the use of reduced and elevated pressures are all easily attained.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">5. If the cleaning bath itself is used as the reaction vessel, larger batch treatment under greater irradiation power can be achieved. Despite the advantages gained from the use of such a simple piece of apparatus, there are a number of considerations which should be borne in mind when using this method of energy input.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Disadvantages of using an ultrasonic bath in sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The amount of power dissipated into the reaction from the bath is not very large&#x2014;usually less than 5 W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. The energy input should be assessed for each system investigated because power will depend on the size of the bath, the reaction vessel type (and thickness of its walls), and the position of the reaction vessel in the bath.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The ultrasonic frequency at which a cleaning bath operates is not universally the same. This may well affect results particularly when attempting to reproduce those reported in the literature. Most manufacturers use frequencies around 40 kHz, but 20 kHz baths are available and higher frequencies may be used in some specialist baths.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. Temperature control is not easy since most cleaning baths warm up slowly during operation. This may lead to inconsistent results when working around room temperature or below. Solutions to this problem have been given (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>).</p>
<p class="banoindent1">5. A few manufacturers produce cleaning baths with adjustable power, but the majority of cleaning baths do not have any such control. It is possible to place a rheostat between the mains and the bath which will permit simple power control.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>For all commercial ultrasonic cleaning baths it is assumed that the sonochemical reaction will be performed in a vessel immersed in the sonicated liquid. It is possible to use the whole bath as a batch reactor but this can only apply where non-corrosive and non-volatile reagents are used. Very few cleaning baths have vapour-tight lids, which means that it is very difficult to use them for reactions which require an inert atmosphere or a reflux condenser.</p>
<p class="indent">It is, however, clear from the variety and large number of experiments reported in the literature that despite its drawbacks the simple ultrasonic cleaning bath is extremely useful for sonochemistry.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once a laboratory cleaning bath has been shown to be of sufficient energy to promote a sonochemical reaction, the next step may be to perform a more rigorous investigation. In this way the process can be optimised or adapted to a larger scale. There are a variety of pieces of equipment which are available for this purpose.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The submersible transducer</b></p>
<p class="noindent">For many years the manufacturers of ultrasonic cleaners have offered the submersible transducer as a convenient and versatile method of converting any vessel into an ultrasonic cleaning bath. The submersible consists of a number of transducers which have been sealed into a stainless steel box (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.6</a>). These are bonded to the inner face of the box which then becomes the radiating face when the submersible is immersed into a liquid. Normally the submersible is equipped with hooks to hang over the edge of the bath and a flexible (water tight) lead for connection to the generator.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of a submersible system to convert a tank into a sonicated bath affords several advantages over the cleaning bath.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. A container of almost any size and shape can be converted into an ultrasonic bath using a submersible. These are available off the shelf, or can be constructed, in a range of sizes.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_54" class="page">page 54, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>2. The submersible transducer can be dipped directly into a chemical reaction thereby introducing power directly into a system, the equivalent of using the cleaning bath itself as the reactor. Of course this advantage will only be of use if the system does not chemically react with the transducer housing.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The position of the submersible can be adjusted to give maximum sonochemical effect in the particular vessel used.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. The vessel to be used can be quite large since any number of submersibles can be used.</p>
<p class="indent">The most likely sonochemical applications for submersible transducers are in the batch treatment of aqueous or non-corrosive liquid systems.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The cup-horn</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If the general utility of an ultrasonic bath could be combined with controllable power and temperature control of a probe, a useful compromise would be available. Such a compromise system is the cup-horn device (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>), which can be considered to be a small but powerful ultrasonic bath. In effect, it uses a specially designed inverted horn to irradiate a small cup of liquid (normally water) into which the reaction vessel is dipped. The horn, with a hole drilled through its centre, allows the liquid in the cup to be part of a circulating coolant system which assists in maintaining temperature stability. Since the irradiation source is a modified sonic horn this system has one major advantage over the cleaning bath&#x2014;its power can be controlled.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The cup-horn was originally designed for use in biological cell disruption, which requires higher power than the normal cleaning bath. The other major advantage of this source over the probe system is that since the cellular material is in a vessel immersed in the sonicated fluid, and thus not in direct contact with the irradiating surface, it avoids contamination by fragments of<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>metal which might be eroded from a directly immersed probe system. The main difficulty with the cup-horn is that it is quite small and this limits the size of the reaction vessel which can be used.</p>

<p class="h2"><b>High-frequency ultrasonic baths specially designed for sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The ultrasonic bath described below is the type developed by Arnim Henglein, who began his studies of the chemical effects of ultrasound as a student studying for a masters degree over 50 years ago [8]. Today most chemists use commercial ultrasonic equipment which operate in the frequency range 20 to 40 kHz, but Henglein often conducted experiments at a much higher frequency (1 MHz). A vessel which is capable of high insonation intensities at 1 MHz is shown in <a href="#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. The glass bottom is a half-wavelength thick and the vessel is placed directly on the aluminium metal flange which carries the transducer (a thin film of water between the vessel and the flange assures efficient acoustic coupling).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In recent years, there have been a variety of higher frequency baths developed for sonochemistry. The drive for these developments has been the discovery that at higher irradiation frequencies (e.g. 500 kHz) the characteristics of cavitation bubble generation and collapse are different from those which occur at 20 and 40 kHz (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>). Radicals also are produced more efficiently [9]. In essence most of these baths are constructed in a similar way with a planar, usually titanium, emitting face sealed into the base of a glass vessel with external cooling (<a href="#fig_2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>).</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>2.8</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The power of equipment related&#x0021; to cleaning baths</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">In any apparatus related to cleaning bath systems the cavitation bubbles are formed as separate entities throughout the sonicated liquid medium. This<a id="page_56" class="page">page 56, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>contrasts with the streaming and coalescence of bubbles which occur in the more powerful sonicators, e.g. probe systems. It is therefore difficult to compare the results of experiments carried out with bath and probe type sonication equipment. There is no doubt, however, that cleaning baths provide sufficient power to identify reactions which are susceptible to sonochemical enhancement, and that they are certainly the most convenient to use under laboratory conditions.</p>
