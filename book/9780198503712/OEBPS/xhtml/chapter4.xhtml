<p class="noindent">It has been recognised for many years that power ultrasound has great potential for use in a wide variety of processes in chemical and allied industries (<a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>). The interest of chemists in power ultrasound has also been established, whether it be to improve yields, speed up chemical or physicochemical processes, or, as seems possible in some cases, completely switch reaction pathways. Yet, in spite of the great amount of information available on sonochemistry, and in spite of the very promising effects described on a laboratory scale, the literature does not seem to provide a great many examples of industrial applications. Over the last few years a number of groups have become interested in solving the problems of scale-up, and the purpose of this chapter is to give an overview of the available systems that can be used to carry out sonochemical transformations on a scale rather larger than that used in the research laboratory [1,2].</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1">
<h1 class="h1"><b>4.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The challenge of scale up</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">There are essentially two types of large-scale chemical plant: batch and flow type. Sometimes the flow system will form a part of batch processing as a loop attached to the main vat. In the preceding chapters we have concentrated on laboratory-scale equipment. The results from some of these small-scale experiments can be adapted for large-scale work, but in order to do so a precise knowledge of the type of sonochemistry involved in the process is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The first decision to be made when considering how a sonochemical reaction should be scaled up is whether that reaction is in fact truly sonochemical or simply the result of an ultrasonically induced mechanical effect. In a solid/liquid heterogeneous reaction, for example, power ultrasound may only serve as an efficient mixing system (for particle fragmentation, deagglomeration, and/or dispersion). In this situation ultrasonic pre-treatment of a slurry may be all that is required before the reaction is allowed to take place conventionally. However, if ultrasound has a real effect on the chemistry of the system, then arrangements must be made to provide sonication during the reaction itself. To scale-up a true sonochemical process, there are three main questions to be answered:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. What will be the most appropriate sonolysis system for the reaction mixture to be processed&#x003F;</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_74" class="page">page 74, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>2. What are the best reaction conditions&#x003F;</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. What will be the energy implications of using ultrasound rather than traditional methodology&#x003F;</p>
<p class="indent">These questions are not easily answered because of the number of factors which must be taken into account when judgement is made. Thus, to attain optimum conditions for sonication the variables which can influence cavitation must be carefully studied. These variables depend upon:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The reaction medium: in terms of its viscosity, vapour pressure, the nature and concentration of any dissolved gas, and the presence of any solid particles before, during, or after reaction.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. The reaction conditions: including the temperatures and pressures involved&#x2014;these may well be varied during a conventional process.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The type of sonic system used: this must involve consideration of both the power and the best frequency to be used, together with the size and geometry of the chemical reactor to be employed.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>4.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Sonochemical efficiency</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">There are only a limited number of ways in which power ultrasound can be introduced into a chemical reaction (<a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>). Whichever method is employed it is certain that there will be a loss in efficiency of the process between the mains electrical power feeding the generator and the acoustic power consumed to perform the chemical process in the reaction. The first place where any loss in efficiency can arise is in the design of the generator where mains power is converted into a signal to the transducer. At this stage there is an inevitable loss of heat. The motion of the transducer will itself involve further losses of energy in the form of heat and sound. Further inefficiency arises from the &#x2018;coupling&#x2019; of the transducer to its load, i.e. the mass which it is sonicating. Lastly there is the problem of whether it is in fact possible to achieve sonication throughout the whole reaction mixture, or whether it would be easier to localise the power ultrasound into a particular region of the reacting system.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_4.1">Figure 4.1</a> can be considered to represent a sonochemical process from the energetics viewpoint. The ultrasonic system transforms electrical power into vibrational energy, i.e. mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then transmitted into the sonicated reaction medium. Part of it is lost to produce heat, and another part produces cavitation, but not all of the cavitational energy produces chemical and physical effects. Some energy is reflected and some is consumed in sound re-emission (harmonics and sub-harmonics). From this, it can be appreciated that the determination of an energy balance is not easy. Nevertheless one can define the term &#x2018;sonochemical yield&#x2019; (SY), as:</p>

<p class="figurecaption" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1.5em"><b>Figure 4.1</b> Possible energy loss during a sonochemical reaction</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This is similar to the definition of &#x2018;photochemical yield&#x2019;. The measured effect can be, for example, the number of moles of product generated per second and the input power can be monitored and measured with a wattmeter. To estimate the output power, i.e. the actual power entering the system, one has to know the conversion yield of the ultrasonic system used. This is not always obvious since part of the energy is reflected back to the transducer, especially when the sonicated mixture is viscous or contains a large amount of suspended solid. Several attempts have been made to measure the overall output power with calorimetry and several different chemical dosimeters (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another problem is the determination of the way in which the &#x2018;sonic energy&#x2019; is distributed within a particular reactor configuration using a given sonic system. One approach developed for the determination of this distribution involves thermistor probes [3]. Pugin has shown that the distribution of ultrasonic energy is not homogeneous (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>) [4]. In some cases standing waves may be formed, and there is a question as to whether a larger sonochemical effect is obtained with standing waves or in their absence [5]. The energy distribution might well have some effect on the course of a chemical reaction. Consider the case of a solid-liquid phase transfer reaction (Scheme <a href="#fig_4.1">4.1</a>) [2]. In this Michael addition of the anion of pentan-2,4-dione (2) to chalcone (1) the adduct (3) is formed and this can react further to give the cycloadduct (4). The overall rate of this reaction is increased by sonication, but the chemical selectivity depends on the particular source of ultrasonic power. Thus, adduct (3) is the only product formed in the absence of ultrasound or using a cup-horn, whereas the cyclised adduct (4) is produced only under the influence of sonication with a probe (<a href="#tab_4.2">Table 4.2</a>). The reason is probably that at the surface of the horn (diameter 12 mm) the &#x2018;power density&#x2019; (expressed in W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>) is higher than at the surface of the cup-horn (diameter 45 mm). This would result in far more severe conditions in the small volume directly under the horn, which might then promote the cyclisation side-reaction.<a id="page_76" class="page">page 76, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a></p>

<img src="../images/f0076-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This difference in product distribution points to one obvious problem when scaling-up sonochemical processes. In an ideal situation the correct sonication conditions would be established on a laboratory scale and the input power required would be optimised for the best sonochemical yield. The energy input could then be characterised as the energy distribution in the reactor, either as the energy emitted at the surface of the ultrasonic device (expressed as W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>) or the energy dissipated in the bulk of the sonicated medium (expressed as W cm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>). In the scaled-up version of the reactor, the shape and type of device may not be directly comparable to the laboratory reactor, and so product differences may arise.</p>
<p class="indent">This is less likely to be a problem when dealing with smaller sonicated volumes such as those used with flow cells, where the geometries and ultrasonic sources are similar on both scales.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>4.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Large-scale ultrasonic systems</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Solutions to the problem of the scale-up of sonochemical reactions do exist but they are not so simple as the use of bigger versions of laboratory equipment. In a production situation the volumes treated will be very much larger than those considered in the laboratory, and the type of process will govern the choice of reactor design. It could well be that some processes would be more suited to low-intensity sonication (e.g. using a bath-type reactor or a liquid whistle), whereas others may need higher intensity irradiation of the type obtained using a probe-type system.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the major considerations which have held back progress on the development of large-scale sonochemical equipment has been that industrial sonochemistry might require &#x2018;tailor-made&#x2019; reactors to achieve optimum sonochemical yields for specific reactions. Such reactors would clearly involve<a id="page_77" class="page">page 77, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>considerable capital investment. Fortunately, however, a wide range of equipment is already available for processing and cleaning which can be readily adapted for sonochemistry (<a href="#tab_4.3">Table 4.3</a>).</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Batch reactors</b></p>
<p class="h4"><i>Based on the ultrasonic cleaning bath</i></p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where only low-intensity ultrasonic irradiation is needed, batch treatment could well be as simple as immersing the reaction vessel in a large-scale ultrasonic cleaning bath. This method has been adopted for a medium-scale Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation reaction using sonochemically activated zinc [6]. Most conventional methods for carrying out this reaction rely upon activation of the zinc by using zinc-silver or zinc-copper couples and/or the use of iodine or Hthium. A sudden exotherm and excessive frothing are common practical problems. In the sonochemical procedure no special activation of the zinc was required, indeed equally good&#x2014;and reproducible&#x2014;yields were obtained using zinc in the form of dust, foil, mossy, or even rods. This methodology was successfully scaled up to achieve the cyclopropanation of methyl oleate in 0.5 kg quantities (Scheme <a href="#fig_4.2">4.2</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The reactor (shown in <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) is a 22 litre flask immersed in a 36 &#x00D7; 18 &#x00D7; 18 inch, 50 gallon heated ultrasonic bath (3 kW, 80 kHz). The zinc metal was cast in the form of two cones (each 900 g) which were suspended with copper wire thus allowing them to be moved into or out of the reaction mixture. The<a id="page_78" class="page">page 78, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>method had several advantages over the normal method of cyclopropanation as a result of changing from zinc powder to the metal:</p>

<p class="banoindent1">(i) there was a reduction in foaming (normally associated with ethene and cyclopropane formation);</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(ii) the exotherm was more evenly distributed (only a small clean area of metal is available throughout the reaction);</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(iii) the reaction could be controlled by removing the lump of metal from the reaction; and</p>
<p class="banoindent1">(iv) the residual metal could be removed from the reaction as a lump rather than by conventional filtration.</p>
<p class="indent">If the cleaning bath itself is to be used as the reaction vessel, the bath tank itself would need to be constructed of a material which was inert towards the chemicals involved. An appropriate grade of stainless steel might prove adequate or plastic tanks could be used. In the latter case, however, the transfer of ultrasonic energy from the tank walls to the reaction mixture would be attenuated by the plastic, and so the transducers would need to be bonded to a stainless steel or titanium plate and this assembly then bolted to the inside wall of the tank. In addition the tank could well require a sealed lid with addition ports, and almost certainly stirring would be required.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Reaction vessel with external transducers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A more logical use of this concept would appear to be to simply convert an existing reaction vessel by the addition of external transducers (<a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). In this configuration the walls of the vessel provide the ultrasonic energy in the same way as the walls of a cleaning bath. This system would have the advantage that facilitates for stirring and for the use of elevated temperatures and pressures would already be available.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_79" class="page">page 79, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>There are, however, some major disadvantages to this type of adaptation.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The transfer efficiency of the acoustic energy entering the reaction will be quite small and the presence of a stirrer or solids will cause attenuation of the sound energy, and this may lead to a central zone which is not under sonication. This will place a limit on the maximum size of the vessel. In this configuration the energy distribution will also be hard to determine.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. If the surfaces to which the transducers are to be attached are curved then very careful design will be required to attain the best energy transfer.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. For heated reactions the transducers will need to be cooled and/or removed from direct contact with the vessel walls. The use of cylindrical extension horn (<a href="chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>) will enable the transducers to be positioned away from the vessel walls at some multiple of the half-wavelength of the sound in the horn material.</p>
<p class="indent">Bath-type reactors can also be used in a flow system. In this case the reacting liquids could be continuously fed into an ultrasonic tank with outflow to the next process. Such treatment could be intensified by recycling or by connecting a number of such sonicated tanks in line.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>The submersible transducer</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A useful variant to the sonicated tank is the submersible transducer assembly described above (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). In fact this offers somewhat greater flexibility in use, since it comes as a sealed unit capable of withstanding organic solvents&#x2014;this dates from the days when halocarbon-type cleaning fluids were in common usage. Such units can be designed to fit into any existing reaction vessel. As with the cleaning bath, ultrasonic reactors involving submersible transducers would require some form of additional (mechanical) stirring.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Fluidised bed reactor</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A sonochemical reactor has been designed which utilises an externally cooled conical shape vessel with a probe at the base (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>) [7]. The system is of the cup-horn type except that the cup is in the shape of a cone constructed with an internal angle which allows optimum radiation of the acoustic field giving plane waves in the reaction chamber. All fluid reactants enter the reaction chamber via a concentric inlet around the probe, and the fluid motion keeps reacting solids suspended in the active sonication zone. In essence the system operates rather like a fluidised bed allowing liquids to mix intimately with suspended solids thereby giving very efficient sonochemical conditions. One obvious application area for this system is Grignard syntheses where the magnesium metal is the suspended material.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Batch reactors incorporating a probe system</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The ultrasonic probe system, with the various types of horn design available to amplify vibrational amplitude (see <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>), is one of the most effective<a id="page_80" class="page">page 80, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>methods of introducing high-power ultrasound into a liquid. Despite this there are some severe restrictions in usage for large-scale batch treatment:</p>

<p class="banoindent1">1. The high energy density produced from a single probe tip is unlikely to be capable of delivering sufficient energy density to affect the whole of a large reacting volume, despite the circulation induced by streaming. Unlike the bath system described above, a probe reactor tends to have its &#x2018;dead zones&#x2019; on the periphery of the vessel (<a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>).</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. In some reactions an optimum power level can be reached (which depends on the system) beyond which increased power input actually reduces the yield (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_81" class="page">page 81, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>3. At high power, erosion of metal from the probe tip could contaminate the reaction and may also necessitate frequent probe or tip replacement. High cavitation energies may also cause some unwanted radical formation and/or solvent decomposition.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Flow systems</b></p>
<p class="noindent">For larger scale operations where high intensity ultrasound is required, the sonic horn, or indeed any other source of high power ultrasound, is best utilised as part of a flow loop outside of the main reactor (<a href="#fig_4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>). This permits the processing of large volumes and provides significant advantages compared with the use of probes in a batch configuration. In a flow system, high intensity sonication can be provided at controllable power by the adjustment of either input power to the transducer system or the flow rate through the cell. In addition temperature control is provided through the circulating reaction mixture or using a pulse option. There are also some disadvantages to the use of a flow system, the most common of which is that pumping is required for circulation through the flow loop and so it is not suitable for either very viscous reaction media or heavily articulate systems.</p>
<p class="indent">In the schematic flow system shown the ultrasound generator can be one of several different configurations (<a href="#tab_4.4">Table 4.4</a>). These possibilities are explored below.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Resonating tube reactors</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This type of system provides the greatest hope for general usage of ultrasound in the chemical industry. Essentially the liquid to be processed is passed through a pipe with ultrasonically vibrating walls. In this way the sound energy generated from transducers bonded to the outside of the tube is transferred directly into the flowing liquid. Two design engineering problems are associated with this type of sonicator (i) the correct mounting of the transducers on the outer tube and (ii) the length of the tube must be such that the ends are at nodal points in the sound wavelength in the unit. This will eliminate vibrational problems associated with the coupling of the unit to existing pipework. Generally the commercial tube reactors are constructed of stainless steel, for chemical processing, however, other materials such as titanium can be used.</p>

<p class="figcaption" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1.5em"><b>Figure 4.8</b> Cross-sectional geometries for flow reactors</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Each of the following systems requires that ultrasonic energy is introduced into a flowing system by vibrations induced in the walls of the pipe carrying the reaction medium. With the correct length and fittings these flow reactors may be easily retrofitted to a chemical processing rig. The cross-sectional geometry for the pipe is generally one of the four shown (<a href="#fig_4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>). Each of these has been used and each has its own good and bad points, but in general the bonding of transducers to a flat surface is easier than to a cylindrical tube.</p>
<p class="indent">(i) <i>Rectangular cross-section.</i> The transducers face each other in this geometry and so there is the possibility of severe erosion of opposite faces unless the design is optimised. If the pipe is not seamless, then high powered ultrasonic vibration is likely to find weaknesses in the construction, particularly at comer joints.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_83" class="page">page 83, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>One application for such a sonicated tube is in waste water treatment where large quantities of sewage sludge are produced which mainly consist of flocculent microorganisms. Anaerobic fermentation is the most commonly applied process for stabilization of sewage sludge, but this is a slow process with residence times in anaerobic digesters of about 20 days. A rectangular flow processor operating at 3.6 kW and 31 kHz at an intensity of 7.5 W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> has been developed to pre-treat and disintegrate the sludge before digestion [8]. This reduced the residence time in the fermenter to 8 days thereby permitting a substantial increase in throughput.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative type of rectangular reactor employs opposite emitting faces with different ultrasonic frequencies known as the Nearfield Acoustic Processor (NAP) (<a href="#fig_4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>). This system can be visualised as two sonicated metal plates&#x2014;each similar to the base of a cleaning bath&#x2014;these enclose a flow system. The plates are driven at different frequencies&#x2014;normally 16 and 20 kHz. In effect the plates can be regarded as the bases of two ultrasonic baths facing toward each other and separated by adjustable spacers. Under these conditions any liquid flowing between the plates is subject to an ultrasonic intensity greater than that expected from a simple addition of the single plate intensities. The ultrasound &#x2018;reverberates&#x2019; and is magnified in its effect. An additional benefit is that with vibrating plates the size of table tops, the system can cope with a very large throughput of material.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) <i>Pentagonal cross-section.</i> In this type of system the acoustic field is fairly even throughout the cross-section because the emitted wave does not impinge directly on the opposite face (<a href="#fig_4.10">Fig. 4.10</a>). The dimensions of such a system are dictated by the space requirements for the transducers. Thus using 40 kHz transducers the cross-section has a minimum value of approximately 9 cm, and such a system with a volume of 1.5 litres has been used for processing [2]. Applications for this type of processor include pasteurisation, crystallisation, degassing, dispersion, and emulsification.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) <i>Hexagonal cross-section.</i> A reactor of this type provides a &#x2018;focus&#x2019; of energy in the centre of the pipe&#x2014;unlike the pentagonal style. Such a focus</p>

When the reactor is produced in the form of an ultrasonic bath, the reaction medium can be located in a vessel at the focus of the energy either for batch treatment or as the sonochemical reactor of a flow system (<a href="#fig_4.11">Fig. 4.11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">(iv) <i>Cylindrical cross-section.</i> To make a permanent bond for a high power transducer to a curved surface is not easy. Fortunately the geometry of the tubular configuration, just as with hexagonal, means that low power can be used at the surface because the ultrasonic energy is focused toward the middle of the tube. A resonating pipe of 6 inch diameter operating at 25 kHz has been developed for the degassing of liquids [9]. Another has been installed on offshore oil drilling rigs for the de-agglomeration of drilling mud. This process is required so that the jettisoned mud disperses with the movement of the sea and does not simply sink to the seabed under the platform<a id="page_85" class="page">page 85, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>form. Accumulations of mud around the platform legs present a problem to sea life and eventually rig maintenance. The tubular reactor meets strict standards of operation for use in hazardous areas, and consists of four modules each one rated at 2 kW and composed of a stainless steel tube of 1 metre in length and 12 cm diameter with an array of piezoelectric transducers bonded to the outside and enclosed in a casing (<a href="#fig_4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>) [10].</p>

<p class="indent">An alternative approach to generating a vibrating pipe is to use a fluid to couple energy from a transducer to the outer wall of the reactor. This avoids any direct bonding to the surface. Such a reactor was developed from an ultrasonic wire cleaning system (<a href="#fig_4.13">Fig. 4.13</a>). Transducers transfer energy to the cylindrical reactor tube via a coupling fluid. This same coupling fluid can be circulated and refrigerated to provide cooling during the sonochemical processing.</p>
<p class="indent">When a probe system is used as the source of energy and coupled through a fluid to a pipe, the advantage of controllable power is added to temperature control (<a href="#fig_4.14">Fig. 4.14</a>). Like all systems based on probes, however, this unit will suffer from erosion of the horn tip and, in the long run, this might prove expensive in terms of &#x2018;down-time&#x2019; for repair and replacement.</p>

<p class="indent">When very high ultrasonic energy is applied to a fluid through a pipe one unavoidable problem is the generation of heat. This can be overcome if the<a id="page_86" class="page">page 86, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>pipe has a tube in its centre carrying cooling liquid (<a href="#fig_4.15">Fig. 4.15</a>). The cooling system occupies the space which would otherwise be the focus of acoustic energy. In acting as both a temperature control and a co-axial reflector of the sound energy this could well prove to be an efficient design for a flow reactor. The annular space between the resonating pipe and the cooling tube can be used to hold solid reagent or catalyst while the reaction mixture is pumped through the system.</p>

<p class="indent">There is another method of transmitting ultrasonic vibrations into a tube using a probe system. The horn is directly attached to an annular collar which acts as a cylindrical resonator (<a href="#fig_4.16">Fig. 4.16</a>). The collar has screw fittings to take one or two stainless steel pipes accurately machined so that the remote end is a null point and may be further coupled to other pipework. At an operating <a id="page_87" class="page">page 87, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>length of 1.2 metres and internal tube diameter of 42 mm the unit can be driven at 2 kW per 1.2 metres with 80 per cent efficiency. The maximum resonance power then operates on the flowing liquid at half-wavelength distances along the tube. An advantage for this system is that when the steel tubing becomes eroded it can be easily replaced.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Resonating bar inserts</i></p>
<p class="noindent">In order to introduce ultrasound into a medium flowing through a tube it is only necessary to place a vibrating source (e.g. probe) in contact with that liquid. A neat method of doing this is via the coaxial insertion of a radially emitting bar into the pipe containing the flowing liquid; this would require minimal change to existing pipework. This type of system was originally developed as a form of submersible transducer for cleaning the inside of barrels and tubes immersed in a cleaning fluid.</p>
<p class="indent">One system, developed by the Swiss company Telsonic, consists of a hollow, gas filled, tube sealed at one end and driven at the other by a standard piezo transducer (<a href="#fig_4.17">Fig. 4.17</a>). The device looks like a conventional probe system, but is significantly different in that the sealed end is at a point of minimum motion and is not the major source of vibrational energy. Instead the ultrasound is emitted radially at half-wavelength distances along its length. There is the potential to unblock the end and use the system as a flow tube. Designed and marketed for cleaning, there is currently no information on its potential for chemical applications.</p>

<p class="indent">A design introduced by the German company Martin Walter involves a cylindrical bar of titanium (cut to a precise number of half-wavelengths at the frequency used). Opposing piezoelectric transducers are attached at each end connected through a central wire (<a href="#fig_4.18">Fig. 4.18</a>). With these transducers operating together in a push-pull mode the &#x2018;concertina&#x2019; effect makes the bar of<a id="page_88" class="page">page 88, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>metal expand and contract at half-wavelength distances along the entire length. Any erosion in this system would not affect the resonant length, and since the bar is essentially solid metal, material loss by erosion is not a major problem.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>The liquid whistle</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The liquid whistle was originally introduced as an efficient mixing/homogenisation system and this still remains one of its main applications. The construction and mode of action of the instrument has been described in <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. These devices differ markedly from the more usual bath and probe types in that they derive their power from the medium (by mechanical flow across the blade) rather than by the transfer of energy from an external source to the medium. The majority of the chemical effects observed on using whistle type transducers for the sonication of heterogeneous reactions can be attributed to the generation of very fine emulsions rather than the ultrasonic irradiation itself. The use of the liquid whistle type of ultrasonic generators for homogenisation has increased dramatically since the Second World War. It was as far back as 1927 when Wood and Loomis reported that oil and water could be emulsified on sonication in the same beaker using quartz piezoelectric transducers [11]. However, at that stage in the development of ultrasonic equipment it was quite difficult to see how transducers driven by quartz crystals could be employed on an industrial scale, and so ultrasonic homogenisation remained a curiosity until 1948. In that year Janovski and Pohlmann highlighted the economic advantages to be gained from the use of a liquid whistle compared with magnetostrictive transducers of the type available at that time [12]. In 1960 a series of experiments was undertaken to compare four methods then in common usage for the emulsification of mineral oil, groundnut oil, and safflower oil [13]. The results proved that a homogeniser, which operated via a liquid whistle, was superior to three other types of apparatus namely a colloidal mill and two types of sonicator, one of which employed a quartz crystal and the other a barium titanate transducer.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_89" class="page">page 89, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>The method has several advantages over flow systems involving probes:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The system was specially developed for such processes as emulsification, homogenisation, and dispersion.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. With no moving parts, other than a pump, the system is rugged and durable.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. It can be used for the processing of flow systems and, as such, has immediate possibilities for scale-up and can be installed &#x2018;on-line&#x2019;. In this way large volumes can be processed as is the case in the manufacture of such items as fruit juices, tomato ketchup, and mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of sonication is not as high as that of the probe, however, and this leads to some disadvantages:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The ultrasonic power obtained from such a system is limited, so that ultrasonically initiated and driven reactions are less likely to be effected by whistle sonication.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. The optimum frequency of blade vibration (normally designed to be 20 kHz) relies upon a rapid pumping of the reaction. Clearly this is not possible for viscous materials.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The underlying mode of action, involving as it does the flow induced cavitation near a steel blade, immediately suggests that there may be a problem of blade erosion by particulate matter. This does not seem to be a major problem in working systems.</p>

<p class="figurecaption" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1.5em"><b>Figure 4.19</b> Shaking tray system</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This device was originally designed by the Lewis Corporation for the processing of coal or metal ores at rates up to 20 tons per hour (<a href="#fig_4.19">Fig. 4.19</a>) [14]. In the particular case of coal recovery from waste tips, the process involves mixing the coal &#x2018;waste&#x2019; with equal quantities of water and, after crude screening to<a id="page_90" class="page">page 90, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>remove rocks, allowing gravity to carry the mixture down the vibrating tray (20 kHz). With a residence time of only a few seconds this process yields marketable low-ash coal product, with clay and sand suspended in the wash water which can be allowed to settle in a pond from which the water is recycled for further processing.</p>

<p class="indent">The vibrating tray is generally used under ambient conditions and is both large scale and extremely robust. Design modification to allow the unit to be installed within a pressure vessel would permit the processing to be used at elevated temperatures with complete containment of vapours. This then becomes a piece of heavy-duty chemical processing equipment for solid/liquid reactions or extractions.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>4.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Low-frequency high-power processing system</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">A significantly different system has been introduced to large-scale processing by Arc Sonics of Canada, and this involves audible frequency vibrations generated in a large cylindrical steel bar. The bar is driven into a clover leaf type of motion by firing three powerful magnets in sequence which are located at each end of the bar. The bar is supported by air springs, so that the ends and the centre are then caused to rotate at a resonance frequency depending on the bar&#x2019;s size (<a href="#fig_4.20">Fig. 4.20</a>). One such unit, operating at a power of 75 kW, drives a bar which is 4.1 m in length and 34 cm in diameter at its resonance frequency of 100 Hz. The bar itself weighs 3 tonnes and produces a vibrational amplitude of 6 mm. Other units using smaller sized bars operating at higher, though still audible, frequencies have also been built. These vibrating bar systems can be used in chemical processing applications by fixing a robust cylindrical steel cell to each end of the bar. Material in the form of a liquid or slurry can then be pumped through the cells in order to perform operations such as mixing, grinding, and the destruction of hazardous waste. Hard spherical grinding balls are often added to the cells to assist in these processes.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_91" class="page">page 91, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>The large 75 kW version was used in the mining industry. Ore is first ground by ball mills down to about 110 microns and then it is put through a flotation circuit. Some ground ore fails the flotation process, this is usually oversize and goes to &#x2018;regrind&#x2019;. This is where the equipment was used (it is not suitable for the primary grinding process where large lumps of ore are processed). The equipment performed well, operating for a 24 hour production of 100 tonnes per day with a power saving estimated at 20 per cent over the ball mill. Other examples include the grinding of sand from 100 microns down to 1 micron or less, suitable for use as silica fume; limestone and talc from 250 microns down to 5 microns, which would enable the use of these materials as paper fillers; and the grinding of sodium metal in oil to create a dispersion.</p>
<p class="indent">The above results would suggest the equipment is operating in a purely mechanical sense, since while the results are clearly sonoprocessing they are not chemistry. There are, however, other examples where the link with chemistry is closer, e.g. in water remediation. One such application is the decolorisation of water contaminated with dye. Using a 20 kW, 430 Hz sonicator fitted with a 3.2 litre reactor and supplied with ozone from a laboratory-scale generator, experiments were carried out on seven dyes, representative of those used by the textile industry. Basic, acid, direct, and even some disperse dyes, which tend to have low solubility, were all rapidly decolorised. For most of the dyes the toxicity of the decolorised dye to micro-organisms was the same as, or less than, the dye solution. This would make them suitable for further treatment on site or for immediate discharge to a publicly operated treatment plan. The amount of ozone required to achieve decolorisation ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 kg of ozone per kilogram of dye. It is suggested that 2 kg of ozone per kg of dye be used in estimating costs and in the design of equipment. The rate of dye destruction was about 20 times faster than in a simple mechanically stirred gas to liquid contactor. The rate is sufficiently great for short residence times of less than 60 seconds to be possible in a continuous flow process with an industrial ozonizer and for dye concentrations within the range typical of wastewater from textile dyeing plants.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>4.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Future prospects</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">So what conclusions can be drawn about the future of sonochemistry in industry. The current main areas of interest are in synthesis, mixing, crystallisation, electrochemistry, and environmental remediation. The newer areas which are attracting attention are improved mass and heat transfer, the generation of new nanoparticle catalysts, therapeutic ultrasound, and the extraction of natural materials.</p>
<p class="indent">At this stage in the development of sonochemistry it seems that the problem is mainly an economic one. If, for each different reaction, a &#x2018;tailor-made&#x2019; reactor was needed to achieve optimum sonochemical yields, then equipment manufacturers would need a lot of persuasion to become involved in one-offs. Fortunately, however, although the effects of some variables, including the nature and the shape of the sonoreactor, must be very well defined, there<a id="page_92" class="page">page 92, Flow systems and scale-up in sonochemistry</a>is no doubt that such equipment can be derived from the existing selection of systems which are quite wide ranging in type. For large vat type reactors, the &#x2018;sonic energy&#x2019; cannot be distributed readily, but this can be partially overcome by the use of smaller sonication cells and the recycling of materials. This is the principle used in the flow reactors.</p>
<p class="indent">Two aspects of sonochemistry which are often cited as problems by industrialists are (i) noise and (ii) cavitational erosion in the reactor. It must be acknowledged that all the sonic systems (with the possible exception of liquid whistles) are rather noisy in operation. However, the noise problem is easily overcome by the use of adequate sound-proofing, indeed sound-proof casings are already used in the case of industrial cleaning baths. The erosion of the reactor walls by cavitation is more difficult to avoid but is only a serious problem for very high power work. The rate of erosion depends on ultrasonic power, pressure (it increases rapidly with increasing pressure), nature of the reaction mixture, and the type of suspended solid. This could be a serious problem with large-scale reactors, but it can be minimised by using some of the devices described above which rely on focused power. Although much remains to be done, the prognosis for the scale-up of sonochemistry is good. The combined efforts of chemists, physicists, and engineering equipment suppliers should ensure that industrialists have power ultrasound as a viable option in the design of the chemical plants of the future.</p>
