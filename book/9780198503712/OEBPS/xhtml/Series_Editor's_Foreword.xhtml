<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Professor Tim Mason presents a stimulating self-contained and practically oriented introduction to the principles and applications of <i>Sonochemistry.</i> The Primer will interest all students (and their mentors) who require an easy-to-read yet authoritative introduction to this increasingly important topic.</p>
