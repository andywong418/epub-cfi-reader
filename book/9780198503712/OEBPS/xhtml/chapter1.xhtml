<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">If you were asked what you knew about ultrasound you would almost certainly start with the fact that it is used in animal communications (e.g. bat navigation and dog whistles). You might then recall that ultrasound is used in medicine for fetal imaging, in underwater range finding (SONAR), or in the non-destructive testing of materials for flaws. For a chemist, however, sound would probably not be the first form of energy that would be considered for the stimulation of a chemical reaction. Nowadays an increasing number of scientists are becoming interested in a new field of research&#x2014;sonochemistry&#x2014;a term primarily used to describe the effect of ultrasonic sound waves on chemical reactions, but also applied to processing involving power ultrasound. The name is derived from the prefix <i>Sono</i> indicating sound, paralleling the longer established techniques which use light (photochemistry) and electricity (<i>electrochemistry</i>) to achieve chemical activation. However unlike most other chemical technologies which require some special attribute of the system in order to function, e.g. the use of microwaves (dipolar species), electrochemistry (conducting medium), and photochemistry (the presence of a chromophore, i.e. a grouping capable of activation by light irradiation), ultrasound requires only the presence of a liquid to transmit its power. In this sense sonochemistry can be considered to be a general activation technique like thermochemistry (heat) and piezochemistry (pressure).</p>
<p class="indent">The first commercial application of ultrasonics dates back to 1917 with the echo sounding technique of Langevin for the estimation of the depth of water. The discovery was the direct result of an idea which arose from suggestions generated by a competition organised in 1912 to find a non-visual method of detecting icebergs in the open sea and so avoid any repetition of the disaster which befell the Titanic. The early &#x2018;echo sounder&#x2019; simply sent a pulse of ultrasound from the keel of a boat to the bottom of the sea from which it was reflected back to a detector also on the keel. For sound waves, since the distance travelled through a medium <i>&#x003D;</i> &#x00BD; &#x00D7; time &#x00D7; velocity (and the velocity of sound in seawater is accurately known), the distance to the bottom could be gauged from the time taken for the signal to return to the boat. If some foreign object (e.g. a submarine) were to come between the boat and the bottom of the seabed an echo would be produced from this in advance of the bottom echo. This system was very important to the Allied Submarine<a id="page_2" class="page">page 2, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>Detection Investigation Committee during the Second World War and became popularly known by the acronym ASDIC. Later developments resulted in the system known as SONAR (SOund Navigation And Ranging) which allowed the surrounding sea to be scanned. As an example of its efficiency, using modem SONAR it is possible to locate a small fish only 35 cm in length at a depth of 500 metres. It is interesting to note that the original ASDIC system actually came before the corresponding RAdio Detection And Ranging System (RADAR) by 30 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Essentially all imaging from medical ultrasound to non-destructive testing relies upon the same pulse-echo type of approach but with considerably refined electronic hardware. The refinements enable the equipment not only to detect reflections of the sound wave from the hard, metallic surface of a submarine in water but also much more subtle changes in the media through which sound passes (e.g. those between different tissue structures in the body). It is high frequency ultrasound (in the range 2 to 10 MHz) which is used primarily in this type of application because by using these much shorter wavelengths it is possible to detect much smaller areas of phase change, i.e. give better &#x2018;definition&#x2019;.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The power of sound</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Sound, as a general subject for study, is traditionally found in a physics syllabus, but it is not a topic which is met in a chemistry course and so is somewhat unfamiliar to practising chemists. Sound is transmitted through a medium by inducing vibrational motion of the molecules through which it is travelling. This motion can be visualised as rather like the ripples produced when a pebble is dropped into a pool of still water. The waves move but the water molecules which constitute the wave revert to their normal positions after the wave has passed. An alternative representation is provided by the effect of a sudden twitch of the end of a horizontal stretched spring. Here the vibrational energy is transmitted through the spring as a compression wave which is seen to traverse its whole length. This is just a single compression wave and it does not equate to sound itself which is a whole series of such compression waves separated by rarefaction (stretching) waves in between. The pitch (or note) of the sound produced by this series of waves depends upon their frequency, i.e. the number of waves which pass a fixed point in unit time. For middle C this is 256 per second. Sound waves can be represented as a series of vertical lines or shaded colour where line separation or colour depth represent intensity, or as a sine wave (<a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). Here <i>P</i><sub>A</sub> is the ambient pressure in the fluid and the sine wave represents pressure variation with position at a fixed point in time. The wave amplitude is <i>P</i><sub>w</sub> and the wavelength is &#x03BB;.</p>
<p class="indent">The physical effects of sound vibrations are most easily experienced by standing in front of a loudspeaker playing music at high volume. The actual sound vibrations are transmitted through the air and are not only audible but<a id="page_3" class="page">page 3, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>can also be sensed by the body through the skin. The bass notes are felt through the body more easily than the high notes and this is connected with the frequency of the pressure pulse creating the sound. Low frequency sound becomes audible at around 18 Hz (1 Hz &#x003D; 1 Hertz &#x003D; 1 cycle per second), but as the frequency of the sound is raised (becoming more treble) it becomes more difficult for the body to respond and that sensation is lost. High frequency sound, while not noticeably affecting the body, does cause severe annoyance to hearing, e.g. feedback noise from a microphone through a loud speaker. At even higher frequencies the ear finds it difficult to respond and eventually the human hearing threshold is reached, normally around 18&#x2013;20 kHz for adults, sound beyond this limit is inaudible and is defined as ultrasound. The hearing threshold is not the same for other animal species, thus dogs respond to ultrasonic whistles (so called &#x2018;silent&#x2019; dog whistles) and bats use frequencies well above 50 kHz for navigation (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The broad classification of ultrasound as sound above 20 kHz and up to 100 MHz can be subdivided into two distinct regions Power and Diagnostic. The former is generally at lower frequency where greater acoustic energy can be generated to induce cavitation in liquids. It is cavitation which is the origin of sonochemical effects. Sonochemistry normally uses frequencies between 20 and 40 kHz simply because this is the range employed in common laboratory equipment. However since acoustic cavitation in liquids can be generated well above these frequencies, recent researchers into sonochemistry use a much broader range (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>). High frequency ultrasound from around 5 MHz and above does not produce cavitation and this is the frequency range used in medical imaging.</p>
<p class="indent">A whistle which generates a frequency of 20 kHz is inaudible to humans but perfectly audible to a dog&#x2014;and produces no physical harm to either. It is<a id="page_4" class="page">page 4, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>however in the correct FREQUENCY range to affect chemical reactivity (Power Ultrasound). Yet such a whistle blown in a laboratory will not influence chemical reactions in any way. This is because the whistle is producing sound energy in air and airborne sound cannot be transferred into a liquid. Technically this is due to an impedance mismatch between the two. Different materials have different &#x2018;resistances&#x2019; to the passage of sound which are determined by their elastic properties and cross-sectional areas. Efficient energy transfer between two materials is only possible when the resistances are balanced.</p>

<p class="noindent">It has been recognised for many years that power ultrasound has great potential for use in a wide variety of processes in the chemical and allied industries. Some of these applications have been known and used for many years [2,3,4] while others are undergoing a renaissance and developing into new and exciting possibilities, as in the use of power ultrasound in therapeutic medicine (<a href="#tab_1.2">Table 1.2</a>). Two of these applications have provided the direct antecedents of the types of equipment now commonly used for sonochemistry, namely ultrasonic welders and cleaning baths.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Ultrasonic welding</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A large proportion of ultrasonic equipment currently in industry is involved in welding or rivetting plastic mouldings for the consumer market. This equipment consists of a generator producing an alternating electrical potential at a frequency of around 20 kHz which feeds a transducer (normally piezoelectric or magnetostrictive, see below), which converts the electrical energy into mechanical energy. A shaped tool or horn transmits (and amplifies) the vibrating motion to a shaped die pressing together the two pieces of material to be welded. The vibrational amplitude is typically 50&#x2013;100 microns.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasonic welding is generally used for the more rigid amorphous types of thermoplastic. Thermoplastics have two properties which make them particularly suited to ultrasonic welding: (a) low thermal conductivity and (b) melting or softening temperatures of between 100 and 200 &#x00B0;C. Ultrasonic vibrations pass through the bulk plastic of the component, without producing bulk heating, to the joint which rapidly heats up. As soon as the ultrasonic power is switched off the bulk material becomes a heat-sink, cooling the<a id="page_6" class="page">page 6, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>welded joint. This is a great improvement on conductive heating for welding since in this case the thermal gradient has to be reversed before cooling occurs. This leads to long heating/cooling process cycles and possible distortion of the material. Another major advantage of the use of ultrasound is the high joint strength of the weld, reaching 90&#x2013;98 per cent of the material strength. Indeed test samples usually break in the body of the material and not at the weld itself.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Ultrasonic cleaning</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Ultrasonic cleaning is another major application for power ultrasound. It is now such a well established technique that laboratories without access to an ultrasonic cleaning bath are in a minority. It is important to recognise the historical significance of the development of ultrasonic cleaning bath technology on the growth of sonochemistry, because the use of ultrasonic cleaners is probably the first method to which the chemist will turn when starting sonochemistry research.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the laboratory ultrasonic cleaning bath is familiar to the chemist, the industrial applications of such cleaning are perhaps less well known. Yet it is developments in industrial cleaning which have made it possible to consider large-scale chemical reactions, since the larger the batch chemical process the bigger will be the size requirement of the bath. Ultrasonic cleaning can be both delicately applied (computer microcomponents, jewellery, medical instruments) and used for very large items (gas cylinder heads, engine blocks).</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Cutting</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Ultrasonic cutting has been available to industry since the early 1950s specifically for accurate profile cutting of brittle materials such as ceramics and glass. It has been extensively used in the aerospace industry since the 1970s for glass and carbon fibre composites. In recent years, ultrasonic cutting has been introduced into the food processing industry where it would appear to have far wider application than the laser and water (oil) jet cutting technologies introduced in the 1980s [1].</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasonic cutting uses a knife type blade attached through a shaft to an ultrasonic source. Essentially the shaft with its blade behaves as an ultrasonic horn driven normally at 20 kHz and with a generator similar to that of an ultrasonic welder. The cutting action is a combination of the pressure applied to a sharp cutting edge surface and the mechanical longitudinal vibration of the blade. Typically the tip movement will be in the range 50 to 100 microns peak to peak. Several advantages arise from the mode of action of this technology.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. In conventional cutting the blade has to compress the bulk material to allow a gap the width of the blade to pass through and this applies a tensile rupturing force at the crack tip. With ultrasonic cutting the whole blade moves or vibrates continuously as it stretches and contracts. This very high frequency movement effectively reduces the coefficient of friction to a very low level, enabling the blade to slide more easily through the bulk material.</p>
<p class="banoindent1"><a id="page_7" class="page">page 7, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>2. The ultrasonic vibration of 20 kHz applies an oscillating force to the material to be cut and generates a crack (cut) at the tip, controlling its propagation or growth, thereby minimising the stress on the bulk material.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. The repeated application of the cutting tip to the product applies a local fatiguing effect which reduces significantly the overall force required to break the bonds of the bulk material.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Therapeutic ultrasound</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The field of imaging is well accepted in the medical field but in recent years ultrasound has been used in therapeutic medicine (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>) [5]. One such development is for the destruction of blood clots, where a miniaturised ultrasonic device (1 MHz) is attached to the end of a catheter so that it can be inserted into the blood vessel. The device is brought close to the clot and a fibrolytic enzyme is released. When the transducer is activated the chemical, assisted by acoustic energy, rapidly dissolves the clot. Another use involves a focused array of transducers for use in cancer therapy. The array can accurately target small rugby football shaped volumes within the body to thermally destroy cancerous cells in a sequence of exposures which cover the infected region. At lower powers the focused ultrasound can be used to enhance the action of chemotherapy agents, often a porphyrin, which become localised in the region of cancerous cells. In this case the effects are generally thought to enhance the chemical reactions involved in chemotherapy, which are generally considered to be radical in nature.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Processing</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The use of power ultrasound in the processing industry has a long history with a great number of different applications. Some of these are dealt with later in this chapter (<a href="#tab_1.5">Table 1.5</a>).<a id="page_8" class="page">page 8, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>
<p class="h3"><b>Sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An ever increasing interest in the specific uses of power ultrasound to affect organic, inorganic, and organometallic synthesis (sonochemistry) has resulted in the organisation of several major conferences and the establishment of special interest groups. It was in 1986 that the first ever International Symposium on Sonochemistry was held at Warwick University, UK as part of the Autumn Meeting of the Royal Society of Chemistry [6]. This meeting was significant in that it was the beginning of serious interest in the uses of ultrasound in chemistry as a study in itself; since then there have been regular international meetings on the subject. The formation of a Royal Society of Chemistry Sonochemistry Group in 1987 followed by a European Society in 1990 and then other national groups has meant that the subject has expanded greatly over the last few years.</p>
<p class="indent">Uses for ultrasound have been found in chemistry which are quite distinct from synthesis. Amongst such areas are environmental protection (both biological and chemical); material science (new catalytic materials, improved extraction, crystallisation, and new methods in polymer technology); electrochemistry (providing improvements in plating electrosynthesis and electroanalysis); and biotechnology (the modification of enzyme and whole-cell activities).</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Cavitation&#x2014;the origin of sonochemical effects</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">The effects of ultrasound on chemical transformations are not the result of any direct coupling of the sound field with the chemical species involved on a molecular level. The reason why power ultrasound is able to produce chemical effects is through the phenomenon of cavitation. Cavitation is the production of microbubbles in a liquid when a large negative pressure is applied to it. This was first characterised at the turn of the century by Sir John Thomycroft and Sidney Bamaby [7]. They were called in to investigate the poor performance of a new screw driven destroyer, HMS <i>Daring,</i> the ship did not reach the high speeds expected. The problem was traced to an incorrect setting of the propeller blades resulting in inefficient thrust. As a result of this study, it was found that during the rapid motion of the propeller blade through the water one face produced thrust, as expected, but the trailing edge produced sufficient &#x2018;negative&#x2019; pressure in the water to pull molecules apart and create tiny microbubbles (cavities). These bubbles subsequently collapsed with the release of intense local energy. Cavitational collapse of this type near the metal surface is extremely detrimental to propeller wear since it causes erosion of the blade.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem of cavitation caused by propeller motion became a significant problem at the beginning of the Second World War. The Allies had a system of sonar submarine detection which was &#x2018;active&#x2019;, that is to say that they sent out a short burst of sound (a ping) and waited to pick up any echo from a submarine. From the time involved between emission and reception of the echo a<a id="page_9" class="page">page 9, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>distance for the target could be estimated. Of course the ping was also detectable by the target which then knew it was under surveillance. The German forces had developed a &#x2018;passive&#x2019; sonar system which simply listened for any underwater noises generated by submarines. That this noise was the result of cavitation produced by the propellers was proven by the fact that the cavitation noise was easily detectable when the submarine was running at periscope depth (some 50 feet under the surface), but became less and less as the ship dived. As we will see later this can be explained by the increase in water pressure with depth which makes cavitation more difficult to produce. During this time there was an enormous amount of research involving sonar which did much to progress the development of transducers. Today many naval research laboratories are interested in the production of harder alloys for propellers and better design to help combat cavitational damage.</p>
<p class="indent">How then can power ultrasound produce cavitation&#x003F; Like any sound wave, ultrasound is transmitted via waves which alternately compress and stretch the molecular spacing of the medium through which it passes (see <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). Thus the average distance between the molecules in a liquid will vary as the molecules oscillate about their mean position. If a large negative pressure, i.e. sufficiently below ambient, is applied to the liquid (here it is the acoustic pressure on rarefaction) so that the distance between the molecules exceeds the critical molecular distance necessary to hold the liquid intact, the liquid will break down and voids will be created, i.e. cavitation bubbles will form. Theoretical calculations indicate that for pure water the negative pressure required is of the order of 10000 atmospheres. If the calculation is modified so that allowance is made for the bubbles to be filled with vapour (from evaporation of the liquid), cavitation will still require negative pressures of about 1000 atmospheres. In practice cavitation can be produced at considerably lower applied acoustic pressures due to the presence of weak spots in the liquid which lower its tensile strength. Weak spots include the presence of gas nuclei in the form of dissolved gas, minute suspended gas bubbles, or tiny suspended particles. In order to study the true cavitation threshold of a liquid it is necessary to use a degassed liquid which has been subject of ultrafiltration.</p>
<p class="indent">When produced in a sound field at sufficiently high power the formation of cavitation bubbles will be initiated during the rarefaction cycle. These bubbles will grow over a few cycles taking in some vapour or gas from the medium (rectified diffusion) to an equilibrium size which matches the frequency of bubble resonance to that of the sound frequency applied. The acoustic field experienced by an individual bubble is not stable because of the interference of other bubbles forming and resonating around it. As a result some bubbles suffer sudden expansion to an unstable size and collapse violently. It is the fate of these cavities when they collapse which generates the energy for chemical and mechanical effects (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are several theories which have been advanced to explain the energy release involved with cavitation of which the most understandable in a qualitative sense is the &#x2018;hot spot&#x2019; approach [8]. Each cavitation bubble acts as<a id="page_10" class="page">page 10, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>a localised microreactor which, in aqueous systems, generates instantaneous temperatures of several thousand degrees and pressures in excess of one thousand atmospheres.</p>

<figcaption>
<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 1.4</b> Development and collapse of cavitation bubbles</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Over the years it has been common practice to classify cavitation into two types&#x2014;transient and stable (also called inertial and non-inertial). Transient cavities generally exist for no more than a few acoustic cycles during which time they expand to at least double their initial radius before collapsing violently within a few microseconds. Stable cavities are those which oscillate, often non-linearly, about some equilibrium size with a lifetime of tens of cycles. This is a simplification of the actual situation within an acoustic cavitation zone, but it does emphasise that there is more than one type of cavitation process involved [9].</p>
<p class="indent">It was once thought that the spectacular effects attributable to cavitation were entirely due to the collapse of transient cavities. It is now believed that the oscillation of &#x2018;stable&#x2019; bubbles makes a significant contribution to the overall sonochemical effect. In this text, however, we are interested mainly in the overall effects of cavitation and so we will not overly concern ourselves with any distinction between types of cavitation.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.4">
<h1 class="h1"><b>1.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Parameters which affect sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">In spite of the great amount of published literature in the field of sonochemistry, only a relatively small number of papers report the influence of the reaction conditions on the rate and/or yields of chemical reactions. This is somewhat surprising since it is well known that external parameters have a great influence on cavitation, and since cavitation is necessary to induce sonochemical reactions then it is important that those factors which influence cavitation are understood. Armed with this knowledge it should be easier to organise the experimental conditions such that the sonochemical effects are maximised.<a id="page_11" class="page">page 11, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>
</section>
<p class="h3"><b>Frequency</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As the frequency of irradiation is increased so the rarefaction phase shortens and it is necessary to increase the amplitude (power) of irradiation to maintain an equivalent amount of cavitational energy in the system. In other words more power is required at a higher frequency if the same cavitational effects are to be maintained, e.g. ten times more power is required to make water cavitate at 400 kHz than at 10 kHz.</p>
<p class="indent">When the ultrasonic frequency is increased into the MHz region it becomes more and more difficult to produce cavitation in liquids. The simplest explanation for this, is qualitative terms, is that at very high frequency the rarefaction (and compression) cycle is extremely short. The production of a cavity in the liquid requires a finite time to permit the molecules to be pulled apart, so when the rarefaction cycle approaches and becomes shorter than this time, cavitation becomes difficult and then impossible to achieve. It should also be recognised that transducers which operate at these high frequencies are not mechanically capable of generating very high ultrasonic power. This is the main reason why the frequencies generally chosen for cleaning, plastic welding, and subsequently sonochemistry are between 20 and 40 kHz.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Solvent viscosity</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The formation and collapse of voids or vapour filled microbubbles (cavities) produces shear forces in the bulk liquid. Since viscosity is a measure of resistance to shear it is more difficult to produce cavitation in a viscous liquid.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Solvent surface tension</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Cavitation requires the generation of a liquid-gas interface. Thus it might be expected that employing a solvent of low surface energy per unit area would lead to a reduction in the cavitation threshold. This is not a simple relationship, but certainly where aqueous solutions are involved the addition of a surfactant facilitates cavitation.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Solvent vapour pressure</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Cavitation bubbles do not enclose a vacuum. During the expansion phase of cavitation bubble generation, vapour from the surrounding liquid will permeate the interface. This produces a small pressure within the bubble, reducing the pressure differential between cavity and bulk. It is difficult to induce cavitation in a solvent of low vapour pressure because less vapour will enter the bubble. A more volatile solvent will support cavitation at lower acoustic energy and produce vapour filled bubbles. Unfortunately, however, sonochemical effects are based upon the energy produced by cavitation bubble collapse which is cushioned by vapour in the bubble. Hence solvents with high vapour pressures easily generate vapour filled bubbles, but their collapse is cushioned and therefore less energetic.<a id="page_12" class="page">page 12, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>
<p class="h3"><b>Bubbled gas</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We have already referred to the fact that dissolved gas or small gas bubbles in a fluid can act as nuclei for cavitation. We will also see later that ultrasound can be used to degas a liquid. Thus at the beginning of the sonication of a liquid, any gas which is normally entrapped or dissolved in the liquid promotes cavitation and is removed. Manufacturers of ultrasonic cleaning baths will always wait until the water in their bath is ultrasonically degassed before using it for cleaning, because the bath is not producing its optimum cavitational effects until the gas is removed.</p>
<p class="indent">Many research groups deliberately introduce a gas into a sonochemical reaction in order to maintain uniform cavitation. According to theory, the energy developed on collapse of these gas-filled bubbles will be greatest for gases with the largest ratio of specific heats (polytropic index). For this reason monatomic gases (He, Ar, Ne) are used in preference to diatomics (N<sub>2</sub>, air, O<sub>2</sub>). Gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> are most unsuitable.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>External (applied) pressure</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Increasing the external pressure will mean that a greater rarefaction pressure is required to initiate cavitation (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a> for the effect of depth on cavitation produced by a submarine propeller). More importantly, raising the external pressure will give rise to a larger intensity of cavitational collapse and consequently an enhanced sonochemical effect. Cum <i>et al.</i> have studied the oxidation of indane to indan-1-one using potassium permanganate (Scheme <a href="#sec_1.1">1.1</a>), at two different frequencies (21.5 and 48 kHz) and under various external pressures [10]. For each set of experiments at a particular frequency only the applied pressure was changed while the other parameters (e.g. power, temperature, reaction volume) were kept constant (<a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>). The results showed that at a specific frequency there is a particular external pressure which will provide an optimum sonochemical reaction, moreover this optimum power depends upon the frequency used.</p>

<p class="noindent">Luche and co-workers have extensively studied the Barbier reaction (Scheme <a href="#s1_2">1.2</a>). They have shown that the reaction rate strongly depends on temperature and there is a clearly defined optimum value (<a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>) [11].</p>
<p class="indent">Any increase in temperature will raise the vapour pressure of a medium and so lead to easier cavitation but less violent collapse (see above). This will be accompanied by a decrease in viscosity and surface tension. However,<a id="page_13" class="page">page 13, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>at higher temperatures approaching solvent boiling point, a large numbers of cavitation bubbles are generated concurrently. These will act as a barrier to sound transmission and dampen the effective ultrasonic energy from the source which enters the liquid medium.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Intensity</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The same reaction was also studied under varying power input (<a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>) [11]. Once again an optimum value was observed. Power variation was achieved by varying the applied potential (V) at the piezoelectric transducer.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of sonication is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration of the ultrasonic source. In general, an increase in intensity will provide an increase in the sonochemical effects, but there are limits to the ultrasonic energy input to the system.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. A minimum intensity for sonication is required to reach the cavitation threshold. This minimum depends upon the frequency.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. When a large amount of ultrasonic power enters a system, a great number of cavitation bubbles are generated in the solution. Many of these will coalesce forming larger, more longer lived bubbles. These will certainly act as a barrier to the transfer of acoustic energy through the liquid.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. At high vibrational amplitude the source of ultrasound will not be able to maintain contact with the liquid throughout the complete cycle. Technically this is known as decoupling, and results in a great loss in efficiency of transfer of power from the source to the medium. Decoupling is more pronounced when large numbers of cavitation bubbles build up at or near the emitting surface of the transducer.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. The transducer material used in the sonicator will eventually break down as the increasing dimensional changes in the transducer become large enough to fracture the material.</p>
<p class="indent">Several examples exist of situations where above a certain energy input the sonochemical effect is reduced, but a particularly good example is the effect of increasing power on the yield of iodine from the sonication of aqueous KI<a id="page_15" class="page">page 15, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>(<a href="#fig_1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>) [12]. The initial response of iodine yield appears to be proportional to power, but this effect is reduced beyond 40 W and drops dramatically above 100 W where decoupling occurs.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Attenuation of sound</b></p>
<p class="noindent">For a variety of reasons the intensity of sound is attenuated (i.e. it decreases) as it progresses through a medium. Some of this energy is dissipated in the form of heat although there is little appreciable heating of the bulk medium during sonication. The extent of attenuation is inversely related to the frequency. This can be shown by using the example of sound attenuation through pure water. Sound at 118 kHz is reduced to half its original intensity after passing through 1 km of water. At 20 kHz the distance required to achieve the same reduction in intensity is much greater at 30 km (this explains why submarine communications are carried out at low frequencies). These examples indicate that in order to achieve identical intensities in a medium at a given distance from an ultrasonic source using different frequencies, it will be necessary to employ a higher initial power for the source with the higher sound frequency.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The types of chemical systems affected by power ultrasound</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">Sonochemistry is mainly concerned with reactions which involve a liquid component within which cavitation can be induced, but since this covers almost all possible chemical situations, sonochemistry has very broad applications. Some typical classes of chemical reaction affected by ultrasonic irradiation are described below.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Homogeneous reactions&#x2014;involving a single liquid phase</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Any system involving a liquid in which bubbles are produced is not strictly homogeneous however in sonochemistry it is normal to consider the original<a id="page_16" class="page">page 16, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>state of the system to which the ultrasound is applied. The mechanical and chemical effects of the collapsing bubble will be felt in three distinct regions (<a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>).</p>

<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 1.9</b> Cavitation bubble collapse in a homogeneous medium</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="h4"><i>Reactions inside the bubble</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The inside of the bubble can be thought of as a high energy microreactor. In order for a chemical to experience the extreme conditions generated inside the cavitation bubble during collapse it must enter the bubble and so should be volatile. The &#x2018;concentration&#x2019; of cavitation bubbles produced by sonication using conventional laboratory equipment is very small and so overall yields in this type of reaction are low. Thus in the sonication of water small quantities of OH&#x002A; and H&#x002A; radicals are generated in the bubble and these undergo a range of subsequent reactions including the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Scheme <a href="#s1_3">1.3</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/f0016-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p id="s1_3" class="figurecaption">Scheme 1.3</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_17" class="page">page 17, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>The highly oxidising HO&#x002A; species can react with other moieties in the bubble or migrate to the bulk solution where they have only transient existence but can be detected chemically [13]. Any species dissolved in the water is clearly going to be subject to chemical reaction with the ultrasonically produced hydrogen peroxide, e.g. if iodide ion is present in solution it will be oxidised and iodine will be liberated (see later). Organic solvents will also slowly decompose on sonication but solvent decomposition normally provides only a minor contribution to any sonochemical reaction taking place in the medium.</p>
<p class="indent">A synthetically useful reaction which takes place in the collapsing bubble is the production of amorphous iron from the sonolysis of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> (0.4 M) in decane under argon [14]. Volatile iron pentacarbonyl enters the bubble and is decomposed during collapse. The fact that an amorphous (rather than crystalline) material is produced confirms that very high temperatures are generated in the bubble and that extreme cooling rates are involved. Conventional production of amorphous iron requires rapid cooling from the vapour to solid state of the order of 10<sup>6</sup> K sec<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Sonolytic decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in pentane (a more volatile solvent) yields Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub> rather than the metal, indicating that the cavitation collapse is not so violent in this solvent (<a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>). Since this original report, the study of cavitation-induced decomposition of iron and other metal carbonyls has continued and expanded. In the case of molybdenum hexacarbonyl, the product is nanostructured molybdenum carbide which has proved to be an excellent dehydrogenation catalyst [15].</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Reactions at or near the bubble/liquid interface</i></p>
<p class="noindent">It is tempting to conclude from this that sonochemistry has no effect on materials which cannot enter the bubble. This is not the case as has been shown in a range of reactions during which the very short-lived radicals produced within the bubble migrate to the interface and beyond to undergo reactions with involatile species dissolved in the bulk medium. A good example of this is spin trapping experiments used to identify the radical species produced in the sonolysis of water [12].</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Reactions in the liquid immediately surrounding the bubble</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The collapse of the bubble also produces very large shear forces in the surrounding liquid capable of breaking the chemical bonding in polymeric materials dissolved in the fluid (<a href="#fig1_10">Fig. 1.10</a>) [16]. Over the last few years increasing interest has been shown in this procedure since the net result of polymer-chain rupture is a pair of macroradicals, which may recombine randomly (resulting in a reduction in molar mass and possibly leading to a monodispersed system) or act as a radical site on which to polymerise another monomer added to the solution (resulting in block copolymerization).</p>
<p class="indent">Small accelerations, in the range 4&#x2013;15 per cent, have been found for the rate of acid-catalysed hydrolysis of a number of esters of carboxylic acids [17,18]. In the case of methyl ethanoate, the effects (at 23 kHz) were attributed to the<a id="page_18" class="page">page 18, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>increased kinetic energy of the molecules induced by the pressure gradients associated with bubble collapse. Similarly, the hydrolysis of the 4-nitrophenyl esters of a number of aliphatic carboxylic acids at 35 &#x00B0;C showed ultrasonically (20 kHz) induced rate enhancements which were all in the range of 14&#x2014;15 per cent (Scheme <a href="#s1_4">1.4</a>) the activation energy for the hydrolysis of each of the substrates varied considerably with the alkyl substituent (R &#x003D; Me, Et, <i>i</i>-Pr, <i>t</i>-Bu) on the carboxylic acid, and so the uniform increase in rate could not be associated with any cavitational heating effect. Here again the modest sonochemical effect was considered to be the result of mechanical effects [19].</p>

<p class="indent">The effect of ultrasonic irradiation on the hydrolysis of 2-chloro-2-methyl-propane in mixed aqueous ethanolic solvents of different compositions revealed more evidence for the influence of mechanical effects [20]. The rate enhancement induced by ultrasound (at 20 kHz) was found to increase with an increase in the alcohol content and to decrease as the reaction temperature was raised. A maximum rate increase of 20-fold was observed at 10 &#x00B0;C (in 50 per cent w/w solvent composition). This composition is closely coincident with the structural maximum for the binary ethanol/water solvent system. It is logical to suppose that if the sonochemical enhancement is associated with solvent disruption then the maximum effect would be observed at this composition.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Heterogeneous reactions involving a solid and a liquid</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two types of reaction involving solid/liquid interfaces: (i) in which the solid is a reagent and is consumed in the process and (ii) in which the<a id="page_19" class="page">page 19, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>solid&#x2014;often a metal&#x2014;functions as a catalyst. In any heterogeneous system cavitation which occurs in the bulk liquid phase will be subject to the same conditions as have been described above for homogeneous reactions. There will be a difference, however, when bubbles collapse at or near any interface and this will depend upon the type of solid phase involved.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Cavitation at or near to any large solid surface</i></p>

<figcaption>
<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 1.11</b> Cavitation bubble collapse near a solid surface</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In this case the bubble collapse will no longer be symmetrical. The large solid surface hinders liquid movement from that side and so the major liquid flow into the collapsing bubble will be from the other side of the bubble. As a result of this a liquid jet will be formed which is targeted at the surface with speeds in excess of 100 ms<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> (<a href="#fig_1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>). The mechanical effect of this is equivalent to high pressure jetting and is the reason why ultrasound is so effective in cleaning. When examined by electron microscopy, surfaces of metals which have been subjected to ultrasonic irradiation reveal &#x2018;pitting&#x2019;. This pitting serves both to expose new surface to the reagents and to increase the effective area available for reaction and is particularly important for the preparation of organometallic intermediates. These are commonly prepared by the direct reaction between a metal and an organic compound. A general problem with such preparations is that the metal surface is easily &#x2018;poisoned&#x2019; by the presence of moisture and other impurities making reaction difficult. In most cases therefore the reagents used for such preparations must be pure and dry and the surfaces of the metal clean and oxide free&#x2014;as a result these syntheses require special precautions to be taken. Ultrasonic irradiation has made it possible to prepare some organometallic reagents even with technical grade chemicals, conditions unheard of in classical methodology. This is of great economic importance to industry, suggesting that for some syntheses sonication may remove the need to employ super-pure (and thus expensive)<a id="page_20" class="page">page 20, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>chemicals. One example of this is the use of ultrasound for the preparation of Grignard reagents in technical grade diethyl ether [21]. The reaction between magnesium and 2-bromobutane can be ultrasonically induced in under 5 min in this solvent whereas conventional stirring (even with occasional crushing of the metal) takes over 3 h (<a href="#tab_1.3">Table 1.3</a>). Depending upon the conditions used this powerful jet can activate surface catalysis, force the impregnation of catalytic material into porous supports, and generally increase mass and heat transfer to the surface by disruption of interfacial boundary layers.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Cavitation in the presence of a suspended powder</i></p>
<p class="noindent">When the solid is particulate in nature cavitation can produce a variety of effects depending on the size and type of material (<a href="#fig_1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>). These include mechanical deaggregation and dispersion of loosely held clusters, the removal of surface coatings by abrasion, and improved mass transfer to the surface. Mechanical deagglomeration is a useful processing aid and is illustrated in the effect of sonication (in a bath) of titanium dioxide pigment in water. A powder sample made up in water consisting initially of agglomerates (volume mean diameter <i>ca.</i> 19 &#x03BC;m) was rapidly broken apart (&#x003C;30 seconds) to provide a limiting size of 1.6-&#x03BC;m particles. Furthermore, the<a id="page_21" class="page">page 21, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>sonicated sample showed no sign of re-agglomeration even after being allowed to stand for a period of 24 hours [22].</p>

<p class="indent">A study of the Ullmann coupling reaction has provided evidence that the mechanical effects of surface cleaning coupled with an increase in surface area cannot fully explain the extent of the sonochemically enhanced reactivity. The reaction of 2-iodonitrobenzene to give a dinitrobiphenyl using conventional methodology requires heating for 48 hours and the use of a tenfold excess of copper powder (Scheme <a href="#fig_1.5">1.5</a>). The use of power ultrasound affords a similar (80 per cent) yield in a much shorter time (1.5 hours) using only a fourfold excess of copper [23]. During these studies it was observed that the average particle size of the copper fell from 87 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m to 25 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m, but this increase in surface area was shown to be insufficient to explain the large enhancement in reactivity (a factor of fifty) produced by ultrasonic irradiation. The studies suggested that sonication assisted in either the breaking down of intermediates and/or the desorption of products from the surface. An additional practical advantage was that sonication prevented the adsorption of copper on the walls of reaction vessels, a common problem when using conventional methodology.</p>

<p class="indent">Studies on the effect of sonication on suspended metal powders at 20 kHz in decane at 20 &#x00B0;C have shown that the particles can be forced into such violent collision that fusion can occur [24]. This can be demonstrated for zinc, a soft metal with a low melting point, more significantly for chromium (m.p. 1857 &#x00B0;C) and molybdenum (m.p. 2617 &#x00B0;C), but not for tungsten (m.p. 3410 &#x00B0;C). This led to the conclusion that the collision energy developed was sufficient to raise the temperature of the surfaces in collision to at least 2617 &#x00B0;C but not to 3410 &#x00B0;C&#x2014; thus giving a measure of the energy involved. In some cases colliding powders can be induced to undergo chemical reaction thus a mixture of powdered copper and sulphur sonicated in hexane generates CuS [25].</p>
</section>
<p class="h3"><b>Heterogeneous reactions involving immiscible liquids</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A problem when dealing with syntheses involving immiscible liquids (e.g. aqueous/organic mixtures) is that the reagents are often dissolved in different phases. Any reaction between these species can only occur in the interfacial region between the liquids and this is a very slow process. Sonication can be used to produce very fine emulsions from immiscible liquids. This is the result of cavitational collapse at or near the interface which causes disruption and impels jets of one liquid into the other to form the emulsion (<a href="#fig_1.13">Fig. 1.13</a>).<a id="page_22" class="page">page 22, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>

<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 1.13</b> Cavitation bubble collapse in a biphasic medium</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The normal method of inducing a reaction between species dissolved in different immiscible liquids (usually water and an organic solvent) is through the use of a phase transfer catalyst (PTC) which will bring both reactants into the same, usually organic, phase. There are, however, two drawbacks to the use of such catalysts in that some of the more specialised PTC reagents are expensive, and all the PTCs are potentially dangerous since they can, by their very nature, transfer chemicals from water into human tissue. Sonication of immiscible liquids generates extremely fine emulsions, which result in very large interfacial contact areas between the liquids and a corresponding dramatic increase in the reactivity between species dissolved in the separate liquids. This effect can be used to either replace the need for a PTC or reduce dramatically the quantity required. A good example of this type of application is to be found in the hydrolysis of commercially important oils, fats, and waxes in aqueous NaOH (Scheme <a href="#fig_1.6">1.6</a>) [26]. The fats are immiscible with the aqueous base and so there is very little contact between fat and NaOH. Traditionally rapid stirring and boiling is used to increase the rate of hydrolysis, but boiling tends to lead to some decomposition and the generation of coloured products. Under sonochemical conditions these hydrolyses can be carried out rapidly and at lower temperatures leading to substantially cleaner products.</p>

<p class="noindent">Recent decades have seen the development of a number of new technologies each of which offer the hope of providing the chemist with innovative synthetic routes. Some of them suffer from their own peculiar limitations. For example, photochemistry requires that the chemicals used include a chromophore, and so will not work in highly absorbent solutions. Power ultrasound is not attenuated by a coloured medium and does not require a specific type of functional group to be effective. Sonochemistry certainly falls into the category of a new technology in itself but it has another major advantage for the chemist&#x2014;it can be used to improve the efficiency of other methodologies. Consider the following examples of the use of ultrasound to help other processes.</p>
</section>
<p class="h3"><b>High-pressure chemistry (piezochemistry)</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Conventional piezochemistry requires specially reinforced, and therefore expensive, reactors. The actual agent volumes involved are often very small (of the order of only a few millilitres for pressures above 1000 bar). In the plant the safety measures are extensive and costly. Ultrasound has been used to reduce the high pressure required for some transformations.</p>

<p class="indent">Scheme <a href="#fig_1.7">1.7</a> shows the preparation of vanadium hexacarbonyl anion which requires a temperature of 200 &#x00B0;C and 200 atmospheres under conventional conditions. These forcing conditions can be reduced to just 10 &#x00B0;C and only 4.4 atmospheres when performed in the presence of power ultrasound [27]. The use of ultrasound to reduce the forcing conditions required for some transformations is not the only benefit of its use. Sonication does not suffer from the restriction of small sample size.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Electrochemistry</b></p>
<p class="noindent">These processes often suffer from restrictions in current flow (reduced current efficiency) during the course of the electrolysis because of electrode fouling or hindrance to ionic transport to the electrode surface. Ultrasonic irradiation has been used to great advantage to improve electrochemical processes and the subject has become known as sonoelectrochemistry [28]. The particular advantages include:</p>
<p class="numlist">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>degassing at the electrode surface;</p>

<p class="noindent">All of these effects combine to provide enhanced yield and improved electrical efficiency.<a id="page_24" class="page">page 24, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>
<p class="h3"><b>Catalysis</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Solid catalysts suffer from surface deactivation through chemical contamination (poisoning) and passivation during continuous usage. The cleaning effect of ultrasound and its surface activation are important in the enhancement of catalytic reactions. When the catalyst is in the form of a powder or an agglomerate, power ultrasound can also be used to reduce the particle size thereby increasing the available surface area for reaction. This benefit has already been referred to above for an Ullmann reaction (Scheme <a href="#sec_1.5">1.5</a>) [23].</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Supported reagents</b></p>
<p class="noindent">When certain chemicals, even enzymes, are adsorbed onto solid supports their reactivity is enhanced over the reagent itself. Ultrasonic irradiation provides a more efficient method of depositing such chemicals onto supports [29]. It also enhances mass transfer to the surface. Consider the case of the substitution of bromide by cyanide (Scheme <a href="#fig_1.8">1.8</a>). This reaction yields no benzyl cyanide under mechanical agitation in the absence or presence of neutral alumina. However, with alumina present and using ultrasonic irradiation, the substitution product is formed in 64 per cent yield.</p>

The resulting powder is reduced to Ru metal using hydrazine conventionally and in the presence of ultrasound. The resulting Ru metal catalyst prepared under sonochemical conditions was far superior to that prepared conventionally, in that there was a greater penetration of the metal into the support with no metal close to the surface.</p>

Galton who was interested in establishing<a id="page_25" class="page">page 25, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>the threshold levels of human hearing [31]. He produced a whistle which generated sound of known frequencies, and was able to determine that the normal limit of human hearing is around 18 kHz. Galton&#x2019;s whistle was constructed from a brass tube with an internal diameter of about two millimetres (<a href="#fig_1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>), and was operated by passing a jet of gas through an orifice into a resonating cavity. On moving the plunger the size of the cavity could be changed to alter the &#x2018;pitch&#x2019; or frequency of the sound emitted. An adaptation of this early principle is to be found in some dog whistles which have adjustable pitch.</p>

<p class="indent">An alternative form of gas-generated ultrasound is the siren. When a solid object is passed rapidly back-and-forth across a jet of high pressure gas it interferes with the gas flow and produces sound of the same frequency at which the flow is disturbed. A siren can be designed by arranging that the nozzle of a gas jet impinges on the inner surface of a cylinder through which there are a series of regularly spaced perforations. When the cylinder is rotated the jet of gas emerging from the nozzle will rapidly alternate between facing a hole or the solid surface. The pitch of the sound generated by this device will depend upon the speed of rotation of the cylinder.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither type of transducer has any significant chemical application since the efficient transfer of acoustic energy from a gas to a liquid is not possible (see above). However, whistles are used for the atomization of liquids.</p>
<p class="indent">The conventional method of producing an atomized spray from a liquid is to force it at high velocity through a small aperture. (A typical domestic example being a spray mist bottle for perfume.) The disadvantage in the design of conventional equipment is that the requirement for a high liquid velocity and a small orifice restricts its usage to low viscosity liquids, and these atomizers are often subject to blockage at the orifice.</p>
<p class="indent">Figure 1.15 shows a schematic gas driven atomizer. The system comprises of an air or gas jet which is forced into an orifice where it expands and produces a shock wave. The result is an intense field of sonic energy focused between the nozzle body and the resonator gap. When liquid is introduced into this region it is vigorously sheared into droplets by the acoustic field. Air by-passing the resonator carries the atomized droplets downstream in a fine soft plume shaped spray. The droplets produced are small and have a low<a id="page_26" class="page">page 26, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>forward velocity. Atomized water sprays have many uses including dust suppression in industry and humidifiers for horticultural use under glass.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Liquid-driven transducers</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In essence this type of transducer is a &#x2018;liquid whistle&#x2019; and generates cavitation via the motion of a liquid rather than a gas. Process material is forced at high velocity by the homogeniser pump through a special orifice from which it emerges as a jet which impacts upon a steel blade (<a href="#fig_1.16">Fig. 1.16</a>). There are two ways in which cavitational mixing can occur at this point.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, through the Venturi effect as the liquid rapidly expands into a larger volume on exiting the orifice, and, secondly, via the blade which is caused to vibrate by the process material flowing over it. The relationship between orifice and blade is critically controlled to optimise blade activity. The required operating pressure and throughput is determined by the use of different sizes and shapes of the orifices, and the velocity can be changed to achieve the necessary particle size or degree of dispersion. With no moving<a id="page_27" class="page">page 27, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>parts, other than a pump, the system is rugged and durable. When a mixture of immiscible liquids is forced through the orifice and across the blade, cavitational mixing produces extremely efficient homogenisation.</p>

<p class="indent">Equipment employing this principle has been in existence for nearly forty years. The main user has been the food industry where the homogenisation of immiscible liquids has always been important; however, more recently other industries have turned to this simple device for processing (<a href="#tab_1.5">Table 1.5</a>).</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Electromechanical transducers</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The two main types of electromechanical transducers are based on either the piezoelectric or the magnetostrictive effect. The most commonly used of which are piezoelectric transducers, generally employed to power the bath and probe type sonicator systems. Although more expensive than mechanical transducers, electromechanical transducers are by far the most versatile.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Magnetostrictive transducers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Historically magnetostrictive transducers were the first to be used on an industrial scale to generate high-power ultrasound. These are devices that use an effect found in some materials, e.g. nickel, which reduce in size when placed in a magnetic field and return to normal dimensions when the field is removed (magnetostriction). When the magnetic field is applied as a series of short pulses to a magnetostrictive material it vibrates at the same frequency. In simple terms, such a transducer can be thought of as a solenoid in which the magnetostrictive material (normally a laminated metal or alloy) forms the core with copper wire winding. To avoid magnetic losses two such solenoids are wound and connected in a loop (<a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The major advantages of magnetostrictive systems are that they are of an extremely robust and durable construction and provide very large driving forces. This makes them an attractive proposition for heavy-duty industrial processing. There are, however, two disadvantages, firstly the upper limit to the frequency range is 100 kHz, beyond which the metal cannot respond fast enough to the magnetostrictive effect, and secondly the electrical efficiency is less than 60 per cent with significant losses emerging as heat. As a result of the second of these problems all magnetostrictive transducers subject to<a id="page_28" class="page">page 28, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>extended use are liquid cooled. This has meant that piezoelectric transducers (see below) which are more efficient and operate over a wider frequency range are generally considered to be the better choice in sonochemistry, especially in laboratory situations. However, now that a range of industrial applications for sonochemistry are under consideration, particularly those requiring heavy-duty continuous usage at high operating temperatures, the magnetostrictive transducer is coming back into consideration.</p>

<p class="indent">Many improvements in the operating efficiency of this type of transducer have been made all of which are based on finding a more efficient magnetostrictive core. The original nickel-based alloys have been replaced by more electrically efficient cobalt/iron combinations and, more recently, aluminium/iron with a small amount of chromium. One of the latest developments in magnetostrictive technology has been the introduction of a new material called TERFINOL-D. This is an alloy of the rare earths terbium and dysprosium with iron, which is zone refined to produce a material almost in the form of a single crystal. It can be produced in various forms, rods, laminates, tubes etc., and has several major advantages over the more conventional alloys used. A magnetostrictive transducer based on this material can generate more power than a conventional piezoelectric transducer, it is compact (about 50 per cent smaller) and lighter than other magnetostrictives. It does have the same problem as other such devices in that it has an upper limit of frequency response&#x2014;in this case 70 kHz.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Piezoelectric transducers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The most common types of transducer used for both the generation and detection of ultrasound employ materials which exhibit the piezoelectric effect, discovered over a century ago [32]. Such materials have the following two complementary properties:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The direct effect&#x2014;when pressure is applied across the large surfaces of the section a charge is generated on each face equal in size but of opposite sign. This polarity is reversed if tension is applied across the surfaces.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_29" class="page">page 29, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>2. The inverse effect&#x2014;if a charge is applied to one face of the section and an equal but opposite charge to the other face, then the whole section of crystal will either expand or contract depending on the polarity of the applied charges. Thus, on applying rapidly reversing charges to a piezoelectric material fluctuations in dimensions will be produced. This effect can be harnessed to transmit ultrasonic vibrations from the crystal section through whatever medium with which it is in contact.</p>
<p class="indent">Quartz was the piezoelectric material originally used in devices such as the very early types of ASDIC underwater ranging equipment. Quartz is not a particularly good material for this purpose because of its mechanical properties, it is somewhat fragile and difficult to machine. Modem transducers are based on ceramics containing piezoelectric materials. These materials cannot be obtained as large single crystals and so, instead, they are ground with binders and sintered under pressure at above 1000 &#x00B0;C to form a ceramic. The crystallites of the ceramic are then aligned by cooling from above their ferroelectric transition temperature in a magnetic field. Such transducers can be produced in different shapes and sizes. Nowadays the most frequently employed piezoceramic contains lead zirconate titanate (commonly referred to as <i>pzt</i> where the <i>p</i> represents plumbum&#x2014;the chemical term for the element lead&#x2014;and the <i>z</i> and <i>t</i> are initials from the name of the salts). The most common form is a disc with a central hole. In a power transducer, it is normal practise to clamp two of these piezoelectric discs between metal blocks which serve both to protect the delicate crystalline material and to prevent it from overheating by acting as a heat sink. The resulting &#x2018;sandwich&#x2019; provides a durable unit with doubled mechanical effect (<a href="#fig_1.18">Fig. 1.18</a>). The unit is generally one half wavelength long (although multiples of this can be used). The peak<a id="page_30" class="page">page 30, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>to peak amplitudes generated by such systems are normally of the order of 10&#x2013;20 microns and they are electrically efficient. Generally piezoelectric devices must be cooled if they are to be used for long periods at high temperatures because the ceramic material will degrade under these conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Such transducers are highly efficient (&#x003E;95 per cent) and, depending on dimensions, can be used over the whole range of ultrasonic frequencies from 20 kHz to many MHz. They are the exclusive choice in medical scanning which uses frequencies above 5 MHz.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.8</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The cavitation threshold</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">When very low power ultrasound is passed through a liquid and the power is gradually increased, a point is reached at which the intensity of sonication is sufficient to cause cavitation in the fluid. It is only at powers above the cavitation threshold that sonochemistry can occur because only then can the great energies associated with cavitational collapse be released into the fluid. In the medical profession, where the use of ultrasonic scanning techniques is widespread, keeping scanning intensities below the cavitation threshold is of vital importance. As soon as the irradiation power used in the medical scan rises above this critical value cavitation is induced and, as a consequence, unwanted even possibly hazardous chemical reactions may occur in the body. Thus, for both chemical and medical reasons there is a considerable drive towards the determination of the exact point at which cavitation occurs in liquid media, particularly in aqueous systems. There are essentially three methods which can be used for the determination of the cavitation threshold relying on either the initial detection of bubbles in the medium, the emission of light (sonoluminescence), or the identification of a chemical reaction which occurs only in the presence of cavitation.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Determination by the detection of bubbles</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Bubbles are extremely efficient absorbers of ultrasound and this provides the basis for a sensitive measurement of the threshold. A low intensity ultrasonic source is arranged with a receiver in a liquid such that the absorption (attenuation) of sound in that liquid can be assessed. Power ultrasound from a separate source can now be applied to the liquid and the attenuation continuously monitored as the sonication power is increased. The onset of cavitation is registered when the attenuation suddenly leaps to a higher value due to the presence of cavitation bubbles in the fluid.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Determination through the detection of sonoluminescence</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Sonoluminescence is the emission of a weak light from cavitating fluids. This emission can be engendered by power ultrasound operating above the cavitation threshold. Sonoluminescence is outside of the scope of this book but a comprehensive review has been published recently. The detection of the onset of sonoluminescence for the determination of the cavitation threshold has been used successfully by Crum and co-workers [33], who have described in detail<a id="page_31" class="page">page 31, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>the experimental apparatus required. This includes both a &#x2018;fluid management system&#x2019; to provide ideal conditions in the liquid to be sonicated and a schematic diagram showing the circuitry used for the generation of cavitation.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Determination through the initiation of chemical reactions</b></p>
<p class="noindent">For the practising sonochemist the above systems are perhaps too &#x2018;physics&#x2019; oriented, when the main interest for them is the onset of cavitation-induced chemistry. The point at which cavitation induces chemical reaction can be used as a true measure of the cavitation threshold which occurs in an actual reaction vessel, i.e. one which is later to be used for sonochemical experiments. Here we will look at two different types of reaction which have been used as chemical probes for the onset of cavitation. By definition these must be particularly sensitive in detecting low levels of radical species. Other, more routine, dosimeters also exist and these are used for the measurement of the amount of cavitation induced by prolonged ultrasonic irradiation. These will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Spin trapping and esr identification of radicals</i></p>
<p class="noindent">When cavitation is induced in a liquid, one possible result is the production of free radicals. The hydroxy and hydrogen radicals produced by cavitation in aqueous media are short-lived species which can often be identified by spin trapping and subsequent esr (electron spin resonance) examination of the spin adduct formed [13]. Spin traps are usually nitroso or nitrone derivatives and the adducts are the longer-lived nitroxide radicals [31]. For the detection of hydroxyl radicals, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-<i>N</i>-oxide (DMPO) is particularly useful, while for hydrogen atoms, <i>&#x03B1;</i>-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-<i>N</i>-tertbutylnitrone (4-POBN) is preferable because of the longer lifetime of the spin adduct (Scheme <a href="#sec_1.9">1.9</a>). These methods have been used to study aqueous solutions of amino acids, peptides, DNA bases, sugars, nucleosides, nucleotides, surfactants, and mixtures of water and alcohols [32].</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Using a fluorescence technique</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Terephthalic acid (TA) has often been used as a chemical dosimeter for ionising radiation and functions effectively as a trap for hydroxy radicals [33]. In aqueous solution TA produces terephthalate anions which react with hydroxyl radicals HO<sup>&#x00B7;</sup> to produce highly fluorescent hydroxyterephthalate ions (HTA) (Scheme <a href="#sec_1.10">1.10</a>) [34]. This reaction provides a very sensitive method of measuring the hydroxyl radicals produced by the sonolysis of water and is particularly useful in determining the cavitation threshold [35].</p>

<figcaption>
<p class="figurecaption">Scheme 1.10</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The product of hydroxy radical reaction with TA is hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) which can be estimated by fluorescence measurements at an analysing wavelength of 425 nm with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm. Very good linearity can be achieved for fluorescence against concentration for HTA down to 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> M, whereas the lower limit for TA is only 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> m. Thus with this system it is possible to detect a 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> M fraction of TA transformed into HTA by HO<sup>&#x00B7;</sup> radicals.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>An ultrasonic exposure system for the determination of cavitation threshold</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In diagnostic ultrasound the onset of cavitation must be avoided, and so great efforts are made to set up a well-controlled exposure environment for cavitation threshold measurements in a fluid. With the aid of such an environment the onset of cavitation can be recorded using one of the sensitive dosimeters already described. The exposure system described below has two advantages. First, it generates a well-characterised acoustic beam that is reproducible. Second, it delivers both constant wave (CW) and pulsed ultrasound, the latter being the type used in medical scanning. The range of intensities generated by this equipment simulates most therapeutic and diagnostic applications of medical ultrasound. The onset of cavitation is signalled by the production of free radicals and two methods for their detection are described: (a) by esr spin trapping techniques and (b) by fluorescence monitoring [13,39].</p>
<p class="indent">The exposure tank is fabricated from 2.5-cm thick sheets of Plexiglas and measures 18 &#x00D7; 30 &#x00D7; 22 cm (<a href="#fig_1.19">Fig. 1.19</a>). At one end an acoustic transducer is mounted, with an absorber positioned directly opposite across the tank to minimise reflections which might result in standing waves. The absorber chosen was castor oil since its acoustic impedance matches that of water and it has a high attenuation coefficient. An acoustic window, made from a thin<a id="page_33" class="page">page 33, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>household plastic film (e.g. cling film), separates the oil from the water. Better acoustic absorbing materials are now available, e.g. a silicone rubber compound filled with microballoons [40]. A constant temperature was maintained in the exposure tank to avoid thermal gradients which would disturb the acoustic beam. Bubbles were also eliminated by using degassed water (boiling distilled water under a vacuum then cooling it in a sealed vacuum bottle makes sufficiently high quality degassed water).</p>

<p class="indent">The reaction cell resembles an inverted T, with a glass cylinder 3.3 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm in length forming the base. The stem is used for mounting and filling the cell which has a sample volume of 20 cm. Both ends of the tube are sealed with an acoustically transparent film (again cling film). Gas was bubbled through the sample prior to sonication but this was stopped before the exposure began. The leading edge of the tube was 6 cm from the surface of the transducer. Before each exposure the tube was centred and aligned with the axis of the acoustic beam.</p>
<p class="indent">A note of warning must be sounded at this point. Controlling the exposure field does not guarantee that the sonochemical results themselves will be reproducible. Using the above apparatus the acoustic field was stable and reproducible but the sonochemical results were not. Cavitation at low-level power, i.e. just above the threshold, is an elusive phenomenon since, apart from factors which affect the exposure field, it also depends on the state of the liquid itself [41].</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.9</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Ultrasonic power measurement</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">The two commonly used sources of ultrasound in the chemical laboratory are the ultrasonic cleaning bath and the probe system. The bath system transmits energy into water contained in the bath, so that acoustic energy can<a id="page_34" class="page">page 34, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>be transferred to any reaction flask dipped into the water. The bath is generally low in energy and of fixed power. The more powerful probe system, which is of variable power, transmits acoustic energy directly into a reaction mixture via a wave guide (usually made of titanium) directly attached to the power transducer. These systems will be dealt with in detail in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">Any paper reporting sonochemical results would be expected to specify the make and model of the irradiation source employed, and this is normally so. Unfortunately, the power input to the reacting system is sometimes reported only as the quoted maximum rating for the equipment. A 500-W unit does not mean that the instrument delivers 500 W of ultrasonic power into any system when operating at its maximum setting. In order to record the actual power input to a reaction some standard method of measurement is required. These methods may be divided into physical and chemical dosimetry measurements [42].</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Physical measurements</b></p>
<p class="h4"><i>The <i></i>measurement of vibrational amplitude for a probe system</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the direct measurement of the amplitude at the vibrating tip of the horn, i.e. the actual mechanical motion being transmitted to the chemical reaction in which the probe is immersed. This will give a parameter that should be directly proportional to the acoustic power. The measurement of amplitude can be achieved simply by observing the ultrasonic vibration using a metallurgical microscope with a calibrated eyepiece. Since most transducers will generate amplitudes of at least 10 microns, quite accurate measurements can be made. A small spot of aluminium paint is placed on the surface of the probe and a single metallic fleck is focused in the graticule. On turning on the power the rapidly vibrating fleck appears as a &#x2018;smear&#x2019;, the length of which is the amplitude of vibration. This method of measurement cannot be easily made when the probe is in use during a sonochemical experiment. An electromechanical method is available, however, which provides continuous monitoring with a display while the probe is in use. The alternating stress in a resonating horn is at a maximum in its centre (this is a stationary point, cf. the middle of a stretched elastic band). If a strain gauge is bonded across this point then the output from this will be proportional to the displacement or amplitude of vibration. This output signal can be displayed on a meter. The meter can then be calibrated by the use of a microscope as described above. Vibrational amplitude is not an absolute measure but it does offer a very sensitive monitor for acoustic changes during a sonochemical reaction. Its major drawback is that a strain gauge is a somewhat fragile instrument; however, amplitude gives an indication of the acoustic power output rather than the electrical power into the transducer. Using this method it is only necessary to calibrate the meter once, since any subsequent change in transducer amplitude due to loading will be accompanied by a proportional change in strain in the system. The meter will thus follow any induced changes of amplitude
<a id="page_35" class="page">page 35, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>which occur either as a result of power input or changes in properties of the sonicated reaction.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Measurement of the real electrical power to the transducer</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A wattmeter can be used to measure electrical power to the transducer. When the system is operating in a chemical reaction it is possible to derive the transmitted acoustic power by measuring electrical power to the transducer when the system is running in air (i.e. the probe tip is not immersed in a reaction mixture&#x2014;a situation which is technically referred to as a system operating without a load) and then when it is loaded (i.e. dipped into the system). The transmitted electrical power is the difference between these values. From this the acoustic power entering the reaction can be calculated if the acoustic transfer efficiency is known [43].</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Calorimetrie measurement of ultrasonic power entering a reaction</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Of the methods available to measure the amount of ultrasonic power entering a sonochemical reaction the most common is calorimetry, which involves a measurement of the initial rate of heating produced when a system is irradiated by power ultrasound. In a pure liquid, one might assume that almost all the mechanical energy produces heat and so, via calorimetry, some estimate of the acoustic power entering the system can be obtained. This is a simple method of estimating the overall acoustic power entering a reaction input even when a thermally insulated vessel is not employed. For the system under study the temperature (<i>T</i>) is recorded against time (<i>t</i>)<i>,</i> at intervals of a few seconds, using a thermocouple placed in the reaction itself. From the <i>T</i> versus <i>t</i> data, the temperature rise at zero time, (<i>dT/dt</i>)<i>,</i> can be estimated by either constructing a tangent to the curve at time zero, or by curve-fitting the data to a polynomial in <i>t.</i> The ultrasonic power actually entering the system can then be obtained by substituting the value of (<i>dT/dt</i>) at time zero (obtained from either method) into eqn (1.1).</p>
<p class="eqn" id="fi_1.1">Power = (d<i>T</i>/d<i>t</i>)<i>c</i><sub>p</sub><i>M</i><span class="space2">(1.1)</span></p>

If this Power (in Watts) is dissipated into the system from a probe tip with an Area measured in cm<sup>2</sup>, then the intensity of power (in W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>) produced by the source of ultrasound is given by eqn (1.2).</p>
<p class="eqn" id="fi_1.2">Intensity = Power/Area <span class="space2">(1.2)</span></p>

<p class="h3"><b>Chemical measurements</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A chemical dosimeter monitors only the production of a chemical species through sonochemistry. In a sense this is the true dosimeter required by a chemist, but it does not reflect the total energy entering the system since not all events occurring inside the collapsing bubble give rise to observable chemical products in the bulk liquid. In the case of the sonolysis of water some of the radicals (e.g. H<sup>&#x00B7;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x00B7;</sup>) recombine to regenerate water.</p>
<p class="indent">A few chemical dosimeters are in common usage.<a id="page_36" class="page">page 36, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a></p>
<p class="h4"><i>The iodine dosimeter ( oxidation of I<sup>&#x2013;</sup> to I<sub>2</sub>)</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The iodine dosimetry method is based upon the fact that sonication of water produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and this reacts quickly with I in solution to liberate molecular iodine. Thus, when aliquots of standardised H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (of the order of 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup> M dm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>) are added to KI solution, fixed quantities of iodine will be liberated, and the yield of iodine can be estimated by the increase in absorbance of this species at 355 nm on a UV/visible spectrophotometer. With the aid of such a Beer Lambert plot it is possible to calculate the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which gives rise to a particular absorbance of iodine and hence the yield of peroxide generated from a particular sonolysis of water. The only difficulty with this method is that the quantity of peroxide liberated on insonation of aqueous KI is quite low [44] and so great care should be taken over the cleanliness of equipment. The calibration plot can then be used to estimate the amount of peroxide generated by various sonication systems simply by putting 5 per cent aqueous KI in the reaction vessel and measuring the development of iodine absorbance with sonication time. In this way comparisons can be made between different pieces of sonochemical apparatus. As we will see later, for consistent results it is important to carry out sonications with the various components of the reactor in the same configuration. In addition it is helpful if the same flask is used throughout these measurements&#x2014;particularly for reactions involving ultrasonic baths&#x2014;since this will help to ensure that the same amount of energy is transferred into the reaction through the glass base of the flask.</p>
<p class="indent">The rate of iodine liberation from KI solution can be enhanced by a factor of five in the presence of a small amount of CC1<sub>4</sub> (the so-called Weissler solution), and this method can be used to demonstrate the process (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). The enhancement is the result of sonochemical generation of additional radicals from the haloalkane, which liberate iodine more readily from the KI. The results from this method are thus a reflection of the total number of radicals produced during insonation and are not restricted to those generated from water alone [45].</p>
<p class="h4"><i>The Fricke dosimeter (oxidation of Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>)</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Aqueous sonochemistry can be thought of as similar in some ways to radiation chemistry. One such similarity is in the oxidation of an air-saturated solution of Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, a system analogous to the classical Fricke dosimeter in radiation chemistry. In 1950 Miller [46] studied this oxidation induced by ultrasound of frequency 500 kHz. The yield was found to be dependent upon the length of irradiation up to 10 minutes duration, beyond which non-linearity of yield was encountered. If, however, at the end of the linear period the solution was resaturated with air and then further irradiated, a linear concentration/time was re-established with identical slope to that obtained previously. This observation suggests that the non-linearity is due to ultrasonically induced degassing of the solution. Clearly estimates of energy input must therefore be made based upon initial concentration changes of the Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup><a id="page_37" class="page">page 37, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>ions generated. The oxidation occurs as the result of an indirect process. Cavitational collapse first generates hydroxy radicals and these react with Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to yield hydroxide ion and Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (eqn 1.3).</p>

<p class="indent">A typical solution would be composed of ferrous ammonium sulphate (1 mM) and sodium chloride (1 mM) dissolved in sulphuric acid (0.5 M), and the radiation dose can be calculated based on the increase in absorbance of the Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions at 304 nm [47] (extinction coefficient 2194 M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>).</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Terephthalate dosimeter</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The sensitivity and method of use of this system have already been referred to in terms of the detection of cavitation threshold (<a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.8">Section 1.8</a> and Scheme 1.10). McLean and Mortimer [48] have studied the variations in HO&#x002A; free radical production during the sonication of aqueous solutions at different powers at 970 kHz. Typically the results showed a threshold power for radical production, after which there is a linear correlation with acoustic power indicating its potential for use as a dosimeter. The terephthalate chemical dosimeter can be prepared by dissolving terephthalic acid (TA) 1.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> mol litre<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> and NaOH 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> mol litre<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> in a phosphate buffer at pH &#x003D; 7.4. The fluorescence was measured as in <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.8">Section 1.8</a>. Mason <i>et al.</i> reported the response of the TA dosimeter with different ultrasonic sources and frequencies. They employed probe systems operating at 20, 40, or 60 kHz [49]. Ultrasonic power measurements were monitored using the calorimetric method. It was reported that under constant sonication conditions the measured fluorescence was directly proportional to exposure time. Within the power ranges studied, the yield of HO radicals was proportional to the power input, and at constant power, the fluorescence yield increased from 20 to 60 kHz, i.e. it appears that radicals are produced more efficiently at higher frequencies.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Nitrophenol dosimeter</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Free radicals can also react with aromatic systems and this type of reaction has been used as a method of dosimetry in sonochemistry. Hydroxy radicals generated sonochemically in an aqueous solution containing 4-nitrophenol react to produce nitrocatechol (Scheme <a href="#fig_1.11">1.11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_38" class="page">page 38, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>Aqueous 4-nitrophenol has an ultraviolet maximum at 401 nm and the hydroxylated product at 512 nm. It is therefore possible to use this reaction as a dosimeter for hydroxy ions in a similar way to that used in the terephthalic acid system [50]. In this case a calibration curve is required for the product 4-nitrocatechol (from zero to about 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup> M dm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>). The nitrophenol dosimeter is an aqueous solution (10<sup>&#x2013;4</sup> M dm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>) at pH 5, adjusted using phosphoric acid. The main drawback of this method is that the reactive hydroxy radical can also attach to the first formed product nitrocatechol, and hence lead to other materials with different spectra. For this reason the method tends to be less accurate for high-powered ultrasound over extended monitoring periods.</p>
<p class="indent">In conclusion it is important to note that the above chemical dosimeters do not measure the same effects. The TA and nitrophenol dosimeters are specific for HO<sup>&#x00B7;</sup> radicals, while the others are more general, thus both I<sup>-</sup> and Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> can also be oxidised by HO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x00B7;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or indeed any other species, and such processes do not occur at the same rate (e.g. the rate of production of I<sub>2</sub> from I<sup>-</sup> oxidation and the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in water can be monitored independently and are not the same). Chemical dosimeters are strongly frequency dependent, thus the production of iodine in air-saturated KI solutions is six times faster at 514 kHz than at 20 kHz [51]. They are also strongly dependent on experimental conditions especially with respect to the gas content.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.10</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Types of sonochemistry equipment</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">In subsequent chapters the various types of equipment which can be used for sonochemistry will be explored in depth. In this brief section the types of instrumentation currently available for sonochemistry will be identified. The versatile ultrasonic bath (<a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) and the more powerful probe system (<a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) are the most commonly available to the chemist. The source of power ultrasound for both is generally the piezoelectric transducer and each suffers from the same disadvantage that they operate at a fixed frequency depending on the particular transducer employed. For most commercial probe systems this frequency is 20 kHz and for baths it is 40 kHz. To study sonochemistry at different frequencies it is best to purchase separate systems tailored to individual requirements. It is also possible to construct a package which includes a multiple frequency amplifier from which a set of different horns can be driven.</p>
<p class="indent">These two systems are routinely used in the batch mode. Some laboratory systems offer the possibility of processing quite large volumes by sonication of a part of the reacting mixture as it flows through a sonication cell (flow systems are studied in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). This offers the potential for the processing of larger volumes and is probably the most likely way that sonochemistry could be applied in industry.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>1.11</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The safety of sonochemical equipment</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">There is perhaps a temptation to think that if you cannot hear a noise it cannot be harmful. This is certainly true of sound in the audible range because in that<a id="page_39" class="page">page 39, An introduction to the uses of power ultrasound in chemistry</a>situation zero ear response means very low intensity indeed. With ultrasound, however, much more care must be taken. It is important to note that most ultrasonic devices when irradiating a liquid medium do give rise to some audible sound. This is because the sound spectrum emitted from a sonicated reaction is not composed entirely of the single transducer resonance but includes some sub-harmonics which give rise to very audible sound levels. Ultrasound is attenuated rapidly in air but sources of ultrasound such as probes start at such a high intensity that there is a distinct possibility that long-term exposure without ear protection might result in damage. Consideration must therefore be given to the health and safety aspects associated with the use of ultrasound. Permitted exposure limits do vary from country to country but generally they lie between 85 and 90 dBA over an 8-hour period. A dBA is a technical exposure term representing an average effect of sound pressure as perceived by the ear, i.e. not the actual distribution of sound pressures from the sound spectrum. Sound exposure meters are generally calibrated in these units. Like radioactivity shorter exposure times permit higher dBA levels. The simplest course of action is that those laboratories which employ sonicators should refer to the latest current industrial practice in their own country. There are three ways in which workers can be protected against radiated noise:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. Generally, any person working with ultrasonic equipment should wear either acoustic ear muffs or in the ear protectors. These are generally available for use in noisy industrial environments. The simple ultrasonic cleaning bath is not normally sufficiently noisy to warrant more than this simple precaution.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. It is good practise to isolate ultrasonic equipment in laboratories where access is limited&#x2014;a closed door is a reasonable sound barrier.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. It is recommended that an acoustic screen is placed around the ultrasonic equipment&#x2014;particularly in the case of powerful probe systems. This can take the form of a box lined with a sound absorbing material, say expanded polystyrene or polythene bubble wrapping. In the chemical laboratory a fume cupboard can be partially sound proofed in this way. A neat solution for the teaching laboratory is a sound-proof box mounted on wheels so that it can be moved around to wherever it is needed.</p>
