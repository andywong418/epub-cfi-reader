<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite its convenience for use, the major disadvantages of the ultrasonic cleaning bath as a general source of ultrasound for sonochemistry are a low maximum power and the absence of energy control. One solution to both of these problems has been found in a piece of equipment originally developed for plastic welding and biological cell disruption&#x2014;the ultrasonic probe. In the laboratory, it is possible to introduce ultrasonic energy into a reaction using a probe system up to some 100 times greater than can be achieved using a cleaning bath. On a larger scale the energies can be much greater than this. Modem probe systems are generally based on piezoelectric transducers and are all of a similar construction.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.1">
<h1 class="h1"><b>3.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Ultrasonic probe construction</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">In order to increase the amount of ultrasonic power available to a reaction it is desirable to introduce the energy directly into the system, rather than rely on its transfer through the water of a tank and then the reaction vessel walls. The simplest method of achieving this would be to have the face of an ultrasonically vibrating transducer in contact with the reaction medium. The maximum amount of power (vibrational amplitude) generated by a transducer assembly is limited by the properties of the material from which it is constructed. A piezoceramic will fail if too much electrical power is fed into it (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>). It is possible to amplify the vibrational amplitude generated at the transducer by attaching to it a specially designed length of metal rod. This rod extension is termed a sonic horn or velocity transformer, and it not only magnifies the acoustic energy available but also allows the transducer to be kept clear of the chemical reaction since only the tip of the rod needs to be immersed in the liquid. It is the complete assembly of transducer plus horn which is referred to as an ultrasonic probe system. The overall construction of a simple laboratory probe system is shown in <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The generator</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the source of alternating electrical frequency (normally 20 kHz) which supplies the transducer. The basic controls on the generator are given below.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Tuning</i></p>
<p class="noindent">For optimum performance a probe system should be &#x2018;tuned&#x2019; before it is used. Tuning is a process whereby the complete probe assembly is brought into resonance with the transducer&#x2014;this is the point where the minimum current<a id="page_58" class="page">page 58, The ultrasonic probe</a>is drawn during operation. This may well be at a frequency fractionally different from 20 kHz. Thus, if a horn is shortened by tip erosion, then the resonance frequency will change. Eventually the limits of adjustment of the generator and transducer will be reached and tuning will no longer be possible&#x2014;when this occurs the only solution is to replace the horn. Early types of generator were only able to cope electronically with small variations in tuning frequency. It was recommended that the initial tuning of such systems was carried out in air when the system is not &#x2018;under load&#x2019;. The load refers to the extra power required to drive the probe system when it is immersed in a liquid medium, so the generator must also be able to provide the extra power to the transducer, and this forms the basis of one method of measuring the acoustic power input to a reaction (<a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.9">Section 1.9</a>).</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Sometimes a system which has been tuned in air will not perform satisfactorily when immersed in the reaction mixture. This is particularly noticeable when operating at low powers with viscous liquids. If the reaction mixture changes in physical characteristics during sonication&#x2014;through a change from starting materials to products or warming&#x2014;the power required to maintain optimum resonance changes, so that re-tuning may be necessary. The modem type of generator can tolerate a much wider range of tuning frequencies. Such systems are tuned when immersed in the reaction, and various types of electrical feedback can be incorporated in the design to give continuous adjustment of the tuning as the reaction proceeds. The slight change in the overall resonance frequency which results from changes in a liquid load are discussed below (<a href="chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Power</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The power control on a simple generator simply allows the energy delivered to the transducer to be varied&#x2014;normally on an arbitrary 0 to 100 per cent scale.<a id="page_59" class="page">page 59, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>The upper limit prevents overload and fracture of the piezoceramic element, but the scale is not a direct reading of the energy entering the reaction.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Pulse</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This was originally incorporated into probe systems to prevent the build up of reaction temperature during continuous operation. The facility consists of a timer attached to the amplifier which switches the power to the probe on and off repeatedly. The &#x2018;off time allows the chemical system to cool between the pulses of sonication. The &#x2018;on&#x2019; time is represented as a fraction of the total time involved in the total time of the cycle, which is generally set at 1 second. Thus 100 per cent is continuous sonication, while 25 per cent represents 0.25-second bursts of power interspersed with 0.75-second &#x2018;off time. This type of pulse operation should not be confused with &#x2018;duty cycle&#x2019; as used in medical ultrasound. In medical parlance, the duty cycle refers to the on/off ratio for scanning which involves the emission of pulses of extremely short duration (of the order of 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup> s) involving only a few cycles of ultrasound in the megahertz range. It is in the longer off period that the echoes are detected. By comparison a pulse cycle of 50 per cent in a sonochemistry probe system corresponds to a 0.5-second &#x2018;pulse&#x2019; which contains 10 000 cycles at 20 kHz.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The transducer element</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The sandwich transducer element is protected by a casing (the transducer housing) which is perforated to allow cooling and may sometimes contain a small fan to prevent overheating. The shape and dimensions of the transducer assembly are dependent on its working frequency. Generally a 20 kHz assembly is twice the length and width of that of a 40 kHz. When a magnetostrictive transducer is used the element will also be protected in a casing, but in this case, the cooling is rather more vital and this is normally achieved using a circulating fluid.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The upper (fixed) horn or booster</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The role of the booster is to adapt the vibration from the transducer so that it can be passed through the detachable horn at a working amplitude, which is introduced into the reaction medium. For the majority of laboratory probe systems this is the part of the system to which other horns of different configuration (see below) may be attached. The booster is a solid piece of titanium alloy which is accurately machined to provide a part of the overall resonating system. The end face of the fixed horn is normally about 1.2 cm in diameter, vibrating at a maximum in amplitude. It is important to recognise that with the (detachable) horn in place the whole probe system resonates, with a maximum vibration now occurring at the tip which is dipped into the reaction medium. With the whole probe unit in resonance there will be points of zero vibrational motion (null points) in the system and one of these will be on the booster. This is where a screw thread may be located for the attachment of optional ancillary equipment, e.g. a flow cell or a PTFE sleeve (see below).<a id="page_60" class="page">page 60, The ultrasonic probe</a></p>
<p class="h2"><b>The detachable horn</b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important part of the whole probe assembly is the detachable horn, which allows the vibration of the fixed horn to be transmitted through a further length of metal which can be used to magnify the power delivered to a system. Most modern probe systems are designed to operate with a range of detachable horns, each offering a different magnification of power. Horn design is in fact a very important aspect of ultrasonic engineering. The material used for acoustic horns should have high dynamic fatigue strength, low acoustic loss, resistance to cavitation erosion, and also be chemically inert. The most suitable material by far for this purpose is titanium alloy.</p>
<p class="indent">The cavitation which is the source of chemical activation is also the source of a common problem with probe systems&#x2014;tip erosion&#x2014;which occurs despite the fact that most horns are made of titanium alloy. One major side effect of erosion is that there will be a physical shortening of the horn below a half-wavelength which will cause a loss of efficiency. The latter problem is alleviated by the use of replaceable screw-on tips for the 1.2 cm diameter horn in the form of titanium studs, this eliminates the need for a costly replacement of the whole section.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several engineering factors which are important in the design of the different types of detachable horn. The first of which is its length. The wavelength of ultrasound in a material is determined by both the type of material and the frequency of the sound wave. In the case of the type of titanium alloy used for horns, the wavelength for 20 kHz sound is about 26 cm, and this defines absolutely the longitudinal dimension of cylindrical horns made of titanium alloy. The minimum length of such a titanium horn is a half-wavelength, i. e. 13 cm, which will give an exact mirror of the vibrational amplitude supplied at one end to the other. If the distance between the upper fixed probe assembly and the sample being processed needs to be increased, this can be done using a horn cut to a multiple of half-wavelengths. This can also be achieved by screwing one half-wavelength horn into another thereby building up the overall length. This will not change the vibrational amplitude.</p>
<p class="indent">The shape of the horn controls the way in which it can be used to transmit acoustic energy from the booster to the reaction mixture (<a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>). The cylinder will not affect the vibrational amplitude, but if the end diameter of a horn is smaller than the area attached to the driving transducer element, there will be a magnification of the ultrasonic vibration (i.e. power). Consider ultrasound entering at the booster end of the horn (driven face <i>D</i>) at say 5 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m peak to peak at a cross-section of 3 cm diameter. All of this energy must be dissipated at the other end of the horn. If that end is of smaller area, say 1 cm diameter (emitting face <i>d</i>), then the vibrational amplitude must be greater in order to conserve energy. This amplitude gain is defined by a specific ratio of the diameter of the two faces of the horn. For a linear or exponential tapered horn, this ratio is <i>D/d</i> giving an emitting amplitude of 15 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m<i>.</i> For a stepped horn, however, the ratio is (<i>D/d</i>)<sup>2</sup> giving 45 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m. Thus, horn magnification is always higher for the stepped horn.<a id="page_61" class="page">page 61, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a></p>

<p class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 3.2</b> Horn shapes and amplification</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In order to avoid material damage by internal stress, the amplification factor cannot be too high, for the linear taper it is normally restricted to four. The exponential taper offers higher magnification factors than the linear taper. Its shape makes it more difficult to manufacture, but the small diameter of the working end (3 mm or less) and its length make it particularly suited to micro-applications. The magnification factor for a simple &#x2018;stepped&#x2019; design is significantly larger than the tapered cylinder and can be up to 16.</p>
<p class="indent">Probe systems are undoubtedly the most efficient method of transmitting ultrasonic energy into a reaction. Although so much extra power is available using the probe system, it is more expensive than the bath and it is significantly less convenient in use especially in terms of the glassware required. Special seals will be needed if the horn is to be used in any reactions which involve reflux, inert atmospheres, or the use of pressures above (or below) ambient.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>3.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Choosing a probe system for sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">For the probe system, depending on the design of horn, a large maximum power density can be achieved at the radiating tip. This can be of the order several hundred W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Conventional probe systems</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Until quite recently the choice of commercial probe sonicators was somewhat limited. The only frequency available was 20 kHz and the peripheral equipment was also similar. Essentially this still remains the case, and although there may seem to be a large variety of names for the product, these tend to be the names attached by suppliers rather than those of the very few manufacturers. Nevertheless such systems are ideal for use as laboratory-scale sonicators and should provide the following features.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_62" class="page">page 62, The ultrasonic probe</a>1. Variable power, normally achieved via a dial setting, from zero to a maximum output of about 150 W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> through a probe tip 2.5 cm in diameter. This will normally approximate to a quoted rating for the instrument of 500 to 600 Watts.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. A pulse facility to allow intermittent sonication.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. A range of interchangeable horns of the types described in <a href="chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a> above. Replaceable tips (studs) for the 2.5 cm horn.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. Horn extenders for the 2.5 cm system with screw thread fittings at both ends. Some extenders have only one end with a screw thread for extending the standard horn, but no screw fitting at the other end for further extension or for a replaceable tip.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">5. Two useful attachments which extend the use of the equipment are a flow cell, to enable the probe system to be adapted for continuous processing (see <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>), and a cup-horn (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#sec_2.7">Section 2.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">These probe systems are the &#x2018;work-horses&#x2019; of sonochemistry, requiring only to be tuned to optimum performance in the system under study before being used to sonicate the system for time periods and at powers which are at the operator&#x2019;s discrection.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Additional desirable features</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It has always been possible to have equipment built to particular specifications with extra options. Some of the extra options which are recommended in addition to those above are:</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The option to use different frequencies. This will mean using a different transducer and horn for each required frequency and a different generator. For convenience the frequency generators can all be housed within one box with outlets for each probe system.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. Automatic frequency tuning is useful, since the precise frequency match for the probe and the reacting system may not be exactly the nominal value for the transducer employed. A read-out of the optimised frequency is then important.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. Some form of feedback to the generator from the transducer element, which can be used to maintain irradiation power throughout changes that occur during a reaction. A wattmeter reading of power supply to the transducer or vibrational amplitude of the horn is then an advantage.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.3">
<h1 class="h1"><b>3.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Laboratory-scale sonochemical reactors involving probe systems</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">The simplest method of introducing power ultrasound to a reacting system via a probe system would be to dip the tip of the horn into the chemical reaction<a id="page_63" class="page">page 63, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>contained in a standard round bottomed flask or even a beaker. The temption then would be to turn the power to a maximum and wait to see what type of sonochemistry might develop. Unfortunately, this obvious approach is seldom ideal. Several precautions should be taken when designing a reactor involving a probe as a result of the following factors.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. Volatile components may well be forced out of an open reaction by the &#x2018;degassing&#x2019; effect of power ultrasound.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. Probes can generate a great deal of heat and so cooling may be required.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. When high-energy ultrasound is introduced into a liquid the power input may reach a stage where so much cavitation is produced that it blocks further power input (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>). Thus the maximum setting of the generator power control does not necessarily produce the greatest sonochemical effect.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. Mechanical mixing may be required at low-power settings. At higher powers the vibrating horn tip will produce sufficient streaming of the liquid away from the tip to produce effective bulk mixing.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">5. Chemical reactions may well require vapour-tight apparatus, the slow addition of reagents, or inert atmospheres. Any sonochemical reaction of this type must be performed in a specialised vessel which accommodates such requirements.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Fitting a probe system into standard glassware</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Commercial 20 kHz probe systems are supplied with standard 13 cm horns. Unfortunately, for many laboratory scale reactions, this is too short to enable the vibrating tip to reach the liquid medium. This problem is easily solved with the use of a half-wave extender (cylindrical horn).</p>
<p class="indent">Another problem is to find a way of sealing the horn into a reaction vessel. Here the difficulty is that at most points along its length the horn is undergoing ultrasonic vibrations. Fortunately there is a null point with a screw thread on most commercial sonicators on the booster horn (see <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). Anything screwed onto the horn at this point will not be subject to vibration, and so it is here that a PTFE sleeve adaptor can be attached which can be made to push-fit into a B34 cone of ground-glass apparatus (<a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The design of reaction vessels</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Once the horn has been sealed into the reaction vessel, some of the options then available to make it more suitable for ultrasonic use are given below.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>The use of glass beads</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A probe system will cause mixing in a reaction as a result of the liquid motion produced by the sonic waves generated at the horn tip. The mixing can be enhanced by putting glass beads in the bottom of the reaction vessel. The beads will be &#x2018;bounced&#x2019; into motion by the sonic waves, and thereby assist bulk mixing.<a id="page_64" class="page">page 64, The ultrasonic probe</a></p>

</figure>
<p class="h3"><i>Dimple cell</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Another method of assisting sonic mixing is to adapt the reaction vessel by providing a bump on its base (<a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>). The probe should be positioned vertically above and no closer than 1 cm from the indent, which serves to disperse the sonic waves as they impinge upon and are reflected from the base.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Rosett cell</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The Rosett cell was originally designed to be operated &#x2018;open-ended&#x2019; for biological cell disruption. It allows the irradiated reaction mixture to be sonically propelled from the end of the probe around the loops at the base of the vessel, thus providing efficient mixing and also cooling (when the vessel is immersed in a thermostatted bath). When equipped with a flanged lid and a PTFE seal this is a good general purpose sonochemical reactor (<a href="#fig_3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>).</p>

<p class="h3"><i>Pressure cell</i></p>
<p class="noindent">In situations where elevated pressures need to be used, a reactor has been described by Suslick. Here the screw thread on the horn is used to attach a PTFE collar which locks onto the outside of the glass joint of the sonochemical apparatus (<a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>). This provides a much more efficient pressure seal than the normal push fit of the PTFE sleeve into a ground glass joint.</p>
<p class="indent">A more refined solution has been developed by Undatim, a Belgian company. This cell provides an adjustable anvil to give the optimum reflection and therefore coupling of the ultrasonic power to the liquid system (<a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>).</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>3.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The effect of external parameters on sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of physical parameters which can be changed in order to affect the action of power ultrasound. This section gives the results of an investigation into how ultrasonic energy input to a chemical reaction is affected by the following important reaction parameters: ultrasonic power used, the presence of bubbled gas, temperature, solvent composition, and reaction volume. The work which follows in this section was performed using the Undatim Sonoreactor probe system which is equipped with an automatic transducer resonance frequency search device. This enables the power input to a system to be maintained accurately throughout a reaction, thereby offering considerable advantages compared with basic commercial probe systems in terms of both the monitoring and control of irradiation parameters.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The type of reaction system</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Of the many different classes of reaction which can be enhanced by ultrasonic irradiation the most common are heterogeneous, including both liquid/liquid and liquid/solid. The chosen system for study was the particle size reduction of copper bronze in liquid media under a variety of different conditions [1]. Although this is not a &#x2018;chemical&#x2019; reaction as such, the reduction of particle size, i.e. increase in available surface area of a reactant or catalyst, is a major contributor to sonochemical enhancement of solid/liquid reactions. Moreover the size reduction is a readily quantifiable factor and thus is ideal as a guide to estimating sonochemical efficiency for the range of conditions chosen. It is important to note that the results obtained in this study are based upon a solid/liquid heterogeneous model reaction, and so may not be directly applicable to heterogeneous liquid/liquid or homogeneous reactions for which different models may be necessary.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The effect of bubbled (entrained) gas</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If the main cause of sonochemical effects is cavitational collapse, then it is clear that sonochemical efficiency must be linked directly to the generation of cavitation bubbles in the chemical reaction. For reproducible results many workers have used a bubbled gas to generate large numbers of nucleation sites for cavitation and provide bubbles of uniform energy of collapse. Most effective for such processes are the monoatomic gases such as argon, with diatomics such as nitrogen next, and polyatomics a very poor third. This is directly related to the ratio of specific heats for these gases&#x2014;the highest ratios giving the greatest cavitational effects.</p>
<p class="indent">The particle size reduction of copper bronze, induced by sonication, illustrates the effect of entrained gas on sonochemistry (<a href="#tab_3.1">Table 3.1</a>). The results clearly show that, if all other external parameters are constant, there is a distinct advantage in the continuous passage of argon through the system.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The only disadvantage of such methodology in general sonochemistry is that, at reaction temperatures above ambient and in an open system, there could well be losses of volatile material through evaporation. It has been<a id="page_68" class="page">page 68, The ultrasonic probe</a>demonstrated that efficient saturation of a gas with liquid vapour is achieved by insonation of that liquid with the gas passing through [2]. For this reason in the studies reported below the sonication has been performed in the absence of entrained gases. Except where stated, all reactions were performed using a &#x2018;dimple cell&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The effect of changes in the reaction medium (the liquid load)</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As the temperature of a reaction is increased, the vapour pressure of any liquid involved in the reaction is also increased. The collapse energy of a cavitation bubble, formed during sonication of the medium, will be directly influenced by the vapour which enters the bubble during its formation. The more vapour which enters the bubble the more cushioned is the collapse, so that any increase in the temperature (i.e. vapour pressure) of a system will reduce the energy of cavitational bubble collapse. Thus as the system temperature is raised, the ultrasonic power input will need to be increased if a relatively constant sonochemical effect is to be maintained. Alternatively if the ultrasonic power setting on the generator is constant, then the lower the temperature of operation the greater will be the sonochemical effect. This is demonstrated in <a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a>, where the probe system operating at 20 kHz was set at a constant power rating of 7 during the insonation of water at four different temperatures. The effect of reducing the bulk water temperature from 90 &#x00B0;C to 0 &#x00B0;C, in steps of 30 &#x00B0;C, on the reduction in particle size of copper bronze powder, shows clearly the improvement achieved as the temperature is lowered. The intensity column shows how the measured power entering the system changes with temperature at the same instrument setting.</p>

<p class="h2"><b>The effect of reaction temperature and solvent composition on irradiation frequency and power</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If cavitation is the major cause of sonochemical effects, then factors such as the vapour pressure, viscosity, and surface tension of the solvent will have a bearing on sonochemical reactions. Any change in the reaction temperature results in a change in these parameters with, as a consequence, a change in the optimum resonance frequency for the system. For example, employing the frequency search mode of the Undatim instrument during the irradiation of 100 cm<sup>3</sup> of<a id="page_69" class="page">page 69, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>water at different temperatures and employing three different transducers, a small but significant change in frequency was observed (<a href="#tab_3.3">Table 3.3</a>). The precise change depends upon the geometry of the vessel and the position of the probe tip.</p>

<p class="noindent">Results obtained in 100 cm<sup>3</sup> water in a glass beaker.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">All chemical reactions, by definition, proceed to a product which differs from the starting material, i.e. the properties of the reaction mixture change with time, therefore, there will be a change in the acoustic properties of the medium during the course of a reaction. As a model for this change 200 cm<sup>3</sup> of water and dimethylformamide (DMF) at 20 kHz were separately sonicated and the power input to each system was monitored. At instrument setting 7 it proved possible to transmit 122 watts of power to the aqueous system, but in DMF the power dissipated at the same setting was only 101 watts. Thus, in order to maintain optimum performance for any sonication system where the reaction temperature is not constant, it may be necessary, with conventional instrumentation, to adjust the tuning of the transducer during the course of the reaction (see <a href="chapter3.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The effect of changes in the sonication frequency</b></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the problems associated with operating at different insonation frequencies is that the physical dimensions of the transducers and horns place a real limit upon the power (i.e. amplitude of vibration) which they can deliver. A comparison of the amount of energy (calorimetric) dissipated in 100 cm<sup>3</sup> of water at 30 &#x00B0;C by three different horn systems is shown in <a href="#tab_3.4">Table 3.4</a>. In the same table the physical consequences of this can also be illustrated experimentally by observing the rate of particle size reduction for copper bronze at 30 &#x00B0;C.</p>
<p class="indent">It should not be concluded from these results that the optimum sonochemical effect can only be obtained at high powers, i.e. at low (20 kHz) frequency. From these results it is certainly tempting to assume that the greatest effects are achieved at lower frequencies. What must be borne in mind, however, is that the actual ultrasonic power entering the system also depends<a id="page_70" class="page">page 70, The ultrasonic probe</a>upon the frequency&#x2014;high frequencies are delivered at lower powers. Thus in order to properly equate the effects of ultrasonic irradiation at different frequencies the time of exposure must be considered. A report on the deagglomeration and dispersion of SiC has effectively made this point [3]. In order to de-agglomerate a material with ultrasonic irradiation tow main parameters must be considered:</p>

</figure>
<p class="banoindent1">1. A threshold power level will be necessary to obtain any size reduction and may depend on the frequency.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. Whatever frequency is used, it is the total sum of ultrasonic energy delivered to the system which is important.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus one might expect that the degree of de-agglomeration will be dependent on the total energy (time &#x00D7; power), and results should be more meaningful if the data are compared using this measure of the total energy. The effect of producing the same total energy from a system using 20, 40, and 60 kHz probes can be seen in <a href="#tab_3.5">Table 3.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The results clearly indicate that even if the same total energy is used the 20 kHz probe system does appear to give a better size reduction than the 40 or 60. Significantly, however, both the 40 and 60 kHz systems give very similar results. The same experimental comparison was also made using two different powders, aluminium oxide and nickel, both suspended in water. Again, the same trend was seen. The 20 kHz probe produced a greater particle size reduc-<a id="page_71" class="page">page 71, The ultrasonic cleaning bath</a>tion than the 40 or 60 kHz probe at the same energy delivered. The effect of insonation frequency in sonochemistry is, however, a relatively new area of study, and indications are that in homogeneous reactions and those involving emulsification there may well be a significant frequency effect.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><b>3.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The advantages and disadvantages of using an ultrasonic probe system for sonochemistry</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">In the chemical laboratory the commercially available probe system is the best method of introducing high-power ultrasound into a chemical reaction. Its advantages and disadvantages are summarised below.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The advantages of using an ultrasonic probe system for sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. The ultrasonic power delivered by a horn is directly related to the magnitude of vibration of the tip. This can be readily controlled by the power input to the transducer, and so the precise power of the system can be regulated. Maximum powers of several hundred W cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> can be easily achieved (depending on the size of the unit).</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. Ultrasonic streaming from the tip of the probe operated at moderate power is often sufficient to provide bulk mixing.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. Most modem units have a pulse facility allowing the operator to sonicate reactions repeatedly for fractions of a second. This gives adequate time for &#x2018;cooling&#x2019; between sonic pulses.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">4. With such systems the probe system can be tuned to give optimum performance. This is important in terms of reproducibility of results. Modem equipment is normally fitted with an Automatic Frequency Regulator.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>The disadvantages of using an ultrasonic probe system for sonochemistry</b></p>
<p class="banoindent1">1. As with all systems which operate using piezoelectric transducers, the optimum performance is obtained at a fixed frequency. For most commercial probe systems this is 20 kHz and, although it is possible to drive them at their overtones (i.e. 40 or 80 kHz), the power dissipation at overtones of the fundamental frequency of the system is very much reduced. To operate successfully at different frequencies it is best to purchase individual amplifier/hom systems tailored to individual requirements.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">2. As with baths there is a problem over accurate temperature control unless precautions are taken. The use of specially designed reaction vessels, e.g. a Rosett cell, does alleviate much of this difficulty. The temperature within the reaction vessel should be continuously monitored.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">3. Due to the high intensity of irradiation in the reaction close to the tip, it is possible that radical species may be produced which could interfere with the normal course of reaction.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_72" class="page">page 72, The ultrasonic probe</a>4. The cavitation which is the source of chemical activation is also the source of a common problem with probe systems&#x2014;tip erosion&#x2014;which occurs despite the fact that most probes are fabricated of titanium alloy. There are two unwanted side effects associated with erosion: (i) metal particles eroded from the tip will contaminate the reaction mixture and (ii) the physical shortening of the horn causes a loss of efficiency (eventually it will become too short to be tuned). The latter problem is avoided by the use of screw-on tips to the probe in the form of studs, this eliminates the need for a costly replacement of the whole horn.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">5. Special seals will be required if the horn is to be used in reactions involving reflux, inert atmospheres, or pressures above (or below) ambient.</p>
<p class="banoindent1">6. Laboratory probe systems are generally only suitable for small batch reactions, although multiple probes will cope with larger volumes.</p>
