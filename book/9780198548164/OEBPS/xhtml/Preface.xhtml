<p class="fmnoindent">In recent years, many parts of chemistry have undergone significant changes with the advent of computer-controlled instrumentation, automation, miniaturization and novel fabrication procedures. This has had a large impact on quantitative measurements and on the speed of data acquisition and analysis.</p>
<p class="fmindent">The objective of this primer is to present modern electroanalysis, the application of electrochemistry to analytical problems, at an advanced undergraduate level. The book has been written as a self-contained text which describes the basic principles of the necessary electrochemistry and then moves on to electrochemical sensors, with an overview of future trends. Many exciting developments have occurred in recent years and which are indicated&#8212;applications can be in areas as diverse as industry, health and the environment.</p>
<p class="fmindent">It is our hope that the book will kindle the enthusiasm of the reader to seek more detailed information concerning new developments and strategies and to use electroanalytical techniques.</p>
