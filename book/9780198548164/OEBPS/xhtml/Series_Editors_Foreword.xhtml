<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Ana and Christopher Brett present a stimulating and self-contained introduction to the principles and applications of <i>Electroanalysis.</i> The Primer will interest all students (and their mentors) who require an easy-to-read yet authoritative introduction to this increasingly important topic.</p>
