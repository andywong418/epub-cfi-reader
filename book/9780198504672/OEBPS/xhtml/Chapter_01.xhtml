<p class="noindent">The modem periodic table is most commonly depicted as in <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>, with the two rows Ce-Lu and Th-Lr set apart from the other elements. These two rows are collectively known as the <i>f block</i> or <i>f elements</i>, and are divided into the <i>lanthanides</i> (Ce-Lu) and <i>actinides</i> (Th-Lr). The lanthanide elements lie between lanthanum (atomic number 57) and hafnium (atomic number 72), while the actinides are situated between actinium and rutherfordium (atomic numbers 89 and 104 respectively). All of the f elements are metallic.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the &#x2018;parent&#x2019; elements of the f block, lanthanum and actinium, are really members of group three, they are often included in discussions of f element chemistry. We will not, therefore, confine ourselves to the shaded rows in <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>, but will include certain aspects of the chemistry of lanthanum and actinium where appropriate. Comparisons will also be made between the lanthanides and scandium and yttrium.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout this book we will use the the general symbols <i>Ln</i> and <i>An</i> to refer to the lanthanide and actinide elements respectively.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The village of Ytterby has the honour of being the origin of the name of four elements, yttrium, terbium, erbium and ytterbium.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">In 1794 J. Gadolin, a Finnish chemist, isolated <i>yttria</i> from a mineral that had recently been discovered at Ytterby, a village near Stockholm in Sweden. Gadolin believed that yttria was the oxide of a single new element, but subsequent work revealed it to contain the oxides of no fewer than ten new elements, yttrium, terbium, erbium, ytterbium, scandium, holmium, <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, 1 Definitions and origins</a> thulium, gadolinium, dysprosium, and lutetium&#x0021; Shortly after Gadolin&#x2019;s discovery, M.H. Klaproth and, independently, J.J. Berzelius and W. Hisinger, isolated another new oxide, <i>ceria.</i> This was later shown to contain the oxides of cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, and europium.</p>
<p class="indent">Thorium, protactinium, and uranium are the only naturally occurring actinide elements. In 1789 Klaproth showed that pitchblende, thought previously to be a mixture of zinc, iron, and tungsten oxides, also contained the oxide of a new element which he called uranium. 39 years later Berzelius discovered <i>thoria,</i> a new oxide from which he subsequently isolated thorium. Protactinium was not discovered until 1913, when K. Fajans and O. G&#246;hring identified <sup>234</sup>Pa as a member of the <sup>238</sup>U radioactive decay series. This isotope of protactinium is short-lived (<i>t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x003D;</i> 6.7 hours), but the more stable <sup>231</sup>Pa, identified in 1916 by O. Hahn, L. Meitner, F. Soddy, and J.A. Cranston, has a half-life of 32 760 years.</p>
<p class="indent">None of the other actinide elements occurs naturally, and must be synthesised by nuclear reactions. <a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a> lists the date and method of the first synthesis of the transuranium elements.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Position of the f elements in the periodic table</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although it may appear strange that yttria was initially regarded as being the oxide of just a single element, instead of the ten eventually discovered, it must be recognised that there was no guide available as to how many new elements remained to be found. Indeed, it was not until the work of H.G.J. Moseley in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century that it was recognised that there were 14 elements between lanthanum and hafnium. By 1907 all of these had <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, 1 Definitions and origins</a> been identified bar the radioactive promethium, conclusive evidence for which had to wait until 1947, when J.A. Marinsky, L.E. Glendenin, and D.C. Coryell observed element 61 in the radioactive decay products of <sup>235</sup>U.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after Moseley&#x2019;s work, N. Bohr realised that the 14 elements between lanthanum and hafnium reflected the fact that the fourth atomic primary quantum shell could accomodate 32 electrons, 14 more than the third. These additional electrons are placed in the 4f orbitals, and the lanthanide elements were recognised as forming a new family in the periodic table. For obvious reasons the lanthanides are often referred to as the 4f series of elements. That the actinides form a second f series - the 5f - was not realised until the work of G.T. Seaborg during the Second World War. His suggestion took thorium, protactinium, and uranium out of groups four, five, and six respectively and into their rightful place at the start of a new family of elements, many of which Seaborg was instrumental in synthesising.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Lanthanides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The term &#x2018;rare earth&#x2019;, which is often used to describe the lanthanides, is rather misleading as many of the 4f elements are quite abundant. Cerium is the 26<sup>th</sup> most abundant element on the Earth, neodymium is more abundant than gold and even thulium (the least common lanthanide except for the radioactive promethium) is more abundant in the Earth&#x2019;s crust than iodine. Only two lanthanide-containing minerals are important commercially; monazite, a mixed lanthanide orthophosphate (LnPO<sub>4</sub>) and bastnaesite, a fluorocarbonate (LnCO<sub>3</sub>F). The most common metals in both ores are (in order of decreasing abundance) cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium, with monazite also containing up to 10&#x0025; ThO<sub>2</sub> as well as smaller quantities of the later lanthanides. Monazite deposits occur in many countries, including India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Australia, and Malaysia, while the principal sources of bastnaesite are China and the Sierra Nevada mountains in the western USA.</p>
<p class="indent">Monazite is typically processed by dissolution in <i>ca.</i> 70&#x0025; NaOH solution for several hours followed by addition of hot water to generate a slurry of crude hydrous oxides. The slurry is then added to boiling HCl until a pH of 3.5 is reached, at which point crude hydrous ThO<sub>2</sub> is precipitated. Stoichiometric amounts of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and Ln<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (three and one equivalents respectively) are then added to the remaining solution of impure LnCl<sub>3</sub> to precipitate BaSO<sub>4</sub> and RaSO<sub>4</sub>, leaving a solution of mixed lanthanide trichlorides. This is also the end product of bastnaesite processing, although a somewhat different route is employed. Large-scale separation of the individual lanthanide chlorides is achieved using solvent extraction, typically with a complexing agent such as tributylphosphate - (<sup>n</sup>BuO)<sub>3</sub>PO - in an inert diluent such as kerosene. Separation relies on the increased solubility of Ln(III) with increasing atomic mass. Alternatively, high purity, small-scale separation <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, 1 Definitions and origins</a> may be achieved using ion exchange chromatography, which is discussed in Chapter Five, Section Four.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">Occurrence and extraction of thorium, protactinium, and uranium</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Earth&#x2019;s crust contains 8.1 ppm of thorium, the principal source of which is monazite. Following the precipitation of ThO<sub>2</sub> with boiling HCl (as described above), nitric acid is used to dissolve the hydrous ThO<sub>2</sub>, and the resulting thorium nitrate is purified by extraction into tributylphosphate diluted with kerosene.</p>
<p class="indent">Protactinium is one of the rarest naturally occuring elements, and is found in trace amounts in uranium ores. The majority of the World&#x2019;s supply of protactinium was produced by workers at the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 1960. They painstakingly extracted a total of 126.75 g of protactinium from about 60 tons of sludge that had built up during the extraction of uranium from UO<sub>2</sub> ores. Small amounts of this sample have been distributed to laboratories all over the world, from which much of the chemistry of protactinium has been elucidated.</p>
<p class="indent">Uranium is the heaviest naturally occuring element, with an abundance of 2.4 ppm in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. It is found in many oxide minerals, the most important of which are pitchbende or uraninite (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) and camotite [K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>0]. The main sources of these minerals are Canada, the USA, South Africa, Australia, France, and the countries of the former Soviet Union. The details of the extraction of uranium depend upon the particular ore being used, but typically the ore is leached with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of an oxidising agent such as MnO<sub>2</sub> or NaClO<sub>3</sub> to ensure that all of the uranium is present as an acidic solution of a uranyl <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3.3">
<h3 class="h3">Synthesis of the transuranium elements</h3>
<p class="noindent">As indicated in <a href="#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>, none of the transuranium elements occurs naturally. Neptunium-fermium have been synthesised by neutron bombardment, a process which relies on the fact that neutron capture by a heavy atom is often quickly followed by the emission of a &#x00DF;<sup>-</sup> particle to produce a new atom with its atomic number increased by one. The principal problem with this route is that the yields of the heavier transuranium elements are very low, as their production relies on successive neutron capture. For example, continuous irradiation of kilogram quantities of plutonium by neutrons in a nuclear reactor will produce only milligram yields of californium over several years.</p>
<p class="indent">A second problem is that neutron capture cannot be used to synthesise elements beyond <sup>257</sup>Fm, as the product of the next neutron capture (<sup>258</sup>Fm) undergoes spontaneous fission. To obtain the elements beyond <sup>257</sup>Fm another <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, 1 Definitions and origins</a> approach must be used, involving the bombardment of an actinide target by very light nuclei. This method, some examples of which are given in <a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a>, produces extremely low yields (the new elements are produced one atom at a time&#x0021;) and is limited by the availability of suitable actinide targets.</p>
<p class="indent">The creation, manipulation, and characterisation of the later actinides is extremely difficult. Not only are the yields extraordinarily small, but the reactions are generally not clean and the desired products must be separated from other actinides as well as lighter fission products (which include lanthanides). Furthermore, the intense radioactivity of most of the actinides necessitates the use of radiation shielding, and most manipulations must be carried out by remote control. However, the radioactivity has the advantage that it allows the detection of tiny quantities of material which would be unmeasurable by conventional chemical detection methods.</p>
