<h1 class="main">6<span class="space">&#160;</span> Organometallics</h1>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Some of the most important advances in understanding the behaviour of the f elements have arisen from the study of their organometallic complexes. In this Chapter we describe the methods that are used to synthesise these compounds, the structures that they adopt, and the physical and chemical properties that they display. The aim is to paint a clear picture of the often unique behaviour of the organometallics of the f elements and to explain it using the concepts described in earlier Chapters.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.1">
<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Comparisons with the d block organometallics</h2>
<p class="noindent">The discovery of ferrocene [Fe(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] <b>6.1</b> in 1952 was followed in 1956 by the synthesis of [U(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl], the first well-defined organometallic complex of an f element. It was, however, the synthesis of the cyclooctatetraene sandwich complex uranocene <b>6.2</b> in 1968 which indicated that, while the f elements would have an organometallic chemistry related to that of the transition metals, there would be some contrasts between the two series. The differences in stability, reactivity, and structure between d and f block organometallics can be traced to the large atomic radii of the latter and also to their lower propensity to form covalent bonds (Chapter Five, Section One). For example while carbon monoxide readily forms complexes with many of the transition metals, this behaviour is extremely rare for the lanthanides and actinides and such carbonyl compounds have only recently been isolated (<a href="#sec_6.4">Section 6.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">For the transition metals, the effective atomic number (or 18 electron) rule can be used very effectively to forecast the stability of a proposed organometallic molecule. For the f elements, no such simple rules exist. Formal electron counts and coordination numbers are determined almost exclusively by steric effects, <i>i.e.</i> the size of the metal atom and its ligands. In addition, molecular geometries of transition metal complexes can usually be predicted or rationalised with reference to the crystal field or molecular orbital theories. For the lanthanides and actinides, the large numbers of electrons involved and the effects of relativity (Chapter Three, Section Two) greatly increase the complexity of the theoretical models required to describe their electronic and geometric structures, and accurate calculations have only recently become possible with the advent of powerful computers.</p>
<p class="indent">The sensitivity of most f element organometallics to oxygen and water is a property which they share with the early the d block compounds, but this problem is exacerbated by the large atomic radii of the lanthanides and actinides. It is with the advent of modem techniques for the rigorous exclusion of air and the development of sterically demanding ligands that the field has expanded to the point where, like the d block organometallics, applications in catalysis and other areas are beginning to emerge.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the context of the problems outlined in <a href="#sec_6.1">Section 6.1</a>, the synthesis of f element alkyls MR<sub>n</sub> presented a great challenge, but nevertheless this has been achieved by two general methods.</p>
<p class="indent">First, by analogy with the aryloxides and dialkylamides described in Chapter Five, Section Five, it is possible to synthesise homoleptic complexes of the f elements such as [U&#x007B;CH(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x007D;<sub>3</sub>] <b>6.3</b> using the extremely bulky bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl ligand.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/pg69.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Second, in some instances where smaller alkyl groups are used, the metal centre may accommodate more alkyl ligands than it requires in order to satisfy its valency. For example, the trivalent lutetium centre in <b>6.4</b> has four 2,6-dimethylphenyl groups in a tetrahedral array and thus has an overall negative charge. Such anionic <i>ate</i> complexes are relatively common in f element chemistry (see Chapter Five, Section Five). A quite spectacular example of this behaviour is given by complexes such as the hexamethylerbiate trianion <b>6.5.</b> Similar compounds are known for most of the lanthanides and thorium.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">&#x03B2;-elimination and the agostic interaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many alkyl complexes of the f and d elements undergo decomposition <i>via</i> (&#x03B2;-elimination of an alkene (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig" style="text-align:left;" id="fig6.1">
<img src="../images/fig6.1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="figc"><b>Fig. 6.1</b> Elimination of alkenes from metal alkyl complexes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The f elements do not form strong bonds with &#x03C0; ligands such as alkenes (<a href="#sec_6.4">Section 6.4</a>) and so the intermediate complex <b>6.6</b>, if formed at all, will rapidly lose alkene leaving a hydride species <b>6.7</b> which may decompose further.</p>
<a id="page_70" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 70, 6 Organometallics</a>
<p class="noindent">In order for (&#x03B2;-elimination to occur:</p>
<table class="ntab">
<tr><td><p class="tdata">(i)</p></td><td><p class="tdata">The (&#x03B2; carbon of the alkyl must bear a hydrogen substituent.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="tdata">(ii)</p></td><td><p class="tdata">The M-C-C-H fragment must be able to take up a planar conformation such that the hydrogen atom makes a close approach to the metal.</p></td></tr>

</table>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:-0.7em;">Considering requirement (iii) and the fact that the f elements have a large number of orbitals in various orientations, it is not surprising that their alkyl complexes are particularly susceptible to (&#x03B2;-elimination. It is thus a common tactic in the design of low coordination number f element (and indeed transition metal) alkyl complexes to use alkyl ligands for which (&#x03B2;-elimination is not possible. For example, the alkyl ligands in <b>6.3</b> have no hydrogen atoms on the (&#x03B2; position (in this case, silicon) with respect to the metal. Other important alkyl ligands are neopentyl -CH<sub>2</sub>Bu<sup>t</sup> and benzyl -CH<sub>2</sub>Ph.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In instances where (&#x03B2;-elimination is prevented by the above strategy, another phenomenon may occur. A C-H bond may approach the metal centre closely as if it were moving toward the transition state in an elimination process. The C-H&#x2192;M bridge thus formed (<a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>) is known as an <i>agostic interaction.</i> For example, the formal coordination number in <b>6.3</b> is three, but it has been determined that an agostic interaction is formed between one methyl group from each ligand toward the uranium centre. The C-H bonds involved are in the y position with respect to the metal, and so this is known as a y-agostic interaction. It is probably the case that many f element organometallics which apparently have very low coordination numbers actually contain agostic interactions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Cyclopentadienyls: spectator ligands</h2>
<p class="noindent">As is the case for the transition metals, much of the organometallic chemistry of the f elements is based around complexes containing the formally monoanionic cyclopentadienyl ligands, C<sub>5</sub>R<sub>5</sub> (R &#x003D; <i>e.g.</i> H, Me). Such complexes have useful properties including high reactivity, and stability with respect to decomposition. The cyclopentadienyl ligands themselves do not often take part in chemical transformations, and thus they are an example of what are known as &#x2018;spectator ligands&#x2019;. Cyclopentadienyls are capable of forming both covalent and ionic complexes with between one and five carbon atoms bonded to the metal centre. In the &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup> bonding mode they can be considered to occupy three coordination sites. For example, we can describe the trivalent ytterbium complex <b>6.8</b> as being seven coordinate. One important advantage of these ligands is that their steric demand (or how effective they are at protecting the metal centre) can be altered subtly and methodically by introduction of alkyl group substituents on the ring. Early chemistry was based around the simple C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> ligand known as Cp, but today the use of very bulky ligands is more common.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Simple cyclopentadienyls</h3>
<p class="noindent">For the trivalent lanthanides, three general types of cyclopentadienyl complexes are available, [LnCp<sub>n</sub>X<sub>3-n</sub>] where n &#x003D; 1-3. These compounds are made by reaction of the anhydrous lanthanide halides with sodium cyclopentadienyl (<a href="#eqn6.1">Eqn 6.1</a>). Ether solvents such as THF work best, but since they are themselves powerful ligands to lanthanide and actinide centres, it is often difficult to remove them subsequently.</p>
<p class="rig" id="eqn6.1">LnCl<sub>3</sub> &#x002B; n NaCp &#x2014;&#x003E; [LnCp<sub>n</sub>Cl<sub>3-n</sub>] &#x002B; n NaCl&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;(6.1)</p>
<p class="indent">The compounds [LnCp<sub>3</sub>] react with FeCl<sub>2</sub> to give ferrocene, as would an ionic cyclopentadienyl such as NaCp, and this is taken as an indication of the polar nature of the Cp-Ln bond. This polarity also manifests itself in the fact that quite rapid exchange of Cp ligands occurs between lanthanide centres. Nevertheless, compounds containing the Cp<sub>2</sub>LnCl unit can be isolated as dimers <b>6.9</b> or as Lewis base adducts such as <b>6.10</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/pg71.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The tris(cyclopentadienyl) lanthanide compounds [LnCp<sub>3</sub>] sublime when heated in a vacuum, and this is a convenient way of removing donor solvents (<i>e.g</i>. THF, diethyl ether). The solid state structures of the &#x2018;base-free&#x2019; compounds subsequently obtained vary across the 4f series in a way which reflects the lanthanide contraction (Chapter Two, Section Three). The larger lanthanides such as lanthanum and praseodymium have ten coordinate structures <b>6.11</b> where each metal centre has one &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-Cp and three &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-Cp ligands. The &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-Cp ligands are further bonded &#x03B7;<sup>5</sup> to another metal centre, thus forming a coordination polymer in the solid state. The slightly smaller thulium and ytterbium are nine coordinate <b>6.12</b>. Lutetium, the smallest lanthanide, forms an eight coordinate structure <b>6.13</b>. Interestingly, the group three elements fit into this scheme according to their atomic radii with yttrium adopting structure <b>6.12</b> and scandium that of <b>6.13</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/pg71-1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The trivalent actinide complexes behave similarly to their lanthanide analogues, and although the compounds [AnCp<sub>3</sub>] are well known, complexes <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, 6 Organometallics</a> such as [AnCpCl<sub>2</sub>] are often poorly characterised. Many of these problems are solved by the use of bulky substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands, as we shall see later.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the cyclopentadienyl chemistry of the actinides, however, involves the metals in a tetravalent state, and complexes [AnCp<sub>n</sub>Cl<sub>4-n</sub>] (n &#x003D; 3, 4) can be prepared as in <a href="#eqn6.2">Eqn 6.2</a>. A combination of the high affinity of the actinide ions for cyclopentadienyl rings and the relatively modest steric demand of the unsubstituted Cp ligand makes it impossible to stop reaction in <a href="#eqn6.2">Eqn 6.2</a> at the [AnCpCl<sub>3</sub>] and [AnCp<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] (<i>i,e.</i> n &#x003D; 1, 2) stages. The vast majority of tetravalent cyclopentadienyls of the actinides are, as expected, of thorium and uranium, although some protactinium and neptunium complexes are known.</p>

The chloride ligand in [UCp<sub>3</sub>Cl] and in the analogous [ThCp<sub>3</sub>Cl] can be readily substituted making these compounds among the most important synthons in the organometallic chemistry of the actinides (<a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>). The three cyclopentadienyl groups protect the metal centre quite effectively, but at the same time allow chemistry to take place at the remaining coordination site.</p>

They are soluble, form crystals more readily, and do not suffer so much from the aforementioned ligand redistribution reactions. In the same way that the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> ligand facilitated the exploration of the organometallic chemistry of the d block, the use of bulky cyclopentadienyl ligands such as Cp* paved the way for the f elements.</p>

<p class="indent">The tris(pentamethylcyclopentadienyls) [MCp*<sub>3</sub>] are unknown for the actinides and for most of the lanthanides, most probably because Cp* is too bulky. This relative inaccessibility of complexes with three Cp* ligands is, however, quite convenient since it makes it rather easier to synthesise complexes of the lanthanides [LnCp*<sub>2</sub>Cl], and actinides [AnCp*<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>n</sub>] (n &#x003D; 1, 2). These compounds are very versatile starting materials for the exploration of the chemistry of the MCp*<sub>2</sub> fragment. The complexes [AnCp*<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] (An &#x003D; U, Th) are structurally analogous to [ZrCp<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] and, like the zirconocenes, have an extensive chemistry. The thorium chemistry is particularly well developed, not least because complexes of thorium(IV) are diamagnetic and thus readily studied by NMR spectroscopy. The dichloride <b>6.15</b> (<a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>) can be readily converted to the dimethyl <b>6.16</b> and subsequently the dihydride <b>6.17</b> which is an active catalyst for the polymerisation of ethene and the hydrogenation of a-alkenes. The hydride also undergoes insertion reactions with polar double bonds such as carbonyls. CO itself is reduced at low temperatures to the r|<sup>2</sup>-formyl compound <b>6.18.</b></p>

<p class="noindent">The carbonyl ligand CO is extremely important in transition metal organometallic chemistry. The stability of the M-CO bond arises from the synergic combination of ligand&#x2192;metal a donation and metal&#x2192;ligand &#x03C0; backdonation as shown in <a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="figc"><b>Fig. 6.9</b> The main bonding interactions in metal carbonyl complexes.</p>
<p class="indent">For the f elements, this type of covalent bonding interaction is difficult to achieve; the filled metal orbitals are generally too deeply hidden within the core of the atom to overlap effectively with ligand &#x03C0; orbitals. Nevertheless, co-condensation of lanthanide vapours with CO diluted with argon at low temperatures (&#x003C; 40 K) results in the formation of mixtures of the carbonyls M(CO)<sub>n</sub> (n &#x003D; 1-6) as identified by their infrared spectra. On increasing the temperature, these transient complexes decompose immediately.</p>
<a id="page_76" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 76, 6 Organometallics</a>
<p class="indent">It was pointed out in Chapter Two, Section Two that the greater range of oxidation states exhibited by the early actinides indicates that the valence electrons are less tightly bound than they are for the lanthanides and later actinides, and that these electrons may take part in covalent bonding to ligands. This phenomenon is illustrated by the synthesis under fairly standard laboratory conditions of CO complexes of trivalent uranium surrounded by bulky cyclopentadienyl spectator ligands, [UCp<sup>&#x2010;3</sup>(CO)] <b>6.25</b> and [U(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>4</sub>H)3(CO)] <b>6.26</b> p donor, making the bridging. Infrared spectroscopy shows that the wavenumbers of the carbonyl stretch v(CO) for these two compounds are 1976 cm<sup>&#x2010;1</sup> and 1900 cm<sup>&#x2010;1</sup> respectively. Since these values are rather lower than that in free CO (2146 cm<sup>&#x2010;1</sup>) there must be a significant amount of U-CO &#x03C0; backbonding. This conclusion is supported by molecular orbital calculations on the model compound [UCp<sub>3</sub>(CO)].</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/pg76.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">No such molecular CO complexes of the lanthanides exist, and this is consistent with the emerging picture that these elements are less capable of forming covalent bonds than are the (early) actinides. This difference in behaviour is also borne out by studies of complexes of the isocyanide ligands CN-R which are isoelectronic with CO. The lanthanide complexes [LnCp<sub>3</sub>(CN-Et)] have v(CN) values that are actually higher than that in free EtNC. This behaviour is also observed in the isocyanide complexes of high oxidation state transition metal ions and indicates that there is little or no <i>n</i> backbonding to the ligand from the metal. By contrast, the early actinide compounds have v(CN) values which are slightly lower than the uncomplexed isocyanide.</p>
<p class="indent">Dinitrogen N<sub>2</sub> is isoelectronic with CO but is far less efficient at forming complexes, even with the transition metals. For the f elements, dinitrogen complexes are exceptionally rare. The complexes <b>6.27</b> and <b>6.28</b> are formed by the addition of N<sub>2</sub> to low valent metal centres Sm(II) (Section 6.3) and U(III) respectively.

<p class="indent">Alkene and alkyne complexes of the lanthanides and actinides are very difficult to make. The complex <b>6.29</b> is a rare example, and is stable only because the Pt(0) centre is a good &#x03C0; donor, making the bridging &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-ethene ligand in turn a sufficiently strong Lewis base to coordinate to the divalent [YbCp*<sub>2</sub>] fragment.</p>

<p class="noindent">By contrast to CO which is a &#x03B1; donor/&#x03C0; acceptor ligand, &#x03B7;<sup>6</sup>-arenes are best regarded as &#x03C0; donor/&#x03B4; acceptors. Metal-arene backbonding interactions are comparatively weak since overlap between &#x03B4; orbitals is difficult to achieve both on steric grounds and because arene orbitals with &#x03B4; symmetry are usually high in energy relative to metal d orbitals. The consequence of this is that compared with CO, &#x03B7;<sup>6</sup>-arenes form highly electron-rich (or high energy) complexes, and are usually formed only where the metal is in a low oxidation state. The f elements, with their deeply buried valence orbitals and tendency to form tri- or higher-valent complexes, are thus not the ideal candidates to form such compounds. Despite this, some notable successes have been achieved in the synthesis of complexes which cannot be adequately described by an ionic bonding model.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cyclooctatetraene (COT) requires two electrons in order to achieve its stable ten electron aromatic form (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sup>2&#x2010;</sup> and so one such &#x03B7;<sup>8</sup>-COT ligand would normally be expected to satisfy two metal valencies. It is also a quite sterically demanding ligand, being similar in effective size to Cp* (Section 6.3). COT is therefore ideally suited to the formation of complexes with lanthanides and actinides, perhaps more so than with the transition elements. As was mentioned earlier, COT complexes were among the first f element organometallics, and they are still being studied in great depth, particularly in relation to the nature of the M-(COT) bond.</p>

Note that each individual COT ring orbital has two vertical nodal planes but that there is no nodal plane <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, 6 Organometallics</a> between the two rings.

<p class="indent">The second most important interaction is between the ligand e<sub>2u</sub> orbitals and the uranium 5f. These bonds are depicted in <a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13(c)</a> and <a href="#fig6.13">(d)</a>. In addition to the two nodal planes within each COT ring, there is a nodal plane <i>between</i> the two rings. These <i>ungerade</i> combinations have symmetry matches with the f orbitals shown. It is important to note that these e<sub>2u</sub> symmetry &#x03B4; <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, 6 Organometallics</a> interactions, which play a crucial role in stabilising the sandwich structure, are not possible using d orbitals on the metal, and so this type of bond is only available to compounds of the f elements.</p>
<p class="indent">Several factors combine to make &#x03B4; bonding more important in uranocene than it is in the bis(arene) lanthanide complexes described above. First, because the carbocyclic ring is larger, the metal must sit closer to the middle of the ring in order to maintain the same U-C bond distance. This improves the spatial overlap between metal and ligand orbitals of &#x03B4; symmetry. Second, there is a much better energy match between ligand &#x03B4; orbitals and metal d and f orbitals. It is for these reasons that the metal f orbitals can make a significant contribution to the U-(COT) covalent bond.</p>
<p class="indent">A molecular orbital scheme for uranocene is shown in <a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>. The e<sub>2g</sub> interaction is considerably larger than the e<sub>2u</sub>, reflecting the fact that ligand/metal d overlap is more efficient than ligand/metal f. Two of the uranium f orbitals have e<sub>3u</sub> (or &#x03D5;) symmetry with respect to the metal-ligand axis, and although orbitals of matching symmetry are available on the ligands, the overlap is very small. These degenerate f orbitals thus remain essentially non-bonding, and in 22 electron uranocene, each contains a single electron. Uranocene is therefore best regarded as containing a [Rn]5f<sup>2</sup> (U<sup>4+</sup>) metal centre.</p>
