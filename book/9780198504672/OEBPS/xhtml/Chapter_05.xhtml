<h1 class="main">5<span class="space">&#160;</span> Coordination chemistry</h1>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The coordination chemistry of the lanthanides and actinides has as much in common with that of groups one and two as it does with that of the d block. At the same time, the unique characteristics of f block complexes have required the development of new techniques for investigation of their chemistry, and have subsequently led to a growing number of technological and scientific applications in, for example, medicine and catalysis. Of growing concern to the public at large is what happens to the products of the nuclear power and fuel reprocessing industries after their release into the environment. Coordination chemistry is at the heart of unravelling this issue.</p>

<p class="figc"><b>Fig. 5.1</b> Molecular structure of [Nd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The f element ions are large, hard acids and form high coordination number complexes with hard bases.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.1">
<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Keys to understanding</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following summarises the properties of the lanthanides and actinides which are of direct relevance to understanding their coordination chemistry.</p>
<p class="alist">(a)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;As hard Lewis acids, the lanthanide and actinide ions prefer to coordinate hard bases such as F<sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>0 (<a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>). The &#x2018;classical&#x2019; coordination chemistry in an aqueous environment is thus very different from that in say anhydrous hydrocarbons, and this has led to the development of what is sometimes termed the <i>neo-classical</i> coordination chemistry of these elements and the advent of a unique organometallic chemistry (Chapter Six).</p>
<p class="alist">(b)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;To an incoming ligand, lanthanide ions have the appearance of a noble gas atom, except with a positive charge (most commonly &#x002B;3). This is because the 4f orbitals which contain the valence electrons do not extend out far enough to interact to any great degree with ligand <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, 5 Coordination chemistry</a> orbitals. The complexes thus formed are held together largely by electrostatic interactions (ionic bonding). The 5f orbitals of the actinides are rather more accessible, however, leading to some overlap and covalent character, but this property decreases with increasing atomic number, and the later actinide ions behave like the lanthanides.</p>
<p class="alist">(c)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The f elements are large, which means that any charge on the ion is distributed over a large area. However, since the most common oxidation states of these elements are &#x002B;3 and above, they still have a high charge density. As we cross the 4f and 5f series, ionic radii decrease uniformly (lanthanide and actinide contractions, see Chapter Two, Section Three) leading to higher charge densities and stronger ionic bonds.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Complexes with water</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most of the early coordination chemistry of the lanthanides and actinides was performed in water or in protic solvents. The highly charged ions formed by the f elements are well suited to this highly polar environment.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Comparative features of lanthanides and actinides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Few monodentate ligands can compete with water for coordination sites of lanthanide ions in aqueous solution. By contrast, the actinides are far better at forming complexes with other bases under these conditions. For example, while dissolution of LnCl<sub>3</sub> in water leads to the formation of [Ln(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> (x &#x003D; 8, 9) ions, ThCl<sub>4</sub> dissolves to give hydrated [ThCl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. It is also generally the case that isolation of lanthanide complexes from aqueous solution is much more difficult than it is for the actinides. In all cases, the use of chelate or macrocyclic ligands leads to more predictable outcomes, and it is here where much modern research is focused.</p>
<p class="indent">The greatest difference between the aqueous chemistry of the lanthanides and that of the early actinides arises from the tendency of some of the latter (U-Am) to form pentavalent and hexavalent actinylions <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

 (discussed in <a href="#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>). The aqueous chemistry of thorium and protactinium resembles more closely that of the group four and five transition metals respectively, while the later actinides (Cm-Lr) behave rather like the lanthanides.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">Oxidation states</h3>
<p class="noindent">As we have seen in Chapter Two, Section Two, the early actinides have many more stable oxidation states than do the lanthanides.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Lanthanides</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The divalent lanthanides tend to reduce water to hydrogen (<a href="#eqn5.1">Eqn 5.1</a>), although <b><small>Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup></small> </b>is more stable in aqueous solution than are Sm<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Yb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Also, since all these ions are oxidised by molecular oxygen, the solutions must be handled under an inert atmosphere. The tetravalent ions of neodymium, dysprosium, praseodymium, terbium, and cerium <i>oxidise</i> water to oxygen (<a href="#eqn5.2">Eqn 5.2</a>), and of these only Ce<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> is sufficiently kinetically stable to form <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, 5 Coordination chemistry</a> aqueous coordination compounds. Hence, the trivalent ions Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> are by far the most readily studied.</p>
<p class="rig" id="eqn5.1">2Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; 2H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x003D; 2Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; H<sub>2</sub>(g)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;(5.1)</p>
<p class="rig" id="eqn5.2">4Ln<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; 2H<sub>2</sub>O(I) &#x003D; 4Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; 4H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; O<sub>2</sub>(g)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;(5.2)</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Actinides</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The oxidation states adopted by the actinides and the-relative stabilities of the di-, tri-, and tetravalent states are represented in <a href="Chapter_02.xhtml#fig2.3">Figs. 2.3</a> and <a href="Chapter_02.xhtml#fig2.4">2.4</a>. In this section we will illustrate the general trend of increasing stability of the lower oxidation states across the series. It is worth noting that complexes of the actinide ions in the same oxidation state usually have the same structures, for example, the hexavalent ions all exist as AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in aqueous solution.</p>
<p class="indent">We have noted that the stability of the trivalent state for the actinides increases as we move across the series. Th<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is rapidly oxidised by water, and the aqueous chemistry of this ion is exclusively of the tetravalent state. The U<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion is, however, readily obtained by reduction of higher valent species and is stable for days in the absence of air. Eventually it reduces water to hydrogen, and the reaction in <a href="#eqn5.3">Eqn 5.3</a> is accelerated by the presence of acid. The tetravalent ion U<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> is quite stable in the absence of oxygen.</p>
<p class="rig" id="eqn5.3">U<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; H<sub>2</sub>0(1) &#x2192; U<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>(aq) &#x002B; l/2H<sub>2</sub>(g) &#x002B; OH&#x2010; (aq)&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; (5.3)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Moving further along the 5f series, aqueous solutions of Np<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> are stable in air, and this ion is readily prepared by electrolytic reduction of acidic solutions of Np<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>. By the time we reach americium, the trivalent ion is the preferred state. All the actinide elements after protactinium can exist as An<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in aqueous solution.</p>
<p class="indent">A corresponding trend is observed for the penta- and hexavalent actinyl ions. Their stability falls across the series from uranium, for which UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x002B;</sup> predominates in the presence of air, to curium for which the actinyls are unknown. The physical properties of these ions are dealt with separately in <a href="#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The redox chemistry of plutonium in aqueous solution is fascinating in its complexity. The element is capable of attaining five oxidation states in water, from Pu(III) to Pu(VII), although the latter only exists in strong alkali.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/pg48.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The redox potentials (see above) separating the most common states are roughly equal. Interconversion between oxidation states occurs through disproportionation and conproportionation reactions, and the matter is further complicated by the reducing effect of the a decay of the plutonium atoms. Given these factors, it is not surprising that all four oxidation states Pu(III) to Pu(VI) commonly occur together in aqueous solution, and it is difficult to prepare pure solutions of any one ion. The redox couples Pu(IV/III) and Pu(VI/V) are reversible, and rapid reactions occur with one-electron oxidising <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, 5 Coordination chemistry</a> and reducing agents. Those couples which would require the making or breaking of bonds, <i>e.g.</i> the oxidation of Pu<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> to Pu0<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, are irreversible.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2.3">
<h3 class="h3">Coordination numbers and geometries</h3>
<p class="noindent">As a consequence of the large size of the lanthanide ions, high coordination numbers (up to 12) are found. In aqueous solution, the Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions are thought to be surrounded by eight or nine oxygen-bound water molecules for the later and earlier metals respectively, but owing to the extremely rapid exchange of bound and unbound water these coordination numbers are not known with certainty. By contrast, the much smaller group three element scandium exists as <small>[Sc(H</small><sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in water. The situation is more complicated for the actinides because of their redox chemistry, but, for example, aqueous U<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is probably nine-coordinate.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The lack of covalent (directional) bonding means that geometries of lanthanide complexes are known with even less precision than are the coordination numbers in solution. However, many hydrated lanthanide ions have been examined by X-ray crystallography in the solid state. They generally have tricapped trigonal prismatic structures (<a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). In complexes where geometrical or optical isomers might be expected, these are extremely difficult to detect or isolate because of rapid equilibration.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Hydrolysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">When a metal cation dissolves in water, it will undergo <i>hydrolysis</i> to some extent (<a href="#eqn5.4">Eqn 5.4</a>). Highly charged cations such as those formed by the f elements will polarise the O-H bonds in water strongly, and the aquo cations [M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>]<sup>n&#x002B;</sup> tend to act as Br0nsted acids.</p>
<p class="rig" id="eqn5.4">[M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>]<sup>n&#x002B;</sup> &#x003D; [M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x.1</sub>(OH)]<sup>(n-l)&#x002B;</sup> &#x002B; H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>	&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;(5.4)</p>
<p class="indentt">The acidity of aqueous solutions of the group three element trications decreases rapidly as we move down the group, and that of the trivalent lanthanides increases smoothly across the series as might be expected from the reduction in ionic radius (lanthanide contraction - <a href="Chapter_02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>) and concomitant increase in <i>charge density</i> of the ions. In the actinide series, the acidity of the aqueous cationic species decreases in the order</p>
<p class="fig">(most acidic) An<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> &#x003E; AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x002B;</sup> &#x003E; An<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> &#x003E; AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> (least acidic)</p>
<p class="noindent">The &#x002B;4 cations are the most acidic since they have the highest charge density. For the actinyl ions AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>n&#x002B;</sup> (<a href="#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>) the question arises as to whether the extent of hydrolysis depends on the net charge on the ion (<i>i.e</i>. &#x002B;1 or &#x002B;2) or on the formal charge on the metal at the centre (<i>i.e.</i> &#x002B;5 or &#x002B;6). In the case of AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x002B;</sup> the O<sup>2</sup> ions do not fully &#x2018;quench&#x2019; the charge on the metal, and the <i>effective charge</i> as experienced by an approaching water molecule has been calculated to be <i>ca.</i> &#x002B;3.3. This explains the position of the AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions between An<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> and An<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in the above order of decreasing acidity (decreasing hydrolysis).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Rates and mechanisms of exchange of ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">The characteristic <i>lifetimes</i> for exchange of water ligands (<a href="#eqn5.5">Eqn 5.5</a>) in aquo complexes of the trivalent transition metals range from <i>ca.</i> 10<sup>5</sup> s for ions with large ligand field stabilisation energies such as Cr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, to 10&#x2019;<sup>3</sup> s for those which do not, such as Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. For the f elements, these lifetimes are of the order 10<sup>&#x2010;9</sup> s which means essentially that rate of exchange of water ligands is controlled by the rate of diffusion of the molecules in and out of the inner coordination sphere. All f element complexes with monodentate ligands are regarded as being very labile. This makes the study of substitution reaction mechanisms difficult.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indentt">Let us assume that the <i>intimate mechanism</i> of substitution (<a href="#eqn5.5">Eqn 5.5</a>) is <i>dissociative</i>, <i>i.e.</i> that in the rate determining step a bond to an inner sphere water ligand begins to break before the new bond to an incoming ligand is formed. Since small, more charge-dense ions should form stronger bonds with water we would expect the rates of exchange to fall with size of the ion. This is found to be the case by experiment. For an <i>associative</i> rate determining step, where a bond with an incoming ligand begins to form before other bonds are broken, we expect the same behaviour since the smaller ion is less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by an incoming group on steric grounds.</p>

It is worth noting that the ion midway between the two regions of constancy is Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, and it is widely held that it is at this point along the lanthanide series that the coordination number in aquo complexes changes from nine (early lanthanides) to eight (late lanthanides). This reduction in the number of water molecules in the primary coordination sphere would lead to a sudden increase in the strength of the remaining Ln-OH<sub>2</sub> bonds.

<p class="indent">Actinides in the environment, whether they be naturally-occurring or arising from accidental contamination, are usually found in the form of actinyl ions, except of course in the case of the later actinides where the trivalent ions are more stable. A highly topical area of research is in the coordination chemistry of actinyls with ligands such as carbonate and bicarbonate which are found in relatively high concentrations in natural groundwaters. Such systems can be quite complicated, and several different species may exist in rapid equilibrium with one another. However, using a wide range of techniques, it has been shown that the dominant species in the uranyl(VI) carbonate system at pH &#x003D; 6 is the trimer [(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>6&#x2010;</sup>, <a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The principal features of the ordering of the six bonding molecular orbitals shown in <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a> have been established for the uranyl(VI) ion using a variety of spectroscopic and theoretical techniques. It can be seen that the &#x03C0; bonding molecular orbitals are lower in energy than the &#x03C3; bonding molecular orbitals, implying that a bonding is less important than &#x03C0; bonding. This is quite unusual since we normally expect a overlap to be more efficient than &#x03C3; overlap where p orbitals are involved. One explanation for this may be that at short U-O distances there is antibonding overlap between the &#x03C3;-oriented oxygen 2p<sub>z</sub> orbitals and the toroidal lobes of the uranium d and f orbitals.

Nevertheless, certain complexes called <i>lanthanide shift reagents</i> are used to induce chemical shift changes selectively in other molecules <i>via</i> through-space interactions. These complexes comprise a lanthanide ion surrounded by three (&#x03B2;-diketonate ligands such as in <b>5.1.</b> Ligands are chosen such that the complexes are soluble in non-polar solvents but still have reasonably accessible coordination sites so that the molecule being analysed can form a bond <i>via</i> a heteroatom to the paramagnetic centre.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The ions Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> are often used because their electronic relaxation times are very short. This reduces line-broadening for the nucleus under study, most commonly <sup>1</sup>H.</p>

<p class="indent">The first use of lanthanide shift reagents was in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis of molecules which under normal conditions display overlapping peaks in the alkyl region of the spectrum, and which contain a ligating group (<i>e.g</i>. aliphatic alcohols and amines). Under the influence of the unpaired electrons, the resonances are spread out over a much greater chemical shift range, thus simplifying the spectrum. Also, since the groups closest to the paramagnetic centre are most strongly affected, it is possible to use the <i>lanthanide induced shift</i> to estimate structural data. With the advent of high field NMR spectrometers, these reagents are used less often. However, <i>chiral</i> lanthanide shift reagents such as <b>5.2</b> are widely applied to the NMR analysis of mixtures of enantiomers. Since one enantiomer is bound more strongly than the other, it experiences on average a larger contact shift of its resonances. Hence, signals for the two enantiomers are separated. Integration of the spectrum obtained allows the determination of enantiomeric excess.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging</i></p>
<p class="indent">Whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners detect the <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals of water in the tissues and fluids of the patient. The presence of highly paramagnetic, stable chelate complexes of gadolinium such as [Gd(DTPA)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>&#x2010;</sup> reduces the relaxation times of nearby <sup>1</sup>H nuclei, and thus causes enhancement of the signal.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">By contrast to Eu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Pr<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> mentioned above, Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> has a rather long electronic relaxation time, making it an efficient relaxer of <sup>1</sup>H spins at levels where any lanthanide induced shift is negligible.</p>

<p class="indent">The complexes are distributed in extracellular fluids, but are preferentially absorbed in brain tumours since the blood/brain barrier is ruptured in such cases allowing access of the complex. Hence, the contrast in the magnetic resonance image between tumour and healthy tissue is increased. Doses are approximately 0.1 mmol kg<sup>&#x2010;1</sup> (<i>ca</i>. 7 g for an adult human), and since gadolinium ions and also the free ligands are toxic at this level the complex must be stable enough to be excreted unchanged by the body. Hence the use of the strongly chelating DTPA<sup>5&#x2010;</sup> ligand. Several gadolinium complexes are used in clinical practice today and 40&#x0025; of all MRI scans are taken with the aid of these contrast agents.</p>

<p class="noindent">Coordination chemistry does not have to take place in water, and indeed given the high affinity of the f elements for this ligand it is clear that their chemistry will be dramatically modified by the use of anhydrous media and techniques for the exclusion of air. In recent years, a new coordination chemistry of the lanthanides and actinides has been developed using this approach. This Section describes the key issues and outcomes of these studies. These <i>neo-classical</i> coordination complexes have structures and properties more akin to the relatively inert organometallic compounds described in Chapter Six than they do the labile hydrated complexes described in <a href="#sec_5.2">Section 5.2</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Synthesis and reactivity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Alkoxide and dialkylamide complexes of the f elements have been synthesised by many routes, but the following two are the most general.</p>
<p class="h4"><i>Salt elimination (metathesis)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The deprotonated (or base) form of the desired ligand is allowed to react with a metal salt incorporating anions which are good leaving groups (Eqns 5.13&#x2013;14. The anhydrous lanthanide and actinide chlorides LnCl<sub>3</sub> and AnCl<sub>4</sub> (An &#x003D; U, Th) are by far the most popular starting materials here because they aie commercially available or are readily synthesised (Chapter Four, Section One). Where lower valent complexes are desired, the iodides or bromides must usually be used. For example the divalent lanthanide sources Lnl<sub>2</sub> (Ln &#x003D; Sm, Eu, Yb) are readily available and the uranium triiodide [UI<sub>3</sub>(THF)<sub>4</sub>] provides a useful synthon for the trivalent coordination chemistry of this element in anhydrous solvents.</p>

<p class="noindent">Control of stoichiometry is important here, particularly with less bulky ligands. If an excess of ligand salt is used, the strongly Lewis acidic f element centre can accommodate anionic groups in excess of the number required by its formal oxidation state to give what are known as <i>ate</i> complexes. Although this phenomenon usually occurs unintentionally and causes problems in isolation of the products, <i>ate</i> complexes are sometimes synthetically useful as shown in <a href="#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>. The salt <b>5.10</b> is probably zwitterionic, with lithium ions incorporated into the structure by coordination to methoxide lone pairs.</p>

<p class="h4"><i>Protonolysis</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The protonated or acid form of the desired ligand is allowed to react with a pre-formed complex such as an alkyl, dialkylamide, or alkoxide. This strategy, which circumvents the problems mentioned earlier of <i>ate</i> complex formation, works for the f elements because the bonds are so polar, and thus is not so useful in the more covalent transition metal systems. The driving force of the reaction (<a href="#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>) can be provided by (i) the relative strengths of the metal-element bonds or the pK<sub>a</sub> of the ligands (ii) the production of a volatile &#x2018;acid&#x2019; or (iii) the chelate effect (Section 5.4).</p>

<p class="noindent">Ceric ammonium nitrate [Ce(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>] (known as CAN) and the analogous sulphate CAS have been used extensively for many years in a variety of selective and efficient oxidative transformations.
