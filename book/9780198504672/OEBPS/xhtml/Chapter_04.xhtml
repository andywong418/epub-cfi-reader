<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">In this Chapter we will focus on two classes of binary compounds - halides and oxides - which between them illustrate many of the important trends in f element solid state chemistry, and which may be used to compare the lanthanides with the actinides. The Chapter concludes with an introduction to the factors which determine the electrical properties of solids, and applies the ideas developed to elemental lanthanides and divalent lanthanide compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Trihalides of the lanthanides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Anhydrous trihalides are known for all of the lanthanides. They are ionic, crystalline substances with high melting points whose principal use is as starting materials for the synthesis of pure lanthanide metals and other lanthanide compounds. Apart from the trifluorides, they are all highly deliquescent.</p>
<p class="indent">Addition of HF to aqueous Ln(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> results in the precipitation of LnF<sub>3</sub>.l/2H<sub>2</sub>O. Heating of these hydrates leads to anhydrous lanthanide trifluorides, which may also be prepared by the reaction of HF with Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:</p>

<p class="indent">LnF<sub>3</sub> (Ln = La-Pm) adopt the &#x2018;tysonite&#x2019; (LaF<sub>3</sub>) structure (<a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>) in which the Ln<sup>3+</sup> is coordinated by nine F<sup>-</sup> in a tricapped trigonal prismatic arrangement, with a further two F at a slightly greater distance. Beyond promethium, all of the LnF<sub>3</sub> have the YF<sub>3</sub> structure which features eight close Ln<sup>3+</sup>-F<sup>-</sup> contacts at <i>ca</i>. 2.3 &#x00C5; and one longer Ln<sup>3+</sup>-F<sup>-</sup> distance (<i>ca</i>. 2.6 &#x00C5;), with the F in an approximately trigonal prismatic arrangement around the Ln<sup>3+</sup>. This reduction in the primary coordination number from nine to eight is a result of the decreasing size of the Ln<sup>3+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">LnF<sub>3</sub> have several technological uses, including thin film coatings of optical elements, high pressure anti-wear lubricants, and host lattices for phosphors and scintillators.</p>

<p class="indent">Heating of the hydrated lanthanide trichlorides, tribromides, or triiodides generally results in the formation of oxyhalides, and hence other routes to LnX<sub>3</sub> (X &#x003D; Cl, Br, I) must be followed. A completely general method is the direct combination of the elements, but there are also many other approaches. For the trichlorides these include:</p>
<figure class="fig">

</figure>
<p class="indent">LnCl<sub>3</sub> (Ln &#x003D; La&#x2013;Gd) adopt the nine coordinate UCl<sub>3</sub> structure, a tricapped trigonal prismatic arrangement which is like the structure of LaF<sub>3</sub> but with the two more distant F' removed. This structure is also adopted by [Ln(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>9</sub>]<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> of the early lanthanides. TbCl<sub>3</sub> has the eight coordinate PuBr<sub>3</sub> structure (which may be regarded as the UCl<sub>3</sub> structure with one of the capping Cl<sup>-</sup> removed) and all of the other lanthanide trichlorides the six coordinate AlCl<sub>3</sub> structure. Thus the trend toward lower coordination number with decreasing Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> radius, noted above for LnF<sub>3</sub>, is also apparent in the trichlorides. The size of the anion is also important in determining the coordination number of a given Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, with a trend toward decreasing coordination number with increasing anion radius.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Dihalides of the lanthanides</h3>
<p class="noindent">By contrast to the trivalent compounds, only a few lanthanides form dihalides with all of the halogens. The known LnX<sub>2</sub> are shown in <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>. There is a variety of preparative routes to LnX<sub>2</sub>, including reduction of the appropriate trihalide with elemental lanthanide, H<sub>2</sub>, or an alkali metal and, in some cases, thermal decomposition of the trihalide (<i>e.g.</i> NdCl<sub>2</sub>, SmI<sub>2</sub>, EuI<sub>2</sub>, and YbI<sub>2</sub>). As shown in <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>, LnX<sub>2</sub> adopt a wide range of structural types, and exhibit the same trend toward lower coordination number with decreasing cation radius and increasing anion radius noted for LnX<sub>3</sub>. The diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and gadolinium are distinct from the other LnX<sub>2</sub> in that they exhibit metallic lustre and conductivity. The origin of these properties is discussed in more detail in <a href="#sec_4.3">Section 4.3</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Other lanthanide halides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Tetravalent lanthanide halides are confined to the fluorides of Ce(IV), Pr(IV), and Tb(IV), of which only CeF<sub>4</sub> is thermally stable. It may be made by direct combination of the elements, by fluorination of CeF<sub>3</sub> or CeCl<sub>3</sub>, or by the addition of F<sup>&#x2010;</sup> to aqueous solutions of Ce(IV) which results in the precipitation of CeF<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O. TbF<sub>4</sub> is made by the reaction of F<sub>2</sub> with TbF<sub>3</sub>. The procedure for making PrF<sub>4</sub> is more complicated, requiring initial fluorination of a mixture of NaF and PrF<sub>3</sub> with F<sub>2</sub> to form Na<sub>2</sub>PrF<sub>6</sub>, followed by treatment with HF.</p>
<p class="indent">Many lanthanide halides have been made in which the metal is in a formal oxidation state less than two. These include Ln<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub> (Ln &#x003D; Y, Gd, Tb, Er, Lu), <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, 4 Solid state compounds</a> which consist of <i>trans</i> edge sharing Ln<sub>6</sub> octahedra arranged in single chains with the Cl<sup>&#x2010;</sup> ions capping the faces of the octahedra. Further reduction can lead to compounds of the general formula LnXH<sub>n</sub> (X &#x003D; Cl, Br; Ln &#x003D; Sc, Y, Gd, Lu), which again feature edge sharing Ln<sub>6</sub> octahedra (now arranged in double metal layers) but which also have interstitial hydrogen atoms.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.1.4">
<h3 class="h3">Halides of the actinides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The actinide elements form a wide range of- binary compounds with the halogens, and several trends may be identified. The actinide &#x2018;group valence&#x2019; (corresponding to the removal of all of the electrons outside the [Rn] core) is achieved only in ThX<sub>4</sub>, PaX<sub>5</sub> (X &#x003D; F, Cl, Br, I), and UX<sub>6</sub> (X &#x003D; F, Cl), but not by elements heavier than uranium. Indeed, the halides of the later actinides resemble those of the lanthanides more than those of the early actinides, with the &#x002B;3 oxidation state being by far the most common. Thus, beyond plutonium the highest metal oxidation state observed in an actinide halide is &#x002B;4 (in AnF<sub>4</sub>, An &#x003D; Am-Cf), while all four trihalides are known for all of the elements uraniun&#x2013;einsteinium. The early actinides display a greater range of oxidation states in their halides than the later actinides, reflecting the general trend in actinide oxidation states discussed in Chapter Two, Section Two.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous preparative routes to actinide halides, and the method chosen depends upon the desired product (particularly the oxidation state of the metal). Broadly speaking, direct combination of the elements leads to halides with the actinide in high oxidation states, while thermal decomposition or reaction with HX produces lower oxidation states. Other routes include reduction with H<sub>2</sub>, reaction with halogenating species such as ClF<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>, or BCl<sub>3</sub>, and halogen exchange reactions. Some of these methods are illustrated below for uranium:</p>
<figure class="fig" style="text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/pg36.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The coordination number of the actinide increases with decreasing oxidation state (and hence increasing radius) and decreasing halogen radius. For example, the early AnF<sub>3</sub> (An &#x003D; U-Cm) have the 9&#x002B;2 coordinate LaF<sub>3</sub> structure <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, 4 Solid state compounds</a> (<a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>), but BkF<sub>3</sub> and CfF<sub>3</sub> have the eight coordinate YF<sub>3</sub> structure. Note that this change in structural type is also seen for LnF<sub>3</sub> but occurs three elements further along the actinide series on account of the greater size of the actinide ions. A similar reduction in coordination number occurs in AnBr<sub>3</sub>, with AcBr<sub>3</sub> to NpBr<sub>3</sub> adopting the nine coordinate UCl<sub>3</sub> structure and PuBr<sub>3</sub> to BkBr<sub>3</sub> (plus another NpBr<sub>3</sub> phase) having the eight coordinate PuBr<sub>3</sub> structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Actinide hexahalides are confined to UF<sub>6</sub>, UCl<sub>6</sub>, NpF<sub>6</sub>, and PuF<sub>6</sub>. All four are strongly oxidising and highly moisture sensitive. The pentahalides are more numerous; all four PaX<sub>5</sub> are known as well as UX<sub>5</sub> (X &#x003D; F, Cl, Br) and NpF<sub>5</sub>. All AnX<sub>5</sub> are very moisture sensitive. All four tetrahalides are known for thorium-neptunium, although only the flouride is known for plutonium- californium. Eight coordination is common, often in dodecahedral geometry (<i>e.g.</i> ThCl<sub>4</sub> ThBr<sub>4</sub>, and UCl<sub>4</sub>). The UX<sub>4</sub> family provides another illustration of decreasing coordination number with increasing anion radius; UF<sub>4</sub> and UCl<sub>4</sub> feature eight coordinate uranium, UBr<sub>4</sub> seven coordination (pentagonal bipyramid) and UI<sub>4</sub> six coordination <i>via</i> edge sharing UI<sub>6</sub> octahedra. AnX<sub>4</sub> (X &#x003D; Cl, Br, I) are hygroscopic, and are readily soluble in polar solvents such as (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO and CH<sub>3</sub>CN.</p>
<p class="indent">AnF<sub>3</sub> (An &#x003D; U-Es) are high melting and insoluble in water, by contrast to the other trihalides of these elements which are hygroscopic and water soluble. Many may be crystallised out of water solutions as the eight coordinate hexahydrates [AnX<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The only trihalides of thorium and protactinium are the triiodides; ThI<sub>3</sub> is poorly characterised, but PaI<sub>3</sub> is well established. It may be made by heating PaI<sub>5</sub> at 360 <sup>0</sup>C <i>in vacuo</i>, and has the eight coordinate PuBr<sub>3</sub> structure.</p>
<p class="indent">AnX<sub>2</sub> (An &#x003D; Am, Cf, Es; X &#x003D; Cl, Br, I) and ThI<sub>2</sub> are known. The latter has metallic properties and has two forms, &#x03B1; (black) and &#x00DF; (gold). By analogy with the [Xe]4f<sup>7</sup> configuration of Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, it might be anticipated that americium would have a divalent chemistry, and the existence of black AmX<sub>2</sub> supports this expectation.</p>

With the exception of cerium, praseodymium, and terbium, Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the end product of the combustion of metallic lanthanide or of the hydroxides, carbonates, nitrates <i>etc.</i> Cerium, praseodymium, and terbium form the tetravalent LnO<sub>2</sub> under these conditions, but the dioxides may be reduced to Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>. Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may be divided into three groups on the basis of structural type.</p>

<p class="noindent">Prior to the mid 1980s the highest recorded value of T, (the temperature at which a material becomes superconducting) was ca. 23 K for Nb3Ge. Then in late 1986 Bednorz and Miiller reported their discovery of a new ceramic compound, La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> which has a <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of 30 K, and in March of the following year Wu and Chu reported a <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, of 92 K for YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>,O<sub>7</sub>., (0 &#x2264; &#x03B4; &#x2264; 1).

The exact mechanism of superconductivity remains uncertain, although it is widely believed that in a superconducting material pairs of electrons (known as Cooper pairs) move through the solid, the first electron distorting the lattice in such a way that the second can follow it very easily.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately the commercial exploitation of superconductivity in, for example, magnetic devices, power transmission, and communications, is hampered by the ceramic nature of the high <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> compounds. The innate brittleness of ceramics prevents their extrusion into wires, and it now seems that the most promising way forward is the deposition of thin films of superconductor onto metal oxide or silver surfaces to form flexible tapes.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxides of the actinides</h3>
<p class="noindent">All of the actinides up to and including einsteinium form more than one oxide, with the exception of thorium which forms only ThO<sub>2</sub>. Polymorphism, non-stoichiometry, and intermediate phases are very common, and hence the stoichiometries of the actinide oxides are best regarded as limiting cases. <a href="#fig4.3"> Figure 4.3</a> shows the most stable oxide of each actinide. The greater range of oxidation states exhibited by the early actinides is reflected in their most stable oxides, and the increasingly lanthanide-like nature of the later actinides is demonstrated by the increasing stability of the sesquioxide as the series is crossed.</p>

The next well characterised phase is U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, which is the end product ofheating any uranium oxide in air at temperatures above 650 <sup>0</sup>C, and which contains pentagonal bipyramidal &#x007B;UO<sub>7</sub>&#x007D; units.

One form (&#x03B3;-UO<sub>3</sub>) has a structure based on edge and comer sharing UO<sub>6</sub> octahedra.

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The electronic structure of lanthanide metals and divalent lanthanide compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">As has already been noted, many divalent lanthanide compounds exhibit very high electrical conductivities while others are insulators or semiconductors. This Section provides an explanation for this behaviour in terms of the band theory of electrical conductivity and the Hubbard approach to electron-electron repulsion in solids. These models are briefly described, and subsequently applied to the elemental lanthanides and divalent lanthanide compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Band theory is one of the most successful approaches to the electronic properties of solids. It assumes that the energetic separation between the electronic levels that arise from overlap of orbitals on adjacent atoms is so small that the levels merge into a continuous energy band. If a band is only partially filled, then electrons with energies close to that of the least stable <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, 4 Solid state compounds</a> electron (known as the <i>Fermi level)</i> can be easily promoted into low-lying empty energy levels. As a result they are relatively free to move through the solid, giving rise to high electrical conductivity. By contrast, electrons in a solid in which all the bands are full cannot undergo this process, and the solid will be an electrical insulator.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_4.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">The Hubbard model</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many compounds of the lanthanides that might be expected to be metallic (on the grounds that they appear to have partially filled d or f bands) are in fact insulating. This is due to the effects of electron-electron repulsion, which localises electrons on individual atoms and prevents the high electrical conductivity described above. This situation arises when the overlap of orbitals on neighbouring atoms is small, and hence the width of the resulting energy band is also small. Full treatment of electron-electron repulsion in solids is extremely complicated, but we can make progress <i>via</i> the Hubbard approach, which makes the assumption that the only important electron-electron repulsion occurs between electrons on the same atom. Although this would appear to be a fairly drastic approximation, intra-atomic electron-electron repulsion does seem to be the principal cause of failures of band theory, and the Hubbard model is a surprisingly useful approach to electron localisation.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider a model solid consisting of a line of atoms each with a single valence s orbital and one s electron per atom. The s band will be half full and the solid will be metallic. If, however, the overlap of the s orbitals on adjacent atoms is very small, it will be energetically preferable for the solid to localise its valence electrons as shown in <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>, in order to avoid the electron-electron repulsion that arises when two electrons are forced to pair on the same atom, as must occur were an electron to move through the solid <i>via</i> the s band. The solid will therefore be insulating.</p>

</figure>
<p class="figc"><b>Fig. 4.4</b> In a line of half-filled, weakly interacting s atomic orbitals, electron-electron repulsion localises the electrons one per atom (above), in order to avoid having to pair two electrons in the same atom (below).</p>
<figure class="fig" style="text-align:left;" >
<img src="../images/fig4.4a.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indentt">We may quantify these ideas as follows. The energy required to remove an electron from an atom is the ionization energy, <i>I.</i> If we now place the electron in an atom which already has a half-filled s orbital we get back the electron affinity of that atom, <i>A<sub>e</sub>.</i> The energy required to move the electron is therefore given by <a href="#eqn4.3">Eqn 4.3</a>, where <i>U</i> is called the <i>Mott-Hubbard splitting</i>, or <i>Hubbard U</i>, and may be interpreted as the repulsion energy between two electrons in the same atom.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">In order for metallic conductivity to occur, the overlap of the s orbitals must be sufficiently large that the band width, <i>W</i>, is greater than the value of <i>U.</i> if <i>U &#x003E; W,</i> electron-electron repulsion prevails and the solid is insulating.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Elemental lanthanides</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have previously seen that the 4f orbitals of lanthanide atoms and ions are radially contracted and interact to a small extent with the surrounding ligands in lanthanide compounds. A further consequence of this contraction is that the overlap of the 4f atomic orbitals on neighbouring atoms in the elemental lanthanides is very small, and hence 4f band widths are also small (typically &#x003C; 0. 1 eV). The metallic nature of the elemental lanthanides comes from the 5d and 6s atomic orbitals, which are much more diffuse and overlap to a much greater extent. That the 4f orbitals cannot be responsible for the metallic properties of the lanthanide elements is confirmed by <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, which plots the value of the Hubbard <i>U</i> for the lanthanide 4f orbitals. These data have been experimentally determined using solid state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and clearly show that <i>U</i> is very much greater than 0.1 eV for the 4f orbitals of all of the lanthanides.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig4.5">
<img src="../images/fig4.5.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="figc"><b>Fig. 4.5</b> Hubbard Uvalues for the 4f atomic orbitals of the lanthanides.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>U</i> values for europium and gadolinium are particularly striking, as they are so much greater than any of the others. It is useful to consider the elemental lanthanides as being composed of Ln<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ions, with the [Xe]4f<sup>n</sup> configuration, embedded in a delocalised valence electron &#x2018;sea&#x2019; made up of electrons in the 5d and 6s bands. Each lanthanide atom contributes three electrons to the band structure. In gadolinium, this results in the [Xe]4f<sup>7</sup> configuration which has the particular stability associated with the half-filled f</p>
<a id="page_44" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 44, 4 Solid state compounds</a>
<p class="noindent">subshell. This is lost when an electron is added to make the [Xe]4f<sup>8</sup> configuration, and hence <i>U</i> is very high. The [Xe]4f<sup>7</sup> configuration is so favourable that it is also adopted in metallic europium, which is best regarded as containing Eu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (as mentioned in Chapter Two, Section Three). Although this gives a high value of <i>U</i> for the europium 4f orbitals, it also means that only two electrons per atom enter the band structure and are available for metallic bonding. This manifests itself in a lower sublimation energy and a larger atomic volume for europium than the other lanthanide elements except for ytterbium, for which the stability of the [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> configuration also results in only two metallic bonding electrons per atom.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also worth noting that the lanthanide 4f <i>U</i> values predicted from gas-phase ion data are in the region of 25 eV. This is clearly significantly greater than the values in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, and is an example of a general effect in which the <i>U</i> values measured for solids are much less than expected on the basis of atomic/ionic energies. This is due primarily to polarisation effects, in which the electrons surrounding a hole created by the removal of an electron relax in toward the hole and away from the removed electron, thereby lowering the energy required to move an electron from one atom to another.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Divalent lanthanide compounds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although the &#x002B;3 oxidation state is the most common for the lanthanides, several series of divalent lanthanide compounds exist. These include LnI<sub>2</sub>, LnE (E &#x003D; S, Se, Te), and LnB<sub>6</sub>, the latter containing octahedral B<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions linked in a continuous three-dimensional framework.</p>
<p class="indent">The electronic configuration of most gas-phase Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is [Xe]4f<sup>n&#x002B;1</sup>, and hence it might be expected that the divalent solids would be electrically insulating on the grounds that the only electrons outside the [Xe] core are in the 4f subshell and are thus highly unlikely to produce bands of a width great enough to overcome the electron-electron repulsion. However, many of the divalent lanthanide compounds listed above are metallic, and it appears that the [Xe]4f5d<sup>1</sup> configuration is more stable than the [Xe]4f<sup>n&#x002B;1</sup> in some lanthanide compounds, giving rise to a single electron per lanthanide atom in a broad 5d band. The partially filled 5d band is believed to be responsible for the high conductivities of LaI<sub>2</sub>, CeI<sub>2</sub>, PrI<sub>2</sub>, GdI<sub>2</sub>, NdO, and SmO noted in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, as well as that of most LnB<sub>6</sub>. However, for certain Ln<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> the [Xe]4f<sup>n&#x002B;1</sup> configuration remains more stable than the [Xe]4f<sup>n</sup>5d<sup>1</sup> even in compounds. Thus the monotellurides of europium, samarium, thulium, and ytterbium are non-metallic, as are EuS, SmS, and YbS, the diiodides of neodymium, samarium, europium, dysprosium, and ytterbium, and LnB<sub>6</sub> (Ln &#x003D; Eu, Yb).</p>
