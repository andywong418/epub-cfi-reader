<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The nature of photochemistry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Life on Earth depends, both directly and indirectly, on the influence that light has on chemistry. The energy of the Sun&#x2019;s visible and ultraviolet radiation promotes processes that not only permit the continued existence of life on the planet, but which quite probably led to the development and evolution of life itself. Photosynthesis in plants provides the most obvious example of chemistry driven by light that, at the present stage of evolution, forms a vital link between the utilization of solar energy and the survival of life. The production of carbohydrates that can be used as energy sources by other life forms is one part of the story; the production of oxygen, a major component of our atmosphere, is another.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.1"/><b>1.1</b> The word &#x2018;light&#x2019; has a rather broad interpretation in connection with photochemistry. In principle, it refers to radiation of any part of the spectrum that can promote chemical change. As we shall see shortly, such radiation is generally visible light (roughly 700&#x2013;400 nm) and radiation of shorter wavelengths in the ultraviolet region. The long-wavelength limit is probably about 2000 nm in the near infrared, while at the short-wavelength side the limit is only a formal one at the start of the X-ray region. In the earlier history of the subject, the short-wavelength limit was set by the transmission characteristics of conventional transparent container materials (glass and quartz) and by absorption by the constituents of the atmosphere itself, although these limitations can be overcome to some extent.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Interactions of light with matter make up the fascinating subject of <i>photochemistry</i> that is the subject of this book. The photosynthetic process itself and the photochemistry of the atmosphere will both be discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. For the time being, they serve as examples of the importance of light in chemistry. Photosynthesis <i>uses</i> light to bring about chemical change. Both in nature and in the laboratory, energy released in chemical reactions can also <i>produce</i> light; fireflies provide an illustration of the <i>chemiluminescence</i> from an energetic reaction. The chemical changes that follow the absorption of light and the chemistry that produces light are equally examples of photochemical processes. Although we have emphasized here <i>chemical</i> change, a number of physical processes that do not involve any overall alterations in chemical identity are taken to lie within the province of the photochemist. <i>Fluorescence</i> and <i>phosphorescence</i>, in which light is emitted from a chemical species that has absorbed radiation, are both examples of such processes.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is one essential feature of photochemistry, it is probably the way in which <i>excited</i> states of atoms or molecules (i.e. those with excess energy) play a part in the processes occurring. We shall return very soon to this topic; note for now that the excited states of most concern to the photochemist are those in which the electrons have become distributed into a higher energy arrangement; the species are thus said to be <i>electronically excited</i>. Absorption and emission of radiation to and from excited states is studied in <i>spectroscopy</i>, and there is much common ground between spectroscopy and photochemistry, as there also is between photochemistry and quantum theory. The <i>rates</i> of photochemical reactions are often of interest, so that the concepts of <i>reaction kinetics</i> are frequently invoked in quantitative photochemistry. The intertwining of photochemistry with these other branches of chemistry means that the reader needs to have some acquaintance with the underlying ideas. At the same time, the study of photochemistry provides examples of the <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Photochemical principles</a> application of the other disciplines, and acts as a link between them. As far as possible, we shall attempt to introduce at the most basic level concepts that may be unfamiliar.</p>

<p class="indent">Man has been aware from the earliest times of the influence that the Sun&#x2019;s radiation has on matter and the environment. However, it is mainly during the present century that a systematic understanding of photochemical and photophysical processes has developed. A logical pattern to the interactions between light and matter emerged only after the concept of quantization of energy was established. It is the purpose of this book to clarify this pattern, and to explain the foundations on which modern photochemistry is based.</p>

<p class="noindent">Light is a form of energy that exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. It is propagated in a straight line (unless reflected or refracted) and its speed in a vacuum is approximately 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Light is characterized by its colour, an attribute identified by Newton when he found that a beam of white light could be split into its component colours using a prism.</p>

<p class="indent">James Clerk Maxwell showed that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation; its wave-like properties arise from the transverse oscillation of electric and magnetic fields in planes perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation of the light (see <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). It is the wavelength or frequency of these oscillations that defines the characteristic colour, i.e. light of a specific wavelength will be a certain colour (red light having a longer wavelength than blue light) [<a href="#nt1.3">Note 1.3</a>]. The wave theory accounts for many intrinsic properties of light such as propagation, reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference and polarization. There are, however, some phenomena that it is not possible to explain by treating light as a wave; these include the <i>photoelectric effect</i> and the nature of <i>black-body radiation</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Einstein&#x2019;s work on the photoelectric effect demonstrated that radiation also behaves as though it consists of a stream of particles, or <i>photons</i>. Each of these photons has a fixed energy that depends on the frequency (or wavelength) of radiation [<a href="#nt1.4">Note 1.4</a>]. The postulate that light behaves as particles of defined and indivisible energy is closely related to <i>quantum theory</i>, which had been developed by Max Planck in connection with his work on black-body radiation. It is not only physical phenomena for which quantum theory provides an explanation. The chemical changes wrought by electromagnetic radiation in its interaction with matter would be very difficult to interpret without assuming that the radiation can behave as particles whose energy is quantized.</p>

The <i>intensity</i> of light is related to the number of photons per unit time; the energy of the individual photons is fixed. An increase in the intensity of radiation will therefore only increase the number of species excited <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Photochemical principles</a> and not the energy available to each individual species.

<p class="noindent">Energy levels in matter are quantized; i.e. species can exist only in certain defined, discrete (separate) energy states. A transition between two such states of specific energy must also have associated with it a definite energy. Thus, a direct result of the quantization of energy levels is that for each individual species only specific energies, and therefore frequencies, of radiation can be absorbed or emitted. The characteristic line and band spectra of chemical species are a consequence of this behaviour.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.6"/><b>1.6</b> Other Interactions, with electric quadrupoles, magnetic dipoles, and magnetic quadrupoles, are also possible, but they tend to be weaker than the electric dipole transitions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In addition to its translational energy, a species may possess other sorts of internal energy, each of which is quantized: rotational energy, vibrational energy which arises from the periodic oscillation of atoms in a molecule, and electronic energy which depends on the distance of the electron from the nucleus and the type of orbital that it occupies.</p>
<p class="indent">An atom can have only electronic (and no rotational or vibrational) internal energy; any increase or decrease in energy of the atom must therefore result from a change in the electronic state as the electron moves between the various available orbitals. These electronic transitions also occur in molecules, between the molecular bonding, non-bonding and anti-bonding orbitals that are available to the electron. Although the situation is more complicated for molecules, as they can also undergo transitions between the vibrational and rotational energy levels, it is the electronic transitions which are of most interest to photochemists for the reasons that will be discussed in <a href="#sec_1.4">Sections 1.4</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">2.2</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.7"/><b>1.7</b> Usually, the absorption occurs in a single step, so that the difference in energy between the states <i>l</i> and <i>m</i> must correspond exactly to the energy of the photons of the incident radiation.

</aside>
<p class="indent">When a species absorbs a quantum of radiation, it becomes excited. How the species assimilates that energy &#x2014; in rotational, vibrational, or electronic modes &#x2014; depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation. The longer the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, the lower the energy [<a href="#nt1.4">Note 1.4</a>]. As the molecular rotational and vibrational energy levels are closer together in energy than the electronic levels, absorption at the lower energies associated with infra-red radiation usually only leads to transitions between rotational or vibrational states of the species. The energy of radiation in the visible to ultraviolet region, however, is of the right magnitude to induce transitions between the electronic energy levels of a species, leading to electronic excitation. This interaction usually takes place via the electric dipole (permanent or transition) of the species [<a href="#nt1.6">Note 1.6</a>].</p>

<p class="indent">In order to discuss different types of absorption and emission processes, we use a model in which a chemical species possesses two quantized states <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>, of energies <i>&#x03B5;<sub>l</sub></i>, and <i>&#x03B5;<sub>m</sub></i>, where <i>l</i> is at a lower energy than <i>m</i>. To reach state <i>m</i>, a species in state <i>l</i> must gain energy; it does this by absorbing energy from the electromagnetic radiation [<a href="#nt1.7">Note 1.7</a> and <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>].</p>
<a id="page_4" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 4, Photochemical principles</a>
<p class="indent">The converse of absorption, when a chemical species undergoes a transition from the higher energy state <i>m</i> to the lower energy state <i>l</i>, constitutes emission. There are, in fact, two types of emission. <i>Stimulated emission</i> is the exact analogue of absorption; the other process is <i>spontaneous emission</i>. In the case of stimulated emission, the interaction between the excited species and the electromagnetic radiation causes the energy-rich species to give up its energy to the incident radiation [<a href="#nt1.8">Note 1.8</a>]. In the case of spontaneous emission, the energy-rich species loses its energy of its own accord in the absence of a radiation field. As the emission phenomena considered in photochemistry &#x2014; namely fluorescence, phosphorescence and chemiluminescence &#x2014; are normally spontaneous, when emission is referred to in this text from this point onwards we mean spontaneous emission, unless we specifically state otherwise.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">There is a distinct difference between stimulated and spontaneous emission. It is evident that the rate (or intensity) of either absorption or stimulated emission must be proportional to the rate of collision between photons and atoms or molecules of the absorbing or emitting species, and hence must be proportional both to the radiation density and to the concentration of the chemical species. Spontaneous emission, however, is a random process and is therefore kinetically first order (i.e. it depends only on the concentration of the excited species). The rate constant for spontaneous emission for an excited species is the <i>Einstein A Factor</i> [<a href="#nt1.9">Note 1.9</a>], which can thus be used to give a good indication of the lifetime of the species in question; a smaller rate constant will result in a longer lifetime. It can be shown that, other factors being equal, the efficiency (and hence the rate) of the spontaneous process is proportional to <i>v</i><sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The excited state of a species can exhibit a dramatically altered reactivity from the ground state. Not only does the species possess more energy, but it can also participate in different reactions as a result of the new electronic arrangement.</p>
<p class="indent">The excess energy of an excited species can alter its reactivity, and is particularly significant in the case of electronic excitation because of the energies involved. First, the energies are of the same order of magnitude as bond energies, so that electronic excitation can have a considerable effect on the bonds in a species. Secondly, the energies correspond roughly with typical activation energies for reactions, and the excitation energy can help a species to either partially or completely overcome an activation barrier (e.g. in situations where reaction of the ground state is highly improbable because the barrier is too high). It can therefore be seen that an energy-rich electronically excited species is likely to differ in reactivity from the ground state, the excited state normally being the more reactive of the two.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.11"/><b>1.11</b> In a molecule, an electron can be promoted to an antibonding orbital, thus making the species more unstable (and possibly leading to dissociation), or it can be promoted into a more strongly bonding orbital and consequently stabilize the species.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The excess energy possessed by an excited species is not the only factor that affects its reactivity. Even if the energy factor had no influence, the excited state could still exhibit a reactivity significantly different from that of the ground state. On excitation, an electron is frequently promoted to a different type (and therefore shape or symmetry) of orbital (e.g. s or &#x03C3; electrons may be promoted to p or &#x03C0; orbitals). The arrangement of the electrons in a species is fundamental in defining what reactions the species can and cannot undergo, so that such a change in the spatial distribution of electrons can have a major effect on reactivity.</p>

<p class="noindent">The quantitative treatment of electronic excitation and the absorption and emission of radiation by chemical species falls within the realm of wave mechanics. This subject is a highly elegant but complex mathematical theory that replaces the classical ideas of position and trajectory with the concepts of <i>amplitude</i> and <i>wavefunction</i>. The theory gives rise to the quantum numbers that define the electronic state of a species [<a href="#nt1.12">Note 1.12</a>]. It is frequently the spin, orbital momentum and symmetry properties of the two wavefunctions in upper and lower states that determine whether or not an interaction with electromagnetic radiation is possible; we shall therefore concentrate on the quantum numbers that describe these properties.</p>

<p class="indent">Individual electrons possess both spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. These momenta are vector quantities; there are therefore angular momenta associated with a species resulting from the vector addition of the spin and orbital angular momenta, a process known as coupling.</p>
<p class="indent">The spin moment of a single electron, <b>s</b>, is equal to &#x00BD;. The vector summation of spin moments of each individual electron in a species (<i>spin coupling</i>), gives a resultant overall spin <b>S</b> and is extremely important in <a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Photochemical principles</a> defining the electronic state of a species. It is common practice to specify a state by the <i>spin multiplicity</i>, 2<b>S</b> + 1, rather than by the spin itself [<a href="#nt1.13">Note 1.13</a>]. For species in which all the electrons are paired, <b>S</b> = 0, 2<b>S</b> + 1 = 1 and the species is a <i>singlet</i>. Most chemical species that can be stored for long periods are of this type, although there are exceptions. If two electrons are unpaired with parallel spins, <b>S</b> = 1, 2<b>S</b> + 1 = 3 and the species is in a <i>triplet</i> state (the excited states of species with singlet ground states are commonly triplet states). Species such as free radicals have one unpaired electron, so that <b>S</b> = &#x00BD;, 2<b>S</b> + 1 = 2 and the species is in a <i>doublet</i> state. One simple scheme for describing states consists of a numbered list based on the multiplicity where, for instance, the ground-state singlet is denoted S<sub>0</sub> and the excited singlets S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, etc., in order of their energies, and the triplet states are T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, etc. (T<sub>0</sub> being excluded because it is not the ground state). Spin is of particular significance because, according to quantum mechanics, it cannot change in either radiative or radiationless transitions; states of the same chemical species, but possessing different multiplicities, tend to behave as distinct groups unlikely to convert from one to the other. It is important to note, however, that spin is not always a pure quantity, so that transitions between states with different <b>S</b> may sometimes be observed although they tend to be significantly less probable than transitions between states of the same multiplicity (see end of <a href="#sec_1.6">section 1.6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In diatomic and linear molecules, the electronic state may still be defined in part by the orbital electronic angular momentum. The individual and total orbital angular momenta are denoted &#x03BB; and &#x039B; respectively, and are used to derive the spectroscopic <i>term symbol</i> that describes the state of a species. However, additional information is also required to describe the state completely, including the total angular momentum and also information about the effect that symmetry operations have on the sign of the wavefunction. In particular, whether the wavefunction stays the same, or changes sign, on inversion through a centre of symmetry (if it exists) defines a state as &#x2018;even&#x2019; or &#x2018;odd&#x2019;, denoted g or u, respectively; whether the wavefunction stays the same or changes sign on reflection by a plane of symmetry passing through the molecule defines a state as &#x2018;+&#x2019; or &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019;. For small, non-linear molecules it is still possible to describe the electronic state in terms of molecular symmetry, although it may no longer be possible to specify the state in terms of orbital angular momentum. In the case of molecules that are more complex still, symmetry elements may also be non-existent; the state may then be described in terms of the individual molecular orbitals (e.g. (n, &#x03C0;*), (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;*), (n, &#x03C3;*), (&#x03C0;, &#x03C3;*) etc. [<a href="#nt1.15">Note 1.15</a>]) with an indication of the multiplicity included in the term symbol.

Although Russell&#x2013;Saunders coupling is a fairly good description of the situation for light atoms, it tends to fail for heavier ones, and the breakdown of selection rules based on these vector quantities reflects the inadequacy of <b>S</b> and <b>L</b> as quantum numbers.

<h2 class="h2">1.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fates of excited species</h2>
<p class="noindent">The absorption of radiation by an atom or molecule can lead, as we have seen, to the production of an electronically excited species that can exhibit &#x2018;new&#x2019; chemistry that is different from that of the parent, ground-state species. There are several ways in which the excited species can react or otherwise use or lose its excess energy, and some of the most important routes are represented diagrammatically in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>, with typical examples given in <a href="#nt1.18">Note 1.18</a>. Each of the routes merits a section to itself, and is considered in more detail in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">3</a>, although the exchange of energy within a molecule (<i>intramolecular energy transfer</i>) is so fundamental to understanding photochemistry that we bring a preliminary discussion of it forward to this section.</p>
<p class="indent">The strictly <i>chemical</i> routes are (i), (ii), and (iii). The first of these, dissociation, leads to a fragmentation in a molecular species. The energy of the photon has thus been sufficient to rupture a bond. Route (ii) represents the situation in which the excitation is used to promote a reaction (either by overcoming an activation barrier or as a consequence of the new electronic arrangement) that is not possible for the ground electronic state. Although this process is considered as an <i>intermolecular</i> process, in which the excited molecule reacts with a separate molecule, <i>intramolecular</i> processes are also well known in which one part of an excited molecule attacks another part of the same molecule. This kind of intramolecular process leads to <i>structural <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Photochemical principles</a> isomerizations</i> or <i>rearrangements</i>. Another isomerization process that ought to be included here is channel (iii). An example of this kind of step is afforded by <i>E&#x2013;Z</i> (<i>cis&#x2013;trans</i>) isomerization in which a double bond in the ground state becomes essentially a single bond about which rotation can occur in an excited electronic state [see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#nt2.3">Note 2.3</a>]. Pathway (viii) is similar in concept to the dissociation step, except that, instead of two chemically distinct neutral fragments being formed, an ion and an electron are produced. Such ionization processes are of considerable importance in many aspects of photochemistry. In the gas phase they are generally of high energy, and require short-wavelength radiation; many of the ions and electrons present in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere are formed as a result of <i>photoionization</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two processes, shown as pathways (iv) and (v), that generate excited electronic states other than the one first formed in the absorption step. These two routes are a collisional <i>intermolecular</i> one (pathway (iv)), in which a different molecule becomes excited, and an <i>intramolecular</i> one (pathway (v)), in which a new electronic state of the same molecule is populated. Following these <i>energy transfer</i> steps, the new excited species or state can lose its excitation in any of the processes in the diagram in which it is able to participate.</p>
<p class="indent">Emission of radiation, which corresponds to radiative loss of excitation energy, is shown as pathway (vi). The general term for the process is <i>luminescence</i>. Particular aspects of the phenomenon are described as <i>fluorescence</i> or <i>phosphorescence</i>, as discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.2">Sections 3.2</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.3">3.3</a> <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Photochemical principles</a> respectively. If the species AB* has become excited as a result of a chemical reaction, rather than by absorption of radiation, the emission process is called <i>chemiluminescence</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The remaining route in the diagram, pathway (vii), is <i>physical quenching</i> or <i>deactivation</i>. It is a collisional process in which electronic energy is taken up by an atom or molecule M, and in which the excess energy is converted to translational or vibrational excitation of M. Although it appears to be chemically rather a boring process, ultimately making the electronic energy unavailable for performing &#x2018;chemistry&#x2019;, it is a very important one, since most of the other possible routes have to compete with quenching, especially in solution, where collisions are frequent.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>The laws of photochemistry; quantum yields</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first law of photochemistry was formulated by Grotthus and Draper at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and states that <i>only the light absorbed by a molecule can produce photochemical change in the molecule</i>. The evolution of the quantum theory led Stark and Einstein to develop and modify this law. Initially, they suggested that one, and only one, molecule reacted for each photon absorbed. This hypothesis was subsequently refined to take into account the fact that chemical reaction is only one of a number of competing routes available to an excited species, as discussed in the previous section. The second law of photochemistry thus states that <i>if a species absorbs radiation, then one particle is excited for each quantum of radiation absorbed</i> [<a href="#nt1.19">Note 1.19</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.19"/><b>1.19</b> If a single photon is involved in the interaction, it follows that the photon must have enough energy to promote chemical change in one molecule, as discussed at the end of <a href="#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the previous section, we outlined a number of routes by which an excited species could yield new chemical species as products. For each primary product formed, there may be a number of secondary processes available, so that the overall products of a photochemical reaction can be very diverse. One concept of great value in interpreting the behaviour, to provide information about photochemical reaction mechanisms, is the <i>quantum yield</i>, <b>&#x03A6;</b>. <b>&#x03A6;</b> is <i>the number of molecules of reactant consumed per photon of light absorbed</i>. Measured values can range from less than 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> to more than 10<sup>6</sup>, depending on the reaction system; a quantum yield greater than one suggests the occurrence of secondary reactions, and a value greater than two suggests the operation of a chain reaction mechanism [<a href="#nt1.20">Note 1.20</a>]. However, the quantum yield as defined so far reflects, without distinction, both the efficiency of the primary photochemical process and also the extent of secondary reaction. It is far more useful to consider primary and overall quantum yields, &#x03D5; and &#x03A6;, separately.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.20"/><b>1.20</b> Primary and secondary quantum yields are discussed in greater detail in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.3">Section 4.3</a>. A secondary step allows another molecule of reactant to be consumed by the product of the primary process, so that &#x03A6; could reach 2. If this secondary step also yields a species capable of consuming the reactant, then &#x03A6; can exceed 2. This kind of chemistry with sequential secondary steps is a <i>chain reaction</i>.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_11" class="page" style="width: 70%;">Page 11, Photochemical principles</a>
<p class="indent">The primary quantum yield should be stated for a specific primary process (i.e. one of the paths shown in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>). In the light of the Stark&#x2013;Einstein law, it can be seen that the sum of the quantum yields for all primary processes, including deactivation, must be one. If an overall quantum yield is quoted without further specification, it refers to the removal of reactant, although in some cases it is more helpful to quote a quantum yield for the formation of a particular product.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.9">
<h2 class="h2">1.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Intramolecular energy transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have referred several times already to pathway (v) in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>, in which a <i>radiationless transition</i> populates an electronic state different from the one that was first excited by absorption. Because this <i>energy transfer</i> process occurs within the same molecule, it is an <i>intramolecular</i> conversion from one state to another.</p>
<p class="indent">Intramolecular energy transfer is of very great importance for a variety of reasons. It may be the dominant primary process for some chemical species, so that the photochemistry of these compounds is essentially determined by the behaviour of the new electronic state. An indirect route via intramolecular energy transfer may populate an electronic state that is inaccessible by direct optical absorption (perhaps because the transition is forbidden and the absorption weak, or because the energy of the excited state means that it does not absorb the wavelengths of radiation incident on the system). One particularly significant example is the population of triplet states, such as T<sub>1</sub> (see <a href="#page_6">p. 6</a>), following initial absorption from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> Optical absorption from S<sub>0</sub> to T<sub>1</sub> is forbidden by the spin rule, and the absorption is correspondingly weak, so that formation of the T<sub>1</sub> state by direct absorption is very inefficient. As we shall see shortly, the S<sub>1</sub> &#x21DD; T<sub>1</sub> process is also formally forbidden by a spin-conservation rule; however, it is limited only by the occurrence of other processes (such as quenching or optical emission) that depopulate S<sub>1</sub>, since the excited species must eventually lose its excess energy. S<sub>1</sub> &#x21DD; T<sub>1</sub> conversion may be able to compete successfully with these other loss processes, and thus lead to efficient population of T<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.21"/><b>1.21</b> The symbol &#x21DD; is used to denote energy transfer processes, rather than the straight arrow (&#x2192;) that is used to denote absorption or emission.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Although the examples of the last paragraph have concentrated on cases where there is a change of spin multiplicity, as in the S<sub>1</sub> &#x21DD; T<sub>1</sub> process, intramolecular energy transfer can also take place between electronic states possessing the same spin. For example S<sub>1</sub> &#x21DD; S<sub>0</sub> conversion can readily occur with many chemical systems. In fact, the conservation or non-conservation of spin is used as one basis for classification of intramolecular energy transfer, with the conserved process being labelled as <i>internal conversion (IC)</i> and the non-conserved one as <i>intersystem crossing (ISC)</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Two consequences of the ISC and IC processes are presented at this stage to illustrate the part that they can play in photochemistry. <i>Phosphorescence</i> (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>) often arises from the T<sub>1</sub> state of molecules whose ground state is a singlet, S<sub>0</sub>. Emission of radiation from T<sub>1</sub> follows initial absorption in the singlet system, and subsequent transfer to T<sub>1</sub> by ISC. Another important <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Photochemical principles</a> process involves the dissociation of complex molecules (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>). It may be that an electronic state that is reached in an absorption process is strongly bound, and does not fall apart spontaneously, but that some other, lower lying, electronic state might be unstable and lead to formation of fragments. If, then, ISC or IC could populate this dissociative state from the one reached by absorption, fragmentation could follow the absorption of the photon. Both these processes will be discussed in more detail in the appropriate chapter, and are introduced here as illustrations of the r&#x00F4;le played by intramolecular, radiationless, energy transfer.</p>

<p class="indent">We shall return to a more complete explanation of the factors that determine the efficiency of radiationless energy transfer in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. It is, however, useful to summarize some of the main features here. There are two main factors on which attention should be focused at this stage: these are (i) the intrinsic probability of the electronic transition; and (ii) the part played by the shapes, sizes, and energies of the molecules in the two electronic states.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.23"/><b>1.23</b> We shall see in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> how the extent of spin&#x2013;orbit coupling can be affected by various influences internal and external to the molecule. We shall note also, that for molecules described by the (n, &#x03C0;*), (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;*), etc. nomenclature [<a href="#nt1.15">Note 1.15</a>], the spin-forbidden processes are much more likely between (n, &#x03C0;*) and (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;*) states, in either direction, than between (n, &#x03C0;*) and (n, &#x03C0;*), or between (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;*) and (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;*) states (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#nt3.12">Note 3.12</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>)</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As for optical transitions, whether or not the radiationless transition can occur is embodied in selection rules given in the margin [<a href="#nt1.22">Note 1.22</a>]. Comparison with the rules set out in <a href="#nt1.16">Note 1.16</a> for optical transitions shows that all rules are the same except for g &#x2194; g and u &#x2194; u. As a result, electronic states reached by <i>allowed</i> radiationless transitions will have all quantum numbers and symmetry elements, with the exception of g and u, identical to the states reached by direct absorption. For <i>forbidden</i> transitions, on the other hand, the quantum numbers may apparently alter, as in going from <b>S</b> = 0 (singlet) states to <b>S</b> = 1 (triplet) ones. Just as in the case of optical transitions, the occurrence of these formally forbidden transitions reflects the inadequacy of the quantum number to fully describe the situation. One particular source of breakdown of the &#x0394;<b>S</b> = 0 rule is the existence of <i>spin&#x2013;orbit</i> coupling, as described in <a href="#nt1.17">Note 1.17</a> for optical transitions [<a href="#nt1.23">Note 1.23</a>].</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The effects of size, shape, and energy of the molecule in its different electronic states can all be rationalized in terms of the Franck&#x2013;Condon principle (see <a href="#page_7">p. 7</a>), and the essential ideas will be presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>. For the time being, we can illustrate the concept by looking at the potential energy curves for a diatomic molecule; such curves can also be taken as representative cross sections for the potential energy &#x2018;surfaces&#x2019; that describe polyatomic molecules (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_20">p. 20</a>). We show in <a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a> typical potential energy curves. Absorption of radiation from the X state can populate the upper state labelled B; in the figure, the line drawn within the B curve is intended to show the vibrational level populated, and thus the total of vibrational and electronic energy. The B state is crossed by another one labelled A, and we are interested in intramolecular energy transfer from the B to A states. The first feature to note about the process is that the sum of the vibrational and electronic energies of the initial (B) and final (A) electronic states must be identical: since there are no collisions or fragmentations, no energy can be gained or lost as translation. The energy transfer thus takes place somewhere along the horizontal line set at the energy with which the B state is generated. However, the Franck&#x2013;Condon principle constrains the electronic transition to <a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Photochemical principles</a> occur without change of nuclear geometry, so that the process must also occur along a vertical line for the nuclear geometry involved. Since neither horizontal nor vertical coordinates can alter, the transfer must occur at a point, although the argument does not yet state at which interatomic distance this point is located. It is often useful to assume that this point where transfer of energy (or crossing from one curve to another) occurs is the point of intersection of the two curves. The fuller argument to be presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a> shows that this is, indeed, the configuration for most efficient energy transfer in most cases, so that the simple picture of jumping from one curve to another at the crossing point is a very helpful one.</p>
<p class="indent">For complex polyatomic molecules, it is often not possible to construct the detailed potential energy curves or surfaces. An alternative type of diagram, used for complex molecules such as naphthalene, is presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>, and will be explained there. Such a diagram is called a <i>Jablonski diagram</i> after the inventor of its original form.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.10<span class="space">&#160;</span>Experimental methods</h2>
<p class="noindent">The discussion of experimental techniques presented in this book is only intended to provide a brief overview of the principles involved and of the most common methods used. The nature of the final products of photochemical reaction, and the rates of their formation, can be determined using relatively straightforward standard chemical techniques, which need not be treated here. We concern ourselves largely with those parts of the experimental technique that involve light. Determination of the identities and rates of formation of highly reactive primary and secondary products formed as intermediates can be difficult. Methods adopted to study intermediates include flash photolysis, photolysis in rigid matrices, isotopic labelling, free radical trapping techniques, and use of emission spectra and lifetimes. Precise measurement of the intensity of absorbed (and sometimes emitted) light is essential to the determination of quantum yields, which in themselves are needed in any assessment of the nature and efficiency of primary (and secondary) photochemical processes. It is worth noting at this point that all optical components of the reaction system, particularly the windows of the reaction cell, must be transparent to the wavelength of radiation used for each particular experiment [<a href="#nt1.24">Note 1.24</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.24"/><b>1.24</b> In addition to the question of transparency of the optical components of an experiment, at short wavelengths (&#x03BB; &#x2264; 190 nm) air itself begins to absorb significantly. Experiments must then be performed in a vacuum (or with the air flushed out by a non-absorbing gas). For this reason, the uv region at &#x03BB; &#x003C; 200 nm called the <i>vacuum ultraviolet</i>.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Classical experiments</h3>
<p class="noindent">Classical experiments seek to follow the overall course, rate, and quantum yield of a photochemical reaction. The basic idea is to irradiate the reaction mixture with a steady light source, and to identify the products formed. Although the concentrations of reactants decrease with time, and those of the products increase, it is quite common in this type of experiment for the concentrations of the intermediates (e.g. radicals, triplet states, etc.) to remain roughly the same (i.e. at <i>steady-state</i> concentrations) for a substantial part of the time of the experiment [<a href="#nt1.25">Note 1.25</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.25"/><b>1.25</b> See <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for a more extended discussion of the steady state.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_14" class="page" style="width: 70%;">Page 14, Photochemical principles</a>
<p class="indent">A typical classical experiment is illustrated in <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>. Radiation from the light source passes through a wavelength-selecting device, from which the emergent beam falls upon the reaction cell. Reaction cells are usually constructed with two parallel windows, so that some of the light incident upon the cell may be transmitted through it. A device for measuring radiation intensity is therefore placed beyond the cell to detect any transmitted radiation. The fraction of incident light absorbed can also be calculated, using the Beer-Lambert law (see <a href="#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>), from measurements of the incident intensity. Some of the specific components are now discussed in more detail.</p>

</aside>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Light sources</h3>
<p class="noindent">The &#x2018;ideal&#x2019; light source in a photochemical experiment is monochromatic, to enable precise assessment of the effect of wavelength on the nature and rate of the reaction being studied. However, monochromatic light is not always an experimental possibility &#x2014; except in the case of laser sources &#x2014; so that means of isolating narrow wavelength bands must be employed. Techniques used to produce near-monochromatic radiation include grating or prism monochromators, although the transmitted intensity may be so low as to make experimentation impossible; &#x2018;colour filters&#x2019;, which may be liquid or solid (glass) solutions containing substances that strongly absorb light of unwanted wavelengths; and &#x2018;interference filters&#x2019; which depend upon the interference effects in thin films (akin to those giving rise to colours in soap bubbles).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.26"/><b>1.26 Light sources</b></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.3em;"><i>Incandescent</i> tungsten-filament lamps have a continuous spectrum which approximates to that of a black body. <i>Discharge</i> lamps emit most of their energy in a small number of bands or lines. They can also be used as &#x2018;flash lamps&#x2019;. <i>Lasers</i> are extremely well suited to use in photochemical experiments. They provide radiation in a collimated beam which is coherent and monochromatic, is of high intensity, and can be pulsed (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a>). <i>Synchrotron</i> radiation is an extremely effective source of radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet region of the spectrum [<a href="#nt1.24">Note 1.24</a>], where most other light sources are particularly poor.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Measurement of light intensity</h3>
<p class="noindent">In a photochemical experiment, the amount of light that is absorbed by the reaction mixture must be measured. A light <i>detector</i> is used for this purpose. Detectors commonly used include thermopiles, photocells, photodiodes, and photomultipliers.</p>
<p class="indent">Thermopiles make use of the heating effect of light as it falls upon a blackened surface; they can be quite sensitive, but are particularly prone to small fluctuations in room temperature and to draughts. They consist of an assembly of thermocouples connected in series, whose front junctions are blackened; the temperature difference between front and rear junctions gives rise to an electrical output (e.m.f) that can be measured.</p>
<p class="indent">Photocells are often more useful than thermopiles in the realm of photochemical experimentation, as they are sensitive to light but not to heat. Their purpose also is to convert electromagnetic radiation into an electric current, but directly via the photoelectric effect rather than indirectly via heating effects. A photocell consists of a photocathode and a collector (anode) enclosed in an evacuated bulb; illumination of the cathode causes electrons to be released, and if the collector is positively charged then a current will flow in the external circuit. Operating conditions can be chosen so that this current is proportional to the light intensity reaching the cathode. It is necessary to calibrate photocells against thermopiles or secondary standards (such as the chemical actinometers mentioned at the end of this section).</p>
<a id="page_15" class="page" style="width: 70%;">Page 15, Photochemical principles</a>
<p class="indent">Small photocell currents may be amplified by conventional electronic techniques, but noise, as well as signal, is amplified. Photomultipliers provide one solution to the problem. A photomultiplier consists of an electron multiplier coupled to a photocathode. Light falling upon this cathode produces electrons via the photoelectric effect; the electrons proceed to hit further active surfaces (<i>dynodes</i>), which in turn release further electrons, so that the current produced is amplified.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.27"/><b>1.27</b> Thermopiles can provide intensity in absolute units (watts, or photons s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), since they depend on a heating effect; the other devices give relative intensities only, and need to be calibrated for absolute measurements.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Absolute calibration procedures using thermopiles are awkward and require great care to avoid errors. It is common practice to employ <i>chemical actinometers</i> to provide a secondary standard for intensity calibration. Such actinometers are gas- or liquid-phase systems in which the quantum yield has been accurately determined in previous experiments (ultimately referred back to thermopile measurements). Measurement of the reaction rate thus allows calculation of the light intensity. Chemical actinometers are usually chosen to be insensitive to wavelength and other experimental parameters. See <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#nt2.37">Note 2.37</a> for two well known actinometer systems.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.28"/><b>1.28</b> Scattered light of the incident radiation can cause problems, especially if luminescence is weak, and may in some cases prevent the study of luminescence at wavelengths near that of the exciting light.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Emission studies</h3>
<p class="noindent">The investigation of phenomena such as fluorescence, phosphorescence and cherniluminescence requires the use of specialized techniques, as the intensities of emitted radiation tend to be far lower than the intensities of the light sources discussed in the previous section, so that the detector must be correspondingly sensitive. Although photographic records of emission spectra can provide intensity data averaged over the exposure period, and information about the spectral distribution of the emission, photomultipliers are far more commonly used as a result of their superior sensitivity and speed of response.</p>
<p class="indent">The spectroscopic nature of luminescent radiation may be investigated using a dispersing instrument (e.g. monochromator) together with a photomultiplier to detect radiation. Fluorescence or phosphorescence <i>excitation spectra</i> are obtained by monitoring the emission intensity (preferably within a narrow wavelength band) as the wavelength of the exciting radiation is altered (see also <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_43">pp. 43</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_45">45</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.29"/><b>1.29</b> It is possible to calculate the quantum yield of emission processes using measurements of either relative or absolute absorption and emission intensities. Another, often more convenient, approach is to compare the emitted intensities from the sample and from a substance whose emission quantum yield is already accurately known.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Fluorescence and phosphorescence are almost always observed at right angles to the direction of the irradiating beam. If an irradiated system exhibits both fluorescence and phosphorescence, it may be difficult to establish the contribution to emission made by each process. The technique used to differentiate between the two phenomena uses time-resolved intensity analysis, of the kind discussed in the next section, to see if any luminescence persists after the illumination is cut off.</p>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Detection of intermediates</h3>
<p class="noindent">The identification of reactive intermediates involved in photochemical change and the measurement of their concentrations are vital in improving understanding of photochemical processes. The term <i>reactive intermediates</i> covers species such as the atoms, radicals, and ions that are the primary <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Photochemical principles</a> fragments of photolysis; the excited states of these fragments; and the excited states, including triplets, of the absorber that are first produced and that participate in fluorescence, phosphorescence, and radiationless transitions (IC and ISC). We first review some techniques that are available for the study of intermediates, and then discuss time-resolved studies.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.30"/><b>1.30</b> The <i>fine structure</i> in an electronic spectrum arises from the superposition of vibrational and rotational structures on the electronic spectrum, and may thus provide information about geometry (shape and size) and the type of bonding.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Optical spectroscopy often provides a sensitive and unambiguous way of identifying an intermediate. When the fine structure [<a href="#nt1.30">Note 1.30</a>] is resolvable, the spectroscopic detail may enable description of the chemical nature, the structure, and the electronic state of the species.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Absorption spectroscopy</i> depends upon the species under investigation having a higher state to which an electric dipole transition is allowed. <i>Laser absorption</i> studies using tunable dye lasers (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a>) as the light source are very successful, and are particularly effective for studying atoms and small radicals. Increased absorption can be achieved using a <i>multipass absorption</i> experiment, in which the light beam is made to traverse the sample many times using suitably arranged mirrors; lasers are particularly well suited to this purpose as a result of the small divergence of a laser beam. <i>Resonance absorption</i> experiments use light sources spectrally matched to the absorption features being studied, e.g. by using electric discharge lamps that contain the appropriate gases. So long as the spectral linewidths of source and absorber match, the sensitivity of absorption can be high, and the specificity excellent.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.31"/><b>1.31</b> Emission studies tend to have a higher ultimate practical sensitivity than absorption studies, as the only radiation comes from the species under investigation, but they are limited to species that have an excited state that lives long enough for spontaneous emission, and generally work on longer timescales than absorption studies. As a result of the high sensitivity, optical pumping to a higher, emitting, state is frequently used to study species initially in their ground state.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent"><i>Optical emission</i> [<a href="#nt1.31">Note 1.31</a>] can be used to study excited species, if an optical transition occurs with sufficient intensity to a lower state. <i>Resonance fluorescence</i> (RF: see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_44">p. 44</a>) can be excited by resonance discharge lamps. <i>Laser induced fluorescence</i> (LIF) is similar in concept to RF, but uses a tunable laser to excite the resonance transition; LIF provides more versatility and often higher sensitivity than discharge-lamp excited RF.</p>
<p class="indent">Lasers can be used as pumps in <i>resonance Raman spectroscopy</i> (RRS) and <i>coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy</i> (CARS). They are also used to great effect in <i>photoionization</i> techniques, which work on the basis that it should be possible to ionize a specific intermediate or excited state using monoenergetic photons of the correct energy. The method is sensitive because ions are only produced when the intermediate is present. Multiphoton ionization (MPI) and <i>resonance-enhanced</i> multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by lasers permit the ionization of a wide variety of species without the necessity of using vacuum ultraviolet sources. See <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.12">Section 2.12</a> for a discussion of multiphoton processes (and REMPI in particular).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.32"/><b>1.32</b> Some of the magnetic resonance techniques that have found application include <i>electron spin resonance</i> (ESR), <i>optically detected magnetic resonance</i> (ODMR), <i>chemically induced dynamic nuclear spin polarization</i> (CIDNP), <i>chemically induced dynamic electron spin polarization</i> (CIDEP) and <i>laser magnetic resonance</i> (LMR). [See also <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#nt2.16">Note 2.16</a> for CIDNP/CIDEP].</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Magnetic resonance methods also find a considerable range of application in the study of photochemical intermediates [<a href="#nt1.32">Note 1.32</a>].</p>
<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Time-resolved experiments</h3>
<p class="noindent">Time-resolved experiments are used to determine the concentration and chemical nature of reactive intermediates and to provide kinetic information about these intermediates. The stationary concentrations of atoms, radicals, or excited species present in a static system are normally too low for the <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Photochemical principles</a> intermediates to be detected by their absorption spectra. In <i>flash photolysis</i>, the archetypal time-resolved technique, an extremely high-intensity flash source is used so that the transient concentrations of intermediates may be sufficiently large for spectroscopic observation. The concentrations of reactants, intermediates, or products can be followed as a function of time after the flash, a process often known as <i>kinetic spectroscopy</i>. This type of method is invaluable in the elucidation of photochemical reaction mechanisms.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.33"/><b>1.33</b> In the earlier experiments, a second flash was used to obtain a photographic record of the absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture at a fixed time after the photolysis flash. The reaction vessel was then filled with fresh reactant, and the experiment repeated with a different delay time between the two flashes.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In a &#x2018;pump-and-probe&#x2019; procedure, a record (&#x2018;probe&#x2019;) of the absorption spectrum is obtained at a fixed time after the photolysis flash (&#x2018;pump&#x2019;). A convenient implementation for kinetic experiments is <i>flash spectrophotometry</i>, in which a broad-band continuous-wave source and monochromator combination, or a laser, set at the wavelength of absorption of the species of interest, are used to measure the transmitted intensity as a function of time [<a href="#nt1.34">Note 1.34</a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Luminescent lifetimes may be studied in a manner wholly analogous to absorption flash spectrophotometry, the monitoring light source being omitted (see also <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_61">p. 61</a>). A further variant is the use of resonance fluorescence (RF) or laser induced fluorescence (LIF) to probe the concentrations of non-emitting intermediates produced by the photolytic flash.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt1.34"/><b>1.34</b> The type of method described in the text can be modified to operate on a nanosecond timescale. Experiments on a picosecond or shorter timescale require rather different approaches, which are described in a number of the texts listed in <i>Further reading</i> (<a href="Further_Reading.xhtml#page_89">p. 89</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Experiments on the millisecond and microsecond timescale provide information about the rates of bimolecular reaction of photolytic fragments and excited states, as well as about the emission of radiation from triplets in phosphorescence. Nanosecond experiments are able to probe the fluorescent emission from singlets, as well as intersystem crossing, while picosecond studies yield kinetic data about geminate recombination (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.5">Section 2.5</a>), energy exchange, vibrational relaxation, and some of the slower internal conversions and isomerizations. Investigations on the femtosecond timescale have been reported, although it should be borne in mind that in one femtosecond light travels only 300 nm, or one wavelength! Experiments on these timescales probe the act of absorption of radiation and the very first stages of utilization of the energy in promoting chemical and physical change.</p>
