<p class="noindent">Earlier chapters of this book have been concerned with the fundamental processes of photochemistry. In this and the next chapter, we look at some of the many ways in which photochemistry has an impact on our lives. Natural photochemical phenomena have contributed to the evolution of life as we know it, and permit its continued existence on Earth.</p>

<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Origin and evolution of the atmosphere</h3>
<p class="noindent">Photochemical reactions have performed a determining role in the evolution of the atmosphere and of life on Earth. Our understanding of primary photochemical processes permits reasonable speculation about the history of the atmosphere; the &#x2018;investigation&#x2019; of the Earth&#x2019;s palaeoatmosphere (fossil atmosphere) has in turn suggested solutions to several &#x2018;puzzles&#x2019; concerning the Earth&#x2019;s geology. The forms and ecology of life that were viable at any time in the past were directly dependent on the constitution of the atmosphere at that period; we shall see that, on the other hand, processes involving living organisms exert a major influence on atmospheric composition. It is this interrelation between atmospheric and biological evolution that makes the study of the Earth&#x2019;s palaeoatmosphere, and comparison with the present-day atmospheres of other planets, particularly rewarding.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.1"/><b>5.1</b> Much evidence shows that Earth was without a primordial atmosphere. For example, the abundances of the noble gases in the contemporary atmosphere lie between 10<sup>-10</sup> and 10<sup>-6</sup> of their cosmic abundances. It has been shown that the quantities of gases liberated as a result of volcanic activity, and from slow decay of solid radioactive elements, are sufficient to account for our atmosphere. However, <i>oxygen is not released from volcanic effluents</i>, and the primitive atmosphere must have contained N<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O as its most important constituents, together with traces of reducing gases such as H<sub>2</sub> and CO.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Inorganic photochemical processes are unable to explain the levels of O<sub>2</sub> found in our atmosphere. How could our atmosphere come to have more than 20% of oxygen in it, while our nearest neighbours, Venus and Mars, have less than 0.1%? Earth possesses an atmosphere that for hundreds of millions of years appears to have been disregarding the laws of physics and chemistry. Minor oxidizable constituents of our atmosphere, such as methane, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide, survive in the presence of large concentrations of oxygen, although thermodynamic considerations would suggest virtually complete oxidation of these components. Earth&#x2019;s peculiar behaviour is a consequence of the existence of life on the planet. Biological processes, acting together with physical and chemical change, determine the composition of our atmosphere. Conversely, our unique atmosphere seems essential for the support of life in its many forms. Oxygen, the unexpected gas of our atmosphere, is almost entirely the result of biological activity. Not only does biology provide the atmospheric oxidant, but it also continually provides the oxidizable minor gas &#x2018;fuels&#x2019;. Biological processes are thus responsible for the thermodynamic disequilibrium of our atmosphere. <a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Photochemistry in nature</a></p>
<p class="indent">Photosynthesis is the only known process that can yield O<sub>2</sub> in its present abundance. Photosynthesis is the subject of <a href="#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>, and for the time being we need only note that the process involves consumption of carbon dioxide and water, and the concomitant <i>liberation of oxygen</i> [<a href="#nt5.2">Note 5.2</a>]. In the present atmosphere, all O<sub>2</sub> passes through the photosynthetic process in a few thousand years, a period extremely short by geological standards, and photosynthesis is clearly an efficient source of O<sub>2</sub>. <a href="#fig5.1">Figure 5.1</a> summarizes one view of the build-up of oxygen from pre-biological to present-day levels as large-scale photosynthesis became established.</p>

Almost all the oxygen in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere is produced by photosynthesis. <a href="#fig5.1">Figure 5.1</a> shows how oxygen concentrations might have evolved since life first appeared on the planet some 3.6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>9</sup> or more years ago. The markers on the oxygen curve show fossil and geological evidence for the particular concentrations. The curve for ozone concentrations is obtained by a model calculation for each of the oxygen concentrations. The results suggest that sufficient protection from solar UV would have been afforded by ozone for life to emerge onto dry land around 550 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Pre-biological oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere are important in two ways. Organic molecules are susceptible to thermal oxidation and photooxidation, and are unlikely to have accumulated in large concentrations in an oxidizing atmosphere. The low pre-biological oxygen concentrations thus seem essential to the development of the organic precursors of life. Living organisms can develop mechanisms that protect against oxidative degradation, but they are still photochemically sensitive to short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Macromolecules, such as the proteins and nucleic acids that are characteristic of living cells, are damaged by ultraviolet radiation of wavelength shorter than about 290 nm. In our atmosphere, the oxygen itself is able to filter out solar ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than about 230 nm. For wavelengths between 230 and 290 nm, however, some other protection must be afforded. Luckily, there is a suitable absorbing species in our atmosphere, so that organisms can live on dry land more or less exposed to the filtered Sun&#x2019;s rays. The species is ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, derived photochemically from O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere (see <a href="#page_69">p. 69</a>). The amount of ozone in the atmosphere, and its altitude distribution, will depend on the concentration of the precursor oxygen, and will therefore have altered markedly as the <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Photochemistry in nature</a>atmosphere evolved. Concentrations of ozone are also controlled by the rates of loss processes for the molecule. Loss is regulated by catalytic cycles involving other trace gases of the atmosphere, such as the oxides of nitrogen, that are themselves at least partly of biological origin (see <a href="#page_70">p. 70</a>). We have already noted that the oxygen in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere comes largely from biological sources. Now we see that the ozone, needed as a filter to protect life, has its concentration determined not only by the biologically generated oxygen required for its production, but also by the biologically generated trace gases that play a part in its destruction.</p>

<h3 class="h2">The stratosphere</h3>
<p class="noindent">Simple thermodynamic arguments suggest that temperature should decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. In the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, the temperature drops by about 6.5 K for every kilometre of height increase, for roughly the first 15&#x2013;20 km above the surface, but above this height the temperature begins to increase again. The reversal in the temperature trend constitutes a <i>temperature inversion:</i> it results mainly from solar photodissociation of ozone, and the subsequent exothermic chemical reactions that we shall discuss shortly. The lowest region of the atmosphere has colder air lying on top of warmer air, so that convection can lead to rapid vertical mixing: the region is named the <i>troposphere</i> after the Greek for &#x2018;turning&#x2019;. In the second region, the warmer air lying on top of colder air results in great vertical stability, and the region is named the <i>stratosphere</i> after the Latin for &#x2018;layered&#x2019;. The troposphere and the stratosphere are divided by the <i>tropopause.</i> <a href="#fig5.2">Figure 5.2</a> shows schematically the temperature-altitude profile in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig5.3">Figure 5.3</a> shows the results of a typical balloon investigation of atmospheric ozone concentration. The concentration reaches a maximum at an altitude of around 27 km which is quite sharply peaked (note that the concentration is on a logarithmic scale), and atmospheric ozone is frequently described as consisting of a &#x2018;layer&#x2019; in the stratosphere, centred on 25&#x2013;30 km.</p>

<p class="indent">The simple four-reaction scheme predicts the layer structure found in the atmosphere. At high altitudes, there is much short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation capable of dissociating molecular oxygen, but relatively little of the O<sub>2</sub> itself. Low in the atmosphere, there is plenty of O<sub>2</sub>, but short-wavelength radiation is absent, because it has already been filtered out by the O<sub>2</sub> and the O<sub>3</sub> lying above. Solar ultraviolet energy absorbed by the O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> is ultimately liberated as heat, in part through the exothermic <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">reactions (5.3)</a> and <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">(5.4)</a>. This heating gives rise to the stratospheric temperature inversion.</p>

After sunset, atomic oxygen concentrations fall rapidly at altitudes below about 40 km, since the source <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">reactions (5.1)</a> and <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">(5.2)</a> are cut off, but the sink processes <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">(5.3)</a> and <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">(5.4)</a> remain.</p>

<p class="indent">Proper calculation of the ozone profile, using rate parameters for the reactions determined in the laboratory, shows that the predicted profile has the same general shape as the measured one. However, the calculated absolute concentrations are all higher, by a factor of up to four or five, than the true atmospheric ones. The problem arises because the loss process, <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">reaction (5.4)</a>, is too slow at stratospheric temperatures (say 220&#x2013;270 K) to balance the production of ozone at the correct concentration. It is now well established that <a href="#eq5.1-5.4">reaction (5.4)</a> can be catalysed by trace constituents in the atmosphere. The idea is summed up in the reaction scheme</p>

<p class="noindent">The reactive species X is regenerated in the second step, so that its abundance is not affected by its participation in odd-oxygen removal. Several species have been suggested for the catalytic &#x2018;X&#x2019; in the atmosphere. The most important for the natural stratosphere are X = H and OH, X = NO, and X = C1; the catalytic cycles are then said to involve HO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and ClO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. These cycles have activation energies for the individual steps that are lower than the activation energy of the direct O + O<sub>3</sub> reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">All three catalytic families, HO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and ClO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, appear to be present in the &#x2018;natural&#x2019; atmosphere unpolluted by Man&#x2019;s activities. Precursors of the catalytic species have sources at the Earth&#x2019;s surface, and they have to be transported through the troposphere to the stratosphere. Amongst the species of importance are H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, which are converted to the catalyst radicals in the stratosphere. One important route for conversion of the precursors involves excited atomic oxygen produced in the <i>ultraviolet</i> photolysis of ozone</p>

<p class="indent">The stratosphere is very dry, probably because water from the troposphere has to pass through the &#x2018;cold trap&#x2019; at the tropopause, and CH<sub>4</sub> constitutes more than a third of the total [H<sub>2</sub>O] + [CH<sub>4</sub>] in the lower stratosphere. CH<sub>4</sub> is therefore an important source of OH, especially since the oxidation of the CH<sub>3</sub> radical (to CO) also yields two or three more odd-hydrogen species (e.g. H, OH, HO<sub>2</sub>). Both N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> are the result of biological activity (mostly microbial) on the Earth&#x2019;s surface. The main contribution to CH<sub>3</sub>Cl is again biological, this time in the oceans, although burning of vegetation and some volcanic eruptions are additional sources.</p>
<p class="indent">Increased understanding of the role played by trace gases in determining atmospheric ozone concentrations has also led to an awareness that Man might inadvertently alter ozone concentrations by releasing catalytically active <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Photochemistry in nature</a>materials. Pollutants introduced into the stratosphere would have a lifetime for physical removal by transport of several years because of the vertical stability that results from the temperature inversion. They might therefore build up to globally damaging levels, reducing stratospheric ozone with biological consequences at ground level, such as increased incidence of skin cancer. Initial concern, in the early 1970s, centred on supersonic stratospheric transport (SST) aircraft, such as Concorde. Such aircraft could inject NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, produced from N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the high temperatures of the jet engines, directly into the stratosphere [<a href="#nt5.5">Note 5.5</a>]. Another source of increased stratospheric NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> could be increased N<sub>2</sub>O production in the biosphere resulting from intensive use of fertilizers. While perturbations due to the use of SSTs may be regarded as discretionary, agricultural use of fertilizers may be essential if populations continue to grow. Doubling the N<sub>2</sub>O concentration is predicted to give a global ozone depletion of between 9 and 16%, although such large increases in N<sub>2</sub>O are improbable in the near future. A more immediate problem seems to be the release of fluorinated chlorocarbons (CFCs), such as dichlorodifluoromethane, CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (CFC-12), and trichlorofluoromethane, CFCl<sub>3</sub> (CFC-11). The CFCs are extremely inert chemically, and are valuable as aerosol propellants, as refrigerants, as blowing agents for plastic foam production, and as solvents. The uses of the CFCs all lead ultimately to atmospheric release, and it appears that the quantities of CFCs in the troposphere are equal, within experimental error, to the total amount ever manufactured. Tropospheric inertness is thus confirmed, and lifetimes of up to hundreds of years are indicated. Only one escape route is available to the CFCs, and that is upward transport to the stratosphere. Sufficiently short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation penetrates to the stratosphere to photolyse the CFCs, the process involving the liberation of atomic chlorine, as exemplified for CFC-12</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-25.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.5"/><b>5.5</b> Current numerical models indicate that ozone reductions due to SSTs are negligible, partly because the present fleet of aircraft is so small and partly because the aircraft fly low in the stratosphere where the NO<sub>x</sub> cycle has relatively little effect on [O<sub>3</sub>]. However, this issue is being reopened as discussions about a new generation of SSTs progress.</p>

<figure class="fig1a" id="eq5.9">
<img src="../images/page71-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The Cl atoms can thus contribute to ozone destruction in the ClO<sub><i>x</i></sub> cycle, and chlorine of Man-made origin now dominates over the natural CH<sub>3</sub>Cl contribution. Many models predict significant ozone depletions from the release of CFCs [<a href="#nt5.6">Note 5.6</a>]. In recent years, a new phenomenon (the &#x2018;ozone hole&#x2019;) has been observed over the Antarctic, where extremely large depletions occur each year in October. The extent of the depletion seems to have been growing each year. It is now virtually certain that the &#x2018;hole&#x2019; is associated with the increasing atmospheric load of CFCs.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.6"/><b>5.6</b> A feature of most predictions is that the depletions will get larger over one or more decades even if CFC release is curtailed now, and that the full recovery of ozone concentrations may take up to 100 years. There is now (1995) substantial evidence that global ozone levels are decreasing somewhat faster than expected. From 1988 onwards, a series of international protocols has restricted production of the CFCs, and they should have been phased out almost completely by 1996.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h2">The troposphere</h3>
<p class="noindent">About 90% of the total atmospheric mass resides in the troposphere, and the bulk of the minor trace gas burden is found there also. The Earth&#x2019;s surface acts as the main source of the trace gases, although some NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and CO may be produced in thunderstorms. Hydroxyl radicals dominate the chemistry of the troposphere in the same way that oxygen atoms and ozone dominate stratospheric chemistry. Free-radical chain reactions initiated by OH oxidize H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and other hydrocarbons, and CO, to H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. The reactions thus <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Photochemistry in nature</a>constitute a low-temperature combustion system. The free-radical chain processes are photochemically driven, although stratospheric ozone limits the solar radiation at the Earth&#x2019;s surface to wavelengths longer than 290nm. At these wavelengths, the most important photochemically active species are O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO. All three can yield OH (or HO<sub>2</sub>) indirectly, and thus initiate the oxidation chains. Ozone photolysis is, however, a critical step, since the other photolytic processes owe either their origin or their importance to it. Although only 10% of the total atmospheric ozone is found in the troposphere, all <i>primary</i> initiation of oxidation chains in the natural atmosphere depends on that ozone. Some ozone is transported to the troposphere from the stratospheric ozone layer, but a mechanism also exists for generation of ozone in the troposphere itself. If NO<sub>2</sub> is present, then NO<sub>2</sub> photolysis</p>

<p class="indent">The oxidation steps for methane obviously have analogues for higher hydrocarbons, but in all cases the reactions depend on the switch between peroxy- (RO<sub>2</sub>) and oxy- (RO) radicals in an interaction with NO.

<p class="indent">Man&#x2019;s activities lead to the release of many kinds of pollutants to the troposphere; one form of pollution which is essentially photochemical in origin is the photochemical &#x2018;smog&#x2019; from which many large cities suffer [<a href="#nt5.8">Note 5.8</a>]. The characteristic pollutants are ozone and nitrogen dioxide, together with a host of organic compounds. Concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> are so high that the ozone can easily be detected by smell, and a heavy load of particles leads to a brown haze in the air. Damage to materials such as rubber, damage to vegetation, reduction in visibility, and increased incidence of respiratory disease are recognized consequences of the pollution; the most immediately obvious effect of photochemical smog is eye irritation caused by substances such as formaldehyde, acrolein, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).</p>

<p class="indent">Aerosols of particulate matter are found in many kinds of air pollution, including photochemical smog.

Aerosols are also produced in a form of natural air pollution, found in many parts of the world, but notably in the southwestern USA. A photochemically induced contamination of the atmosphere by particulate matter gives rise to a haze or smokiness over regions possessing high densities of trees such as pines or citrus fruit. Terpenes can be oxidized by ozone to give particulate matter [<a href="#nt5.9">Note 5.9</a>], and it seems that the atmospheric aerosols are formed in this way by reactions of terpenes liberated from the trees.</p>

<p class="noindent">Photosynthesis is perhaps the most important of the many interesting photochemical processes known in biology; not only was the evolution of the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere dependent on it, but also animal life derives energy from the Sun, via photosynthesis, by eating plants. It is estimated that the total mass of organic material produced by green plants during the biological history of the Earth represents 1% of the planet&#x2019;s mass, and that photosynthesis fixes annually the equivalent of ten times Mankind&#x2019;s energy consumption.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">From the point of view of organic synthesis, the overall process consists of the formation of carbohydrates by the reduction of carbon dioxide</p>

<p class="noindent">The essence of the process is the use of photochemical energy to split water and hence to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>. Molecular oxygen is liberated in the reaction, although it appears at an earlier stage in the sequence of steps than the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. True photochemical processes appear to produce compounds of high chemical potential, which can &#x2018;drive&#x2019; the synthetic sequence from CO<sub>2</sub> to carbohydrate in a cyclic fashion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a href="#eq5.16">Reaction (5.16)</a>, with <i>n</i> = 1, is the sum of <a href="#eq5.17-5.18">reactions (5.17)</a> and <a href="#eq5.17-5.18">(5.18)</a>, and it is evident that if each photon absorbed can lead to the transfer of one electron, then a minimum of four photons are needed for each CO<sub>2</sub> molecule converted. Experimental measurements of the quantum yield indicate that <i>eight</i> photons are needed in reality, suggesting that two photons are utilized for each electron transfer, and thus pointing to a two-step process with relatively long-lived intermediates connecting the steps. Other evidence, to be presented shortly, is in accord with this view.</p>
<p class="indent">The essential feature of the actual carbon cycle is the input of energy by (and reducing power of) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the reduced form (NADPH) of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) (see <a href="#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>). The synthetic carbon cycle can, in fact, be driven by ATP and NADPH in the presence of all initial enzymes and substrates, <i>but in the absence of light.</i> Thus it can be concluded that the ultimate result of the primary and secondary photochemical acts is the formation of ATP and NADPH, by the photophosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the reduction of NADP</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq5.19-5.20">

<p class="noindent">ATP is an &#x2018;energy-rich&#x2019; phosphate used in many biochemical processes; the storage of chemical energy arises from the energy available in hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Since <a href="#eq5.19-5.20">reaction (5.19)</a> can occur independently of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and in an anaerobic environment, the original development of the use of light by organisms may have been primarily for the storage of energy rather than for the synthesis of new organic matter. The development of photosynthesis proper would then have been a later evolutionary step.</p>
<p class="indent">The trapping and use of solar radiation depends on the presence of chlorophyll in the plant. <a href="#fig5.7">Figure 5.7</a> shows the structure of the most ubiquitous chlorophyll, chlorophyll-a [<a href="#nt5.11">Note 5.11</a>]. Chlorophyll is an exceptionally <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Photochemistry in nature</a>efficient photosensitizer because of its ability to trap the energy of radiation and pass it on from one molecule to another until conditions are favourable for the sensitized reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Reduction of NADP to NADPH (i.e. electron transfer from H<sub>2</sub>O to NADP) requires more energy than is available in a single excited chlorophyll molecule, and it is necessary to postulate some kind of &#x2018;uphill&#x2019; process, possibly involving several excited chlorophyll molecules. The actual energy requirement for reduction of 1 mole of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbohydrate is roughly 2.6 times the maximum available energy in a single excited chlorophyll molecule; with a quantum demand for the overall process of 8 (see <a href="#page_74">p. 74</a>), the efficiency of the multiple-quantum process must be as high as 33%. Some rather special and efficient &#x2018;uphill&#x2019; mechanism is therefore in play in photosynthetic plants.</p>
<p class="indent">Chlorophyll in the higher living plants is always to be found associated with lipoprotein membranes, which are organized into a highly ordered structure known as the chloroplast. The molecular arrangement in the chloroplast appears to be an essential component of the natural photosynthetic process. The chloroplast functions as a device both for the capture of light, and for the conversion of light energy to chemical energy. Several compounds other than chlorophyll are found in the chloroplast, including the auxiliary pigments (see <a href="#nt5.12">Note 5.12</a>), and carotenoid compounds which can both act as auxiliary pigments and protect chlorophyll against oxidative degradation [<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#nt2.31">Note 2.31</a>]. Also present are quinones (e.g. plastoquinone, &#x03B1;-tocopherol quinone, vitamin K) and proteins known as cytochromes that play roles in photosynthesis as important as those of the auxiliary pigments and carotenoids.</p>
<p class="indent">The membrane systems within the chloroplast are illustrated in <a href="#fig5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>: they seem to consist of a number of flattened sacs. Electrons may be transferred from one side of the membrane to the other, in such a direction that oxygen is released on the inside and reduction occurs on the outside. The number of chlorophyll molecules present in each chloroplast is directly related to the number of membrane surfaces, with roughly 10<sup>9</sup> chlorophyll molecules in a typical chloroplast. It seems that the pigment (mainly chlorophyll) molecules might be spread as monolayers on the membrane surfaces, maximizing the surface area of the pigment for light absorption and for energy transfer at specific sites on the membrane. An array of pigment molecules appears to be able to transfer energy to a single reaction centre, only one molecule needing to absorb radiation. Energy transfer, via the coulombic long-range mechanism (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.5">Section 3.5</a>), redistributes excitation from the primary absorber to other pigment molecules and ultimately to the reaction centre. In this elegant way, the available light is collected efficiently, without molecules of all components of the chemical system involved in the secondary processes having to be present for each individual light absorber. The complex array of pigment molecules thus functions as a <i>light-gathering antenna.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Detailed examination of absorption spectra of chlorophyll reveals at least two forms of chlorophyll in the chloroplast, which may possibly be chlorophyll-a complexed to different proteins, or present as monomers and dimers. In the absence of more specific information about the two forms of <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Photochemistry in nature</a>chlorophyll, they are known as &#x2018;pigment systems 1 and 2&#x2019; (PS1 and PS2). PS2 absorbs at shorter wavelengths than PS 1, probably because absorption occurs in an auxiliary pigment (e.g. chlorophyll-b in green plants): fluorescence studies indicate, however, that the excitation always resides on the chlorophyll-a and not on the auxiliary pigment.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.12"/><b>5.12</b> In photosynthetic organisms, the chlorophyll-a is usually accompanied by one or more auxiliary pigments whose function may be to absorb radiation at wavelengths where absorption by chlorophyll-a is weak; chlorophyll-b (chlorophyll-a with the 3-methyl group replaced by -CHO) and carotenes are probably the most important auxiliary absorbing pigments in the higher plants. The auxiliary pigments appear always to transfer their excitation energy to chlorophyll-a.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The photosynthetic scheme consists of two partial oxidation and reduction reactions, electrons being transferred against the potential gradient by the absorption of light. Absorption of light by PS2 leads to the formation of a strong oxidant, which eventually yields molecular oxygen and a weak reductant. The process driven by PS1 generates a strong reductant and, concomitantly, a weak oxidant. NADPH is derived from the strong reductant finally produced, and ATP is generated in the reactions that link the two photosystems.</p>
<p class="indent">The function of the chlorophyll in photosynthesis is now clear: under the influence of light, it can cause electron transfer and bring about oxidation-reduction changes. Two kinetic steps (electronic energy transfer and electron transfer) are of particular importance in photosynthesis, and each has associated with it a pigment-protein complex. True photochemical processes that involve electronically excited states are completed within about the first nanosecond after the absorption of light. The next stage in exploring photosynthesis will depend on separation of the pigment-protein complexes from the chloroplast, and it seems likely that a detailed description of the primary step in the complex molecular aggregate will soon further our understanding of what is one of the most important of all photochemical processes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Vision</h2>
<p class="noindent">Vision is stimulated by the photochemical transformation of a pigment containing a moiety related to retinal, which is the aldehyde derived from vitamin A (retinol). Extracts from the retina show the visual pigments to be compounds of a carotenoid substance with a protein. Rhodopsin, which is typical of the pigments, contains 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal (see <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>) as the carotenoid chromophore, and the protein scotopsin. Animals derive their retinol from carotenoids of plant origin, and retinal is produced in the retina by enzymic oxidation of retinol. The opsins are proteins with relative molecular masses of about 40,000. Rhodopsin (bovine or ovine) has 348 amino acid residues grouped into seven mainly hydrophobic segments that pass between the two sides of the photoreceptor membrane.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.14"/><b>5.14</b> Vertebrates, molluscs, and arthropods have all developed well-formed eyes, although the anatomy and evolutionary development of vision in the three phyla are entirely different. It is therefore remarkable that the photochemistry of the visual process is nearly identical for the three types of eye.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The gross anatomy of the vertebrate eye &#x2014; in particular, the system of lens and retina &#x2014; is too well known to need description here. The receptors of the retina consist of &#x2018;rods&#x2019; and &#x2018;cones&#x2019;: the former possess high sensitivity and are used at low light intensities, while the latter are less sensitive but may carry colour selectivity. In 1876, <b>Boll</b> discovered that the rose colour of the frog&#x2019;s retina faded in bright light. This bleaching of the so-called &#x2018;visual purple&#x2019; demonstrated explicitly the occurrence of a photochemical reaction in <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Photochemistry in nature</a>vision. Subsequent studies showed that the bleaching is reversible if the retina is kept <i>in situ:</i> the reversibility was lost in solutions of visual purple extracted from the retina, even though the initial photobleaching still occurred. It is now recognized that the bleaching is too slow to be responsible for the sensory visual response, and that it is the end result of a sequence of reactions involved in nerve excitation.</p>

<p class="indent">Irradiation of rhodopsin leads to a series of conformational changes that are reflected in the appearance and disappearance of various intermediates of differing colour. Absorption of a photon leads to photoisomerization, and thus to strained structures and ultimately to cleavage of the protein-chromophore bond. Lowering of the energy of the excited state resulting from interaction of retinal with opsin leads to a red shift, and the stronger the interaction, the larger the shift. As the progressively more strained structures of lumirhodopsin and the metarhodopsins are formed, the shift becomes smaller and the absorption maximum moves towards the blue. In the case of bathorhodopsin, which absorbs at slightly longer wavelengths than rhodopsin, it may be that the ground state lies at a higher energy than the starting rhodopsin as a result of the strained geometry. The cycle is completed by the slow thermal isomerization of all-rrans-retinal to the 11-<i>cis</i>-isomer that combines with opsin, and additional retinal can be supplied from vitamin A</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq5.21">
<img src="../images/page77-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We now turn to a brief consideration of how the photochemical changes described so far become converted to an electrical impulse that stimulates the brain. There is evidence that a single quantum of radiation can stimulate a retinal rod. The absorption of one quantum does not, however, result in vision, and several quanta (between two and six is considered a reasonable estimate) must reach the same rod within a relatively short period. Even so, the process is remarkably efficient, and the energy of the ultimate reaction greatly exceeds that absorbed by the visual pigment. The absorption of light appears to initiate a chain reaction that derives its energy from metabolism, and visual excitation is a result of &#x2018;amplification&#x2019; of the light signal received at the retina. The photoreceptor is the biological equivalent of a photomultiplier tube (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_15">p. 15</a>), which converts photons to an electrical signal with high gain and low noise. Both photoreceptor and photomultiplier achieve high gain in a cascade of amplifying stages. Visual pigments are integral membrane proteins that reside in the photoreceptor outer segment. Photoisomerization of retinal triggers a series of conformational changes in the attached protein that create or unveil an enzyme site. A cascade of enzymatic reactions follows, which ultimately produces a neural signal.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt5.15"/><b>5.15</b> Colour vision is associated with the cones rather than with the rods. The pigment iodopsin has its absorption maximum at slightly longer wavelengths than the maximum of the absorption of the rhodopsin belonging to the rods. The cones are less sensitive than the rods, and the spectral response of the eye shifts towards the red in going from dim to bright light, as expected. Vertebrates appear to perceive colour through the operation of a three-colour system. Three different cone pigments seem to be implicated, with absorptions in the blue, the green, and the red wavelength regions.</p>
