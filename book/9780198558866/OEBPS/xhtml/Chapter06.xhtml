<p class="noindent">The making of a more or less permanent record of light and shade by photography represents the best-known of all applied photochemical processes. Photography is one of a series of <i>photoimaging</i> techniques in which photons are used for the capture and replication of image information. Besides photography, other obvious large-scale applications of imaging include office copying and the preparation of various kinds of printing plates. If the image modifies the properties (e.g. the solubility) of a material used to protect some underlying medium, then subsequent treatment may allow the image to be transferred to the formerly protected surface. Such materials are known as <i>photoresists</i>, and are of enormous importance in the production of printing plates, integrated circuits and printed circuit boards for the electronics industry, the manufacture of small components such as electric razor foils and camera shutter blades, and many other applications besides [<a href="#nt6.1">Note 6.1</a>].</p>

<p class="indent">Photoimaging can be divided into the three stages of capture, rendition, and readout. These stages are illustrated in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a> for a typical imaging system. The capture process in the example is photopolymerization; description of this important technique is deferred until <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Section 6.5</a>. In general, image capture is the photochemical step, with image rendition consisting of the subsequent thermal reactions. Image readout then requires the development of the rendered image into a form that differentiates it physically from the unexposed background. Optical changes form the basis of ordinary photography; solubility changes can be used to generate three-dimensional relief patterns for printed circuits, printing plates, or three-dimensional topographic maps; wettability changes are used to produce lithographic printing plates, and enhanced tackiness can be used to pick up pigments to yield pigment-toned images in printing.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.3">
<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photography</h2>
<p class="noindent">By far the most common form of the photographic process (both for monochrome and for colour photography) is based on silver halides as the photosensitive materials. Microcrystalline grains of silver halide suspended in gelatin are coated onto a suitable support (film, glass plate, paper, etc.) to form the light-sensitive &#x2018;emulsion&#x2019;. Prolonged exposure to light causes <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79 Applied photochemistry</a> darkening of the emulsion &#x2014; the <i>print-out effect</i> &#x2014; which X-ray powder patterns show clearly to be a result of metallic silver formation. Much shorter exposures produce a so-called <i>latent image</i> in the silver halide grains. This latent image may be turned into a visible silver deposit by a &#x2018;developer&#x2019;, which is a suitable reducing agent. All developers are, in fact, thermodynamically reducing towards silver halides, and the presence of the latent image seems to lead to an increased rate of reduction to metallic silver rather than to a change in the ultimate reducibility of the emulsion. Extended development of unexposed emulsion leads finally to darkening (&#x2018;fog&#x2019;), so that the discrimination by development between exposed and unexposed areas depends on the difference in reduction rate for the two areas [<a href="#nt6.2">Note 6.2</a>]</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.2"/><b>6.2</b> In normal practice, the developed image corresponding to exposed and unexposed areas is rendered permanent by &#x2018;fixing&#x2019;: the unexposed (and hence unaffected) grains of silver halide are dissolved in sodium thiosulphate solution immediately after development.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The latent image consists of metallic silver present in the halide grains, but at much lower concentrations than in the print-out image. The presence of the metallic silver atoms appears to lower the activation energy for the reduction reaction in development, and thus enhance the rate. Development, once it has been initiated at one site on a grain, proceeds with an increasing rate as more and more silver is formed, until the entire grain is developed. This autocatalytic activity of silver has been clearly demonstrated: a low concentration (about 10<sup>15</sup> atoms cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>) of metallic silver evaporated onto a silver halide surface renders the surface &#x2018;developable&#x2019;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.3"/><b>6.3</b> The steps up to the formation of a two-atom speck are reversible, which is consistent with the experimental evidence for latent image stability only with aggregates of more than two atoms. A real crystal or grain of silver halide may possess chemical impurities and physical imperfections; in the case of emulsions, the gelatin may also enter into the photochemical process. These impurities seem to be important in practical photographic materials.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Silver halides show the phenomenon of photoconductivity, and it is believed that irradiation of silver halide raises photoelectrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the halide. The mechanism for the production of free silver then involves the migration of the photoelectrons and of interstitial silver ions to preferential sites in the halide; free silver atoms are formed by the combination of silver ions and electrons. The free silver so formed acts as an efficient trap for photoelectrons produced subsequently, so that further silver ions are discharged <i>near the same place</i> as the initial atom. Specks of silver grow, therefore, at the original preferential site. The positive &#x2018;holes&#x2019; left behind by the electrons may have some mobility, and they can diffuse towards the surface of the halide grain to liberate free halogen.</p>
<p class="indent">Spectral sensitization of silver halide emulsions can be achieved by adsorption of suitable dyes onto the halide grains. Sensitization is important, since it permits image formation by radiation of wavelength longer than that effective with unsensitized emulsions, and it offers an excellent example of a reaction photosensitized by energy or electron transfer. Spectral sensitization of photographic emulsions seems to have been the first recognized case of photosensitization (1873) (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.6">Section 2.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another use of dyes in silver halide photography is in producing images for colour photography. Here, much larger quantities of dye are used than in sensitization, and the dye becomes incorporated in the final image. A three-colour &#x2018;subtractive&#x2019; process is used to give the entire range of visible hues. Three layers of emulsion are used, each being spectrally sensitized to a different spectral region (blue, green, and red), and possessing integral filter dyes if necessary. Exposure to a coloured image thus leads to the formation of different latent (silver) images in each layer. Although development <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80 Applied photochemistry</a> involves reduction of the silver, as with black and white photography, in colour photography it is the consequent oxidation of the developer that is of interest. The oxidized developer reacts with a &#x2018;colour coupler&#x2019;, often incorporated in the emulsion layer, to produce an image dye.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.4">
<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photochromism</h2>
<p class="noindent">Silver halide photography involves the production of an essentially permanent optical effect by means of an ultimately irreversible photochemical process. A <i>reversible</i> light-induced colour change is referred to as <i>photochromism.</i> In photochromic systems, irradiation drastically alters the absorption spectrum; but when the irradiation source is removed, the system reverts to its original state. In some cases, the reversal can be brought about by light of a different wavelength. The visible effect often involves the appearance of colour in a previously colourless material, although changes in colour &#x2014; for example from red to green &#x2014; are also known.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.4"/><b>6.4</b> Photochromic sunglasses and spectacles are familiar, and plastics incorporating a photochromic dye have also been used for aircraft windows that darken in bright sunlight but become lighter again under less intense radiation. Various kinds of data storage are possible, including image storage for uses like those of photography.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The major difficulty in the use of materials incorporating photochromic materials is the rapid &#x2018;fatigue&#x2019; exhibited by most known photochromic substances. Many of the photochromic systems reported are really able to undergo reversal only a limited number of times. Photochromism based on isomerization (see below) offers the best prospect of good fatigue characteristics, since, with alternative systems that involve bond cleavage, a very small lack of reversibility soon leads to chemical decomposition in side reactions.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The main mechanisms responsible for photochromic behaviour are isomerization, dissociation, and charge-transfer or redox reactions. Many hundreds of specific photochromic substances are known, and one example must suffice to illustrate how photochromism arises. Many aromatic nitro-compounds exhibit photochromic isomerization: the process is believed to involve photoisomerization from the colourless nitro-form to the coloured aci-form [<a href="#nt6.5">Note 6.5</a>].</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photochemistry of polymers</h2>
<p class="noindent">Photopolymerization can be classified according to whether each increase in relative molecular mass requires its own photochemical activation step, or whether many (thermal) polymerization steps follow the absorption of a photon. <i>Photocrosslinking</i> falls into the first category, and involves formation of crosslinks between pre-existing polymer chains, while <i>photoinitiated polymerization</i> falls into the second.</p>
<h3 class="h2">Photopolymerization: imaging</h3>
<p class="noindent">The many uses of photoresists were listed briefly in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.2">Section 6.2</a>. One important application is in the manufacture of electronic integrated circuits, where resists are used to define the doped regions on the silicon substrate that will form the resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors of the finished <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81 Applied photochemistry</a> circuit, together with the metal conductors joining the components and the insulating and passivating layers [<a href="#nt6.6">Note 6.6</a>]. Photoresists are commonly based on photopolymer systems; those employed in the semiconductor industry are refined versions of photoresists used for making printing plates. Since crosslinked polymers are generally insoluble in any solvent, photocrosslinking might obviously form the basis of a photoresist system, and since the material that will be left behind after development by a solvent is that in the exposed regions, the resist will be <i>negative working</i> [<a href="#nt6.7">Note 6.7</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.6"/><b>6.6</b> In producing a complex circuit, there may be several tens of successive stages of imaging, followed by etching, doping, or other processing. Each stage must be lined up with an accuracy as good as a few hundred nanometres. Photographic methods are used to provide the required accuracy, although the use of ultraviolet radiation is being supplemented by shorter-wavelength X-rays or electron or ion beams, as even more components are packed into a small space (very large scale integration, VLSI).</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:2em;"><a id="nt6.7"/><b>6.7</b> Resists in which the areas exposed to light are removed on development are referred to as <i>positive working</i>, since they leave behind the protective coating where the light was obscured by the transferred pattern. <i>Negative working</i> resists leave the coating which <i>has</i> been exposed to light.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">One important photocrosslinking system involves the photolytic cycloaddition of pendant cinnarnate groups incorporated in polymer chains. For example, on irradiation of poly(viny1 cinnamate), the cinnamoyl groups react to form a crosslinked structure</p>
<figure class="fig1a">
<img src="../images/page81-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">which is insoluble in solvents. Dimerization can take place from either the singlet or the triplet excited states of the cinnamate chromophore. Only the <i>trans</i> isomer of the ester dimerizes, but the <i>cis</i> isomer is converted to the <i>trans</i> isomer by a photoisomerization reaction. Although the cinnamates only absorb radiation at wavelengths shorter than about 320 nm, triplet sensitizers such as 4,4&#x2032;-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler&#x2019;s ketone) can increase the sensitivity to near-uv and visible light by a factor of several hundred.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.8"/><b>6.8</b> Apart from the various uses in imaging, photopolymerization of films is extremely valuable in applications ranging from the drying of decorative and protective coatings on a variety of substrates to the rapid and easily-controllable hardening of resins in dentistry.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h2">Photopolymerization: curing</h3>
<p class="noindent">Photoinitiation of polymerization has found little application for the bulk production of thermoplastic linear polymers, because satisfactory low-temperature <i>thermal</i> initiators are available. Rather, the major practical uses of photopolymerization are concerned with <i>in situ</i> polymerizations of relatively thin films of materials [<a href="#nt6.8">Note 6.8</a>]. The drying or hardening processes are generally referred to as <i>curing</i>, and the photochemical route offers considerable advantages over other methods. For example, many conventional coating techniques employ large quantities of solvents that play no part in the final cured coating, and whose purpose is to reduce the viscosity of the primary material to facilitate the coating operation; energy-inefficient <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82 Applied photochemistry</a> heating of the entire substrate may also be necessary. In contrast, photoinitiation of the cure works directly on the coating, so that the substrate need not be affected, and heating operations are not usually required. With high intensities, the cure can be completed in a fraction of a second.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.9"/><b>6.9</b> Substituted acetophenones, such as benzoin esters, undergo &#x03B1;-cleavage (Norrish Type I: see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_24">p. 24</a>) to yield initiating radicals.

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Addition polymerization is used almost universally in photoinitiated curing operations, the monomers often containing either double bonds or strained rings. Most applications of photoinitiated polymerization involve a free-radical mechanism, with the monomer being based on acrylate esters (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCOOR). Acrylate groups are attached to resin types commonly used in coating technology (epoxides, urethanes, and polyesters). Polyfunctional reactive diluents, resulting from the reaction of polyols with acrylic acid, promote a more rapid cure and a more highly crosslinked coating. Successful photoinitiators have generally been aromatic carbonyl compounds, which have absorption spectra that match available ultraviolet sources.</p>
<h3 class="h2">Photodegradation and photostabilization</h3>
<p class="noindent">Our brief study of the photochemistry of polymers ends with two topics related to the durability of polymers in the outdoor environment. Most organic polymers undergo chemical change, or <i>photodegradation</i>, when exposed to visible or ultraviolet radiation, especially if atmospheric oxygen is present, and, as a result, the mechanical properties of the bulk polymer deteriorate. Durability is essential in some contexts, such as in the building or automotive industries, so that it is desirable to extend the usual lifetime by <i>photostabilization</i> of the material. On the other hand, there is also environmental concern with the persistence of agricultural plastics and of plastic packaging materials after disposal. Polymers may therefore be made deliberately light-sensitive; use of <i>photodegradable plastics</i> may allow articles such as plastic cups to be short lived, exposure to light reducing them to a fine powder, and thus &#x2018;naturally&#x2019; disposing of abandoned waste.</p>
<p class="indent">Normal degradation is a light-initiated autoxidation process. Photostabilization of polymers must thus aim at reducing the rates of initiation or propagation of the chains, or possibly at increasing the rate of their termination. Reduction of residual impurities in the polymer would decrease the rate of initiation, and protection from oxygen would decrease the rate of propagation, but these two methods are rarely practicable.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.10"/><b>6.10</b> Orthohydroxybenzophenones make up one very useful class of stabilizer that operates by both screening and quenching. In addition, the hydroxybenzophenones seem able to react chemically with hydroperoxides, thus preventing the acceleration of autoxidation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An alternative way of reducing the rate of initiation is to prevent the absorption of light. Highly absorbent materials such as carbon-black are often used, and they confine photodegradation to the polymer surface. Reflecting substances such as the white oxides of zinc or titanium are used similarly. Quenchers may be used that prevent the relatively long-lived triplets of carbonyl compounds from participating in the secondary photoinitiation steps [<a href="#nt6.10">Note 6.10</a>]. Radical scavengers such as phenols, hydroquinones, and thiols can retard photodegradation by interfering with the propagation steps.</p>
<p class="indent">Deliberate incorporation of photoactive groups into a polymer can render it easily photodegradable, and thus confer environmentally desirable qualities. For example, copolymerization of ketonic species with hydrocarbons yields <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83 Applied photochemistry</a> light-sensitive polymers. Photodegradation of the resulting material does not seem to involve radical-mediated photooxidation, but rather Norrish Type II scission of the polymer chain</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Solar energy storage</h2>
<p class="noindent">Solar energy is the ultimate source of the fossil fuels used by Man. Photosynthesis fixes about 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>14</sup> kg of carbon annually, or around ten times our present energy needs. Nevertheless, plants are not directly very useful energy sources, except perhaps in the case of wood. Rather, it is the decomposition and transformation over geological time spans that yields gas, oil, and coal. The recognition that the Earth&#x2019;s reserves of these fuels is not unlimited has stimulated photochemists to see how solar radiation might be used artificially. Aspects of such endeavours include: (i) the storage of energy for later release, as heat, light, or electricity; (ii) the immediate production of electrical power; and (iii) the formation, photochemically or photoelectrochemically, of products that would otherwise require consumption of power from other sources (such as production of Cl<sub>2</sub> from the Cl<sup>-</sup> ion). In this section, we outline the principles underlying some of the purely photochemical methods being considered in the goal of solar energy conversion. Electrochemical methods are probably more promising commercially than the purely chemical ones, but are beyond the scope of this introductory text.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.11"/><b>6.11</b> Of possible consumable raw materials, water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen must be amongst the cheapest and most abundant. The real prize is the photochemical fission of water, because hydrogen is a fuel that can provide pollution-free combustion, as well as being a feedstock for electricity-generating fuel cells.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Certain features are common to all forms of photochemical solar energy utilization, and can conveniently be considered in their general forms here. It is apparent that any useful method of photochemical energy conversion must either use cheap and abundant raw materials [<a href="#nt6.11">Note 6.11</a>], perhaps to generate storable fuels, or must be capable of operating cyclically with regeneration of the energy-carrying material. The &#x2018;photochemical&#x2019; processes all naturally involve the generation of electronically excited states, and the objectives are to use those excited states to form products (including electrons and ions) that are energy rich with respect to the reactants. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, energy beyond the energetic threshold for formation of the required products is &#x2018;wasted&#x2019; since, in condensed-phase systems at least, excess energy will be degraded to heat in the absorbing medium. There is, however, another side to the question of excess energy. Whenever high-energy products are formed by an &#x2018;uphill&#x2019; process, they are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the starting materials. The products can be harvested only if there are kinetic constraints to the reverse reaction. Two obvious constraints are that the reverse (exothermic) reaction must have an appreciable activation barrier, <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84 Applied photochemistry</a> which implies that the forward reaction also has a barrier greater than the endothermicity of reaction, or that the products must move apart fast and far enough not to re-encounter each other before they can be utilized, a situation again implying an input of energy greater than the thermodynamic threshold value. Purely homogeneous systems are at a serious disadvantage in this respect, in that the newly formed products are likely to be trapped within a solvent cage. In heterogeneous systems (or microheterogeneous ones such as micelles), the possibility arises that the products can be kept far enough apart to prevent the back reaction. We shall, however, only examine photochemistry in homogeneous solutions to provide a guide to what might occur in the more complex cases.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.12"/><b>6.12</b> Absorption of light by one or other of the partners in a redox pair alters the redox potential because of the excitation of electrons. Excitation of the reducing partner makes electrons more readily accessible, and thus reduces the redox potential by an amount equivalent to the electronic excitation energy. Conversely, electronic excitation of the oxidizing partner increases the redox potential, because the electron hole left by the promoted electron makes the excited molecule a better electron acceptor (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A further critical factor in solar energy conversion is that the absorption spectrum must match the spectrum of the Sun&#x2019;s radiation incident on the Earth&#x2019;s surface. Optimum threshold absorption limits can be shown to lie in the range 1100-700 nm, with theoretical limiting thermodynamic efficiencies of around 30% for single-photon processes (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_75">p. 75</a>). It is worth pointing out that, although 700 nm is close to the threshold of absorption in green plants, the average efficiency of natural photosynthesis is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the thermodynamic limit.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct photolysis of water is not a candidate for solar energy conversion, since water does not absorb in the visible spectral region; fission to form H + OH as radical fragments has an energy threshold around &#x03BB; = 240 nm, and even at that wavelength absorption is weak. An ionic redox mechanism, on the other hand, requires the transfer of four electrons which corresponds to a wavelength per photon of roughly 1000 nm, in the near infrared. Such a multiphoton redox fission of water thus seems promising, and the question is how to make it occur. The reactions involved would formally be</p>

<p class="indent">One might imagine a redox pair that could oxidize water when unexcited, but that could reduce water when the reducing partner absorbed radiation [<a href="#nt6.12">Note 6.12</a>]. In an exactly similar way, a normally reducing pair might oxidize water on excitation of the oxidizing partner. These ideas are represented in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Unfortunately, real systems have yet to be found that operate quite so simply, and many ingenious indirect routes have been devised in order to overcome the various kinetic and energetic limitations. It has proved generally difficult to run both oxidation and reduction processes, reactions (6.3) and (6.4), with the same redox pair. Instead, many experiments have concentrated on one or other of the components, especially the less demanding reducing step. In that case, an external source of electrons must be found if the absorbing species is not to be consumed (i.e. if the redox system is to work catalytically). That source may be a chemical species that acts as a &#x2018;sacrificial donor&#x2019;. For the analogous photooxidation process, a sacrificial acceptor is <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85 Applied photochemistry</a> needed to remove electrons. Colloidal platinum can be used to trap electrons from one-electron reduced species, and so couple together the photochemistry and water reduction.

<h2 class="h2">6.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photochemistry in synthesis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Photochemistry has important applications in synthesis in the chemical industry. A very few examples must suffice here to show the types of compound to which photochemical routes are suited. The main advantage of photochemical reactions in synthesis is that highly specific reactions can be brought about by light, to give products that would be difficult or impossible to form using thermal reactions. In the laboratory, photochemical methods are much used in the formation of four-membered rings by [2 + 2] inter- and intra-molecular cycloaddition and by electrocyclic ring closure of conjugated dienes (see pages <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_26">26</a>-<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_27">27</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_30">30</a>-<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_31">31</a>). Photochemical techniques also offer a route to highly strained compounds whose thermodynamic instability disfavours thermal methods. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> will have indicated the scope of photochemistry for laboratory synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">We are more concerned here with the use of photochemistry in industrial synthesis. A photochemical process must obviously be superior in yield or purity of product in order for it to be competitive with alternative thermal methods. Reactions proceeding by a chain mechanism (often with radical chain carriers), in which the initiation step is photochemical, are particularly favourable candidates for industrial use. Indeed, we have already seen this application in connection with photopolymerization (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Section 6.5</a>). However, a photochemical reaction may even be economic if the quantum yield is low, so long as the chemical yield is higher than that available from thermal processes. In <i>fine</i> chemical manufacture, the use of light may represent only a small fraction of the total cost of the high-value product. Furthermore, the relatively small quantities of material involved mean that a batch process can often be used that is a scaled-up version of the laboratory method. Greater difficulties arise with the use of photochemistry in large-scale <i>heavy</i>-chemical <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86 Applied photochemistry</a> manufacture, because the energy cost may now be a substantial element in the cost of the final product.</p>
<p class="indent">Chain reactions play a part in one of the most important applications: the chlorination of hydrocarbons. The process is illustrated by the reactions shown in <a href="#nt6.14">Note 6.14</a>. Kinetic chain lengths (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.3">Section 4.3</a>) can be as large as 1000: i.e. the overall quantum yield is very large, so that a relatively small radiation source can be used for high outputs of chlorinated material. In alkylated aromatic systems (e.g. toluene), photochlorination allows substitution in the alkyl group to the exclusion of chlorination of the aromatic ring. With benzene itself, addition occurs, to make hexachlorocyclohexane. The &#x03B3;-isomer is a valuable biologically degradable insecticide, commonly known as gammexane or lindane.</p>

<p class="indent">One example often quoted of a large-scale process that is commercially successful in spite of having a quantum yield of less than unity is the photooximation of cyclohexane to yield &#x03B5;-caprolactam. Caprolactam is the cyclic amide that produces, by ring opening and addition, Nylon-6, which is a Nylon variant finding high-tonnage applications</p>
<figure class="fig1a">
<img src="../images/page86-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In the manufacture of caprolactam, nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) is the photochemically active species used. Visible radiation will bring about fission of the weak Cl-NO bond, and the subsequent reactions of Cl and NO fragments with cyclohexane lead to the formation of an oxime and finally caprolactam [<a href="#nt6.15">Note 6.15</a>]. Hydrogen chloride is added to the nitrosating gas, and the ratio of NOCl to HCl is critical in determining the yield of the desired product. The cost of manufacturing caprolactam photochemically from &#x2018;inert&#x2019; hydrocarbon compares favourably with that of producing the material by thermal reactions from starting materials such as phenol or toluene.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Applications of lasers</h2>
<p class="noindent">Laser radiation can have particular properties such as monochromaticity, intensity, and coherence, that were indicated in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.26">Note 1.26</a>. In suitable lasers, light pulses of very short duration can be generated. These special properties are valuable in a variety of applications, and some processes are only possible because of them. Examples of the uses of lasers range from laser welding to reading CD recordings, and from microsurgery to weapon aiming and <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87 Applied photochemistry</a> guidance. It might be expected that lasers would also find applications in photochemistry itself. It is certainly the case that laser techniques have vastly improved the detail of the way in which photochemical processes can be probed. Lasers can provide the requisite light sources for highly selective excitation of specific energy levels, and pulsed lasers give access to time-resolved information (via laser flash photolysis and similar techniques) that was hitherto inaccessible. Furthermore, lasers are also at the heart of several modern and sensitive techniques for probing the excited states and fragments produced in photochemistry. The selectivity may be at the level of individual quantum states (rotational, vibrational, electronic) for both pump and probe aspects of an experiment. These are uses of lasers in experiments designed to <i>understand</i> photochemistry. Lasers also have applications in commercial procedures based on photochemical <i>processes.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Lasers as light sources might be expected to find wide application in industrial synthesis. However, the high-power lasers needed are not yet available commercially, and laser methods are restricted in industry to selective separation of molecules at the atomic or molecular level. Photochemical separation of isotopes (mentioned on <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_37">p. 37</a> in connection with IRMPD) is one such use. Laser isotope separation depends on the shifts in the optical absorption spectrum resulting from isotopic substitution. The highly monochromatic radiation from a laser can be used to excite only those molecules containing a particular isotope. Some means is then provided of removing or harvesting the excited species. For example, <sup>35</sup>Cl and <sup>37</sup>Cl may be separated by exciting ICl with radiation from a dye laser and allowing the excited molecules to react with 1,2-dibromoethene. Some 1,2-dichloroethene is formed, the simplified scheme</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">indicating the nature of the interactions. If the laser is tuned to the absorption of I<sup>37</sup>Cl (&#x03B3;=605.4 nm), the resulting dichloroethene shows an enrichment in <sup>37</sup>Cl of nearly 20 over the natural isotopic abundance. A major stimulus to developing methods for laser isotope separation has been the need for the <sup>235</sup>U used in nuclear reactors. One enrichment scheme employs two-step photoionization of a molecular beam of uranium, in which the first laser selectively excites neutral U atoms, and the second photoionizes the excited (but not the ground state) uranium. The beam contains neutral molecules as well as ions, but the ions are preferentially of the 235-isotope. Electrostatic separation therefore enables the enriched sample to be collected.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Optical brighteners</h2>
<p class="noindent">Coloured fluorescent dyes and pigments find many non-scientific applications: they are used for the brilliant &#x2018;dayglo&#x2019; paints, for textile dyes, and to obtain special theatrical effects. No application is so widespread, however, as the use of special fluorescent substances as <i>optical brighteners</i> or <i>bleaches</i> in the <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88 Applied photochemistry</a> &#x2018;whiter-than-white&#x2019; washing powders. The principle behind the operation of an optical bleach is that the substance should absorb in the ultraviolet and radiate in the visible region, so that the washed (white) textile apparently reflects more light than was incident upon it. A related large-scale application is in the optical bleaching of paper.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt6.17"/><b>6.17</b> Cellulosic fibres are hydrophilic and swell in water so that the pores in the amorphous region grow to around 15-30 &#x00C5; in diameter, large enough to admit the brightener molecules. Brightening of hydrophobic fibres (e.g. nylon, polyester, and acetate) takes place in a manner similar to the dyeing of these fibres, possibly involving the penetration of the molecules into canals between the fibre molecules, or, alternatively, as a result of actual solution of brightener in the solid fibre. <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.3">Figure 6.3</a> shows some brighteners active for polyamide, polyester and acrylic fibres.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A substance that is to be suitable as an optical bleach must satisfy several stringent requirements. First, it must not absorb at all in the visible, since this would lead to coloration of the fabric, but must absorb strongly in the near ultraviolet, where there is still some intensity available from natural or artificial light sources. Secondly, the fluorescence must lie in the short-wavelength end of the visible spectrum, as otherwise the fluorescence would give an apparent undesirable yellowing to white fabric. Thirdly, the fluorescent substance must be photochemically stable, and it must not sensitize degradation or oxidation of the fibre material. Lastly, the substance must be soluble or dispersible in the aqueous detergent solution, but must be sufficiently strongly adsorbed by the textile fibres for an appreciable concentration to build up during washing and to remain after rinsing.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.10<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photomedicine</h2>
<p class="noindent">We conclude our survey of the applications of photochemistry with a very brief reminder that photochemistry has important uses in medicine. Ultraviolet radiation is employed in disinfection, sterilization, and the purification of water. Fluorescence is used diagnostically in dermatological and dental practice. Ultraviolet curing of dental resins was mentioned in <a href="#nt6.8">Note 6.8</a>, and lightweight orthopaedic casts based on photopolymerization have also been reported. <i>Phototherapy</i> is concerned with the treatment of disease. Minor skin ailments often respond well to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Psoriasis is a serious skin condition, and is treated by <i>photochemotherapy:</i> exposure to ultraviolet radiation is augmented by use of a photosensitizing drug, such as 8-methoxypsoralen, taken by the patient some hours before the exposure. Sometimes the ultimate effect of the ultraviolet radiation is experienced in parts of the body different from those exposed. The production of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> described briefly at the end of <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.7">Section 6.7</a> as an industrial synthesis, proceeds in the body in the same way, 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin being converted photochemically to the vitamin. Normally, exposure to sunlight produces sufficient vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, which is essential for healthy bone formation. In patients forced to remain indoors, supplementary exposure to artificial ultraviolet radiation may provide protection against the development of fragile bones and rickets. Several other examples of photochemotherapy have been described, and this rapidly developing field affords an excellent example of the chemical effects of light being harnessed to the benefit of Man, and also provides a suitably optimistic note on which to finish this introduction to the study of photochemistry.</p>
