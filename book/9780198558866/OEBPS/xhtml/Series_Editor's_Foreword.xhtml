<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Richard and Carol Wayne have produced an authoritative and beautifully written account of <i>Photochemistry</i> which covers both elementary and advanced aspects of the subject and which will be of lasting and broad value throughout any undergraduate&#x2019;s career. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
