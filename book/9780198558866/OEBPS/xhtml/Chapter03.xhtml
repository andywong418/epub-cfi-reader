<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Emission and loss processes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several of the pathways for loss of electronic excitation shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a> do not lead to any chemical change. Instead, the energy becomes used in a physical process such as the emission of light as <i>luminescence</i> (path (vi)), or becomes lost by <i>quenching (physical deactivation</i>, path (vii)). Alternatively, the excitation energy can populate a new level in the same or a different molecule by <i>intramolecular</i> or <i>intermolecular energy transfer</i> (path (v) or path (iv)); the new state or the new molecule excited by the energy transfer process can, of course, emit its own radiation. Luminescence, quenching, and the two types of energy transfer are important aspects of <i>photophysics</i>, and form the subject of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Luminescent emission provides some of the most reliable information about the nature of primary photochemical processes. Competition exists between emission and other fates of excited species (quenching, reaction, decomposition, etc.), and the dependence of emission intensity on temperature, reactant concentrations, and other experimental parameters, may yield valuable data about the nature and efficiencies of the various processes. In particular, quenching by bimolecular collisions, and unimolecular energy degradation by radiationless transitions, are almost always best studied in terms of their effect on the intensity of luminescence. As well as possessing this fundamental interest, luminescent phenomena are also of considerable importance in several commercial and scientific applications (see, for example, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.9">Section 6.9)</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.1"/><b>3.1</b> There are other means of producing electronic excitation, for instance by using heat or an electric field, that do not really fall within the scope of this book.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The individual luminescent phenomena are named according to the mode of excitation of the energy-rich species. Emission from species excited by absorption of radiation is referred to as <i>fluorescence</i> or <i>phosphorescence</i>. Emission following excitation by chemical reaction (of neutral or charged species) is <i>chemiluminescence</i>, and is described briefly in <a href="#sec_3.8">Section 3.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The two emission processes in which the ultimate source of excitation is absorption of radiation &#x2014; fluorescence and phosphorescence &#x2014; were originally distinguished in terms of whether or not there was an observable &#x2018;afterglow&#x2019;. That is, if emission of radiation continued after the exciting radiation was shut off, the emitting species was said to be phosphorescent, while if emission appeared to cease immediately, then the phenomenon was one of fluorescence. The essential problem is what is meant by &#x2018;immediately&#x2019; in this context, since the observation of an afterglow will obviously depend not only on the actual rate of decay of the emission, but also on the techniques used to observe it.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.2"/><b>3.2</b> &#x03C4; is very simply related to the Einstein <i>A</i>-factor for emission (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a> and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.9">Note 1.9</a>), since &#x03C4; = 1/<i>A</i>. It is also very closely related to the radiative <i>half-life</i> (the time taken for the intensity to decay one-half of its initial value), since the half-life is roughly equal to 0.69/<i>A</i>. These matters are discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">Section 4.4</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The decay of intensity of luminescent emission is characterized quantitatively by the radiative <i>lifetime</i> (&#x03C4;), which is the time taken for the intensity to decay to 1/e of its initial intensity immediately after the exciting radiation is shut off [<a href="#nt3.2">Note 3.2</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>]. Radiative lifetimes are usually measured in present-day experiments by exposing the luminescent sample to <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Photophysics</a> a brief flash of light (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.10">Section 1.10</a>) and then following the decay of intensity with fast electronics that can record the intensity on a time scale of nanoseconds or even less. However, in the 1930s, with less sophisticated instrumentation, a luminescence with a lifetime of less than about 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>s was thought to be short lived and, hence, fluorescent. In 1935, Jablonski suggested that phosphorescence was emission from some long-lived metastable electronic state lying lower in energy than the state populated by absorption of radiation (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.9">Section 1.9</a>). This long-lived metastable state is now known to be the first excited triplet in many cases where the ground state of a molecule is a singlet. The long lifetime of the emission is a direct consequence of the &#x2018;forbidden&#x2019; nature of a transition from a triplet to a singlet: that electric dipole transitions occur at all where &#x0394;S &#x2260; 0 is due to the inadequacy of S to describe a system in which there is spin&#x2013;orbit coupling (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.17">Note 1.17</a>). Extension of this idea to other systems, not necessarily triplet-singlet, in which &#x0394;S &#x2260; 0 leads to the useful definition of phosphorescence as a <i>radiative transition between states of different multiplicities</i>: fluorescence is then understood to be a radiative transition between states of the <i>same</i> multiplicity [<a href="#nt3.3">Note 3.3</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.3"/><b>3.3</b> The definitions of fluorescence and phosphorescence given in the text are used almost universally by organic photochemists, although they might be extended to include within the scope of phosphorescence those emission processes involving a transition forbidden by <i>any</i> selection rule rather than just the &#x0394;S &#x2260; 0 rule. Since the distinctions between allowed and forbidden transitions are not sharp, the definitions lack some precision. Typically, the <i>A</i> factor for emission of a fully allowed optical transition is 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> corresponding, very roughly, to radiative lifetimes (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.9">Notes 1.9</a>, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#nt3.2">3.2</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">Section 4.4</a>) of 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> to 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>s. Forbidden transitions, on the other hand, can have lifetimes associated with them of seconds or more.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.9">Section 1.9</a>, we mentioned that a Jablonski diagram could be used to indicate the electronic and vibrational energies of complex molecules. <a href="#fig3.1">Figure 3.1</a> is such a diagram. The S<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;, T<sub>1</sub>,&#x2026; notation is employed. Wavy lines on the diagram represent radiationless energy conversion [<a href="#nt3.5">Note 3.5</a>]: the vertical wavy lines within a particular electronic state indicate degradation of vibrational excitation (probably by a collisional, <i>inter</i>molecular process), while the horizontal wavy lines indicate intramolecular energy exchange. Electronic energy exchange permitted by the &#x0394;S = 0 rule and that forbidden by it are labelled IC and ISC respectively (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.9">Section 1.9</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.5"/><b>3.5</b> Both internal conversion and intersystem crossing are assumed to take place with no change in total (electronic+vibrational) energy, and the wavy lines are therefore horizontal on the diagram (i.e. no translational or rotational energy is released in an intramolecular electronic energy exchange).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Absorption of radiation in a singlet-triplet transition is weak, since it is forbidden in the same way as the triplet-singlet phosphorescent emission. It follows that excitation of phosphorescence by direct absorption of radiation is inefficient, and phosphorescence is much more usually the result of emission from a triplet populated by intersystem crossing from an excited singlet formed on absorption. The sequence of events is illustrated in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>. Absorption populates <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>1</mn><mtext>v</mtext></msubsup></mrow></math>; vibrational energy, at least in condensed phases, is rapidly degraded and <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> can then lose its energy by radiation, intersystem crossing (ISC) to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mn>1</mn><mtext>v</mtext></msubsup></mrow></math>, or internal conversion (IC) to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>0</mn><mtext>v</mtext></msubsup></mrow></math>. It is, perhaps, surprising that ISC to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mn>1</mn><mtext>v</mtext></msubsup></mrow></math>, which is spin forbidden, can compete effectively with spin-allowed fluorescence and IC to <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mtext>S</mtext><mn>0</mn><mtext>v</mtext></msubsup></mrow></math>; phosphorescence is, however, observed in many systems, suggesting that IC from <img src="../images/page41-1.jpg" alt="images"/> is relatively inefficient. A complete understanding of the photochemistry of a molecule really requires that the efficiencies (i.e. quantum yields) be known for all the processes occurring. Even if chemical reaction, decomposition, and physical quenching of an excited species do not occur, it is still necessary to measure quantum yields for fluorescence (&#x03D5;<sub>f</sub>), phosphorescence (&#x03D5;<sub>p</sub>), intersystem crossing <img src="../images/page41-2.jpg" alt="images"/> and internal conversion <img src="../images/page41-3.jpg" alt="images"/>.

<h3 class="h2">Quenching or collisional deactivation</h3>
<p class="noindent">In addition to loss by emission and intramolecular energy transfer (IC and ISC), excited states often suffer losses in quenching processes. Quenching is especially important in the liquid phase where collisions are very frequent. At low pressures in the gas phase, collisional processes may not be competitive with emission or energy transfer, and in solids collisions may be hindered by the rigidity of the structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Quenching is a particular case of energy transfer between an excited molecule, A&#x002A;, and a quenching species, usually represented as M</p>

<h3 class="h2">Intramolecular deactivation</h3>
<p class="noindent">It must be recognized that the radiationless intramolecular IC and ISC processes compete with emission of fluorescent or phosphorescent emission, just as the collisional processes do. Indeed, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of these processes, while it may be possible to remove the influence of bimolecular quenching. <a href="#eq3.1">Equation (3.1)</a> embodies the idea that the <i>total</i> quantum yield for all the processes will be unity in the absence of quenching. The individual quantum yields, &#x03D5;<sub>f</sub>, &#x03D5;<sub>p</sub>, &#x03D5;<sub>IC</sub>, and &#x03D5;<sub>ISC</sub> are the ratios of the numbers of molecules decaying by the particular channel to the total number of molecules that lose their electronic excitation (equal, of course, to <a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Photophysics</a>the total number of molecules excited). The IC and ISC processes, <img src="../images/page43-1.jpg" alt="images"/> and <img src="../images/page43-2.jpg" alt="images"/>, thus reduce the intensity (and quantum yield) of fluorescence, while ISC <img src="../images/page43-3.jpg" alt="images"/> reduces the intensity of phosphorescence directly and IC <img src="../images/page43-4.jpg" alt="images"/> reduces it indirectly (by decreasing the population of S<sub>1</sub> from which the emitting T<sub>1</sub> level is excited). Efficient fluorescence or phosphorescence thus depend on the depopulating IC and ISC channels not competing with the emission process. Efficient phosphorescence also requires ISC <img src="../images/page43-5.jpg" alt="images"/> to be fast, and the other ISC and IC channels to be slow. The relative probabilities (that is, the rates) of these various intramolecular energy transfer processes therefore determine whether or not a molecule is likely to emit, and if the emission is more likely to be fluorescence or phosphorescence. The factors that control the rates of IC and ISC are examined in <a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fluorescence</h2>
<p class="noindent">An electronically excited atom must lose its energy either by emission of radiation or by collisional deactivation: chemical decomposition is not possible, and neither is radiationless degradation, which would require an increase in translational energy. At low enough pressures, therefore, fluorescent emission is expected from all atoms. Many molecular species, however, either do not exhibit fluorescence or fluoresce only weakly even when bimolecular reaction or physical deactivation do not occur. Some general principles can suggest whether a polyatomic organic molecule is likely to be strongly fluorescent. First, absorption must occur at a wavelength long enough to ensure that chemical dissociation does not take place. Absorption to an unstable state is clearly very unlikely to result in fluorescence. Further, in many molecules in which the absorption corresponds to an energy greater than the cleavage energy of the least stable bond, no fluorescence is observed. Secondly, intramolecular energy transfer must be relatively slow compared to the rate of radiation. This appears to mean that ISC from <img src="../images/page43-6.jpg" alt="images"/> must be slow (we have mentioned on <a href="#page_41">p. 41</a> and shall discuss later in this section the inefficiency of the IC <img src="../images/page43-7.jpg" alt="images"/> process). Geometrical factors such as rigidity and planarity can also affect the efficiency of fluorescence (see <a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.7"/><b>3.7</b> In <a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a> we shall see that ISC is normally slower for <img src="../images/page43-8.jpg" alt="images"/> states than for ISC involving (n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) states, and that the efficiency of the process increases as the energy separation of S<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> decreases. Simpler carbonyl compounds, in which the longest absorption corresponds to an n&#x2192;&#x03C0;&#x002A; transition, are rarely fluorescent (but often phosphorescent) while aromatic hydrocarbons (&#x03C0;&#x2192;&#x03C0;&#x002A; absorption) are frequently fluorescent. Increasing conjugation in hydrocarbons shifts the first (&#x03C0;&#x2192;&#x03C0;&#x002A;) absorption maximum towards longer wavelengths, and thus increases the probability of fluorescence rather than decomposition. High ring density of the &#x03C0; electrons also seems important for high fluorescence yields.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">There are two different types of spectrum discussed in connection with luminescence phenomena: the <i>excitation spectrum</i> and the <i>emission spectrum</i>. The first is obtained by measuring the intensity of the emission (which may or may not be spectrally resolved) as the excitation wavelength is altered, for example by scanning a monochromator. The emission spectrum is obtained by measuring the emission intensity as a function of wavelength for excitation at a fixed wavelength.</p>
<p class="indent">The detailed nature of the fluorescence emission spectrum is determined in part by whether the fluorescence is excited in a condensed-phase sample or in a gas, and, if in a gas, the pressure. The general ideas can be explained with reference to simple energy diagrams (<a href="#fig3.3">Figs 3.3 (a)</a>&#x2013;<a href="#fig3.3">(d)</a> on the next page) showing schematically two electronic energy states and some vibrational levels associated with them.</p>
<a id="page_44" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 44, Photophysics</a>
<p class="indent">The simplest type of fluorescence is <i>resonance fluorescence</i>, in which the radiation emitted is of the same wavelength as the exciting radiation. Resonance fluorescence is observed only in the gas phase at low pressures, and only with atoms or simple molecules. Absorption of monochromatic light, of wavelength corresponding to a specific vibrational transition (&#x028B;&#x2032;, 0) populates exclusively the &#x028B;&#x2032; level of the upper state and radiation from that state gives rise to the resonance fluorescence (see <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3 (a)</a>). Transitions also occur from &#x028B;&#x2032; to &#x028B;&#x2033; levels higher than zero, so that a progression of bands is observed at wavelengths longer than the exciting wavelength, in accordance with an empirical observation of Stokes: the lines are called <i>Stokes lines</i> [<a href="#nt3.8">Note 3.8</a>]. Irradiation by polychromatic light can obviously excite many &#x028B;&#x2032; levels, and fluorescent emission can then be observed from all these different levels.</p>

<p class="indent">Stepwise collisional relaxation of vibrational excitation is a relatively efficient process, requiring in the region of 1&#x2013;100 collisions for many quenching gases. Resonance fluorescence is not expected, therefore, at pressures at which the kinetic collision frequency greatly exceeds the spontaneous emission rate, and, for <i>A</i> &#x007E; 10<sup>8</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, observation of resonance emission is confined to pressures at least below about 1 mmHg (and less, if <i>A</i> is smaller than 10<sup>8</sup> S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Lower vibrational levels of the upper electronic state are populated from the &#x028B;&#x2032; level produced on absorption, and at moderate pressures, at which emission and vibrational quenching still compete, emission may be observed from all vibrational levels in the upper state up to &#x028B;&#x2032; (see <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3 (c)</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">At higher gas pressures, at which the collision rate greatly exceeds the rate of emission, vibrational relaxation is essentially complete, and no fluorescence is observed from &#x028B;&#x2032;&#x003E;0 (see <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3 (d)</a>). Vibrational relaxation is extremely probable in solution, and fluorescence from vibrationally excited levels is never observed in the liquid phase. Furthermore, neither the fluorescence spectrum nor deactivation rates are affected by changes in exciting wavelength so long as it lies within the absorption bands.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.8"/><b>3.8</b> <i>Anti-Stokes lines</i>, much weaker than Stokes lines, are observed at shorter wavelengths than the exciting wavelength, and result from absorption from &#x028B;&#x2033;&#x003E;0 and fluorescence to lower &#x028B;&#x2033; levels (see <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3 (b)</a>): thermal populations of &#x028B;&#x2033;&#x003E;0 are small and the anti-Stokes lines are correspondingly weak.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The intensity of each vibrational emission band depends, in the same way as absorption intensities, on the operation of the Franck&#x2013;Condon principle. The (0,0) band is the most intense for many organic molecules, and the maxima of intensity both in absorption and in emission therefore correspond to the same transition. This observation suggests that upper and lower electronic states of such molecules must be of similar size and shape, and it is likely that the vibrational <i>spacings</i> will be the same in both states. In contrast, simple diatomic species frequently have greatly different internuclear separations in ground and excited states. <a href="#fig3.4">Figure 3.4</a> (<a href="#page_45">p. 45</a>) indicates transitions in absorption and emission for two electronic states with similar vibrational spacings. <a href="#fig3.5">Figure 3.5</a> (<a href="#page_45">p. 45</a>) shows emission and absorption spectra of a solution of anthracene in benzene. The two spectra are almost mirror images of each other on the wavenumber (i.e. energy) scale employed. Because the vibrational spacings are similar (see <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>), the (0,1) emission band will lie at the same energy below the (0,0) band as the (1,0) absorption band lies above it, and <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Photophysics</a>so on. This mirror-image relationship is of frequent occurrence in the fluorescence of organic substances, and assumption of its existence is sometimes useful in sorting out overlapping emission spectra.</p>
<p class="indent">Organic fluorescence usually originates from the <i>lowest excited singlet</i> level, even though absorption may initially populate a higher singlet (e.g. S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>, &#x2026; S<sub>n</sub>). Rapid internal conversion occurs from S<sub>n</sub> to <i></i>S<sub>1</sub>, followed by vibrational degradation. This behaviour is encapsulated in <i>Kasha&#x2019;s rule</i>, which states that <i>the emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity</i>. One organic compound whose fluorescence is an exception to this rule is azulene, and many thioketones (RR&#x2032;C=S) behave in a similar manner (see <a href="#nt3.16">Note 3.16</a> for an explanation).</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Phosphorescence</h2>
<p class="noindent">As explained in <a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>, phosphorescence is luminescence of a forbidden emission, and for most organic molecules with singlet ground states, this emitting species is a triplet. Because of the long radiative lifetime of phosphorescent transitions, collisional deactivation of the triplet competes effectively with radiation, and visible phosphorescence is not normally observed unless the collisional deactivation rate is sufficiently reduced. In rigid media, species are unable to diffuse towards each other, and bimolecular deactivation is slow. The earliest investigations of phosphorescence employed solutions of dyes in gelatin, and subsequently in boric acid glass at room temperature. More satisfactory rigid media are now used: mixtures of ether, isopentane, and ethanol (EPA) frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) are frequently employed, and thin films of various plastics are becoming popular as rigid matrices. The highest purity of the solvents is necessary to avoid swamping the phosphorescence of the solute by luminescence of the impurities.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.9"/><b>3.9</b> The spacing of emission bands indicates the vibrational levels in the ground electronic state, while the spacing of absorption bands depends on vibrational spacing in the upper state. See <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a> for an explanation.</p>

</aside>
<a id="page_46" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 46, Photophysics</a>
<p class="indent">Although the first observations of phosphorescence were confined to rigid glasses, it was soon appreciated that phosphorescence could appear in other phases. Emission from biacetyl vapour is one of the best-known examples of gas-phase phosphorescence. Fluid solutions of species that are phosphorescent in low-temperature glasses also generally show emission, so long as the radiationless transitions from T<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>0</sub> do not show an increased rate at the higher temperatures. It is, of course, essential that the solvent does not deactivate the triplet, and that quenching impurities are rigorously excluded. Residual impurities may still make the emission intensity weak, and artificially reduce the luminescence lifetime. Perfluoroalkanes make suitable solvents for the study of phosphorescence at room temperature.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.11"/><b>3.11</b> There is direct evidence that the emitting state in phosphorescence is a triplet. Flash photolysis (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.10">Section 1.10</a>) can be used to produce high transient concentrations of triplet species: kinetic spectroscopy of absorption to a higher triplet permits the build-up and decay of the triplet level to be followed. The decay rates for the triplets and the phosphorescence are identical, confirming the connection between the two. Similar results are obtained from observations of triplets using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Absorption leading to direct population of an excited triplet state from the singlet ground state is weak because the transition is forbidden. However, in some cases it has proved possible to excite phosphorescence by irradiation with light absorbed in the T<sub>1</sub> &#x2190; S<sub>0</sub> system. Just as with fluorescence, there is often a mirror-image relationship between absorption and phosphorescence spectra. It would appear, therefore, that in relatively large organic molecules the vibrational spacings are nearly identical in all three lowest states (S<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, and S<sub>1</sub>. The (0,0) separations in the T<sub>1</sub> &#x2190; S<sub>0</sub> absorption and emission spectra are, however, relatively large (&#x007E; 500 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) as a result of slight conformational differences between ground and excited states. Hence, triplet energies based solely on the position of the (0,0) band in emission may not represent faithfully the energetics of an absorbing system. Good absorption spectra of T<sub>1</sub>&#x2190;S<sub>0</sub> transitions are difficult to obtain by ordinary techniques, but the weakness of the absorption makes it possible to use the <i>phosphorescence excitation spectrum</i> to determine the absorption spectrum (this is <i>spectrophosphorimetry</i>, which is the analogue of spectrofluorimetry discussed at the end of <a href="#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Phosphorescence most commonly follows population of T<sub>1</sub> via intersystem crossing from S<sub>1</sub>, itself excited by absorption of light. The T<sub>1</sub> state is usually of lower energy than S<sub>1</sub>, and the long-lived (phosphorescent) emission is almost always of longer wavelength than the short-lived (fluorescent) emission. The relative importance of fluorescence and phosphorescence depends on the rates of radiation and intersystem crossing from S<sub>1</sub>; the absolute quantum yields depend also on intermolecular and intramolecular energy-loss processes, and not only collisional quenching of T<sub>1</sub> but also intersystem crossing to S<sub>0</sub> are in competition with phosphorescent emission.</p>
<p class="indent">We must now give some consideration to the nature of triplet&#x2013;singlet processes, both radiative and non-radiative, which are formally spin forbidden.

Thus, transitions between triplet and singlet states can take place if the triplet has some singlet character, or vice versa. In organic molecules some &#x2018;mixing&#x2019; of singlet and triplet states takes place as a result of a small amount of spin&#x2013;orbit interaction. The relative probability of triplet&#x2013;singlet transitions from (n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) and (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) states is explained in <a href="#nt3.12">Note 3.12</a>.

<p class="noindent">The rate of these transitions may be perturbed by the external environment. Such an influence is seen in the effects of the addition of paramagnetic molecules to the solvent [<a href="#nt3.13">Note 3.13</a>]. Heavy atoms in an environment also increase the probability of S&#x2194;T radiative and radiationless transitions by inducing appreciable spin&#x2013;orbit coupling in the solute [<a href="#nt3.14">Note 3.14</a>].</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Intra</i>molecular perturbation of transition probabilities is also important.

<p class="indent">Strong intramolecular perturbations may also arise when certain metal ions are chelated to an organic molecule. It is interesting that the natural porphyrins chlorophyll and haemin display markedly different photochemical behaviour, despite the similarities in their structures: chlorophyll has diamagnetic magnesium as its central ion, while haemin has paramagnetic iron (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a> for the structure of chlorophyll).</p>

<h3 class="h2">Vibrational Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">The probability for energy transfer can be shown experimentally to be some inverse function of the energy gap between the two states for a given type of electronic transition. This result can be understood in terms of the operation of the Franck-Condon principle in radiationless transitions. As explained in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.9">Section 1.9</a>, in the radiationless case the principle demands that the transition <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Photophysics</a>is &#x2018;horizontal&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;vertical&#x2019;, so that it is confined to a very small region of a potential energy curve or surface. For a given probability of electronic transition, the overlap in the region between the vibrational probability functions for starting and finishing states will then determine the efficiency of energy transfer. <a href="#fig3.6">Figure 3.6</a> extends <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> by illustrating three possibilities: the curves given may be regarded as potential energy curves for diatomic molecules, or as cross-sections through surfaces for more complex species. In <a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6(a)</a>, the two states, A and B, are of similar geometry, but of widely different energy. The lowest vibrational level, &#x028B;&#x2032; = 0, in B has the same total energy as high &#x028B;&#x2033; in A. Because of the nature of the vibrational probability distributions, the overlap is small. In <a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6(b)</a>, however, the energy gap is much smaller, and the difference in vibrational quantum numbers &#x028B;&#x2032; and &#x028B;&#x2033; is also smaller, with the result that there is far greater vibrational overlap. Thus, the efficiency of crossing will increase as &#x028B;&#x2033;&#x2192;0; i.e. crossing to a state will be favoured if the state can be populated near &#x028B;&#x2033; = 0, which means that the <i>electronic</i> energy gap itself must be small. Only if the geometries of A and B are different, as in <a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6(c)</a>, can there be rapid radiationless conversion between two states of widely separated electronic energies. In general, energy separations lie in the order (S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;S<sub>0</sub>)&#x003E;(T<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;S<sub>0</sub>)&#x003E;(S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>1</sub>), and the rate constants usually lie in the reverse order, even though the second two processes are formally spin forbidden. Molecular rigidity favours efficient fluorescence of a species (see <a href="#page_43">p. 43</a>). Without that rigidity, changes in geometry may occur, and <img src="../images/page48-1.jpg" alt="images"/> IC <i>can</i> depopulate S<sub>1</sub>. The sum of &#x03D5;<sub>f</sub> and &#x03D5;<sub>ISC</sub> is often close to unity, so that the quantum yield for internal conversion, &#x03D5;<sub>IC</sub> = 1 &#x2212;(&#x03D5;<sub>f</sub>+&#x03D5;<sub>ISC</sub>), must be zero within experimental error. The observation made in <a href="#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a> that organic fluorescence usually originates from S<sub>1</sub> rather than from higher singlets (S<sub>n</sub>) is explained by the size of the S<sub>n</sub>&#x2212;S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;S<sub>0</sub> energy gaps. The former gap is much smaller, so that the <img src="../images/page48-2.jpg" alt="images"/> IC process is much faster than <img src="../images/page48-3.jpg" alt="images"/>, and S<sub>n</sub> will not survive to emit radiation [see <a href="#nt3.16">Note 3.16</a> on <a href="#page_49">p. 49</a>].</p>

<p class="indent">The same arguments apply to the rate of the <img src="../images/page48-5.jpg" alt="images"/> (ISC) process. As a general rule, the larger the molecule, the smaller &#x0394;<i>E</i>(T<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;S<sub>0</sub>), and &#x03D5;<sub>p</sub> is correspondingly low in large molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">The differences in the photochemistry of species whose absorption system is predominantly &#x03C0;&#x2212;&#x03C0;&#x002A; or n-&#x03C0;&#x002A; are at least in part a result of the increased likelihood of <img src="../images/page48-6.jpg" alt="images"/> ISC for S<sub>1</sub> = <sup>1</sup>(n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;). Three factors work towards this increased likelihood of radiationless transition for <sup>1</sup>(n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) states. First, both radiative and radiationless transitions to the S<sub>0</sub> ground state are partially forbidden, so that the <sup>1</sup>(n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) state survives longer than a <sup>1</sup>(&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) state and has more chance of undergoing ISC to T<sub>1</sub>. Secondly, T<sub>1</sub> <i>may</i> be <sup>3</sup>(&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;), to which ISC from <sup>1</sup>(n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) is favoured [<a href="#nt3.12">Note 3.12</a>]. Thirdly, the energy gap, &#x0394;<i>E</i>(S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>1</sub>) is often small compared to the gap from <sup>1</sup>(&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) states [<a href="#nt3.17">Note 3.17</a>, <a href="#page_49">p. 49</a>]. In many carbonyl compounds, phosphorescence is strong, and fluorescence is weak or non-existent (typically &#x03D5;<sub>p</sub>/&#x03D5;<sub>f</sub> &#x003E; 1000) because of efficient crossing from S<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>1</sub>, a fairly large fraction of the molecules reaching T<sub>1</sub> phosphoresce, the magnitude of the T<sub>1</sub>&#x2192;S<sub>0</sub> gap partly determining the rate of radiationless, <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Photophysics</a><img src="../images/page49-1.jpg" alt="images"/>ISC, decay. In hydrocarbons, S<sub>1</sub> is likely to be <sup>1</sup>(&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;), so that the transition to <sup>3</sup>(&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) is strongly forbidden. Furthermore, &#x0394;<i>E</i>(S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>1</sub>) is large. The two factors together make <img src="../images/page49-2.jpg" alt="images"/> ISC less probable, and fluorescence becomes important in such hydrocarbons.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Intermolecular energy transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent"><i>Inter</i>molecular exchange of energy between two discrete partners is another important photochemical step. The &#x2018;acceptor&#x2019; (A), which receives excitation from the &#x2018;donor&#x2019; (D), then participates in those processes open to it as an electronically excited species. <i>Photosensitized</i> phenomena, such as sensitized reactions (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.6">Section 2.6</a>) and sensitized fluorescence or phosphorescence (see <a href="#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>), in which the change of interest occurs in a species other than the one that absorbed radiation, are believed to be of great significance in photobiology; they also provide valuable insights into photophysical processes.</p>
<p class="indent">Exchange of energy between two different species is not so restricted with regard to exact equivalence of internal energy between initial and final states as in the case of intramolecular exchange, since any energy excess can be taken up by translation (or, more rarely, a deficiency can be supplied by the kinetic energy of collision). Energy exchange can take place between electronic, vibrational, rotational, and translational energy modes; except in the rare case of exact energy resonance between the internal modes, some energy is always converted to or from translation. We have already given implicit consideration to the degradation of electronic excitation to vibration, rotation or translation, in our discussion of physical quenching of luminescence. Much of the following discussion will, however, be directed towards electronic-electronic energy exchange, and it will be assumed that <i>excess</i> energy goes into other modes of excitation. Where the absorption spectrum of the acceptor overlaps the emission spectrum of the donor, there are, of course, quantized vibronic levels of A and D for which energy exchange is isoenergetic, and no change in translational energy is needed.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.17"/><b>3.17</b> The splitting for singlet to triplet (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) is often from about 10,000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 20,000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, while that for (n, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) states is usually only 1,500 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 5,000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Several different mechanisms of electronic energy transfer are believed to operate under different circumstances. They include: (i) collisional &#x2018;short-range&#x2019; transfer; (ii) coulombic &#x2018;long-range&#x2019; transfer; (iii) radiative transfer, and (iv) exciton migration. We shall discuss only the first two mechanisms, as they are the most important in solution-phase photochemistry.</p>
<h3 class="h2">Short-range, collisional, energy transfer</h3>
<p class="noindent">&#x2018;Short-range&#x2019; energy transfer arising from <i>exchange interaction</i> occurs over intermolecular or interatomic distances (henceforth referred to as r) not much exceeding the collision diameter; the interaction decreases in a complex fashion with <i>r</i> raised to a high power.</p>
<p class="indent">Energy transfer by exchange interaction may be thought of as a special kind of chemical reaction in which the chemical identity of the partners A and D does not change, but in which excitation is transferred from one to the <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Photophysics</a>other. The transition state is then expected to possess a separation between A and D not greatly different from the sum of the gas-kinetic collision radii, and energy transfer by the exchange mechanism is probably important only for values of <i>r</i> of this order. In common with other chemical processes, energy transfer can be efficient only if the process is adiabatic (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_19">p. 19</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#nt2.32">Note 2.32</a>). Most chemical reactions involving ground-state partners can occur adiabatically, but in processes such as energy exchange, where several electronic states are involved, the requirement for adiabatic reaction may impose some restrictions on the possible states for A, A&#x002A; and D, D&#x002A; if there is to be efficient transfer of excitation. In atoms or small molecules there must be correlation of electron spin, orbital momentum, parity, and so on. However, correlation in complex molecules of low symmetry usually only involves the electron spin. To test for correlation, the possible total spin(s) of the transition state is calculated from the individual spins of the reactants by the addition of the quantum vectors (for example, S<sub>1</sub> = 1 adds to S<sub>2</sub> = 1 to give the resultant S<sub>T</sub> = 2, 1 or 0). It is then necessary to see if the product pair is also able to give one (or more) transition state(s) of the same spin as the transition state(s) reached from the reactants. <a href="#nt3.18">Note 3.18</a> shows multiplicities in the transition state that can arise from some multiplicities of two separated species. Thus we can see, by use of the table, that all of the processes</p>

So long as the reaction is exothermic, energy transfer is fast (it approaches the diffusion-controlled limit: see <a href="#nt3.6">Note 3.6</a>), but when the reaction becomes endothermic, the rate rapidly drops off [<a href="#nt3.20">Note 3.20</a>, <a href="#page_51">p. 51</a>].

<p class="noindent">For many energy transfer processes, the interaction takes place when the partners are separated by more than the sum of the gas-kinetic collision radii [<a href="#nt3.21">Note 3.21</a>]. &#x2018;Long-range&#x2019; transfer occurs by a direct mechanism involving electrical, or coulombic, interactions between transition dipoles [<a href="#nt3.22">Note 3.22</a>]. These dipoles are the ones involved in optical interactions with the electric vector of radiation: the usual optical selection rules apply to both the transitions D&#x002A;&#x2192;D and A&#x2192;;A&#x002A;. Higher multipoles can also interact, but dipole-dipole interactions are stronger than dipole&#x2013;quadrupole interactions, and so on. The measured rate constants for transfer of excitation by the coulombic mechanism may greatly exceed the diffusion-limited rate constant, and not depend on solvent viscosity. This behaviour contrasts markedly with that observed for short-range transfer. (Note that <i>k</i><sub>diff</sub> is dependent on viscosity, as indicated by <a href="#nt3.6">Note 3.6</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">The efficiency of energy transfer occurring by the exchange interaction mechanism is related to whether the process can take place adiabatically, but <i>not</i> to whether optical selection rules permit radiative transitions in both donor and acceptor independently; this behaviour is one way in which exchange interaction and long-range coulombic interaction may be distinguished. For example, in the exchange interaction excitation of triplet states by triplet benzophenone, the efficiency of energy transfer is roughly the same both for naphthalene and for 1-iodonaphthalene. We saw on <a href="#page_47">p. 47</a> that the T<sub>1</sub>&#x2192;S<sub>0</sub> radiative transition is more probable by a factor of nearly 10<sup>4</sup> in the substituted molecule, so that, in this case, the optical transition probability in the naphthalene molecule does not seem to affect the probability of energy transfer to it.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1922 Franck predicted that electronic excitation could be exchanged between atoms, and Cario and Franck subsequently demonstrated <i>sensitized fluorescence</i> in a mixture of mercury and thallium vapours. The mixture was irradiated with the &#x03BB; = 253.7 nm resonance line of mercury [<a href="#nt3.23">Note 3.23</a>], to which thallium vapour is transparent, and emission was observed from the thallium.

However, spin-orbit coupling is strong in Hg, so that the <img src="../images/page52-5.jpg" alt="images"/> transition (&#x03BB; = 253.7nm) is intense; it is thus common practice to refer to this line as the resonance one.</p>

<p class="indent">Energy may sometimes be transferred from an excited species to an acceptor that is already excited, thus raising the acceptor to a higher electronic state; the process is referred to as energy-pooling. Molecular energy-pooling has been established in many systems. Triplet-triplet pooling to give an excited singlet state is most common, partly because the relatively long lifetime of excited triplets favours the rare triplet-triplet bimolecular process. The reaction</p>

Triplet-annihilation delayed fluorescence is sometimes known as <i>P-type delayed fluorescence</i> because it is observed in solutions of pyrene [<a href="#nt3.24">Note 3.24</a>].</p>

Excimers will be discussed further in <a href="#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another mechanism for generating long-lived fluorescent emission is <i>E-type delayed fluorescence</i>, named after the dye eosin. E-type delayed fluorescence shows spectral features characteristic of the normal, short-lived, fluorescence. However, the emission decays at the same rate as phosphorescence; further, no emission is observed at low temperatures, and there is an activation energy for the process. This kind of delayed fluorescence arises from thermal activation of S<sub>1</sub> from T<sub>1</sub>(&#x03C5; = 0); the rate of activation is slow compared to the rate of loss of either T<sub>1</sub> or S<sub>1</sub> so that the decay of delayed fluorescence is determined by the decay of T<sub>1</sub>. <a href="#fig3.7">Figure 3.7</a> illustrates this excitation mechanism. The activation energy for the emission (calculated from the temperature dependence of intensity) should be identical to &#x0394;E(S<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>1</sub>) (obtained spectroscopically) and, for many molecules, a remarkable agreement is indeed observed.</p>
<p class="indent">The P-type delayed fluorescence displayed by anthracene does not show the same dependence on temperature as the thermally activated E-type delayed fluorescence, and it may be distinguished from it by this means. A better diagnostic feature is the relation between the emitted and absorbed intensities, which is linear in E-type delayed fluorescence, but squared in the triplet-annihilation process. In addition, E-type delayed fluorescence has the same decay lifetime as that of the triplet-singlet phosphorescence in the same solution; delayed fluorescence excited by the triplet-annihilation mechanism should have a lifetime of about one-half of that of the phosphorescence, because of the second-order dependence on triplet concentration.</p>

<p class="noindent">Emission from electronically excited species forms the basis for an important class of light sources, that of lasers. The properties of laser radiation have been referred to in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.26">Note 1.26</a>. The term laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, and, as the name suggests, the operation of a laser depends upon the net production of stimulated emission (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>). Absorption and stimulated emission both necessarily take place in systems containing electronic levels between which transitions occur, the rates of each process being determined by the population of the lower (absorption) or upper (emission) levels. <i>Net</i> emission (the difference between stimulated emission and absorption), and thus amplification of light, can only be achieved if there are more species in the upper state than in the lower state, a situation described as a <i>population inversion.</i></p>

<p class="indent">To understand the principles of laser action, it is helpful to consider a typical laser set-up. The essential features of one type of laser system are shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>. The species with the inverted population (the <i>lasing</i> <a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Photophysics</a> <i>medium</i>) is contained within a cylindrical tube with a mirror at each end. One of these mirrors is totally reflecting, whilst the other is partially transmitting to enable some of the light produced to be harvested. The laser cavity is made to be resonant at the wavelength of the radiation, so that as the radiation traverses the medium the intensity increases through constructive interference. In the excited system, some of the excited species will lose their energy by spontaneous emission. The photons produced in this way can then interact with further excited species to stimulate the emission of more photons, and so on, thus greatly amplifying the radiation; spontaneous emission <i>seeds</i> the process of stimulated emission. The light amplification can continue until the population inversion is destroyed, so that the light is produced in <i>pulses</i> as population inversions are created and destroyed. Lasers in which the population inversion is maintained, by constantly replenishing the supply of excited species, are called <i>continuous-wave (CW)</i> lasers.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">There are various approaches that may be adopted to achieve the population inversion necessary for laser action. Many of these rely upon the intra- and inter-molecular energy transfer processes that were introduced in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> and are discussed further in this chapter. Thermal excitation cannot, by definition, lead to inversion in an equilibrated system. Nor can direct absorption of light give an inversion in a simple system consisting of two levels, because the incident (&#x2018;pumping&#x2019;) radiation will not only excite the lower state to the upper, but also promote stimulated radiation from the upper state to depopulate it. Population inversion, and hence laser action, can, however, be achieved when three or more energy levels are involved. <a href="#fig3.9">Figure 3.9</a> (a) shows a <i>three-level</i> system; one of the first lasers developed, the ruby laser, operates on such a mechanism. The third level, B, is populated by radiationless transition from the state initially populated by absorption (C). As long as this transition is rapid, and the radiative transition from B to X is relatively slow, a population inversion can be built up. Even so, more than 50% of the ground-state species must have been removed by pumping in order to achieve a population inversion. A potentially more efficient laser system uses four levels (<a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9 (b)</a>); neodymium-based lasers, for example, use this system. As soon as state B is populated, there is an inversion with respect to level A, which is initially not populated at all. CW, as opposed to pulsed, operation requires, of course, that the level A is rapidly depopulated.</p>
<p class="indent">Organic dye lasers are effectively four level devices: although there may only be two electronic levels involved, the system makes use of the vibrational sub-levels and can therefore be thought of as using four levels (<a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9 (c)</a>). As the dyes are usually in solution, collisional quenching is sufficient to maintain the population inversion. The lasers are tunable as a result of using systems which exhibit broad-band absorption and emission characteristics, from which the desired frequency may be selected (using, for example, a diffraction grating).</p>
<p class="indent">Gas-phase lasers often use electrical excitation to obtain the population inversions: collisions with energetic electrons can excite (and ionize) chemical species. Optical selection rules do not necessarily apply, so that forbidden <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Photophysics</a>metastable states may become accessible. Important examples include the argon-ion and nitrogen lasers. It is also possible to use intermolecular energy transfer to generate a population inversion in a species other than the one first excited, and examples include the helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers. Finally, another class of gas-phase laser is the <i>excimer (exciplex)</i> laser mentioned in connection with <a href="#sec_3.9">Section 3.9</a> (see <a href="#nt3.27">Note 3.27</a>, <a href="#page_57">p. 57</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Chemiluminescence in the firefly system is remarkably efficient, the overall quantum yield for emission approaching unity.

<p class="indent">One of the most efficient man-made chemiluminescent systems discovered so far is based on aromatic esters of oxalic acid (ethanedioic acid). Hydrogen peroxide decomposes the ester catalytically, and an energy-rich intermediate in the decomposition can transfer energy to a fluorescer present in the mixture. The ester CPPO (bis(carbopentoxy-3,5,6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate) is a typical example of the starting material (see <a href="#nt3.25">Note 3.25</a>). Quantum yields reach values as high as 0.32, and the spectral characteristics can be selected by suitable choice of the fluorescer. Good fluorescers include 9,10-diphenylanthracene (blue), bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (green), and rubrene (red). The commercial CYALUME&#x00AE; lightsticks use the oxalate system, the solution of oxalate ester and fluorescer being contained in an outer plastic tube, and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in an inner breakable glass tube.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">Chemiluminescence is of great value in analysis, partly because very low levels of emitted light may be detected (as low as a few photons per second).

<h2 class="h2">3.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Excimers and exciplexes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The theme of this chapter has been how intramolecular and intermolecular processes involving excited species can affect the emission of light as a result of the exchange of energy. Another important type of interaction is the formation of relatively long-lived molecular complexes of excited species. Studies of emission provide much information about complex formation, and it is appropriate to introduce the concepts here, although it should be recognized that other aspects of photochemistry may be influenced as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Many molecules that do not interact significantly in their ground states appear to form reasonably stable complexes when excited. The complexes are called <i>excimers</i> or <i>exciplexes</i>, words derived from excited dimer and excited complex. An excimer is produced by the interaction of an excited molecule with a ground-state molecule of the same chemical identity, while an exciplex involves interaction with a chemically different species. Excimers and exciplexes have a fixed and simple stoicheiometric composition, usually 1:1.</p>
<a id="page_57" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 57, Photophysics</a>
<p class="indent"><i>Excimers</i> were first recognized by the effect of increasing concentration on the fluorescence of some solutes. The intensity of the normal fluorescence decreases, while a new band at longer wavelengths appears, the intensity of which increases with increasing concentration. Some aromatic hydrocarbons such as pyrene show this behaviour particularly clearly. Pyrene itself has a violet fluorescence when it is in dilute solution, which is replaced by a structureless blue emission at high concentrations. An excimer is formed between an excited singlet pyrene and ground-state pyrene, and it is the excimer that radiates. If pyrene is represented as P, the excitation scheme is</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt3.27"/><b>3.27</b> The phenomena described here provide the route to another way of achieving population inversion in an important class of laser (see <a href="#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a>), the <i>excimer laser</i> (although exciplexes are really involved). The lifetime of the ground-state exciplex or excimer is around one vibrational period and its population is negligible. Formation of the excited-state complex necessarily gives it a population greater than that of the hypothetical ground state, and laser operation is possible. Important practical examples include noble gas-halogen systems such as ArF and XeCl.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq3.26-3.29">
<img src="../images/page57-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The emission from the excimer is initially to a P(S<sub>0</sub>):P(S<sub>0</sub>) pair possessing the same geometry as the excimer, but, since there is no attraction between the ground-state molecules, it has the same energy as isolated P(S<sub>0</sub>) molecules, and immediately separates. The excimer, on the other hand, <i>is</i> stabilized with respect to an isolated P(S<sub>1</sub>) molecule, so that the emission from the excimer lies at longer wavelengths than the normal fluorescence. Excimer emission is structureless, because the lower state of the transition is essentially a continuum resulting from the repulsion of the ground-state molecules.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Exciplex</i> emission is seen in solutions of mixed solutes. For example, fluorescence of anthracene is quenched by diethylaniline, and a new and structureless emission is observed at longer wavelengths. The emission is not sensitized fluorescence of diethylaniline, but rather emission from the excited singlet anthracene-diethylaniline complex.</p>
<p class="indent">Excimer formation occurs with non-aromatic molecules as well as with aromatic ones, and triplet excimers also exist, giving rise to excimer phosphorescence. The excimer of pyrene is, however, particularly strongly bonded, thermodynamic measurements indicating a bond strength of around 40 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Experimental results suggest that the dimer is quite rigid, and it is thought that the aromatic hydrocarbons adopt a sandwich structure with a separation between the planes of about 0.33 nm.</p>
<p class="indent">The nature of bonding in excimers and exciplexes is clearly dependent on the presence of electronic excitation. Part of the stabilization arises from the promotion of an electron from a filled orbital that would be antibonding in a ground-state dimer or complex to an unfilled bonding orbital in the excited pair. Charge-transfer stabilization is also important in excimers, and especially in exciplexes. The promotion of an electron to a higher energy level obviously makes an excited molecule potentially a better donor than the ground-state molecule, but the lower-energy orbital from which the electron was promoted can also now receive another electron, thus leading to increased acceptor properties (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>). Electrostatic attraction between M<sup>+</sup> and N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> can thus arise in an excited pair (MN)&#x002A;, the direction of electron transfer depending on the particular chemical species involved.</p>
