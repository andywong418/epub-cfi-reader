<p class="noindent">The different possible fates of an excited species were outlined in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.7">Section 1.7</a>. In this chapter, we deal with the processes involving excited species that lead to <i>chemical</i> change, i.e. reactions in which the reactants and products differ in chemical identity rather than in state of excitation. Chemical change can come about as a result of photodissociation of the absorbing molecule into fragments, direct reaction of the excited species, or spontaneous isomerization of the excited species. Specific examples are shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.18">Note 1.18</a>, which illustrates the various pathways outlined in the rest of this section.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.1"/><b>2.1</b> Photoionization usually requires wavelengths in the vacuum ultraviolet region [<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.24">Note 1.24</a>] because the ionization energies of most species are relatively large (and generally larger than chemical dissociation energies).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Photodissociation (route (i) in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>) is the most obvious type of chemical change; it occurs when the species excited by the absorption of radiation has enough, or more than enough, energy to split into fragments. Several mechanisms are recognized for dissociation processes; the three major routes are <i>optical dissociation, predissociation</i> and <i>induced predissociation</i>, and will be discussed in more detail in <a href="#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>. The fragmentation of a species into an ion and an electron, i.e. photoionization (shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a> as route (viii)), is a special case of photodissociation.</p>
<p class="indent">The chemistry of an excited species may differ markedly from that of the ground-state species, and, as discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>, the differences can arise as a result of both the excess energy carried by the excited species and the particular electronic arrangement of the excited state. The direct reaction of the excited species (route (ii) in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>) may be either intermolecular (including reaction with added reactants, unexcited molecules of the absorbing substance, or, in solution, with the solvent), or intramolecular (including intramolecular reductions, additions, and various types of isomerization).</p>
<p class="indent">The excess energy possessed by an excited species may be sufficient to allow internal rearrangement of the species, i.e. the species may undergo spontaneous isomerization (shown as path (iii) in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>).</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.2">
<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Factors determining reactivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">The factors that contribute to the reactivity of an excited species are all interrelated, and include the excess energy possessed by the species (which may help overcome activation barriers), the intrinsic reactivity of the specific electronic arrangement, and the relative efficiencies of the different competing pathways for loss of the particular electronic state.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most important factors in relation to the electronic arrangement concerns the type of orbital (s, p, &#x03C3;, or &#x03C0;, etc.) and its symmetry. This point is implicit in much of the discussion that follows in this and the next chapter, and becomes explicit in the <i>correlation rules</i> for orbital symmetry and spin that are introduced first at the end of this section [<a href="#nt2.2">Note 2.2</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.2"/><b>2.2</b> In photochemistry, excited species are necessarily involved, and the reaction pathways allowed by the correlation rules are often different from those for the ground-state partners.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chemical Change</a><span class="space">&#160;</span>There are a number of related issues, all closely linked to the effect of altering the electronic configuration, that explain why excitation from one state to another can lead to such marked differences in chemistry. These include the effects of changes in geometry, dipole moment, redox characteristics (i.e. electron donating and accepting ability), and the related acid-base properties.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.3"/><b>2.3</b> The ground state of an alkene such as ethene is planar. Promotion of one of the electrons from its &#x03C0; orbital to form the (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) [<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.15">Note 1.15</a>] excited state leaves only a &#x03C3;-bond between the carbon atoms, about which rotation can occur; the configuration adopted, with the minimum overlap between &#x03C0; and &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals, has the two CH<sub>2</sub> groups lying in perpendicular planes.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Both the sizes and the shapes of molecules may be affected by excitation and the concurrent redistribution of electrons between bonding, non-bonding and anti-bonding orbitals [<a href="#nt2.3">Note 2.3</a>]. For a particular excited state, the new steric arrangements can then either increase or decrease reactivity.</p>
<p class="indent">The dipole moment of a chemical species is affected by the changes in both electron distribution and molecular geometry. As a result of its dependence on these factors, the dipole moment can give an indication of the possible chemical behaviour of excited states. Both increases and decreases in dipole moment may occur [<a href="#nt2.4">Note 2.4</a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Excited species are usually more effective electron donors <i>and</i> acceptors than the ground-state species. Excitation in most molecules involves promotion of a (paired) electron from a lower to a higher orbital, so that its removal from the molecule then requires less energy. At the same time, the promotion of an electron leaves behind a low-lying vacancy which will have a strong tendency to accept another electron. Hence, excitation leads to a reduction in the ionization energy and an increase in the electron affinity of the molecule. One consequence is that the redox properties may be very different from those of the ground-state species. In fact, complete electron transfer to or from an excited molecule is quite common, and many photochemical reactions involve radical anions or cations (see, for example, the discussion of photosynthesis in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.4"/><b>2.4</b> In formaldehyde (methanal, HCHO), there is a 30% <i>decrease</i> in dipole moment upon excitation to the (&#x03C0;,&#x03C0;&#x002A;) state, indicating reduced polarization in the C=O bond. In an aromatic molecule such as 4-nitroaniline, excitation can <i>increase</i> the dipole moment by a factor of more than two, indicating extensive charge transfer in the excited state.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As a consequence of the different donor-acceptor properties, acid-base behaviour can also be influenced by electronic excitation. Experimental evidence shows that the excited states of some molecules may be stronger acids than the ground state, while in other species the excited state is a weaker acid [<a href="#nt2.5">Note 2.5</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.5"/><b>2.5</b> As an example of altered acidity, consider the S<sub>1</sub> state of phenol, which may be up to 10<sup>6</sup> times as acidic as the S<sub>0</sub> state. This change is attributed to the transfer of electrons from the hydroxy oxygen to the aromatic nucleus. Interestingly, the excited triplet, T<sub>1</sub>, is not so highly acidic, because of quantum mechanical effects.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Chemical reactions can be efficient only if the reactants and products are connected by a <i>continuous</i> surface that describes the potential energy of the system as a function of the several interatomic distances: a reaction occurring &#x2018;on&#x2019; such a surface is said to proceed <i>adiabatically</i>, and the reactants and products are said to <i>correlate</i> with each other. In other words, the reactants and products must correlate with each other and with the transition state. The occurrence of chemical reactions is restricted by wave-mechanical arguments, summed up as <i>correlation rules</i> (see <a href="#sec_2.10">Sections 2.10</a> for orbital correlation and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.5">3.5</a> for electron-spin correlation). Electron spin correlation rules are particularly important, and, as far as the quantum number S provides a good description of the system, total electron spin is conserved.</p>

<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0.8em;">Optical photodissociation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Our discussion of photodissociation in this book, and the examples we use to illustrate our arguments, will generally focus on diatomic molecules. The two-dimensional representation of the relationship between potential energy and internuclear distance for a diatomic species constitutes the familiar potential energy curve, and the actual form of the curve is frequently known for specific electronic states of diatomic molecules. Although the same physical principles apply to the photochemistry of larger molecules, the descriptions are necessarily more complex and less precise &#x2014; for instance, the potential <i>curve</i> is replaced by a multi-dimensional <i>surface</i> in order to define the energy as a function of all the different internuclear distances &#x2014; and will be covered in more depth later in the chapter.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.6"/><b>2.6</b> Note that absorption spectra give information about vibrational spacings in the upper state of the transition. Information about the lower state can be obtained from the emission spectrum, as explained in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a> (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#nt3.9">Note 3.9</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.7"/><b>2.7</b> The products of an optical dissociation lie upon the same potential surface as the upper state reached by absorption, i.e. the products correlate with the excited state. It is fairly common in optical dissociation for the upper state to correlate with at least one excited fragment, thus leading to one or more excited product fragments being formed.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Optical dissociation may come about either if absorption occurs so that the excited species possesses energy greater than its own dissociation energy, or if the absorption occurs to an unbound, repulsive state. Both possibilities are shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. In either case, the molecule will dissociate, and any excess energy may be taken up by the fragments as translational energy. Because this translational energy is effectively continuous, the spectrum beyond the point at which dissociation occurs becomes a continuum. If the upper state is bound, then at longer wavelengths (i.e. lower energies) the spectrum may be banded, corresponding to different vibrational levels in the upper state. These levels become progressively closer together, until the continuum is reached: the energy corresponding to the onset of the continuum &#x2014; the <i>convergence limit</i> &#x2014; is the dissociation energy to the products. Several methods exist to determine the exact convergence limit, but they fall more within the scope of spectroscopy than of photochemistry.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.8"/><b>2.8</b> Photoionization is of profound importance in the upper atmosphere, where short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can lead to appreciable ionization of the chemical species present.

<p class="indent">Complete removal of an electron, <i>photoionization</i> [<a href="#nt2.8">Note 2.8</a>] can also be regarded as a form of photodissociation, yielding dissociation products of an ion and an electron <a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chemical Change</a>Rydberg series (in which the principal quantum number increases) are known for both atoms and molecules, and the lines or bands converge as the electron is moved into orbitals further away from the nucleus. The convergence limit corresponds to complete removal of the electron, and thus to ionization.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.9"/><b>2.9</b> The gas-phase absorption spectra of the simpler molecules show considerable sharp rotational structure, but in some cases this rotational structure becomes blurred, leading to a diffuseness of the bands at energies well below the optical dissociation limit. The term predissociation was first adopted to describe this spectroscopic situation.</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="h2">Predissociation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another route to fragmentation exists; the process involves population of an excited state <i>below</i> its dissociation limit, and subsequent radiationless transition to populate another state <i>above</i> the dissociation limit of that second state. The phenomenon is referred to as <i>predissociation</i> [<a href="#nt2.9">Note 2.9</a>]. We shall illustrate the process with reference to a model diatomic system, although it is of greater importance in complex organic molecules. Such molecules usually do not undergo direct optical dissociation in the wavelength regions of their strongest absorption, but rather fragment by the predissociation mechanism. Predissociation of these molecules is favoured by the greater number of electronic states, their much closer spacing, and the increased number of vibrational modes, all of which tend to encourage radiationless transitions between different electronic states.</p>
<p class="indent">Predissociation in a diatomic molecule can be explained in terms of the &#x2018;crossing&#x2019; potential energy curves of <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. Absorption populates the upper bound curve at an energy above that where the repulsive curve crosses it. Subject to the quantum mechanical requirements for radiationless transition (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.9">Sections 1.9</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">3.4</a>) the system may thus cross to the repulsive state, which falls apart to yield the atomic fragments. In a more complex molecule, the sequence of events is essentially the same, with chemical dissociation occurring from a dissociative state at an energy less than that of the state first populated by absorption. It is important to note that the products may well be different from those yielded by direct optical dissociation [<a href="#nt2.10">Note 2.10</a>].</p>

<p class="indent">In certain instances, radiationless transitions that are apparently forbidden by the selection rules can occur in the presence of perturbing influences such as collisions or external electric or magnetic fields (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_8">p. 8</a>).

<p class="noindent">The discussion of photodissociation so far has centred upon diatomic molecules; excluding the case of ionization, the only possible products of dissociation of a diatomic species are the two atomic fragments from which that molecule is formed. The dissociation of polyatomic molecules, however, can yield a multitude of different sets of products, and in order to understand the mechanisms behind such processes it is first necessary to establish the nature of the primary reaction products. In <a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a> we provide a selection of the types of process that occur with small inorganic species.

The absorption lies at considerably shorter wavelengths in acids, anhydrides and esters (&#x003C;250nm), <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chemical Change</a>and in amides (&#x003C;260nm).

<p class="noindent">Much of what we have discussed so far has been about gas-phase photochemistry. We now examine the way in which photochemistry may differ in the condensed phase, where the close proximity of neighbouring molecules may have a profound effect on both the process of absorption itself and on the subsequent fate of the species thus excited.</p>
<p class="indent">Solvation can reduce molecular energies, to an extent determined both by the nature of the electronic state and by the solvent, so that an isolated species and a species in solution usually absorb at different wavelengths. The energies of ground and excited states may also be reduced to differing extents [<a href="#nt2.14">Note 2.14</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.14"/><b>2.14</b> Further discussion of the effects of solvents on the energies of ground and excited states is deferred until <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a> (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#nt3.10">Note 3.10</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In addition to the observed change in the wavelength of absorption, the <i>intensity</i> of absorption may be affected by the change from gas to liquid phase, particularly for forbidden transitions: the disturbances brought about by the neighbouring molecules may be sufficient to invalidate selection rules.</p>
<p class="indent">The relative importance of the different fates of excited species may also change as a result of the change from gas phase to solution. For a start, the greatly increased number of collisions undergone by each molecule means that physical quenching becomes far more important, so that the quantum yields for any other primary process are often appreciably smaller than in the gas phase. <i>Chemical</i> quenching, i.e. the removal of the excited molecule by chemical reaction, may also become competitive with other loss processes. In addition, the fragments formed by dissociation may react with solvent molecules almost immediately, and the <i>overall</i> step may then be regarded for practical purposes as the primary one. This phenomenon is particularly important when radical fragments are formed in a hydrogen-containing solvent, since the formation of <i>free</i> radicals is effectively prevented [<a href="#nt2.15">Note 2.15</a>].</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.15"/><b>2.15</b> The influence of H-abstraction from the solvent is exemplified by the photolysis of (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH.CO.CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which in solution yields CO, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCHO as the main Type I products. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCO.COCH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are seen in the gas-phase photolysis but not in solution.

</aside>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chemical Change</a><span class="space">&#160;</span>One factor which is not apparent in the gas phase, but which strongly affects the types and rates of processes taking place in solution, is the occurrence of <i>cage effects</i>. In solution, molecules are effectively trapped within a &#x2018;cage&#x2019; of solvent molecules. The separation of reacting species by normal diffusive processes is therefore hindered, and the species may make many mutual collisions before they are eventually liberated from the cage. Cage effects may be particularly important in the <i>geminate recombination</i> (from gemini, the Latin word for twins) of radicals formed by the fragmentation of an excited species, since the prevention of their separation encourages very rapid reaction to reform the original product; any excess energy in the newly-formed bond is removed by collision with solvent molecules. Relatively few radicals manage to escape the solvent cage before recombination, and the effective quantum yield for dissociation is consequently substantially reduced.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.16"/><b>2.16</b> Cage effects are responsible for the interesting phenomenon of chemically induced polarization observed in photochemical magnetic resonance experiments. Chemically induced dynamic nuclear spin polarization (CIDNP) manifests itself by abnormal absorption intensities, and even emissions, in NMR studies of photochemical processes. The CIDNP technique affords one method for the diagnostic study of certain types of photochemical reaction. Chemically induced dynamic electron spin polarization (CIDEP) may lead to emission of electron spin resonance (ESR), and the phenomenon can yield information about the energetics and relaxation of triplet states.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The importance of geminate recombination is related to the kinetic energy of the fragments formed on photolysis, as well as to the viscosity of the solvent. If the fragments have sufficient energy, they may force their way out of the cage, and the primary quantum yields of some solution-phase photolyses increase as the wavelength of photolysing radiation is decreased.</p>

<p class="indent">The lowest excited singlet and triplet states of ethene and its derivatives are (&#x03C0;, &#x03C0;&#x002A;) in character [<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.15">Note 1.15</a>], formed by promotion of an electron from the highest filled bonding &#x03C0; orbital to the lowest unfilled antibonding &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbital. This change in electronic configuration removes the constraints that hold the molecule in a fixed planar geometry, so that free rotation can then occur about the carbon-carbon axis [<a href="#nt2.3">Note 2.3</a>]. Both S<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> states adopt a perpendicular configuration, so that excitation of both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers gives rise to a geometrically equivalent excited state. The subsequent relaxation to the ground state is accompanied by a necessary re-adoption of the planar configuration, with both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers being formed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.19"/><b>2.19</b> Geometrical photoisomerization can occur from <i>cis</i> to <i>trans</i> or from <i>trans</i> to <i>cis</i> isomers, so that on prolonged irradiation of either isomer, a stationary state is set up. If the quantum yields for processes in each direction are similar, the concentrations of <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers at the stationary state are determined mainly by the amount of light absorbed (and thus by the extinction coefficient) of each isomer at the wavelength employed. For many simple alkenic systems, the higher extinction coefficient at longer wavelengths is possessed by the <i>trans</i> isomer, and if long wavelength light is used, the <i>cis</i> isomer will predominate at the photostationary state.</p>

<h3 class="h2">Photosensitized oxidation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many of the photosensitized oxidations undergone by unsaturated compounds are thought to involve the photochemical addition of oxygen. Photosensitized oxidations are of particular importance in the biological field, because of their impact on living organisms. It has long been known that microorganisms can be killed in the presence of oxygen and a sensitizing dye. The pathological effects of photooxidation of cell constituents are now known to include cell damage, induction of mutations or cancer, and death. Recent investigations of photosensitized oxidation have led to a better understanding of the chemical processes, and the results are now finding application in the biological field. Some brief remarks about photomedicine are presented in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.10">Section 6.10</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The majority of photosensitized oxidations involve the sensitizer in its triplet state, since the singlet is relatively so short lived. The sensitizer triplet may then react either with the unsaturated compound itself, or with the oxygen. For many sensitizers, the reaction with oxygen is so efficient that, at all but the lowest oxygen concentrations, the latter process is favoured over the former. The chemical nature of the unsaturated compound determines whether the presence of oxygen merely inhibits the former possibility, or whether the products of the primary reaction with oxygen eventually lead to oxidation of the substrate. The sensitized oxidations of alkenes, dienes, dienoid heterocycles, and polycyclic aromatic compounds are particularly efficient, and it is with these substances as oxidizable reactant that we are concerned. The first oxidation products are often peroxides or hydroperoxides, and they may subsequently take part in secondary oxidation steps.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.31"/><b>2.31</b> The elucidation of the mechanism of sensitized photooxidation has made possible several fruitful speculations with regard to photobiology. An example is the protective action of carotenoids in biological systems. Carotenoids apparently protect photosynthetic organisms against the lethal effects of their own chlorophyll, which is an excellent sensitizer of photooxidation. It has been shown that &#x03B2;-carotene is an extremely efficient quencher of singlet oxygen, and it can also inhibit sensitized photooxidations. Studies suggest that the quenching of O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>&#x0394;<sub>g</sub>) may involve excitation of triplet carotene by energy transfer. Thus, the interesting speculation may be made that carotenoids serve a double function in photosynthetic organisms (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>): first, that they remove &#x2018;toxic&#x2019; singlet oxygen, and, secondly, that they can store the energy that O<sub>2</sub> receives from chlorophyll, which would otherwise be lost.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Overwhelming evidence points to a mechanism for these photooxidations in which energy transfer from the (triplet) sensitizer to (triplet) ground state oxygen occurs</p>

The lowest-lying excited state of oxygen is, in fact, a singlet (<sup>1</sup>&#x0394;<sub>g</sub>) [<a href="#nt2.30">Note 2.30</a>], and possesses an energy of 92 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, so that it can easily be excited by energy transfer from the triplet states of most dyes.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct studies of the reactions of O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>&#x0394;<sub>g</sub>) have indicated that it is the intermediate involved in sensitized photooxidation.

For a wide variety of acceptors that yield more than one oxidation product, the product distributions from the reaction with O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>&#x0394;<sub>g</sub>) and from the photooxidation are identical, and there are no detectable differences in stereoselectivity.</p>

A reaction of this kind is termed <i>adiabatic</i> and its occurrence implies the connection of spin, orbital angular momentum, and certain symmetry properties.

<p class="indent">To find out whether conrotatory or disrotatory ring closures are allowed, it is necessary to discover which electronic states of the reactant correlate [<a href="#nt2.32">Note 2.32</a>] with which of the product.

For disrotatory electrocyclization, the S<sub>0</sub> states do not correlate and the reaction therefore cannot proceed adiabatically. The conclusion is that <i>thermal</i> reaction is allowed for conrotatory cyclization, but is forbidden in the disrotatory mode.</p>
<p class="indent">In a similar way, it can be demonstrated that the S<sub>1</sub> state of butadiene correlates with S<sub>1</sub> in cyclobutene for disrotatory ring closure, thereby implying that the disrotatory reaction might be allowed in photochemically induced cyclization.

<p class="noindent">In <a href="#sec_2.5">Section 2.5</a>, we discussed some of the special aspects of solution-phase photochemistry. One of the most important features, especially in polar solvents (and particularly water), is the significance of ionic species. &#x2018;Primary&#x2019; photochemical reactions involving ions in solution may be very different from the photodissociation of neutral molecules, since oxidation-reduction steps are frequently involved.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.34"/><b>2.34</b> Electron-transfer processes are of great importance throughout condensed-phase chemistry. The efficiency of such processes sometimes shows a dependence on the free energy of reaction that is somewhat surprising, with the rate constant <i>decreasing</i> with increasing free energy in the so-called &#x2018;inverted&#x2019; region. This behaviour is the subject of <i>Marcus theory</i>, which explains the anomalies in terms of the wave-like properties associated with electrons. It is thought likely that some of the steps in photosynthesis (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>) and some other natural phenomena can occur only because of these special features of photoinduced electron transfer.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The characteristic colours of the complexes of transition metal ions usually arise from optical transitions of electrons on the metal atom. These absorptions are frequently fairly weak, as the transitions are forbidden on symmetry grounds. Many ions do, however, show a strong absorption in the ultraviolet region (usually between 200 and 250nm), which is due to <i>charge-transfer</i> transitions, i.e. transitions in which an electron is transferred from one ion to another, or from an ion to the solvent [<a href="#nt2.33">Notes 2.33</a> and <a href="#nt2.34">2.34</a>].</p>
<p class="indent">The reducing species formed on photolysis of aqueous solutions of ions appears to be a hydrated electron. Much of the evidence from which this <a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Chemical Change</a>conclusion has been drawn comes from comparisons with the products of the radiolysis of water (i.e. a process in which water is stripped of an electron). For instance, a transient absorption at around 700nm is observed on flash photolysis (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.10">Section 1.10</a>) of aqueous ionic solutions, which appears identical to the absorption seen on pulse radiolysis of pure water. In addition, the rates of reaction of the species produced in the two ways are also often identical. Furthermore, both optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of uv-irradiated aqueous glasses containing ionic species, and of trapped electrons produced by ionizing radiation, are identical. The wavelengths involved imply that much less energy is required to remove the electron from the parent species than in gas-phase photoionization: this energy difference presumably arises as a result of the stabilizing effect of hydration of the electron. Quantum yields for the formation of hydrated electrons have been estimated, and may be relatively high. In photolysis of the halide ions (I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, &#x03BB; = 253.7nm; Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, &#x03BB; = 184.9nm), for example, the quantum yields are probably 0.3&#x2013;0.5.</p>

<p class="indent">At first appearances, multiphoton processes seem to be in contradiction to the basic tenets of photochemistry as embodied in the Stark-Einstein laws and as explained in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.8">Section 1.8</a>. Despite the apparent inconsistency, however, multiphoton processes do not violate quantum theory; the simple view must merely be modified to allow for the situation that arises when more than one photon can arrive at a single particle in very rapid succession.</p>
<p class="indent">Our discussion of multiphoton processes will concentrate on two-photon excitation, and the ideas presented can readily be extended to account for a greater number of photons. Two mechanisms may be considered in the achievement of multiphoton excitation. <i>Sequential</i> excitation involves a real intermediate state of the absorbing species. That state becomes populated by the first photon, and it can act as the starting point for the absorption of the second, as illustrated in <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3(a)</a>. The real intermediate state A* has a well-defined lifetime, typically 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> to 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>s. Because it is excited by a resonantly-absorbed photon, the overall sequential process is referred to as <i>resonant two-photon excitation</i>. The second excitation mechanism is <i>non-resonant two-photon excitation</i>, in which no resonant intermediate states are involved [<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3(b)</a>]. A <i>virtual</i> state, A&#x002A;<sup><i>v</i></sup> is created by the interaction of the first photon with A. Only if a second photon arrives within the duration of the first interaction (about 1 cycle of the electromagnetic radiation, or 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>s) can it be absorbed. The process is therefore often referred to as <i>simultaneous</i> biphotonic absorption, to distinguish it from the sequential mechanism. It is now apparent why high intensities are essential to achieve two-photon excitation. In the resonant process, it is necessary that the second excitation step occurs before loss processes (collisional, intramolecular radiationless, and radiative) depopulate the intermediate A&#x002A;, while with the non-resonant process the two photons must reach the absorber within about 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>s of each other. The resonant process has a higher probability than the non-resonant one, although the two formally distinct mechanisms merge if the photon energy of the exciting radiation in the non-resonant process approaches that of a real intermediate state. In both the sequential and the simultaneous mechanisms, the essential feature is that the energy of individual photons &#x2014; still quantized according to the Planck relation &#x2014; is stored in such a way that the energy of several photons can be used cooperatively.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><a id="nt2.38"/><b>2.38</b> The optical absorbance of a system absorbing multiple photons is dependent on the incident light intensity, i.e. the Beer-Lambert law (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>) no longer holds. This behaviour is most obvious in the non-resonant, simultaneous process involving the virtual intermediate level. The system may be completely transparent at low light intensities, yet absorb radiation at the same wavelength when exposed to high intensities.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">Multiphoton excitation in the ultraviolet region offers the photochemist several interesting opportunities. Excited states not normally accessible can be populated. For example, biphotonic excitation can be used to populate states with the same parity as the ground state (the selection rules are g &#x2194; g and u &#x2194; u, contrary to the rules for single-photon absorption (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.6">Section 1.6</a> and <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chemical Change</a><a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.16">Note 1.16</a>). Of particular importance is the possibility of conducting high-energy photochemistry that is normally associated with ultraviolet radiation of wavelength shorter than, say, 190nm (the &#x2018;vacuum&#x2019; ultraviolet [<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#nt1.24">Note 1.24</a>]). The problems of experimentation in this wavelength region can be avoided by using multiphoton excitation with wavelengths in the &#x2018;conventional&#x2019; ultraviolet region. <a href="#nt2.39">Note 2.39</a> gives an example.</p>

<p class="indent">Multiphoton ionization (MPI) is readily achieved with ultraviolet laser radiation. Compared with single-photon experiments, multiphoton excitation gives access to ionization studies on a vastly increased range of species. If resonant intermediate states are involved, the process is called <i>resonance-enhanced</i> multiphoton ionization (REMPI). The ions formed can be detected at very low concentrations, and MPI is of great value in multiphoton spectroscopic, studies. MPI also provides a new perspective on photoionization&#x2013;mass spectrometry, a technique in which wavelength-selected radiation allows highly specific ionization of particular species or of particular quantum states.</p>
<p class="indent">Infrared multiphoton absorption provides a unique source of molecules with high degrees of internal excitation. A new technique for the study of the problems of unimolecular dissociation is thus available. In addition, infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) generally yields products in their electronic ground states, which may well not be the case in conventional single-photon dissociation with ultraviolet or visible radiation (see <a href="#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a> and <a href="#nt2.7">Note 2.7</a>). Infrared multiphoton dissociation gives products similar to those obtained by thermal dissociation or pyrolysis, but without the need for high temperatures of the bulk materials: it is thus a technique for conducting <i>vibrational photochemistry</i>.

In one sense, reaction dynamics is at the heart of all chemical transformations, and a better understanding of the dynamics represents a better understanding of the transformation itself. <i>State-to-state kinetics</i> provides some of the experimental information for theoretical approaches to reaction dynamics by attempting to investigate the rates of processes involving reactants in specific internal quantum states, and with specific velocities and <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chemical Change</a>starting coordinates, to form products in equally well-defined quantum states, velocities, and angular distributions and momenta.

<p class="indent">While intermolecular energy exchange can be minimized by avoiding collisions [<a href="#nt2.42">Note 2.42</a>], intramolecular energy exchange within the same molecule cannot. In these circumstances, the only way to obtain the nascent energy distributions is to probe the dissociating system at times short enough after the photon has been absorbed for energy exchange to be impossible. To meet this aim, and to understand the exchange processes themselves, very fast time-resolved experiments are required.</p>
