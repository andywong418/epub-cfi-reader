</aside>
<p class="noindent">Since the nature of the surface involved in heterogeneous catalysis is crucial to performance it is important to consider the structure as a starting point for the discussion of catalytic properties. The surface rests on the bulk and so is related to the bulk structure. In this short text we cannot describe all the types of structure that can be formed, but we will exemplify them by consideration of one class, that is the face-centred cubic (fcc) class. <a href="#fig2.1">Figure 2.1</a> shows slices through this crystal which produces the major, so-called low index faces, the (100), (110) and (111) planes. The numbers are Miller indices and their derivation is shown in the margin and is the reciprocal of the intersections of these planes through the major crystallographic axes.</p>
<p class="indent">It is evident that the coordination of the atoms in each of these surface planes is different. Generally speaking, surfaces with lower coordination surface atoms have the highest surface free energy, the highest reactivity for adsorption and the strongest binding for the adsorbate (high adsorption heat). The (100) atom has 4 nearest neighbours in the surface, (110) has only 2, while the (111) is in a close-packed structure with 6 nearest neighbours. This has a significant effect on reactivity &#x2013; the open surfaces generally being the most reactive and the close-packed the least reactive, as described with examples in <a href="#sec2.4">Section 2.4</a> below. The surface unit cells are indicated in the figures. These are the three low index faces, but many other orientations are possible. Most importantly, surfaces consisting of mostly well-defined faces of this kind can have other types of morphological features, as shown in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. Generally, metal crystals cannot be cut to exactly the surface required and so have steps relating to the angle of the cut (usually &#x007E;0.5&#x00B0; off the indicated plane). Here there are a range of sites, depending upon the number of nearest neighbours. Those that are most coordinated in the surface are the terrace atoms, next are those at steps, next are those at kink sites within the steps, then double kinks and, finally, isolated adatoms (adsorbed atoms) on terraces. The distribution of these kinds of atoms is a strong function of temperature, but those with maximum coordination in the terrace are the most stable while adatoms are the least stable. In turn, the former will diffuse to new sites slowest, while the latter will diffuse fastest.<a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a></p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.4</b> Showing the mirror-like finish of a single crystal surface, reflecting a catalyst pellet.</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The surface of a small metal catalyst particle will often be more complex, and more heterogeneous than this simple picture, comprising a surface with many types of crystallography exposed (more like that shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>): this is considered in more detail in <a href="#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a> below. However, single crystals of the type described above are widely used in surface studies, in order to examine how surface structure affects reactivity. Using a material with only one type of surface coordination also helps with the understanding of reactivity by eliminating one of the variables involved, that is, the heterogeneity of catalyst surfaces. Great care is taken in preparing such single crystals. They are grown very slowly, usually from a very high purity melt of the metal, as a boule (a cylindrical rod). This is then cut to the appropriate orientation, which is checked by Laue back diffraction of X-rays for accuracy of orientation. The surface is then polished mechanically and/or electrochemically, the former with abrasive pastes down to a sub-micron grade. This process results in a mirror finish to a crystal, as shown in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. The use of such well-defined surfaces has tremendously expanded our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis in the last 20 years. Single crystals of most metals are readily available, whereas high purity oxide crystals represent much more of a problem, and only very few types are produced.</p>
<p class="indent">In the experimental situation it is essential to be able to check the surface crystallography and this is routinely done by back diffraction of low energy electrons (low energy electron diffraction, LEED) as shown in <a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>. The surface structure is altered by adsorption of gases and LEED can be used to analyse the structure of the adsorbate on the surface. However, nowadays it is becoming common to use STM (scanning tunnelling microscopy) to determine adsorbate structures directly (<a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The composition and cleanliness of the surface is determined using surface-specific techniques, again using electrons which have a very short escape depth from the surface region; only those originating from near the surface can escape and be detected. The two major techniques for such analysis are Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In both, the energy of emitted electrons is analysed, after excitation by electrons or X-ray photons; these energies are element specific and can be used to identify the elements present in the surface region. This is because the energy of emitted electrons is in the range of short penetration depth through a solid. Thus the electrons selected come only from the near-surface region (<a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a>First, a single crystal of Pd contains a low level of bulk sulphur when new, but this material segregates to the surface upon heating; cycles of heating and bombarding the surface with high-energy Ar ions knocks these atoms off the surface and results in a clean interface. The Auger spectrum shows well-defined and separated peaks for the Pd metal and for S which help to identify when the surface is representative of clean Pd. The second example shows the application of XPS to the analysis of an FeSbO<sub>4</sub> catalyst used for the oxidation and ammoxidation of propene. It is obvious from the spectra that the component elements are present and that the surface is not of the bulk stoichiometry &#x2013; it is highly enriched in the Sb component. In fact, it is likely that the surface is almost exclusively Sb and O, since most of the Fe signal comes from material below the surface layer (the inelastic mean free path is several monolayers at this electron energy).</p>

<h2 class="main">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Surface restructuring</h2>
<p class="noindent">Because the surface is a region of high energy, thermodynamics dictates that there will be a tendency to minimise this energy. In nature this occurs in several ways.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Surface relaxation</h3>
<p class="noindent">All surfaces show a changed lattice parameter in the top layer due to the lack of neighbouring solid atoms on one side of the interface. In general, the surface atoms are pulled closer to the bulk, which in effect increases the coordination of the surface atoms a little, by increased electron overlap with the layers below: this is illustrated in <a href="#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>. The extent of this relaxation depends on the crystal plane and on the material, but generally ranges from &#x007E;2 to 10% of the bulk lattice parameter.</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Surface reconstruction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here there is gross reordering of the surface atoms, often resulting in a changed number of atoms in the topmost layer. The most well-known example of this is the reconstruction of Pt(100), which forms a (5&#x00D7;1) surface &#x2013; the numbers show that the surface unit cell is very large with respect to the underlying bulk (100) structure (<a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>). This reconstruction was first interpreted by LEED, which shows a large number of spots, many more than expected from the normal termination (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). A commonly observed reconstruction is the missing row reconstruction of a (110) surface, where alternate atomic rows on the surface are removed. Again, here the surfaces are trying to maximise surface coordination; the (5&#x00D7;1) Pt(100) reconstruction produces a near-close-packed structure, with a surface coordination of 6 rather than the coordination number of 4 for the unreconstructed surface.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Sintering</h3>
<p class="noindent">If a catalyst is produced which consists of separated metal particles, the total surface energy can be minimised by merging of these units to form fewer bigger ones (see <a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a> and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.2">1.2</a>). This results in lower surface area and higher average surface coordination. This effect is one of the major causes of <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a>loss of efficiency of a catalyst that generally occurs during its lifetime in an industrial plant.</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Adsorption</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another way of reducing surface free energy is by adsorption of molecules at the surface, resulting in surface compound formation and the satisfaction of free surface valencies. This is most significant in relation to catalysis because it is the first step in the reaction and is the driving force for catalysis. Adsorption can often be accompanied by reconstruction of the metal atoms in the surface. For instance, in the case of Cu(110) the adsorption of oxygen results in the formation of chains of Cu-O units on the surface (<a href="#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>). The Cu which forms this &#x2018;added-row&#x2019; structure is thought to come from Cu atoms removed from steps. Counter-intuitively reconstructed clean surfaces can form the bulk termination when an adsorbate impinges on the surface. Thus, small amounts of oxygen or carbon monoxide convert the Pt(100) (1&#x00D7;5) surface back to the (1&#x00D7;1). All these effects are driven by the minimised energy situation related to the packing density of the metal and of the adsorbate. In the case of a supported catalyst surface, such effects are likely to be more severe, since, at least for small particles, the coordination is low. Thus, for Rh catalysts, exposure to CO can pull off Rh atoms to form Rh <i>gem</i>-dicarbonyl molecules, Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>, which are bonded to the support as separate entities.</p>

<p class="noindent">Using the face-centred cubic structure as the basis, we can build a catalyst atom by atom as shown in <a href="#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>. This illustrates qualitatively the change in average coordination in the surface as the particle increases in size. The surface energy is related to the number of unsaturated bonds in the surface atom and so as the average coordination goes up with particle size, so unsaturation goes down and surface energy diminishes. There are, however, still individual atoms of low coordination, even on the bigger particles.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a></p>
<p class="indent">The coordination shown in <a href="#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a> can be compared with that in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> and it shows that low-index single crystals may be poor models for the reactivity of small metal particles. However, crystals can be prepared with a high proportion of low coordination atoms (kinks, for instance, see <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). Furthermore, many catalysts have relatively low dispersion metal phases with particle sizes which may expose mainly (III)-type planes. Work on the methanation reaction (CO &#x002B; 3H<sub>2</sub> &#x2192; CH<sub>4</sub> &#x002B; H<sub>2</sub>O) shows very close agreement for the results of single crystal experiments, compared with supported paniculate Ni catalysts (<a href="#fig2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In catalysis the number of atoms at the surface of a particle, compared with the total atoms, is often called the dispersion, and the formula for dispersion is given below. The relationship between surface atoms and particle diameter is given in <a href="#fig2.15">Fig. 2.15</a> for any hemispherical body made up of spherical sub-units which are ordered (the cross-section of the particle is assumed to be connected to a support). This can be more generally represented by the following equation for the surface area (<i>SA</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">An important factor affecting some oxidic and all pure metal catalysts is their relative lack of thermal stability, which generally results in these materials having a very low area due to sintering. Thus, in almost all cases the active phase is &#x2018;supported&#x2019; on an inactive, but thermally strong, support phase which is ceramic and refractory in nature. The most common such supports are alumina, silica and carbon. All of these can be obtained in very high surface area forms (up to c. 200 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and they maintain their areas even in very harsh temperatures and environmental conditions. Hence, in order to produce high area active phases of metals and oxides they are prepared in a form that is bonded to the support phase (see, for instance, <a href="#fig2.16">Fig. 2.16</a>, <a href="#fig2.20">Fig. 2.20</a> below and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>). This keeps the active particles apart and helps maintain their activity over a long period of time. Because of the particulate nature of these materials they are highly porous and high area samples generally have a range of pore sizes, from less than a nanometre or so in diameter (micropores), through to mesopores (&#x007E;10&#x2013;100 nm), to macropores (bigger than 100 nm). The distribution of these pore sizes can be an important factor in making a catalyst that has a very good performance.</p>

<h2 class="main">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Structure dependence and independence of catalytic reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Some catalytic reactions show little dependence on the nature of the surface structure involved (see <a href="#fig2.14">Fig. 2.14</a> for instance), while others are strongly dependent on it. The best evidence for the influence of structure on a reaction comes from studies using model catalysts, namely single crystals. A particularly useful example of this is hydrocarbon reactions with Pt surfaces carried out by Somorjai&#x2019;s group in California. <a href="#fig2.17">Fig. 2.17</a> shows the results of measurements of both the hydrog&#x00E9;nation and hydrogenolysis of hexane, showing that the latter is strongly structure dependent, in contrast to the former.</p>

<p class="indent">Another example concerns the Haber process of ammonia synthesis. Experiments carried out on single crystal Fe surfaces under low pressure conditions shows a marked variation of the dissociative adsorption probability of nitrogen (<a href="#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>), with the most open low-index face, the (111) for a body-centred cubic crystal, having the highest probability, and the close-packed (110) having the lowest. This again reflects differences in surface free energy and coordination. However, particular types of sites are also supposed to be important for the conversion of molecularly adsorbed nitrogen into atoms, which is thought to be the rate-determining step for this reaction. Experiments carried out in a different laboratory showed that these results were in agreement with the trends of ammonia synthesis activity under conditions of high pressure and temperature near those used industrially (<a href="#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>). Thus, structure has a controlling influence in this case and modelling calculations confirm that the association of molecular nitrogen is rate-determining.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a></p>
<p class="indent">In general, for dissociative adsorption, the dissociation probability is strongly dependent on the structure of the surface and there is often a more strong dependence on crystal structure than on the particular metal involved (see <a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>). A general picture of this is shown in <a href="#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a> where, open planes &#x005B;such as (110)&#x005D; have a high sticking probability into the dissociated state, but close-packed planes have lower values, sometimes orders of magnitude lower. The main reasons for this are the lower work functions on open planes, allowing easier transfer of electrons into anti-bonding LUMOs on incoming molecules, and also the easier approach of the molecules to the electron-rich surface plane. Promotion of a surface with an alkali has a similar effect on a close-packed plane to that when an open surface is used -it induces a rougher surface with a lower work function.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fig. 2.19</b> Potential energy profile for adsorption of oxygen onto a metal surface showing the possibility of two barriers to adsorption from the gas phase.

These three states are successively more strongly bound to the surface. High energy gas phase atoms are stabilised by the surface.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">These effects are often expressed in catalysis as &#x2018;demanding&#x2019; and &#x2018;undemanding&#x2019; reactions. This feature of the catalysis is usually determined by examining how the rate of reaction per site varies with changing the particle size of the active phase of the catalyst. In general, for reactions where the surface reaction is rate limiting, structure sensitivity is to be expected.</p>
<p class="indent">Many catalysts are metallic in nature and are often composed of highly dispersed, small diameter, precious metal particles. There are many additional effects of changing the structure of such a material which, in turn, affect its catalytic activity, as illustrated in <a href="#fig2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>. When a particle is very small (&#x2264;3 nm) it becomes less like a metal because of the splitting of the conduction band into discrete energy levels and this can change the surface reactivity and activation energies for all the steps involved. Furthermore, there can be charge transfer between the catalyst particle and the support material, depending strongly on the nature of the support, on the nature of <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 2 The effect of surface structure on reactivity</a>the metal and on its structure/size. Edge effects can also be very important for small particles where the edge atoms in contact with both the support and the gas-solid interface can be a significant fraction of the atoms involved.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, in recent times an effect known as SMSI (strong metal support interaction) has been discovered and this can occur when metals are supported on partially reducible oxides such as TiO<sub>2</sub>. In this case, reduced support compounds can diffuse onto the metal, and this then strongly affects the catalytic performance.</p>
