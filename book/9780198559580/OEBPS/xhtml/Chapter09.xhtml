<h2 class="main">9.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the previous chapters we have concerned ourselves with a range of catalytic principles and some examples of industrial catalysis. In this chapter some examples of catalysis which impinge rather directly on individual modern lives will be given. As already mentioned, society is highly dependent on the chemical industry and our modern lifestyle would be impossible without this business. The vast majority of chemical products are formed using catalysis.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most directly evident everyday uses of catalysis has been given above &#x2013; namely automobile catalysis. This is perhaps the catalytic technology of which people are most aware nowadays. However, there is a wide range of catalytic processes which are used to make everyday products, some of which are a surprise, and in the following sections some of the larger scale of these will be described.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.2 Food from gas: fertilizer production</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Most modern western economies are dependent on livestock for food production and cows are fed largely from grass and grains. For the maximum intensity of production (hamburgers per square metre) fertilizer has to be added to fields to increase grass growth rates and to increase grain yields (approximately 10 kg of grain are required per kg of beef produced). Cows are vegetarian and require such non&#x2013;meat inputs; feeding alternative meat-based sources has led to the BSE (&#x2018;mad cow disease&#x2019;) scare in the UK. The yield of grass and grain used for feed is improved by the addition of nitrogen to the soil in the form of ammonia-based fertilizers (e.g. NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">The ammonia is produced by the Haber process for nitrogen fixation which is exothermic.</p>

<p class="noindent">Since there is also a pressure drop upon synthesis, the thermodynamics dictate that the reaction should be optimised at low temperature and high pressure. At very low temperatures the reaction becomes kinetically limited and so industrially temperatures of around 450 &#x00B0;C and pressures of 100 atm are used, under which conditions yields of NH<sub>3</sub> are &#x007E;14%, close to the equilibrium value. Because conversion is low the ammonia is trapped out in a cooler/refrigeration unit at the exit of the reactor and the unconverted N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> is recycled to the front of the reactor. The catalyst used is mainly iron (<a href="#tab9.1">Table 9.1</a>) with small amounts of a promoter (potash) and a support (alumina), <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Chapter 9 Catalysis in everyday life</a>which also plays some role in the activity. This is a very strong and stable catalyst.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the potash and alumina are present in low amounts in the bulk, various surface science studies have shown that these are preferentially segregated to the surface in the working catalyst. Thus, although at &#x003C;1% in the bulk, potash has a surface coverage of &#x007E;10% (<a href="#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>). In order to produce the N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> for the synthesis, however, a number of other catalysts have to be used, as illustrated in <a href="#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>. These catalysts are required for several steps in the conversion of natural gas (methane) into ammonia.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.3 Modifying food: margarine production by hydrogenating vegetable oil</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Vegetable oil is mainly composed of unsaturated fats such as linolenic and linoleic acids. These are liquid oils which are not pleasant for use on bread, they tend to degrade easily and are often not convenient for baking. Hydrogenation of one or more of the double bonds in the molecules increases saturation (mono-unsaturated oleic acid is the main product), and increases hardness and &#x2018;spreadability&#x2019;, thereby producing the margarine familiar to everyone.</p>
<p class="indent">This saturation is achieved using heterogeneous catalysis, with Ni-based catalysts supported on silica, the reaction being run at 420 K at c. 3 atm pressure in batch mode, with subsequent removal of the catalyst by filtration.</p>

<p class="indent">Acetic acid is produced by the carbonylation of methanol, the reactants themselves being produced from natural gas. Acetic acid from this industrial source is used widely by the food industry, though the large majority of the product is used to make acetates, especially vinyl acetate.</p>

<p class="indent">In this case the reaction is carried out by a dissolved monomeric organometallic catalyst which passes through several intermediate forms, though the predominant species observed in solution is &#x005B;Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x2013;</sup> since the reaction is run in the presence of a co-catalyst, a mix of HI/CH<sub>3</sub>I. The mixture is approximately 10<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> M in Rh and is run at around 180 &#x00B0;C and 35 atm pressure in a continuous process. The catalytic cycle is thought to proceed in the manner shown in <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>, with several organometallic intermediates, some short-lived and some detectable at a steady concentration in the reacting medium. Recently, newly developed catalysts have been announced, based on Ru promoted Ir organometallics of a similar type. These have better stability characteristics, are already in use in plants and may supplant the Rh-based process.</p>

<p class="noindent">and so to avoid over-oxidation the reaction is run in a substoichiometric amount of oxygen, essentially a mix of reactions <a href="#eq9.3">9.3</a> and <a href="#eq9.4">9.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The preferred catalyst used for this reaction has been Ag, in the form of powder or sponge, of low surface area, to minimise combustion. The reaction proceeds through a methoxy intermediate which decomposes to yield formaldehyde, whereas the combustion route occurs through over-oxidation of this intermediate through a formate intermediate which decomposes to give CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, the latter reacting with surface oxygen in a facile manner to produce water (<a href="#fig9.4">Fig. 9.4</a>). This process is run at temperatures around 900 K and pressures just above atmospheric. To help to avoid combustion the catalyst is of low surface area and the reaction is run with short residence times over a narrow plug of catalyst. Recently, new catalysts have been introduced and the selective oxidation can be carried using oxide catalysts such as iron molybdate, Fe<sub>2</sub>(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. The advantage of these catalysts is that complete oxidation is less easy, and so the reaction can be run in higher oxygen levels. The reaction is then more exothermic and is run at lower temperatures, of &#x007E;650 K. In fact, high levels of air are used to minimise flammability risks. The plant is of the multitubular reactor design with a heat transfer medium flowing between the tubes.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.6 Clothes from oil: fibres and plastics</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">All plastics which are produced from feedstock oil use catalysis in their production. Modem society is now built on these materials, quite literally, with an enormous expansion in the use of plastic materials in the building sector, and most modern cars have high levels of plastics in their construction. So much so that in tests of emissions from cars fitted with an exhaust converter, the small amount of volatile organics in plastics on a new car can contribute in a major way to the total pollution load measured&#x0021; Plastics are used widely in every aspect of daily life from food wrapping and drinks containers (usually PET, polyethylene terephthalate), to general packaging, to clothes. The vast majority of these materials are made from oil and the bulk plastics come mainly from the catalytic conversion of ethylene and propylene. If we use the former as an example, Ziegler and Natta won the Nobel Prize for chemistry for their reaction of a then new class of catalysts, <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 9 Catalysis in everyday life</a>based on titanium chloride/aluminium alkyl, which are capable of polymerising a wide range of such reactions. They appear to work at an active centre in titanium where the alkene can <i>&#x03C0;</i> bond to a vacant coordinate site and chain lengthening comes from addition of groups from an adjacent site on the metal centre (see <a href="#fig9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>), essentially by insertion in the growing chain. The catalysis is heterogeneous in that the catalyst is a solid and the reactant is in the gas phase, but the product is a solid with the catalyst intimately locked into it. The catalyst is very efficient, however, and represents a very small fraction by weight of the final polymer. Thus, the catalyst has to be continually added to the process. New, more efficient and more specific catalysts for these processes are continually being developed.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a range of different processes for production of different plastics and sometimes this is very involved, requiring multistep processing. An example of this is nylon production, which involves approximately 13 catalytic steps (some routes involve more catalytic steps) to produce it from the original starting materials of oil (for the organics involved, i.e. benzene, propene) and natural gas/air/water (for ammonia production, as described in <a href="#sec9.2">Section 9.2</a> above). The overall steps involved are shown in <a href="#fig9.6">Fig. 9.6</a> below.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.7 Washing powder additives: selective oxidation of ethylene</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Ethylene oxide is used for a wide variety of products (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>) and its production represents the largest tonnage selective oxidation process in use. A supported Ag catalyst is employed and works at approximately 80% selectivity. In fact, supported Ag alone yields ethylene oxide but only with about 50% selectivity. Current commercial catalysts have at least one promoter (such as an alkali oxide) doped onto the catalyst surface, and a selectivity enhancer (a chloro-organic such as vinyl chloride) is added to the gas feed at the ppm level. The latter is the most important of these modifications to the process, increasing the selectivity up to &#x007E; 70% or more and there is an anecdote to describe its discovery. An ethylene oxide plant periodically improved its selectivity markedly and it was eventually realised that this improvement corresponded with windy days on which the wind blew from a particular direction. This direction had a chlorine plant upstream of the ethylene oxide plant, and small amounts of chlorine effluent got into the air intake of the oxidation process causing temporary improvement in ethylene oxide yield and selectivity.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.8 Sweet drinks from corn: immobilised enzyme catalysts</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Sucrose (<a href="#fig9.7">Fig. 9.7</a>) is a disaccharide that has been traditionally used as a sweetener, but a preferable sweetener is the one used by nature to make fruits sweet, namely fructose, which is nearly twice as sweet as sucrose per unit weight, thus enabling use of less carbohydrate to sweeten drinks and foodstuffs. In the 1970s there was an economic drive to produce this sweetener due to the high price of sugar cane. A process was developed using a natural enzyme called glucose isomerase, derived from the bacterium <i>Streptomyces</i> (also the source of the antibiotic streptomycin). The reactant is a by&#x2013;product of corn milling, consisting of a syrupy solution of 95% glucose, and this is converted into a solution with approximately 50% fructose, which is much sweeter than the starting material (fructose is 2.5 times sweeter than glucose). This material is the so-called &#x2018;corn sweetener&#x2019; in many drinks and foodstuffs. In order to maintain high activity and to enable its easy separation from the liquid the enzyme catalyst is supported (&#x2018;immobilised&#x2019;) on a ceramic coated with a polymer to which the enzyme can adhere.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>9.9 Catalysis for health: pharmaceuticals by asymmetric synthesis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Nature is usually very specific in the way it makes molecules, especially so when a stereogenic centre is involved (see <a href="#fig9.8">Fig. 9.8</a>). When there are two different molecules, it usually chooses the one which has the desired properties, in a biological sense. Different chiral versions of the same molecule often have very different properties, especially in terms of fragrance. Thus L-limonene smells of lemons, whereas D-limonene smells of oranges (<a href="#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>). In the plants which produce these fruits, there are natural processes to make only one of the enantiomers with very high selectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a big growth area for the application of catalysis at present. Many drugs are more efficacious in only one chiral form and so asymmetric catalysis is now being widely applied in this area. A famous example acts as a cautionary tale for this field, namely the thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s. Here the drug, as its <i>R</i>-isomer, was found to be a useful sedative, but when applied to large-scale production the racemate, an equal mixture of <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> forms was made, with the tragic consequences of the birth of many deformed <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Chapter 9 Catalysis in everyday life</a>babies. This is because the <i>S</i>-isomer is a teratogen, which also interfers with the natural abortion function in human beings.</p>

<p class="indent">The ability to produce one form of isomer is therefore of great importance and interest to the pharmaceutical industry, and catalysts have a significant role to play in this development. An example of this is a catalytic route to the drug L&#x2013;dopa (<a href="#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>) used in the treatment of Parkinsons disease, although here the R&#x2013;form is largely inactive, it has to be separated from the L&#x2013;form, which is a costly process. Homogeneous catalysts can enable this conversion (which involves one-sided hydrog&#x00E9;nation of an olefinic bond) with 95% selectivity. Although many of these kinds of processes are homogeneous, this involves costly operations for removing the catalyst from the liquid phase product. If heterogeneous catalysts could be prepared, then separation would become much simpler, and making the process continuous would be easier. Thus, there is a drive at present for the development of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts, especially as a result of FDA regulations for low heavy metal concentrations in the product</p>
