<p class="noindent">If we consider any particular reaction then, in principle, it is possible to manipulate the properties of a catalyst for that reaction by any process that alters the properties of its surface. In thermodynamic terms we may increase or reduce the surface free energy, in microscopic terms we may alter the nature of the individual sites at the surface which are responsible for giving the desired products. <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> lists the ways in which a particular catalyst can be manipulated, and it is in the engineering of the surface in these kinds of ways that the industrial catalytic chemist should be adept. The practical application of catalytic know-how is to maximise the time-yield integral shown in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fig. 3.1</b> The time dependence of catalyst activity to the desired product in a commercial plant operation. The total yield over the life of the plant is dictated by the flow rate (<i>F</i>) multiplied by the time integral of total conversion activity (<i>A</i>) and selectivity (<i>S</i>) to the desired product. For definitions see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">Typically, a catalyst goes through a &#x2018;lining out&#x2019; period during which the performance is unstable as the surface of the catalyst changes, by sintering, segregation and by achieving steady state in surface concentrations of reactants and products. The performance then usually reaches a maximum and thereafter declines. At some point it becomes no longer economical to continue running the catalyst at lower activity and so the plant is shut down and recharged with new catalyst The time-scales of these changes can be very variable depending on the catalyst and process, but can vary from days to years. The industrial scientist maximises this yield by developing varied catalysts and testing them in small-scale reactors. However, the inputs to catalyst design and preparation come from a variety of sources, ranging from fundamental surface science to reactor engineering. With the advent of expert systems and high power computing, catalyst design is close to being a prescriptive discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">In what follows we will concentrate on the effect of additives located on the surface of the catalyst upon the way catalysis proceeds. The effects of altering other parameters have already been considered above. For instance, it is generally the case that changing the size of the active particle alters its activity &#x2013; smaller particles being more reactive due to their higher surface energy. However, at least for very small particles (less than <i>c.</i> 3 nm diameter), other factors can also be affected by sintering. For very small particles, charge transfer to/from the support can be significant, as described above, and can affect the catalysis positively (increase desired product) or negatively (decrease desired product) depending on the nature of the reaction. If reactions at the interface between the support and active phase are important, they become decreasingly important as particle size increases. Sometimes, however, it may be necessary to have lower activity sites present, either to prevent self-poisoning with strongly adsorbed material, or to favour more selective synthesis; as the particle size increases, the close-packed surfaces are favoured and these may be important for some reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">Altering the support material can have dramatic effects for many processes, for a variety of reasons. These are often most significant when the active phase is highly dispersed. Under those circumstances there is often an electronic interaction with the support, which can result in net charging of the particle; boundary effects may also then be important. Such effects are not pronounced for large particles.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall consider the effects of engineering the active phase of the material by placing additives at the surface. In practice, most industrial processes have additives that act as modifiers to the chemistry at the surface.</p>

<p class="noindent">Promoters can be classed as substances which, when added to a catalyst as a minor component, improve one or more of the properties of the material with respect to product formation. These effects are summarized in <a href="#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a>. In very many cases an alkali metal is the promoter and most often it is potassium. A major reason for this is that the compounds of this material (such as the oxide) have low surface energies compared with the metals, which in turn means that they generally segregate to the surface of the catalyst. Thus, although the alkali may be present at only the 1% level, its concentration at the active interface, the surface, can be much greater than this.</p>

<p class="indent">An example of this is in ammonia synthesis catalysis, in which nitrogen and hydrogen are reacted together at high pressure and temperature over an Fe catalyst. Here, potash is added to the material during preparation at the 1% level, yet surface analysis of the material shows that it covers the outermost layers of the catalyst to approximately 10% (discussed further in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). <a href="#tab3.3">Table 3.3</a> gives a list of some of the large-scale industrial catalytic processes that use promoters.</p>
<p class="indent">It was stated above that promoters improve the properties of the catalyst for the reaction, but this can occur in several ways.</p>
<p class="alist">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Activity enhancement. An alkali can directly increase the rate of synthesis.</p>
<p class="alist1">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Selectivity enhancement. A promoter may change the pathway of a reaction to enhance the rate of formation of the selective product.</p>

Sometimes a promoter can appear to have little effect on the initial performance of a catalyst, but can keep it operating longer (see <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). This is often due to either a reduction of the sintering rate or reduction in the build-up of an irreversible poison on the surface with time, due to alteration of the surface chemistry.</p>

<p class="indent">Promoters are usually alkali metals, but can vary more widely than that More generally, they are electropositive elements, often positive ions. An activity promoter operates in the following manner. It activates sites around it, but always acts as a blocker of the site it sits on, since the promoter itself is not active. The effect of this on the site distribution and on the activity of the material is shown in <a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>.</p>

<figure class="fig1" id="fig3.3">
<img src="../images/Fig3.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.3</b> Showing the effect of a promoter on an incoming molecule. A major effect is to lower the energy of LUMOs to allow easier transfer of electrons into them, such orbitals are often antibonding for the molecule and so this effect enhances dissociation.</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The model of the working of a promoter has been the subject of much debate over the years, but a consensus is beginning to emerge with the help of theoretions. This can be pictured as in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>. The ionic species generates an electrostatic field is located at the surface, with the positive part of the field outermost. This field in the region of the promoter and interacts with orbitals of incoming molecules in a way that pulls these levels down in energy such that electron exchange between the solid and the reactant can take place more easily. This electron exchange is often the essential requirement of the initiation of the catalytic process. This changes the binding energies of such molecules, strengthening the binding and easing the pathway of dissociation. These effects have been carefully measured for a number of adsorption systems, an example being oxygen dissociation on silver. The addition of a potassium promoter to a silver catalyst increases the dissociation probability by three orders of magnitude from 10<sup>&#x2013;6</sup> to 10<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> , largely due to a decreased activation barrier to dissociation.</p>
<p class="indent">Poisons tend to be electronegative elements, such as Cl, S, P and C. At the simplest level they block sites on the surface and so reduce the total number of centres of activity. However, they often also induce a field of the opposite polarity to the promoters, which in turn raises molecular energy levels relative to the unpoisoned surface, reduces electron transfer and weakens adsorbate binding. A nice example of this is in the adsorption of CO <a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, Chapter 3 Changing the reactivity of catalytic surfaces</a>on nickel where both the total amount that can be adsorbed and the temperature stability is reduced, as evidenced by the desorption experiment in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a> which measures the adsorbed gas evolving as the surface is heated.</p>

<p class="indent">Poisons can have a positive effect for certain reactions. For instance, in ethylene epoxidation on Ag catalysts, the addition of ppm levels of an organochloride such as ethylene dichloride, leads to the deposition of Cl atoms on the surface and this has a positive effect on the reaction. It improves selectivity from &#x007E;50&#x2013;70%, by preferentially poisoning the non-selective combustion reaction (<a href="#eq3.2">Eqn 3.2</a>) below.</p>

<p class="indent">This is illustrated nicely by single crystal results on Ag(110), which shows this effect at high coverages of Cl on the surface (<a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>). This is thought to be due to restriction of the transition state during the reaction, or to reduced availability of surface oxygen (<a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>). For the former, the transition state for complete oxidation is bigger than for the selective route, because an intermediate is involved which contains at least one more oxygen atom in the complex than in the selective product, ethylene oxide. Alternatively, Cl blocks sites at the surface where oxygen atoms could be <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 3 Changing the reactivity of catalytic surfaces</a>adsorbed and therefore limits oxygen availability in the reaction, slowing up the combustion reaction which <a href="#eq3.2">Eqn 3.2</a> shows to be highly oxygen demanding.</p>

<h2 class="main">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Alloying</h2>
<p class="noindent">The properties of metal or oxide catalysts can be altered by mixing in another metallic or oxide component. Mixed metal alloy catalysts are now widely used in the oil reforming industry. For example, the addition of Re to Pt-based catalysts for naphtha reforming (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) in the early 1970s led to a big improvement in the efficiency of the process. This was largely due to an enhanced lifetime in the reactor, due to reduced carbon poisoning susceptibility. A variety of other alloys can also be used for this process.</p>
<p class="indent">This is just one example, in which the effect of the second metal appears to be mainly on reducing poisoning. However, alloying can have a wide variety of effects which are determined both by the distribution of the second metal in the first and by its chemical properties. Where a second component locates largely depends on the relative sizes and bond strengths of the two elements (<a href="#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>). If there is a large mismatch of atom sizes, then the larger atom tends to be displaced from the bulk to the surface (segregation) and may be totally phase separated from the first. Thus, for Cu and Ag, since the latter is a much bigger atom, it will be pushed out to the surface and indeed these metals do not form good bulk alloys, whereas Ag and Pd, with much closer atomic sizes, do.</p>
<p class="indent">If the bond energy of one metal is much less than another (that is, lower cohesive energy, lower heat of vaporisation) it will also tend to segregate preferentially to the surface, since the stronger bonding element will maximise its coordination in the bulk and surface energy is minimised by terminating with the weaker bonding element. For cases where the atomic size and bond energy are similar, there is a delicate balance of population which depends sensitively on the details of these differences of surface structure, temperature and gas phase composition. A nice example of this specificity is the surface structure of a Cu&#x2013;Pd alloy with 15% Pd in the bulk. In this case the surface terminates with an all Cu outer layer and a 50% mix of Cu and Pd in the second layer.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The chemical effects of alloying are severalfold and again depend on the nature of the solvent and solute atoms. In general, if an &#x2018;inert&#x2019; metal like Au is placed on an active metal, such as Pt, the effect is to dilute the active sites, but it can be more marked than this. If a reaction requires a large ensemble of sites to facilitate it, a small coverage of the second metal can have a dramatic effect on the activity for that step, indeed it can act like a poison. On the other hand, the electronic structure of a metal is intimately connected to the catalytic reactivity, and alloying of d-band metals changes this electronic structure. In turn, this affects the stability of surface intermediates and therefore changes the kinetic pathway and selectivity of catalytic reactions. This effect on stability can be seen in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>, which shows that the alloy described above, with only Cu in top layer, is nevertheless more active for <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Chapter 3 Changing the reactivity of catalytic surfaces</a>formate decomposition to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, producing a peak at lower temperature in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) than for Cu(110).</p>
<p class="indent">Mixing metals in oxides also dramatically affects reactivity. When Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is used for the oxidation of propene, it has very low activity, but is selective to acrolein.</p>

<p class="indent">However, if Fe is doped into the rutile lattice of Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (which is an equal mixture of Sb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Sb<sup>5&#x002B;</sup>) to replace the Sb<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, then an active, highly selective catalyst is formed (FeSbO4). In this case the main effect is on the stability of the oxygen in the lattice, which affects: (i) the surface reactivity and oxygen vacancy formation rate; and (ii) the rate of diffusion of oxygen vacancies into the bulk. The mixed phase material has a near optimum efficiency and is used commercially in a SiO<sub>2</sub> supported, multiply promoted form.</p>

<h2 class="main">3.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Support effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The support can be used as a way of tailoring the performance of a catalyst, particularly if the active phase consists of small diameter particles. The area of the support affects the dispersion of the active phase, which then also tends to have a low surface area if the support is of low area. Impurities in the support can affect catalytic performance. Thus, if Rh is supported on highly pure SiO<sub>2</sub> it tends to produce alkanes/alkenes in synthesis gas (CO/H<sub>2</sub>), whereas on standard silica, oxygenates can be formed. This is due to the presence of impurities of Fe and alkalis which can diffuse onto the metal phase and promote it for oxygenation</p>
<p class="indent">Some supports are reducible in reducing gases (TiO<sub>2</sub>, for example) and the reduced form of the support is often labile and can diffuse onto the metal, giving marked effects on catalytic activity known as SMSIs (strong metal support interactions).</p>
<p class="indent">As described above, the nature of the interface and the dispersion of the metal alter the interaction with the support and to some degree these properties can be used to tailor performance.</p>
