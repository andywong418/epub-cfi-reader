<p class="noindent">The major volume sources of chemicals are coal, oil and natural gas (<a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). The dominant source for the chemicals industry in the early part of the century was coal which was converted to a variety of products by high temperature reaction, and which was used for both domestic and industrial use. The products included coke, town gas for fuel and coal tar for chemicals production.</p>

<p class="indent">The use of coal in the chemical industry was phased out after World War II and replaced with increasing supplies of oil, especially from the Middle East where large reserves were discovered. Oil is converted to a variety of products by cracking, as described in more detail below, ranging from bitumen for use on roads, to petrol for cars, to ethene for plastics production. It is presently the major source of carbon for chemicals production and fuel.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the 1960s there has been increasing use of natural gas in the chemical and fuel sector of the economy, especially in the production of <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 7 Raw materials and their conversion</a>some of the high volume chemical products such as ammonia and methanol. In the former case the hydrogen is extracted from the methane to make ammonia, the carbon is not used and represents a large source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (one plant produces approximately 200,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year). Use of all of these fossil feedstocks results in most of the carbon used being ultimately emitted as CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Some of the solid products (plastics for instance) may end up in landfills and may be converted to methane. Both CO<sub>2</sub> and methane are severe greenhouse gases and evidence is mounting that strong legislation will have to be introduced to reduce annual emissions of this kind. This can be achieved, to some degree, by efficient recycling (of plastics for instance), but is almost certainly going to require new, pollution-free processes, and this will be discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

<h2 class="main">7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Feedstock conversion</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig7.2">Figure 7.2</a> shows the crude pattern of feedstock conversion and products formed. If we begin with the main carbon source for the petrochemical industry, crude oil, then the first process is separation of the fractions of light molecules, intermediates (naphtha) and heavier fractions the latter being of a wide range of molecular weights with carbon numbers greater than 12. This is achieved by fractional distillation, the higher molecular weight species having higher boiling points. The range of boiling temperatures is from ambient temperature, for the light gases, to above 500 &#x00B0;C, for bitumen tars.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Chapter 7 Raw materials and their conversion</a></p>
<p class="indent">The most useful molecules for chemical synthesis and for fuel are produced by catalytic cracking (cat cracking and hydrocracking) of the higher chain length alkenes, to produce molecules closer to C<sub>8</sub> in an unsaturated form. The major reason this is so important is the huge global demand for fuel for vehicles. Some of the molecules, particularly cyclic paraffins, are reformed, again to produce functionality by hydrogen loss and also to open up the rings. This produces fuels with high &#x2018;octane&#x2019; rating which is needed to give fuel the &#x2018;anti-knock&#x2019; characteristics desirable for use in modern engines. The catalysts involved in these various processes are listed in <a href="#tab7.1">Table 7.1</a>. The most useful molecules for chemical synthesis are the short chain alkenes ethene and propene, which are produced in huge quantities from the crackers, though mainly from non-catalytic steam cracking of naphtha.</p>
<p class="indent">Natural gas is now readily available in many parts of the world and so has become widely used in simple molecule synthesis since the 1960s. It is mainly used in ammonia and methanol synthesis, as described in the next section. Methane is a very stable hydrocarbon (hence its abundance in the earth) and so needs rigorous conditions for its reaction and conversion. Currently it is converted by steam reforming, by oxidation or by the use of both processes.</p>
<p class="indent">In steam reforming the gas is heated to high temperature and passes through a tubular reactor containing a catalyst consisting of Ni supported on alumina and is heated to &#x007E;1000 K by burning gas on the outside of the tubes. This results in oxidation of the methane by water and thus production of hydrogen.</p>

<p class="indent">Coal was a major feedstock earlier in this century for the production of synthesis gas. Coal was anaerobically carbonised to produce mainly solid fuel (in the form of &#x2018;coke&#x2019;) and &#x2018;town&#x2019; gas (mainly CO/H<sub>2</sub>), together with small amounts of higher molecular weight synthetic chemical precursors. More recently it has mainly been used in times of emergency to produce fuels and other hydrocarbon products, when oil supplies were cut-off. This was notable in Nazi Germany, when oil could not easily be imported, and in South Africa <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Chapter 7 Raw materials and their conversion</a>during the oil embargo crisis of the Apartheid era. The South Africans built a huge plant at Sasolburg to convert coal to fuels. It used Fischer&#x2013;Tropsch technology invented in Germany. The process involves coal gasification as the first step, that is, steam reforming of coal at very high temperatures.</p>

A great deal of methane is used to make methanol, as shown in <a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>, and the catalyst for the synthesis is a very efficient one operating at low temperatures (&#x007E;520 K) and producing methanol in high selectivity (&#x007E;99%).

<p class="indent">A plant was built in New Zealand to convert gas into fuels and this proceeds by dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether, which then passes through a zeolite catalyst to yield a mixture of products, mainly hydrocarbons, which can then be separated to produce fuels.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus it can be seen that with methane as a feedstock we have all the technology that we need to supply basic chemicals to the chemicals industry and so there should be no technological difficulties with the reduction in oil supply which is coming up in future years.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>From coal</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of coal is similar to that of methane since it can produce a synthesis gas which can be used as the major reactant for other products. One difference is the stoichiometric ratio of CO to the H<sub>2</sub>, since coal has a chemical formula of approximately CH, with much less hydrogen than methane contains.</p>
<p class="indent">The Fischer-Tropsh technology was invented in the 1920s and was developed up to and during World War II; it was used to produce a wide range of products. The catalyst is similar to that for ammonia synthesis and consists of promoted Fe, run at &#x007E;320 &#x00B0;C and 20 atm pressure, although modern plants tend to use Co based catalysts. The range of products from this process is shown in <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>, though the distribution is somewhat different than that from oil cracking, and includes a significant yield of oxygenated hydrocarbons and methane.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>From oil</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Oil is currently the major source of petrochemicals because of its excessive cheapness (excessive because it does not yet take account of global damage inflicted by its use) and its ease of transport. As <a href="#fig7.6">Fig. 7.6</a> shows, all our major industrial organic products can be produced from this source. Major outlets are, of course, fuels of various kinds for petrol and diesel engines and airplanes. Producing the correct balance of these is a tricky business and a variety of catalytic processes are used in the conversion, some are listed above in <a href="#tab7.1">Table 7.1</a>. For instance, in converting (reforming) a n-hexane molecule a variety of reactions can take place, as shown in <a href="#tab7.2">Table 7.2</a>.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 7.6</b> The range of some of the major petrochemical products from crude oil.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent">An important class of catalysts for these conversions includes the bifunctional materials such as Pt, or Pt alloy catalysts on an acidic support (such as fluorinated &#x03B7;-alumina), for general reforming of a feedstock to give a higher octane rating (more aromatics and branched chains) for fuel. Such catalysts are called bifunetional because both the metallic and support components play an active role in the catalysis. The metal facilitates <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 7 Raw materials and their conversion</a>dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions and the acidic support acts on spillover dehydrogenated species to rearrange them. Hydrogen is used in the feed to keep the surface clean of cracked low molecular weight carbon species, which would quickly poison the activity of the metal function.</p>

<p class="indent">A large amount of ethylene is also converted to ethylene oxide and this is the largest volume selective oxidation carried out by industry. It uses a low area Ag catalyst supported on porous &#x03B1;-alumina (sapphire). As usual with selective oxidation reactions, the work of the catalyst is to &#x2018;beat&#x2019; thermodynamics by favouring the production of ethylene oxide as opposed to combustion, which is much more exothermic. This catalysis is discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.

<p class="indent">Thus, a range of technologies exist to produce the major fuels and chemicals required nowadays and all three major hydrocarbon sources, solid, liquid and gas, are used in various parts of the world. Although oil is the least abundant of these feedstocks, it is the most convenient to use for a variety of reasons, including purity, ease of transport and a most appropriate C:H ratio for the main products required. However, the technology is now in place for use of the solid and gas carbon sources, for the time when the oil supply is reduced and prices of the latter become uncompetitive. A more severe problem for the future may be the huge emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> which the use of these carbon sources results in, and this has implications for the kind of catalysis and feedstocks used in the next century, as described further in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="Chapter10.xhtml">10</a>.</p>
