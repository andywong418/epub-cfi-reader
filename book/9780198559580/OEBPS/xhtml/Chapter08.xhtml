<p class="noindent">A great deal of damage has been done to the environment during the last century, mainly associated with the industrialization of society and the greater wealth and materialism of individuals. <a href="#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a> lists the various areas of concern for the global environment. Many of these kinds of pollution are the result of overuse of raw materials, but much of it is due to their careless use, and inadequate attention has been paid to the by-products of these processes in the past. We have the technology in our modern world to solve all these pollution problems given the will and the backing of government. In general, commercial pressures manipulate governments to be lenient in this area; it is the advent of pressure groups, such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and many others, backed by public opinion, which has forced politicians to do something about pollution. That &#x2018;something&#x2019; is enacting legislation, which forces improvements in industrial and individual practices.</p>

<p class="indent">Legislation against pollution was initiated very early on and local laws against coal burning were enacted in European cities as early as the 13th century. More recently legislation in the &#x2018;Clean Air Act&#x2019; in the UK (1956) was introduced after some particularly bad &#x2018;pea-souper&#x2019; smogs in London, which were thought to have been responsible for the deaths of some 4000 people in excess of the normal mortality in 1952. Major pollutants in such smogs are particulates and SO<sub>2</sub>, a severe lung irritant, which is acidic when mixed with moisture in the lungs, and this pollution resulted largely from the domestic consumption of coal as a fuel. As a result &#x2018;smokeless zones&#x2019; were defined in which only cleaner fuels, such as natural gas, could be burned. More recently California initiated legislation to reduce the emissions of CO, NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and hydrocarbons from vehicles after smogs formed in Los Angeles which were thought to be due mainly to these pollutants and their photochemical products. This legislation quickly spread across the USA and more recently around the world, and now most developed countries have restrictions on vehicle emissions. These are classic examples of good leads by politicians via legislation, something which occurs, alas, too infrequently, largely due to dishonesty in some governments induced by donations from interested parties (such as elements of the road building lobby for instance).</p>
<p class="indent">Pollution comes from many sources as indicated in <a href="#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a>, and has many consequences on nature, mainly to weaken it. Nature, of course, includes human beings. Human beings are weakened in our modern society, <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Chapter 8 Catalysis for environmental protection</a>just two of many examples of this being the huge increase in asthma in Western society, caused by a variety of environmental factors, but mainly by pollution, and the big decrease in fertility (sperm count) of males in the last 30 years.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is an economic push (in this case by force of legislation) then scientists can solve most problems. In the first example of catalysis used for environmental protection given in the next section, the reduction of emissions from petrol vehicles will be described. Catalysis, however, can be generally applied to environmental improvement, for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="list-al-n" style="width:65%;">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Processes can be improved in selectivity by the application of catalysts (less by-products).</p>
<p class="list-al-n" style="width:65%;">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>They can be improved in efficiency by lower temperature operation. In the case of oxidation with air this results in less NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission because NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> formation results from direct N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> reaction at high temperatures.</p>
<p class="list-al-n" style="width:65%;">(c)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Catalysts can be applied at the &#x2018;back-end&#x2019; of all processes to remove a significant fraction of the pollutants by further conversion.</p>

<h2 class="main2"><b>The problem</b></h2>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig8.1">Figure 8.1</a> shows the problem with the automobile; it emits noxious chemicals, the major pollutants being CO, NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and hydrocarbons. Reactions in photochemical smog of various of these pollutants produce even more toxic materials (such as peroxyacetyl nitrate, PAN, which is toxic to the lungs in parts per billion). Of these pollutants the automobile is the major source of CO, and contributes &#x007E;25% to total NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions. This, combined with the huge increase in car numbers around the globe in the last 30 years, has put a heavy strain on the environment. Besides the direct human problems caused by such pollution, it is also a source of SO<sub>2</sub> (in small amounts compared with power-stations) and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> which are responsible for the production of acid rain and subsequent destruction of forests and plant life, which, in turn, has knock on effects on higher lifeforms. <a href="#fig8.2">Figure 8.2</a> shows <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter 8 Catalysis for environmental protection</a>an example of the percentage of pollutants emitted by a car engine. The engine usually operates close to the stoichiometric ratio of fuel to air, at which point there is very high production of hydrocarbons, CO and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>. Furthermore, Pb compounds were added to fuel as &#x2018;anti-knock&#x2019; agents, at a level which resulted in several kilograms of lead being emitted into the environment from each engine every year.</p>

<h2 class="main2"><b>The solution</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The solution to this problem is to remove the pollutants from the exhaust, and this is achieved by catalytic conversion. As <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a> shows, high conversion of the main pollutants is achieved close to the stoichiometric ratio by placing a three-way catalyst in the exhaust line of the vehicle.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 8.3</b> Cross-section of a car catalyst with expanded views of the washcoat and active phase.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">The catalyst used is a complex one, which fulfils a variety of functions. It is constructed as shown in <a href="#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>. The framework of the converter is a ceramic monolith constructed of a material called cordierite, which is a Ca/Mg aluminate. It is designed to be strong and both impact and thermal shock resistant. This is very important since the converter can change temperature on starting an engine by 500 K in a short time interval. The monolith has to hold onto the catalyst through this temperature regime and so has a low expansion coefficient. The active phase has a high surface area for optimum activity and so a high area alumina support is deposited onto the monolith by a technique known as washcoating. The whole catalyst monolith is then impregnated with a solution of salts of the main active metals, Pt, Pd and Rh. Modern catalysts also have a number of other additives such as ceria, and a variety of other oxides, often present as oxygen <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Chapter 8 Catalysis for environmental protection</a>storage media to maintain high oxidation in the fuel-rich part of the engine cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">This kind of system is called a three-way catalyst because it can successfully convert the three main pollutants (CO, NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and hydrocarbons) as follows:</p>

However, NO conversion is more difficult, since it has to be reduced, and this is achieved by a number of reactions, the most notable being those shown below.

<figcaption><b>Fig. 8.4</b> Schematic figure of the effect of an oxygen storage oxide on the effective oxygen level in the catalyst. Dashed line, without, solid line, with the storage medium.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">Other components in the catalyst play a multiplicity of roles, but perhaps the most important is in the oxygen storage capacity which has the effect shown in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>. The storage component takes up oxygen onto the surface during the lean cycle, and gives it out during the rich cycle, thus ameliorating the disastrous loss of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> conversion which would occur in the O<sub>2</sub>-rich part of the cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">Legislation is continually driving technology to reduce the damaging emissions from cars, so that current European legislation dictates for the emission levels shown in <a href="#tab8.2">Table 8.2</a>. It should be noted that a great deal of research work is now devoted to the phenomenon of &#x2018;light-off (<a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>), the point in temperature at which the catalyst begins to work. As <a href="#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a> shows, the reason for this effort is clear; most of the emissions detected during a test come during &#x2018;cold start&#x2019;, after the engine is first turned on and before the catalyst has warmed up sufficiently to start working. If this light-off temperature can be reduced significantly, then it will have a major impact on the total levels of pollutants that are emitted from the vehicle.</p>
<p class="indent">Other areas for current work for reduced vehicle emissions are several fold. Some modern cars are of the lean-burn type, that is, they operate on the fuel lean, oxygen-rich side of the stoichiometric ratio (right hand side of <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>). As can be seen in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>, however, conversion of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> is very poor under these conditions for normal three-way catalysts. Thus a new generation of catalysts has had to be designed to cope in this environment which reduce NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> under oxidising conditions. Several classes of catalyst have been devised for this kind of operation. For instance, copper supported on a zeolite material shows very good initial activity for the reaction, but degrades in performance rather quickly in the real exhaust conditions of high temperature and humidity.</p>

<p class="noindent">Of rather more promise are catalysts which have the ability to store NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> during running and this is then removed by injection of a reductant for a short duration into the gas phase (<a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>). Such a system has recently been announced by Toyota and uses Ba as the main NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> storage cation.</p>
<p class="indent">Another area of considerable research activity is the clean-up of diesel emissions, which are characterised by a high level of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and particulates. The latter are soot and sulphate particles, which may be in a highly reactive form, like supported catalysts, with metals such as V and Ni deposited on the surface, these coming mainly from natural components of the oils and from additives used in engine lubrication.<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 8 Catalysis for environmental protection</a></p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 8.7</b> Showing increased NO<i><sub>x</sub></i><sub></sub> conversion under lean-burn conditions, with periodic increases in fuel ratio, where a NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> storage device is used.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent">This is a very difficult problem since such particulates could easily block a ceramic monolith. Thus, a catalytic system for diesel clean-up would have to consist of at least two parts, as shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>, namely, a soot trap and oxidation catalyst, with a following NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> conversion catalyst. Furthermore, all of this has to work at the low temperatures of a diesel exhaust (only &#x007E;200 &#x00B0;C), and, for application in most of the world, has to be sulphur tolerant. Such a system has yet to be developed for commercial use, and it must be said that an easier solution could be to eliminate diesel engines.</p>
<p class="indent">There are presently moves in California to demand zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and 10% of all vehicles sold in California will have to be of this type in the near future; ZEVs are generally electrically powered vehicles. A great deal of effort is going into this area by car manufacturers and the performance of electric vehicles (range and speed) is improving continually.</p>

<p class="noindent">Static sources of pollutants are many and varied and of greatest concern are those which emit gases and liquids. In the former category are power stations (major NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emitters) and industrial operations, while many small and large industries have used rivers as free diluents and transport devices for liquid effluents. Again, legislation is driving for reduced emissions by both methods, especially the latter, which can be easily monitored and regulated.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig8.9">Figure 8.9</a> gives an idealized view of a catalytic clean-up system which consists of a catalyst on the exit of the source. The catalyst may be able to do most of the work on its own, especially for oxygen-rich effluent streams in which the undesired emissions can simply be removed by catalytic oxidation. However, more commonly, oxygen or other reactants will need to be fed into the stream to depollute the emissions reactively. In some cases the added reagent itself may be a pollutant and so careful monitoring of the <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Chapter 8 Catalysis for environmental protection</a>exit stream is required in order to ensure stoichiometric reaction and full conversion. This then requires a fast feedback mechanism to alter the ratio of reactant injected into the effluent line and this is illustrated in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a> and requires the addition of sensors with high molecular sensitivity and selectivity.</p>

<p class="list-no">This kind of clean-up method is used on both the small-scale (e.g. industrial boilers) and the large-scale (e.g. nitric acid plants, waste incinerators, power plants). The catalysts used for such conversions are various, but, for instance, supported vanadium pentoxide makes a stable, active material.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>8.4 Protecting the home environment: the catalytic toilet</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">A fascinating and unusual application of catalysis has recently been developed by Dr. Haruta and co-workers in Japan. There are circumstances in which lavatories are very small cubicles with poor air circulation, with the result that unpleasant odours can be emitted from the toilet itself, and can perhaps remain in the local environment for some time. The group in Japan have developed extremely active catalysts for oxidation of the odorous compounds (mainly amines) within the toilet at ambient temperature. The system is drawn schematically in <a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>a and the catalyst pack is shown in <a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>b. It consists of several parts, but the catalyst is gold/iron oxide supported on a zeolite, and the whole is made on a paper monolith framework. This pack weighs only 40 grams and fits into the toilet air ventilation stream above the waterline. The catalyst can last for 7 years before needing to be replaced.</p>

<p class="indent">The development of this system is a marvellous achievement of catalytic science (even if mundane in application), all the more impressive because of its use of a metal, gold, hitherto widely considered to be useless in the catalytic context. This further presages the advent of catalysis more widely into the domestic scene as discussed in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
