<p class="fm-no1">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fm-in">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Professor Michael Bowker presents an authoritative, clearly written, and elegant account of the fundamentals, practicalities, and applications of <i>Heterogeneous Catalysis</i>. This is a topic of immense industrial and environmental significance so that this Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
