<h1 class="ch-title">I<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fundamentals: what is catalysis?</h1>
<p class="noindent">Catalysis is one of the most important technologies in our modern world. We depend on it to produce materials, such as plastics, from oil; we depend on it to produce fuel to power our cars; we depend on it to remove the pollutants emitted from the engines of those cars; we even depend on it for the functioning and growth of our own bodies. It is therefore very important that we ask ourselves the question, &#x2018;what is catalysis?&#x2019; In this section the fundamental basis of catalysis will be described, focusing largely on the crucial part of a catalyst, namely the surface layer, where all the chemical action takes place.</p>
