<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.1">
<h2 class="main">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Types of catalytic material</h2>
<p class="noindent">Catalysts can take a broad range of forms, and this is reflected in the range of materials produced, and used, by the chemical industry and by nature. Thus they can range from solid materials to biological enzymes, from gas phase molecules to liquid coatings on surfaces. In this section we will highlight the important types of applied industrial catalysts.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common materials used for catalysts are metals and oxides of various kinds. Metals are generally materials of very high surface energy and are therefore very active for many catalytic reactions. Indeed, for a wide range of reactions, particularly selective oxidations (for example, propene to acrolein), they are too active and their use results in poor selectivity for the desired product, mainly with combustion of the valuable reactant molecule. In these cases oxide catalysts are used (for instance, mixed oxides such as FeSbO<sub>4</sub> for propene oxidation), which, although usually less active than metals, give high selectivity for the partially oxidised product.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of these catalysts are not thermally stable in the high surface area form in which they need to be used, and so they are usually prepared as small particles adhering to a refractory support material &#x2013; usually oxides such as alumina or silica. These help to reduce the rate of sintering, especially of metal particles (the effect of sintering was shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.2">Figs 1.2</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.11">2.11</a>). The macroscopic form of the catalyst which is used is strongly dependent on the nature of the reaction, but a selection of types is shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. The simplest form, which is often used in small-scale reactors (microreactors), is a powder. This can be used directly from the preparation, although this will often result in reactor blocking due to the presence of very fine powder. Thus it is usually made coarser by sieving, to use only large particles (say &#x007E;0.1 mm size), or more often the powder is compressed under pressure to form a large tablet, which is then broken up again, and the appropriate range of particle sizes is obtained by sieving. The latter process results in less waste catalyst, a narrower range of particle sizes and generally bigger particles.</p>
<p class="indent">In many cases shape is important for the best use of the material. Powder is generally useless in a large-scale, fixed-bed reactor, because the particles can: (i) get blown out of the bed; and (ii) block the bottom of the bed. The latter results in high resistance to gas flow and a large pressure drop across the catalyst. For a large-scale fixed-bed reactor, which may hold many tonnes of material in a 20 m tall tower, it is crucial that the catalyst is: (i) of a form that can allow significant gas flow with a low pressure drop; and (ii) resistant <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a>to crushing which would result in the reactor blocking with Tines&#x2019;. These properties are achieved by a variety of macroscopically hard shapes and some of these are shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. They can be cylindrical pellets, pellets with holes in them, lumps, spheres or even be in the form of shaped metals with the catalyst coated on the surface. The latter would be useful when good thermal conductivity is essential to enable heat to get to, or from, the reaction mixture efficiently.</p>

<img src="../images/Fig4.1.jpg" alt="images" style="width:70%;"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 4.1</b> Different forms of supported catalyst</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">Some types of industrial reactor, however, require fines &#x2013; very small particle sizes. Such reactors are fluidised bed reactors, which are described in more detail later on (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). Here, the catalyst medium needs to be able to &#x2018;flow&#x2019; in a gas stream, and small particle diameters (often &#x007E;50 &#x03BC;m diameter spheres) are essential for this. Under these circumstances powder may be used, but the choice of support is crucial (alumina, for instance, is very abrasive and may scour the reactor walls) and shape is important (microspheres may be essential).</p>
<p class="indent">A fundamentally important feature of a catalyst must be reiterated here, that is, its high surface area. A pellet of the type shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.1">Figs 1.1</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">4.1</a> earlier, can have a surface area of 100 m<sup>2</sup>, that is, approximately the same area as all the pages of 15 copies of this book (&#x007E;1500 pages). How is this possible in such a small amount of material with an apparent outside area of only 1 cm<sup>2</sup>? The answer lies in porosity. The pellet mentioned contains a range of very small pores, as illustrated in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>. These can be divided into three arbitrary classes</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-27em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The average size of pores in a material is approximately related to the surface area by the following relationship</p>

This relationship is derived simply from the geometry of an open cylinder, and the ratio of cylinder area to volume. Thus, if a sample has 50% porosity, a density of 3 g cm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, and a surface area of 100 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> then the average pore size is &#x007E;3 nm. As shown in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>, this can be a gross oversimplification since a catalyst may contain a wide range of pore types.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Methods of assessing pore sizes and surface areas are described later (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Macropores are essential for most catalysts to enable: (i) efficient penetration of liquids in some preparations, for instance, in incipient wetness methods (<a href="#sec4.4">Section 4.4</a> below); and (ii) efficient flow of reactants to the smaller pores. The smaller types of pores are essential to the high surface area. Most catalysts are mesoporous with an interpenetrating array of variously sized pores. The highest surface area catalysts also have significant amounts of microporosity. For instance, as shown in <a href="#fig4.3">Figs 4.3</a> and <a href="#fig4.4">4.4</a>, zeolite catalysts are often very crystalline; they have very well-ordered, well-defined arrays of micropores, and can have surface areas of as much as 1000 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Zeolites have become very important materials for catalytic processing in recent times. Most zeolites are aluminosilicates based upon a simple tetrahedral building block (<a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). Zeolites are mainly Si based, but the presence of small amounts of Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> in the framework has two main effects: (i) it distorts the lattice, resulting in new crystal structures and pore sizes/shapes; (ii) it is of lower charge, and therefore has to be balanced by the presence of another net charge cation which is exchangeable. The cation in the preparation is often an alkali metal such as Na which can be acid exchanged for a proton, creating a highly acidic site in the zeolite. From the basic tetrahedral unit the sodalite cage can be built (<a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>) and this, in turn, is the building block for a variety of other zeolite structures with different pore and internal cavity sizes. Some of these zeolites are naturally occurring (for example, faujasite), others are man-made (e.g. ZSM5). The latter is now widely used for the catalytic cracking of oil (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a></p>

<figcaption style="margin-left:2em;"><b>Fig. 4.4</b> Models of (a) sodalite cage, (b) sodalite and (c) Zeolite A. The intersects are cation positions.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent">They can also be used, in combination with metals incorporated into the cavities (often by metal ion exchange) for a wide range of catalytic conversions. Recently, a range of mesoporous zeolites have been invented, which may be of some use as catalyst supports with a very specific pore shape.</p>
<p class="indent">Having briefly listed the forms of catalyst that are used in industry and academia, we will now examine what parameters constitute an efficient catalyst for any particular reaction.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.2">
<h2 class="main">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>What makes a good catalyst?</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is a wide range of properties of a catalyst that are required in order for it to be an efficient one for any particular reaction. The foundations of catalyst production are the correct kinetic reaction parameters, that is, high product yield per unit time, and so, as shown in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, the correct active phase is the basis of catalyst preparation. Without this piece in the catalyst development pyramid a successful material will not be obtained, whatever success there is with the other parameters. In order for the yield to be optimised, the catalyst should usually have a high surface area exposed to the reactant, although, for some reactions, we may want a modest surface area to avoid further reaction of an intermediate product. Items 3,4 and 5 in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> can be considered together. The longevity of a catalyst is a very important parameter in catalyst design, and one often ignored by academic workers; it is crucial for the cost effectiveness of a process</p>
<p class="indent">Almost all catalytic processes decay in activity with time, as illustrated earlier in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, and this is due to a variety of contributions as discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> in more detail. The cost effectiveness is determined by the integral under the time&#x2013;yield plot. The bigger it is, the better. It is in this way that the vast majority of patents for new catalysts fail. It is relatively easy to invent a very active catalyst, but such materials usually decay in activity very quickly. The decay is caused by a variety of factors, of which three dominate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a></p>

<p class="list-al">(c)<span class="space">&#160;</span>poisoning &#x2013; loss of activity per unit area</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Point (a) is minimized by the correct preparation procedure in steps 1 and 2 shown in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>. Point (b) is ameliorated by paying attention mainly to step 3, but step 5 also plays a role. Poisoning &#x005B;point (c)&#x005D; can be avoided by using a guard bed at the front of the reactor to trap the poison, and by making use of a great deal of gas &#x2018;scrubbing&#x2019; and clean-up upstream of the reaction bed. It is essential to pay attention to point 5 in order to obtain good gas and heat flow characteristics down the reactor, and to minimise crushing of material at the bottom (which may have a significant weight of catalyst bearing down on it).</p>
<p class="indent">Step 6, shown in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, has become of great significance in recent years, and rightly so. The catalyst must be environmentally compatible in a variety of ways:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="list-al" style="margin-left:2em;width:66%">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>it must minimise toxic by-products in the reaction;</p>
<p class="list-al" style="margin-left:2em;width:66%">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>it must not release toxic materials itself to the environment (e.g. heavy metals) during use;</p>
<p class="list-al" style="margin-left:2em;width:66%">(c)<span class="space">&#160;</span>it must be in a low toxicity form if being dumped after use, or better still, it should be either regenerable or recyclable.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">All of these factors are essential for a successful catalyst, both in terms of current and future legislation limits and, perhaps more importantly, in terms of the fact that chemistry in the future must be seen as a clean, modern technology, not as a science for the poisoning of mankind. Ultimately these factors are also much more cost effective on the global scale.</p>
<p class="indent">On the last step in the pyramid, a process catalyst will fail if the costs of producing it are high compared with the selling price of the product, which in turn relates to competition in the market place, both for the catalyst, for the process, and for the product of the catalysis itself. A very high price can be obtained for a catalyst which can facilitate a new reaction or process. In general terms, a catalyst can be classed as an &#x2018;effect chemical&#x2019; or a &#x2018;higher <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a>added value&#x2019; product. This puts catalysts in the same category of materials as pharmaceuticals, for which the profit margin is often more than 30%.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> it can be appreciated that catalysis is an interdisciplinary subject, requiring knowledge over a range of fields, from fundamental and applied chemistry, through materials science, engineering and business/legal inputs. Successful catalysts can only be produced by the close interaction of all these disciplines and the best organizations in the world at catalytic innovation have research groups set up that involve all of these. The weaker companies who are doing badly at catalytic innovation have resisted such ideas for some considerable time. In the following section approaches to &#x2018;catalyst design&#x2019; will be considered before covering methods of catalyst synthesis in <a href="#sec4.4">section 4.4.</a></p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.3">
<h2 class="main">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Catalyst design methods</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig4.6">Figure 4.6</a> summarises approaches to the integrated design of catalysts. The methodology for most of the era of catalyst production up till the present has been somewhat &#x2018;empirical&#x2019;. The latter word is one which is often used disparagingly, but this is misplaced, since the word is literally meant to describe an experimental approach to problem-solving, an approach upon which most of science is built. However, such an approach can also be rather &#x2018;hit and miss&#x2019;, relying heavily on chance findings and serendipity. There was very little input of detailed theoretical understanding of catalysis, although a deep understanding of synthetic chemistry and chemical properties was essential for the evolution of catalysts in this way. Rather than &#x2018;catalysts by design&#x2019; this approach is better classified as catalyst development.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig4.6">
<img src="../images/Fig4.6.jpg" alt="images" style="width:70%;"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 4.6</b> Catalyst development flow chart; (a) traditional method, (b) modem integrated method.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a></p>
<p class="indent">With advancing theoretical understanding of catalysis, and the development of computational power and so-called &#x2018;expert systems&#x2019;, a new era of &#x2018;catalysis by design&#x2019; is dawning and this approach is also outlined in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>. Here the important point is that targets can be better identified. Let us give an example of this approach, and let us use the case of ammonia synthesis catalysis. The catalyst for this process is an excellent one, evolved over 90 years of experiments, but not essentially very different from that discovered near the beginning of this period. The approach then was entirely empirical, many reactors were used 24 hours a day at BASF to &#x2018;screen&#x2019; materials (ores, for instance) from around the world for the most efficient catalyst. Eventually, Swedish magnetite was identified as the best, it was analysed, and synthetic analogues were produced which contained the essential promoting additives (most importantly potash and alumina). Let us pose a question; how do we make an even better ammonia synthesis catalyst? The current catalyst has been thought to be so good, and to have been around so long, that it was impossible to invent a better one. This is, of course, scientific nonsense, and probably impedes progress in this area. To make a better catalyst we have to look to the fundamental limitations in the reaction and this requires literature input from the surface science and catalysis areas. It is thought that the dissociation of N<sub>2</sub> molecules is slow, and that, in turn, this is limited by the availability of surface sites due to blockage by N adatoms.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1" id="fig4.7">
<img src="../images/Fig4.7.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 4.7</b> A possible way to make an improved ammonia synthesis catalyst &#x2013; by destabilisation of the most abundant surface intermediate, in this case adsorbed nitrogen atoms.</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Thus nitrogen atom recombination and desorption might actually aid synthesis due to reduced self-poisoning &#x005B;a lower steady state N(a) coverage&#x005D;. Thus in designing a new catalyst we would look to a material which has a lower desorption temperature for nitrogen atom recombination than at present (see <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>). Verification that this would indeed be effective lies in the so-called &#x2018;microkinetic modelling&#x2019; method, in which the experimentally determined kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for each step in the reaction are put into a computer, with die mass balance and flow characteristics for a particular reactor. The effect of changing any individual parameter on output can then be assessed. Only changes in those factors associated with the rate determining step should have a significant effect on the production rate, although if such a step is made more efficient another step may become rate determining. Such modelling then feeds back into the catalyst design. Modern synthetic and experimental skills are crucial, then, to produce the desired effect in a real material, but these steps are the essence of catalyst design in die 21st century. Returning to the example cited, the target might be for a material with reduced N(a) stability and this can then be explored for other metals, or for other additives to the current catalyst. However, care must be taken here because very often any individual component has a multiplicity of roles and effects. For example, in current catalysts potash acts as an activity promoter, but also interacts strongly with alumina and may block sites there that are active for NH<sub>3</sub> binding and decomposition. A new generation of catalysts has recently appeared which uses Ru as the main metal component and which indeed appears to have reduced N(a) stability. A further major advantage of the microkinetic modelling method is that it may indicate new areas of temperature, pressure and reactant ratio which may be beneficial for <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a>the reaction. A great limitation of current exploration methods is often that they are carried out under the fixed conditions that are best for current catalysts, but may not be appropriate to new generations of materials. In this respect catalytic innovation is often limited by engineering considerations and the cost of building new plants. Thus, it must be remembered that the catalyst design function is step 1 in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> and must be integrated with the other requirements of any particular company.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.4">
<h2 class="main">4.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The making of catalysts</h2>
<p class="noindent">Catalysts can be made by many of the variety of ways available to chemistry, but here we will restrict ourselves to a summary of the most commonly used methods.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Impregnation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A supported material may be prepared by starting with a high area, porous support, such as alumina, and dosing it with the active phase precursor. This impregnation can be achieved in a variety of ways. It can be done by adsorption of an active phase from solution, that is, by adding the support to a solution of the active ingredient. This method can be modified by precipitation impregnation, in which the active phase is precipitated onto the support by, for instance, a sudden pH change in the mixture, or by chemical reaction. The catalyst then has to be separated by filtering, and much of the solution may be wasted.</p>
<p class="indent">In many ways a more controllable method is the &#x2018;incipient wetness&#x2019; technique. Here, the active phase is added in solution form to the dry powdered support until the mixture goes slightly tacky. This occurs when the pores of the support are filled with the liquid.</p>
<p class="indent">In all these cases the impregnated material is finally dried and then usually calcined (heated in an oven) to some specific temperature which decomposes the precursor active phase to produce either the final active phase, or something close to it.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Slurry precipitation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this case the catalyst is directly produced from the active components by mixing. If we take an example of FeSbO<sub>4</sub> catalysts for propene oxidation or ammoxidation, these can be prepared by warming FeNO<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O to 60 &#x00B0;C, at which point the water of hydration of the salt is released and the nitrate dissolves in it to form a solution. Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is then added, in powder form, to this solution, and the pH is raised by the addition of aqueous ammonia. The final catalyst is produced by drying and calcining to very high temperature which enables ionic interdiffusion to produce the rutile-type FeSbO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Co-precipitation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here the precursor components are mixed and then co-precipitation occurs at a particular pH by addition of other salts, acids or bases. A good example of this method is the production of methanol synthesis catalysts. Here, an intimate mix of nitrates of copper, zinc and aluminium are co-precipitated by <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a>rapid addition of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The gel which is produced is aged (left to change chemical and physical structure slowly), has to be washed to remove Na ions which would otherwise change the selectivity to methanol, and finally has to be dried and calcined. The final active product is a mix of copper oxide, zinc oxide and alumina as the support phase.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Fusion</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The most notable example of this kind of preparation is the ammonia synthesis catalyst for which mainly magnetite, together with small amounts of potash, lime and alumina, are fused at high temperature (&#x007E;1800 K) in a melt. This is then cooled and broken into somewhat irregular lumps of approx. 5 mm diameter. This produces a very low area material with no pore structure. This is only developed when the iron oxide is reduced <i>in situ</i> in the reactor to produce the metallic form, which then has pores where the hydrogen penetrated the material to reduce it.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>The Raney method</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, two metals are mixed, one being leachable in an acid or alkali medium. Thus, Raney nickel is produced from a NiAl alloy, from which the Al is leached with alkali. This leaves a highly porous, highly reactive, high surface area form of the metal, but if done carefully it also leaves some alumina which helps maintain the integrity of the catalyst during use. Such catalysts are used in hydrogenation of unsaturated vegetable oils to produce more &#x2018;spreadable&#x2019; margarine, and in this way much of the food we eat has actually passed through an industrial catalyst first (further details in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Physical mixing</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes good catalysts can be produced in this way. Dry powder of the individual components (e.g. Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the case of the catalyss for propene oxidation, or magnetite, potash and alumina for ammonia synthesis catalysts) are mixed and calcined to high temperature. This can often form a mixed phase by ionic interdiffusion, or can form&#x2019;necking&#x2019; between individual particles. There is some evidence that a synergistic effect is obtained from the mere act of mixing. This is often put down to the ability of one phase to adsorb one reactive component, whereas the other cannot, but this reactant diffuses onto the latter where it reacts to make the product. In general such mixes, although often having surprisingly good characteristics, do not match up to those produced by more sophisticated methods which give a better intimacy of the component ions or elements.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Washcoating</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although mentioned last here, this method is the largest scale industrial catalyst preparation nowadays because it is used in car catalyst production. The monolith support (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>) is the component of these catalysts which gives good thermal shock (rapid heating) resistance, while allowing the exhaust gases to flow at very high velocity. The active phase only coats the outside geometric area of this honeycomb, but a high area is produced by first coating the honeycomb with a so-called &#x2018;washcoat&#x2019; layer, which is <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter 4 Catalytic materials and their preparation</a>basically a highly porous alumina, with a variety of other minor additives for resistance to sintering. Hie final catalyst is then produced by dipping the monolith into a mix of the active components (esp. Pt, Pd and Rh salts), drying and calcining.</p>

<p class="noindent">The final step in the production of many industrial, heterogeneous catalysts, is pelleting to produce the macroscopic form which is used in the plant, examples being shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. This is usually done in two ways. One is high pressure compaction in a pelleting machine, the other is by extrusion of a plasticised version of the catalyst powder. This is in the form of a paste, which is forced through a former (<a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>), in the simplest case producing a cylindrical rod of extrudate which can then be dried/fired to harden the material. A variety of shapes can be produced, however, by appropriate design of the extrusion formers.</p>
