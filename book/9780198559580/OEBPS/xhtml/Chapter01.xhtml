<p class="sidebar">&#x2018;Many bodies have the property of exerting on other bodies an action which is very different from chemical affinity. By means of this action they produce decomposition in bodies, and form new compounds into the composition of which they do not enter. This new power, hitherto unknown, I shall call it catalytic power. I shall also call catalysis the decomposition of bodies by this force.&#x2019; J. J. Berzelius, Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, 21 (1836), 223.</p>

<p class="noindent">Catalysis is an extremely important phenomenon for our modern industrial economy, without it life today would be quite different from the reality we see around us. As one example of this, and perhaps the most widespread application of catalysis today, cars are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce the pollutants (such as NO) leaving the vehicle. There is no doubt that without this technological advance, our cities would be much more severely polluted places than they currently are. Catalysis is a vital technology in today&#x2019;s world. Approximately 90% of all our chemicals and materials are produced using catalysis at one stage or another. In turn, many developed countries are net exporters of such chemicals and thus rely on catalysis for the health of their economies.</p>
<p class="indent">Catalysis is not a new phenomenon, although its wide-scale application by mankind has only really begun in this century. Enzymatic catalysis is essential to all living matter, without it life would not exist. Most fundamental of all of these processes, perhaps, is photosynthesis, a process for energy storage which is used by most of the simplest and earliest evolved lifeforms. After photon capture in chlorophyll and storage of the energy as separated charge, several enzymes operate in the production of sugars, which is the chemical form in which energy is stored, and which is ultimately also used by humans.</p>
<p class="indent">Humans learned to utilize natural catalytic processes very early on, exactly how early is difficult to say, but natural yeasts were used to ferment fruits to yield alcoholic drinks many millennia ago. Indeed, ancient Sumerian physicians prescribed a kind of beer as a &#x2018;pick-me-up&#x2019; for their patients; the prescriptions were written on clay tablets. The natural catalysts in yeast which convert sugar into alcohol are enzymes, and a number are involved in this complex, step by step conversion.</p>
<p class="indent">A more systematic study of the phenomenon began early in the 19 th century. Studies of this process began to accelerate, with a number of notable scientists being involved. Davy began experiments in 1815 on catalytic combustion with Pt gauzes (Pt having then only recently been discovered and extracted). Indeed, the catalytic oxidation of &#x2018;fire-damp&#x2019; on the gauze in the Davy safety lamp (which was designed for use in mines), warned miners that they were in a dangerous area since the gauze would glow in such a gas.</p>
<p class="indent">A little later in the century, Berzelius coined the term &#x2018;catalysis&#x2019; after working in this field of chemistry for a number of years. The quotation shown in the margin gives us a good idea of what catalysis is about, but over the years there have been some misunderstandings regarding the nature of <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 1 The reactive interface</a>catalysis. A catalyst does not appear in the stoichiometric equation for an overall reaction, but it is nevertheless directly involved in the conversion and appears both in individual mechanistic steps, and in the kinetic rate law. A simple example of homogeneous catalysis is ozone destruction, a reaction of importance to the ozone hole phenomenon, as described in the margin.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Here, ozone destruction is catalysed by Cl radical atoms, the Cl is directly involved in the reaction, and an intermediate with Cl in it is formed. Note, however, that Cl is regenerated at the end of the catalytic cycle and that it does not appear in the overall stoichiometric equation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A slightly simplified and updated definition of catalysis might be as follows &#x2013; &#x2018;Catalysis is a process whereby a reaction occurs faster than the uncatalysed reaction, the reaction being accelerated by the presence of a catalyst&#x2019;. Note that acceleration of an elementary reaction step is produced by the catalyst and that at equilibrium (equal rate of forward and reverse reactions) no gain is achieved by the addition of a catalyst &#x2013; under such circumstances the reaction is said to be under &#x2018;thermodynamic control&#x2019; and catalysts are only effective when a reaction is under &#x2018;kinetic control&#x2019;. This will be discussed in more detail later (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.1">Section 6.1</a>). The definition of a catalyst, then, is linked to the definition above, and is given in the margin.</p>
<p class="indent">In the late nineteenth century the application of catalysis accelerated and <a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a> shows some notable dates for the development of a few large-scale industrial processes. Perhaps the most well known of these is the Haber synthesis for ammonia production which was developed in Germany just prior to World War I, thus ensuring supplies of fertilizer which had previously been imported from natural sources in South America. This technology has now been applied world-wide with little modification to the mainly Fe catalyst which was developed then.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A catalyst is a body or a material which can induce the phenomenon of catalysis. It enhances the rate of the catalysed reaction, and while being intimately involved in the reaction sequence, it is regenerated at the end of it.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">In more recent times catalysis has been applied to national defence, for example, to the security of the UK during World War II. The Spitfire fighter aircraft has an heroic place of honour, together with the men that flew them, in the annals of World War II history, particularly in the &#x2018;Battle of Britain&#x2019;. What is less well known is that the application of catalytic innovation was also behind their success. The Spitfires were able to use a new, higher octane fuel derived from catalytic oil cracking technology (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>), which helped give them better acceleration than their opponent aircraft.</p>

<p class="indent">Our present economy is highly geared to the use of catalysis. We produce fuel for our cars by cracking and reforming oil into petrol and diesel using a variety of catalysts. The ethylene and propylene from the cracking of naphtha is used in large-scale polymer production, and we even modify our food using catalysis (spreadable margarine is produced by saturation of the double bonds of unsaturated, free-flowing oils using nickel catalysts). Practically every aspect of modern living is dependent on catalysis and so it is a subject well worth study and understanding.</p>
<p class="indent">This small book is an attempt to spread the understanding of catalysis, and in the next section we begin tins process by considering the nature of the surfaces of materials, since this is where heterogeneous catalysis takes place. The nature of the topmost atomic layer which is exposed to the reactant is crucial to the efficiency of all such processes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Industrial catalysis can be divided into two broad types &#x2013; heterogeneous and homogeneous. Most large-scale, industrially catalysed processes are of the former type, and the widespread recent application of catalysis to car emission control uses such solid catalysts in contact with the gas phase exhaust stream. For these kinds of reaction the nature of the interface is crucial for the efficiency of the process. The nature of the top layer of atoms determines how fast a catalytic reaction takes place and small amounts of additives can reduce (poison) or enhance (promote) the reaction.</p>

The area of the Ag is crucial for efficient catalysis.

This is an image of a very small diameter (approx. 100 nm) Rh hemisphere taken with a special technique called field ion microscopy (FIM) and each bright spot is an atom on the surface of the particle. It is evident that different morphologies are exposed: some flat planes of atoms, some steps, even missing atoms. These atoms all have different coordination at the surface and this affects their ability to bind and react with gas phase molecules.</p>

<p class="indent">This low coordination is the essence of catalysis, and is the driving force for it. The surface is an abrupt termination of the bulk structure and so exposes atoms in an asymmetric environment, with neighbouring atoms only in the surface plane and in the bulk direction. This leaves free bonds at the surface which are available for interaction with incoming molecules. This and the subsequent steps of catalysis are discussed in more detail in <a href="#sec1.3">Section 1.3</a> below.</p>
<p class="indent">The driving force for catalysis then, is these free bonding states at the surface, and, in thermodynamic terms, this &#x2018;catalytic power&#x2019; is represented by the surface free energy, <i>G</i><sub>s</sub>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Because of the termination and asymmetry the surface region is one of high energy, <i>E</i><sub>s</sub>. This energy can be understood in terms of the work it requires to make a surface (<a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>). In real terms this can be felt as the muscle power required to cut through an aluminium bar, or the effort needed to tear a metal foil into two halves, both of these break metal bonds and create new surfaces. The former requires much more effort than the latter because the area of surface created is much higher and more bonds are broken in the process.</p>

<p class="noindent">The molecular level processes involved in product formation are illustrated in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a> for a very simple example, CO oxidation on a metal surface, which is nevertheless practically important because this reaction takes place in automobile exhaust catalysts. The first step is diffusion of the molecules through the gas phase to the metal surface where the molecules may bond (adsorption) in a molecular form.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 1 The reactive interface</a></p>
<p class="indent">Surface diffusion may then occur, and the molecule may dissociate into atoms. For the particular example shown, O<sub>2</sub> dissociates, but CO does not, and this is because of the much higher internal bond strength in CO (1076 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> vs. 500 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for O<sub>2</sub>). The next step is a surface reaction whereby oxygen atoms react with the CO to form the adsorbed product, CO<sub>2</sub>. The surface reaction step is often the rate-determining step in a catalytic reaction. Finally, product desorption occurs, where the product to surface bond is broken and the CO<sub>2</sub> enters the gas phase, diffuses down the catalyst pores, to emerge finally at the end of the reactor. A great deal of engineering expertise is required in catalytic processes in order to manipulate gas phase diffusion. This is because very often the product carries excess energy away with it; in the example above the CO<sub>2</sub> is &#x2018;hot&#x2019; as it leaves the catalyst, due to the high exothermicity of the reaction, and for the safe operation of large-scale reactors this excess energy of reaction must be exchanged, by a variety of heat transfer pathways, with a coolant at the walls of the reactor (<a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>).</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 1.6</b> Schematic diagram of heat transfer in an industrial reactor.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">It is the availability of bonding sites on the catalyst that favours the catalytic process. This provides a lower energy pathway for molecules to rearrange their bonds in the breaking and reforming that is required for a chemical reaction. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>. In the gas phase the reaction activation energy &#x2206;<i>E<sub>g</sub></i> is high, largely because energy has to be expended to break bonds, before bond making begins. On the surface, however, the reacting molecules are anchored during the process, always keeping this bonding which stabilises the intermediates in the reaction.<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 1 The reactive interface</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The result is that the activation barriers are generally lower than for the uncatalysed process and the reaction is kinetically accelerated. A catalyst, then, enhances reaction rates by lowering activation barriers, speeds the approach to equilibrium, but does not affect the equilibrium concentrations.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig1.5">Figure 1.5</a> shows adsorption as the first reactive step in the cycle of heterogeneous catalysis. Strong adsorption is called chemisorption and involves real bond breaking or weakening in the reactant and the making of bonds to the surface. In general, as <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a> shows, this is a thermodynamically &#x2018;downhill&#x2019; process, at least for transition metals, and is the basis of why catalysis works. The solid surface stabilises intermediates by bonding, which in the gas phase would otherwise have unsatisfied valences and a relatively unstable configuration.</p>

The molecule first feels an attractive energy minimum which is weak (physisorption, similar to the forces in liquids), but can dissociate from that state. Otherwise it can dissociate direct from the gas phase, if it has energy higher than the activation barrier. For atoms from the gas phase there is only attraction until they are very close to surface atoms, and a deep energy minimum for adsorption. In (b), this curve is represented in an alternative way and shows what happens to the length of the internal bond in a molecule as it approaches a surface for which adsorption is activated.

<p class="noindent">The energetics of adsorption can be viewed in a simple way using a Lennard&#x2013;Jones-type one-dimensional description, as shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a>, or, in a somewhat more complicated but more realistic way, in terms of <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8b</a>. In <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a> two states of adsorption are shown for the case of a molecule that can dissociate. As the molecule approaches the surface it begins to feel an attractive force due to Van der Waals and mainly electrostatic polarisation effects between the molecule and the solid. At a closer approach the molecule begins to experience repulsion (an increase in energy) due to the increasing proximity of the outer electronic orbitals of the solid and the molecule (Pauli exclusion principle). As a result there is a minimum in energy into which the molecule can be accommodated; this state of adsorption is called physisorption and is associated with weak adsorption, very similar to liquefaction, or condensation onto a cold surface. The heat of adsorption in such a state is very low (&#x007E;20 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), although the exact number depends on the size and complexity of the molecule. The average lifetime of a molecule adsorbed on the surface in this state can be approximated using the Frenkel equation, where &#x03C4; is the surface lifetime, To is the lifetime of a surface vibration (&#x007E;10<sup>&#x2013;13</sup> s) and &#x2206;<i>H</i><sub>a</sub> is the heat of adsorption.</p>

<p class="indent">The lifetime at three temperatures is given in <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a>, for the real example of nitrogen adsorbed at a tungsten metal surface.</p>
<p class="indent">If a molecule, such as nitrogen, is dissociated in the gas phase, then it is in a highly energetic state and bonding to any surface lowers its energy, as shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a>. In this case its energy is lowered to the extent that it adsorbs into a stable, dissociatively adsorbed state, with a net exothermic reaction, even when taking into account the energy used to dissociate the molecule in the gas phase. Again, as the atom is pushed closer to the surface than its equilibrium position, it experiences repulsion between electrons from the solid and its own non-bonding electrons due to Pauli exclusion. This bonding state is called the chemisorbed state and has a wider range of energies, from &#x007E;40 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for weak, molecular chemisorption to &#x007E;600 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for the strongest binding atomic species.</p>
<p class="indent">It is noticeable that the two curves for chemisorption and physisorption cross in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a>, and this gives the possibility of curve crossing of a molecule as it approaches closely to the surface, from the molecular to the dissociated curve. <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a> shows a net activation barrier (<i>E</i><sub>a</sub>) from the gas phase into the dissociated state, though in many cases this barrier may be zero (e.g. oxygen dissociation on most transition metal surfaces). The size of this barrier depends on the solid involved, its surface structure and the nature of the incoming molecule. For instance, for oxygen on most transition metal surfaces this barrier is zero, whereas for Ag it is significant at &#x007E;15 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. This then affects the adsorption probability, which can be written in a simplified form as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">For oxygen on most transition metal surfaces <i>S</i> is close to unity, whereas on Ag at room temperature it is low, at &#x007E;10<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, even for the most reactive surface structures. Often, activated dissociation of the latter type occurs directly from the gas phase, without the molecule being accommodated into the physisorbed state, since dissociation from that state is even more difficult (the barrier in that case being equal to the gas phase activation energy plus the heat of physisorption).</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fig. 1.9</b> Shows a 1-D plot of the activation barrier to adsorption as a function of distance across a surface with a step. Adsorption is difficult on the flat terraces, but much easier on the step which acts as the &#x2018;active site&#x2019; for adsorption in this case.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent">The major difference between the simplified diagram of <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8a</a> and that of <a href="#fig1.8">1.8b</a> is that the former has an axis labelled &#x2018;distance from surface&#x2019;. The problem is that the path taken by the incoming molecule into its final dissociated state may be far from linear and so <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8b</a> gives an alternative view in terms of what&#x2019;s happening to the bond distances within the molecule and between the molecule and the surface. For the case, shown, there is a barrier to dissociation from the molecular state, but it is not simply traversed by impacting with the surface with sufficient energy. In this case, if the molecular bond is significantly lengthened before dissociation, then dissociation is easier; a variety of factors can affect the efficiency of this process, including molecular orientation upon approach (rotation), vibrational state and the structure of the surface. Furthermore, as shown in <a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>, the surface can be considered (at least for highly activated adsorption) to have only certain &#x2018;active&#x2019; areas, where the dissociation barrier is lower than in other parts of the surface. Then a great many collisions with the surface will be ineffective and the adsorption will be inefficient.</p>
