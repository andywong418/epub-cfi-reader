<h2 class="main"><b>10.1 Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In all that has gone before in this book we have considered the fundamentals of adsorption and catalysis and their application to current processes. To conclude, the use of catalysis in the future will be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">The main areas of importance here are threefold: (i) new routes to fuels; (ii) new routes to commodity chemicals from alternative feedstocks; and (iii) new areas of the application of catalysis to environmental protection. However, first we will consider how the process of catalytic invention and development will change as we advance into the 21st century.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>10.2 Catalysts by design: chemistry in cyberspace</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Over recent years the importance of the application of computer technology to the field of chemistry has been realised. Computers are an integral part of the scientific laboratory and office, driving experimental equipment and analysing data. They have now gone beyond this and are being used in new frontiers, in many cases to reduce the need for experimentation or to lead experiments in alternative directions. This has been achieved by the increase in personally accessible computer power as well as by the rapid development of molecular modelling. This is evidenced by the large number of specialist modelling companies now selling products to the chemical industry and academia and this has had an effect in the area of drug design in particular. Catalysis has been rather backward in this area, but in the 21st century it will mature from a &#x2018;black art&#x2019; to a truly predictive scientific discipline by the use of computer-based &#x2018;expert systems&#x2019; which may work broadly as shown in <a href="#fig10.1">Fig. 10.1</a>. This is part of the approach outlined in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>. Experimentation and testing will still be necessary but will be strongly led by such expert systems.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec10.3">
<h2 class="main"><b>10.3 Chemicals from alternative feedstocks</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Many new routes to commodity chemicals are presently under consideration or development. The current use of feedstocks has been outlined in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, oil still being the major source of chemicals and fuels. However, CH<sub>4</sub> and coal are present in much greater quantities on the earth and there is increasing use of these sources for a variety of applications. Their use as alternative routes to fuels and basic chemicals is restricted to a few locations in the world at present, but this is likely to expand in the medium term as the oil price increases due to diminishing production. There are also many possibilities for the conversion of the simple alkanes (<a href="#fig10.2">Fig. 10.2</a>), most of <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Chapter 10 Catalysis for the future</a>which are currently burned as cheap fuels, or are flared off at well-heads. In particular, several possibilities exist for the conversion of methane, including the high temperature coupling to ethene (using oxide-type catalysts initially discovered by Lunsford in Texas) or by direct oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde. Alternative routes using alkanes instead of processes currently using alkenes include, for instance, the ammoxidation of propane instead of propene, and BP America is currently developing catalysts for this process based on VSbO<sub>4</sub> as the active material, and including gas phase reaction modifiers.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>10.4 The fuel of the 21st century: catalytic hydrogen production</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is likely that there will be severe curtailment of the ability of society in the coming century to continue to burn fossil fuels due to the burden of CO<sub>2</sub> upon the atmosphere and its contribution to global warming. This will lead to legislation that will encourage the use of non-greenhouse fuels. A major alternative is hydrogen, since, as shown in <a href="#fig10.3">Fig. 10.3</a>, it enables a clean cycle which, in effect, converts sunlight into power.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a variety of opportunities for the production of hydrogen in this way, for example by the combination of solar photovoltaics and electrolysis, or by electrolysis at hydroelectric plants, but there is also a possible photocatalytic process. This uses photons to provide the thermodynamic impetus to crack water and the catalysis lowers the kinetic barrier to break the OH bonds involved. <a href="#fig10.4">Figure 10.4</a> shows the type of catalysts which are currently being developed for such processes.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 10.4</b> Photoactive catalyst for water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">It is possible that in the next century hydrogen produced in this way will be used for domestic heating and cooking and that it will be used in cars. In particular, in the latter case, and as described in more detail below, fuel cells are likely to be the engines of the next century for motor vehicles. These can be powered by hydrogen, but currently it&#x2019;s more convenient to reform hydrocarbons (such as methanol) to produce hydrogen (and throw away the CO/CO<sub>2</sub> carbon end-product). Again, future legislation may prevent such engines using fossil fuels, in which case hydrogen may have to be stored on board.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec10.5">
<h2 class="main"><b>10.5 New transport options: fuel cells</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">California has pioneered the improvements in pollution emission per car by introducing novel legislation, the most significant being that which led to the introduction of catalysts to the tail pipe of the car to reduce hydrocarbons, CO and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>). California has gone on to make these regulations more and more stringent, something which has kept the industrial catalytic chemists in this field busy for the last 20 years or so. This legislation has spread around the world so that we now have the situation where most developed countries have catalysts fitted to most new vehicles. However, there is still much development to do in this area, such as the application of catalytic depollution to diesel engine vehicles, to trucks and to <a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Chapter 10 Catalysis for the future</a>buses, and to develop lean-burn engines which have high fuel efficiency but reduced NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions.</p>
<p class="indent">However, California is currently legislating for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). Here the emphasis will be on electrically powered vehicles, and there are battery driven cars currently available. However, these generally have a rather limited range, need regular recharging (taking considerable time) and require a heavy load of batteries to work. A more promising alternative is the electrically powered car which has on-board generation in the form of a fuel cell. This is an electrocatalytic device, shown in <a href="#fig10.5">Fig. 10.5</a>, which converts chemical energy (for instance hydrogen/oxygen, or methanol/oxygen) into electrical energy, forming combustion products in the process. In this sense only the H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> powered fuel cell is truly &#x2018;zero emission&#x2019;, others using a fossil fuel as the original C source are CO<sub>2</sub> emitters.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 10.5</b> A simplified diagram of the processes occurring in a catalytic fuel cell.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">Enormous strides have been made in recent times in the development of this technology, such that it appears likely that cars powered in this way will be available early in the next century. Of crucial importance in this area is the continued development of the catalytic side of this story, especially for methanol powered fuels cells where CO is a major contamination problem, poisoning the catalytic effectiveness of the precious metal component and reducing efficiency (i.e. mpg of methanol). This is a rich area for collaborative research between those with an applied interest in such catalysis and those with an academic interest in understanding surface reactivity.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec10.6">
<h2 class="main"><b>10.6 Catalysis in the home</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">This may well be an area for considerable expansion of catalysis, especially for the reduction of indoor pollution. Catalysts do already exist in the home &#x2013;for instance, the catalytic toilet described in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.4">Section 8.4</a>, gas powered hair dryers (using catalytic combustion of butane to produce heat) and in self-cleaning ovens. However, it is now widely recognised that people can be poisoned in the home by gaseous pollutants, either short-term (e.g. CO poisoning from incomplete combustion of methane in gas fired water heaters) or longer term from low levels of CO or formaldehyde (the latter coming from furniture materials and insulating fillers in cavity walls). These can be overcome by the use of high efficiency oxidation catalysts (such as the Au catalyst described in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec8.4">Section 8.4</a>) which could be permanently mounted in the home, perhaps with a gas recycler attached so that the room air is constantly pumped through it.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec10.7">
<h2 class="main"><b>10.7 Catalysis for drugs</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">This area was covered in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, but is set for enormous expansion as the use of catalysis for stereospecific reactions becomes recognised. Legislation is driving for only one form of enantiomer to be present in drugs which are offered for license and for the properties of all isomers to be identified. The body often only recognises one optical isomer for a particular biochemical pathway, the other isomer may be inactive or may be involved in a <a id="page_90" class="page">Page 90, Chapter 10 Catalysis for the future</a>completely different pathway. The major pharmaceutical companies are currently investing considerable sums of money into the development of such processes.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec10.8">
<h2 class="main"><b>10.8 Conclusions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Catalysis is intimately involved in all aspects of our modern society and all organic products are based on processes using catalysts, usually heterogeneous catalysts. They are used to reduce the energy and cost requirements of the process and to reduce polluting emissions from inefficient conversion. The future of catalysis looks extremely bright, especially as it becomes more widely recognised that this technology can bring further improvements to our life. They will be more extensively applied to the development of novel materials and drugs, to more efficient processing, and to reduction of the pollution burden put upon nature by the high activity of the world&#x2019;s human population.</p>
