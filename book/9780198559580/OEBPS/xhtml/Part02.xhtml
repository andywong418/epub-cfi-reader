<h1 class="ch-title">II<span class="space">&#160;</span>Practicalities: what is a catalyst?</h1>
<p class="noindent">A catalyst is a material that can increase the rate of a reaction, while not being consumed in the process. It is intimately involved in the reaction and is not a &#x2018;referee&#x2019;. A referee does not get directly involved in the game, whereas a catalyst is very much involved, as a reagent, in the chemical reaction, but is regenerated at the end of the cycle. In this section we will consider the answers to the question &#x2018;what is a catalyst?&#x2019; by examining what they are physically and chemically composed of, how they are made, what properties make good catalysts, the kinetics of catalytic processes and how the catalytic scientist can determine that the properties needed to make a good catalyst have been achieved.</p>
