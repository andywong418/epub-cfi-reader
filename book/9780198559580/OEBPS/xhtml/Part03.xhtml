<h1 class="ch-title-1" style="text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;">III<span class="space">&#160;</span>Applications: catalysis for the benefit of humans</h1>
<p class="noindent">Catalysis is a beneficial technology for a wide variety of reasons and these can be summarized as follows.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="nlist" style="margin-bottom:1em;text-indent:-1.8em;margin-left:1.8em;"><b>1.</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Environmental efficiency.</b> Catalysts generally enable chemical conversions to take place at lower temperatures, and under milder conditions than would otherwise be necessary. As a result the reactions are also normally less polluting because careful control of the emissions (and their removal with clean-up catalysts) results in less wastage of raw materials and is less costly.</p>

<p class="nlist" style="margin-bottom:1em;text-indent:-1.8em;margin-left:1.8em;"><b>2.</b><span class="space">&#160;</span> <b>Economics</b>. Most countries depend on the petrochemical industry as the basis for their modern, materials-based economies. Most materials are produced by the chemical industry, ranging from plastics to pharmaceuticals, and approximately 90% of all these processes use catalysts at some stage. Without catalysis the nature of modern economics would be completely changed. Life itself is dependent on the use of natural catalysts (enzymes) for cell function and so, without these, life would not have evolved.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, catalysis is an essential phenomenon and in this section we will review some of the main processes to which catalysis is applied for the material benefit of humans.</p>
