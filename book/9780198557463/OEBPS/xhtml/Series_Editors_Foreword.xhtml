<p class="fmnoindent">Understanding the mechanisms of the reactions at transition metal sites is a key component in designing synthetic methods, developing industrial homogeneous catalysts, and investigating metalloenzymes. So this is an essential component in an undergraduate chemistry course.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series will provide explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry. Richard Henderson writes with the authority of a specialist and in a very approachable style. He covers the most important reaction classes from which one can build up more complex reaction sequences.</p>
