<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.1">
<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>A short history</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the period from 1920 to 1950, organic chemistry developed from a series of apparently unrelated facts to a discipline in which the application of a relatively few simple ideas concerning the electronic theory of reactivity resulted in an overall unified picture. This remarkably rapid growth was aided by several simplifying factors: the reaction centre (carbon) was the same in all studies; carbon has a single, stable oxidation state in these systems, a wide variety of compounds had already been prepared and structurally characterized, products were, in general, kinetically controlled and thus mechanistic information could be gained from product analysis experiments; and finally, most of the reactions were relatively slow and could be studied by conventional sampling methods.</p>
<p class="indent">In stark contrast, it was not until the 1950s that chemists started to look systematically at the reaction mechanisms of inorganic systems. The problem facing these early workers was immense: which of the hundred or so elements did they investigate? The problems did not stop there, since most of the elements can assume several different oxidation states, and each of these oxidation states can be associated with a wide range of coordination numbers, and each coordination number may be associated with more than one geometry! Nowadays, we would be spoilt for choice, but back in the 1950s the decision was driven by practicalities. First, in order to probe the mechanism meaningfully a wide variety of structurally characterized compounds were an important prerequisite. Secondly, the reactions had to be sufficiently slow to be studied by conventional sampling techniques, since this was before flow techniques for studying rapid reactions had been developed. Hence we see in the early days that, for instance, substitution mechanisms at octahedral sites were dominated by studies on the cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes developed by Alfred Werner in the nineteenth century, and substitution mechanisms at square-planar sites were preoccupied with platinum(<small>II</small>) complexes, prepared primarily by the Russian researchers.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, of course, our knowledge of inorganic reaction mechanisms spreads across all areas of the periodic table, covering a wide range of reaction types, geometries and coligands (from classical coordination compounds through to organometallics and bioinorganic relevant studies). Inorganic reaction mechanisms is an active area of research and, having played their part in the early development of the subject, studies on the substitution reactions of cobalt(<small>III</small>) and platinum(<small>II</small>) complexes are now <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>
less common. Nevertheless it is these early studies which have established the patterns of reactivity around which the more contemporary studies are judged.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.2">
<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>What is a mechanism and how is it determined?</h2>
<p class="noindent">The aim of this book is to show that the principles of mechanistic chemistry present a unifying description of the multitude of reactions that constitutes transition metal chemistry. However, before we rush headlong into describing the mechanisms of a wide variety of inorganic reactions it is essential that there is a clear understanding of what is meant by the word mechanism. Basolo and Pearson in their classic textbook on inorganic reaction mechanisms, last published in the 1960s, defined the word as, &#8216;All the individual collisional and other elementary processes involving molecules that take place simultaneously or consecutively in producing the overall reaction&#8217;. Thus the mechanism of a reaction describes all the pathways by which a reactant is converted into products. This definition hides the complexity of the problem. If a reaction occurs by just one pathway, we have to define the way in which the reactant&#8217;s ground state becomes activated, the structure of the derived intermediate and the manner in which this intermediate then collapses into product. Also, many reactions occur by several pathways, all of which require a description to the same degree of detail. Thus, mechanistic chemistry is necessarily preoccupied with the nature of the intermediates. Occasionally, these intermediates may attain sufficiently high concentrations to be detected spectroscopically and even more rarely, be sufficiently long-lived to be isolable. Under these circumstances the whole gamut of spectroscopic techniques can be used to probe the species. More frequently though, the intermediate is so short-lived that it cannot be detected directly; now the mechanist must use less direct methods to elucidate the nature of the intermediate. Clearly, if we have to employ these indirect methods then a large amount of circumstantial evidence must be accrued before the characteristics of the intermediate can be convincingly defined. During this process of defining a mechanism, two questions are paramount in the experimenter&#8217;s mind. First, is the proposed mechanism consistent with all the known facts about the system under study? If it is not, then no amount of hand waving will change the fact that the mechanism is wrong. Secondly, once the experimenter is convinced of the mechanism, is there anything that the mechanism predicts which has not been investigated, such as the stereochemical consequences of the reaction?</p>
<h3 class="h3">Designing the system for a mechanistic study</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is clear that if we are to establish the detailed mechanism of any reaction unambiguously, then the system we choose to study must fulfil certain broad prerequisites, as shown in <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>.</p>
<a id="page_3" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 3, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>

<p class="indent">Undoubtedly the most important prerequisite is that the structure of the reactants and the products must be known: determining the kinetics of a reaction in which the product (or even the reactant) is unknown is of no use in mechanistic chemistry. Obviously, a kinetic study cannot define the structure of the reactant. We should also make the system as simple as possible if we are to focus our attention on one aspect of the reaction system. For instance, consider the simple, generalized substitution reaction in <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig1.2" style="width:70%;">

<p class="noindent2">Fig. 1.2</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we wish to understand the factors which influence the simple substitution of X by Y<sup>&#8722;</sup> we do not want secondary reactions involving the loss of the other ligands L to interfere. For this reason it is important to ensure that the remainder of the coordination sphere is essentially inert and merely acts as a spectator to the reaction under investigation. This may require a degree of fine-tuning of the system, involving synthetic chemistry. Finally we need the system to be amenable to perturbation. We need to vary the nature of the spectator ligands or the other reactants in a systematic manner to see how their various electronic and steric influences are reflected in the reactivity of the system.</p>
<p class="indent">Having designed the system which fulfils these prerequisites, we are now able to move on to the detailed mechanistic study, confident that we are targetting that aspect of the system of interest, uncomplicated by irrelevant side reactions. However, it is important to see <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> in its true light. Just because &#8216;mechanism&#8217; occupies the far right-hand box in this figure does not mean that mechanism is the essence of chemistry. To be of true value the results of the mechanistic study should feed back pertinent information to chemistry in general, perhaps indicating new synthetic strategies or at least rationalize the reactivity of the system under investigation. Indeed the results may well have application beyond the realm of fundamental chemistry, and in particular over the last decade, the relevance of <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>mechanistic inorganic studies to problems in bioinorganic chemistry have been much to the fore.</p>
<p class="indent">Currently it is fashionable to discuss studies on biological systems in books on inorganic reaction mechanisms. This will not be attempted in this short text. What does follow in the remainder of this book is a description of the fundamental reactions in transition metal chemistry. These fundamental reactions are the building blocks for understanding, at the atomic level, the multitude of reactions which make up chemical and biochemical reactions. The application of these principles to the understanding of the action of a particular metalloprotein is best left to specialist discussion of the pertinent protein.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.3">
<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Probing the mechanism</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a variety of strategies which the mechanist can use to probe the mechanism of a reaction. In this section, only those that find the most general applicability will be outlined briefly to give the reader an idea of the approaches taken in the studies that make up the remainder of this book.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The rate law</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most important tool for the mechanist is the determination of the experimental rate law associated with the reaction. We are not going to devote space to the discussion of phenomenological kinetics or the techniques used to measure the kinetics of reactions as these are more than adequately covered in other textbooks in the reference section. Suffice it to say that the vast majority of inorganic kinetics are established employing the simplest approach: the method of pseudo first order conditions. In this analysis, the rate constant for the reaction is determined under conditions where all reagents are maintained in a large excess, compared to concentration of one of the reactants. By a series of such experiments, in which the concentrations of the species in excess are changed systematically, the complete rate law can be defined.</p>
<p class="indent">The interpretation of a rate law is reasonably straightforward. For the generalized reaction shown in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> a variety of rate laws may be observed.</p>
<figure id="fig1.3" style="width:70%;">

</figure>
<a id="page_5" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 5, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>
<p class="indent">The rate law cannot be predicted by an inspection of the stoichiometry of the reaction, but only determined by experiment. The reaction may be an overall second order process: first order in the concentration of each reagent; an overall first order reaction: first order in the concentration of either A or B; or an overall third order process: for instance first order in A and second order in B.</p>
<p class="indent">The rate law gives the following information.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;From the kinetic order: the number and types of each molecule participating in the formation of the transition state of the rate-limiting step.</li>
<li>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;From the rate constant: the rapidity of the reaction, allowing the comparison with analogous reactions.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">In interpreting these parameters, the experimenter must arrive at a mechanism that is consistent not only with the rate law, but also with intuitive chemical sense. In general, the mechanism will consist of a series of elementary reactions which describe not only the interactions of the reactants prior to the rate-limiting step, but also those occurring after this slow step, which give rise to the products. The elementary reactions consist of unimolecular or bimolecular processes, since termolecular reactions are statistically unreasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to be clear that the kinetic order of the reaction is not the molecularity of the reaction. As an example consider the system in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>. The third order kinetics clearly do not mean that the reaction is termolecular, rather that in the series of elementary steps leading to the transition state, two molecules of B sequentially interact with one molecule of A. It is important to remember that the kinetic order is determined experimentally, whilst the molecularity of a reaction is a mechanistic interpretation.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately it is a fact of life that the simpler the rate law observed for a reaction, the less certain you can be about the mechanism to which it relates. Consequently many kinetic studies are aimed at trying to perturb the simpler kinetics in order to limit the number of mechanisms with which they are consistent.</p>
<p class="indent">As an example of the sort of problems one encounters in interpreting a rate law, consider the studies on the substitution reactions of cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes (<a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig1.4" style="width:70%;">

<a id="page_6" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 6, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>
<p class="indent">The rate of this reaction shows only a first order dependence on the concentration of the cobalt complex and by analogy with the kinetics of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction at a saturated carbon atom, it could be assumed that this reaction was also dissociative. This in essence is true, but these simple kinetics do not suffice in defining that mechanism. After all, what else would one expect for the kinetics of this reaction? The nucleophile (water) is also the solvent present in such a large excess that any participation by it in the activated complex could not be monitored. In this case the experimenter must take recourse to other parameters which can discriminate between unimolecular dissociation of the cobalt-chlorine bond, and bimolecular attack of water at the cobalt centre.</p>
<p class="indent">Another reaction showing simple kinetics is the substitution of the dinitrogen ligand in <i>trans</i>-[Mo(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] shown in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>. This reaction exhibits a simple first order dependence on the concentration of the molybdenum complex provided the nucleophile is present in a large excess. The observed rate constant under these circumstances is the same, irrespective of the nature of the nucleophile (RCN, RSH or RI), consistent with rate-limiting dissociation of dinitrogen,</p>
<p class="indent">However, at relatively low concentrations of the nucleophile the true rate law is sometimes revealed and is significantly more complicated than that described so far, as shown by the expression in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>. This generalized rate law is derived by treating the five-coordinate, coordinatively unsaturated intermediate as a steady state species. At sufficiently low concentrations of nucleophile the rate exhibits a first order dependence on the concentration of that nucleophile, but at high concentrations of nucleophile k<sub>2</sub>[RCN] &#8811; <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> and the rate of the reaction becomes independent of both the nature and concentration of the nucleophile.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In this latter example, the complexity of the rate law permits a detailed mechanism to be established with a reasonable degree of confidence as to its correctness. The important feature about the derivation of the <a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>
mechanism from the form of the rate law is that only secondary notice is taken of the magnitude of the derived rate constants. Although accurately establishing the numerical value of the rate constant is of importance, we must always bear in mind that this is not an end in itself, and that just accurately measuring the rate constant for a simple, unambiguous process is often of very limited mechanistic value.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Extra-kinetic parameters</h3>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the determination of the rate law at a single temperature, it is sometimes of mechanistic value to study the temperature dependence of a reaction. Over a relatively narrow temperature range, the rate constant changes in accordance with the Eyring equation shown in <a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Derivation of the corresponding values of &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> and &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>, the enthalpy and entropy of activation, for elementary steps in a reaction mechanism give information about whether differences in rate constants for apparently analogous reactions are attributable to bond strength differences (reflected in &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>) or, for instance, specific solvation effects (reflected in &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>). In particular, the determination of whether &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> is positive or negative has been used extensively in the study of substitution reactions to discriminate between dissociative and associative mechanisms. However, as we have already seen, many of the reaction mechanisms are multistep processes with rate laws which are only limiting forms of more complex equations. Consequently, the observed rate constant may in reality correspond to a complicated quotient of elementary rate constants. Measuring the temperature dependence in such a situation is often of limited value since all it tells you is the overall effect of temperature on the combined rate constants.</p>
<p class="indent">In some cases, the influence of temperature on the multistep nature of the mechanism can be used to advantage. For instance, in the reaction shown in <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>, varying the temperature over a relatively modest range gives a distinctly curved Eyring plot.</p>
<figure id="fig1.7">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0007.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 1.7</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This curved behaviour is consistent with a change in the rate-limiting step from deprotonation to dissociation of chloride. Clearly this sort of behaviour will only be evident if the values of &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> for the two steps are significantly different.</p>
<p class="indent">A word of caution about Eyring plots is pertinent at this stage. There is no point in measuring these temperature dependencies over extended temperature ranges (a range of 20&#176;-30&#176;C is normal), since there is no good <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a> reason why the Eyring equation should be valid over a protracted range, and hence any observed curvature may have no mechanistic significance.</p>
<p class="indent">A relatively new parameter which is finding application in a wide variety of mechanistic studies is the volume of activation, &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>, determined by monitoring the effect of pressure on the rate of the reaction. Caution should be exercised when interpreting &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> since it is made up of two components. The two components are:</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;the intrinsic volume change of going from reactants to the transition state, &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup><sub>int</sub>;</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;the volume change associated with solvation effects, &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup><sub>sol</sub>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The term of most interest to most mechanists is &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup><sub>int</sub>, since it relates to changes in bond lengths and geometry upon reaching the transition state. It is not always easy to estimate the relative contributions of &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup><sub>int</sub> and &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup><sub>sol</sub> to &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Electronic and steric effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">These two effects are treated together here since it is often difficult to separate one from the other.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure id="fig1.8">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">One example where steric factors do undoubtedly operate is in the redox reactions of the complex shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the oxidation of these nickel(I) complexes by substitutionally inert cobalt(III) complexes, the rate varies little with the nature of the quadridentale ligand <i>k<sub>tmc</sub>/k<sub>dmc</sub></i> &#x2243; 4. However, in the reactions with other oxidants such as alkyl halides or peroxides there is a large difference in the rate of reaction with the two complexes, <i>k<sub>tmc</sub>/k<sub>dmc</sub></i> = 104&#8211;105. The greater sensitivity of the latter reactions to the substituents is due to these reactants having to bind to the nickel prior to oxidizing it, whereas the inorganic oxidants do not.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, it is easier to establish the electronic influence of substituents on the reaction rate, free from the complications of steric effects. Here, as in organic reactions, extensive use is made of Hammett functions with the substituent far removed from the reaction centre. Often it is the departures from the expected Hammett correlation that gives the most interesting mechanistic insight. For example in the substitution reaction shown in <a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>, there is a good linear correlation between the carbonyl stretching frequency, v<sub>co</sub> and the Hammett &#x03C3; (for the substituent R on the cyclopentadienyl-ring) in both the reactant and the products. The correlation with the rate of the reaction though is not so good.</p>

<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 1.9</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In particular there is a marked deviation from the Hammett o value for the substituents NMe<sub>2</sub> and Cl. Since there is a good correlation with the <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Introduction to inorganic reaction mechanisms</a>carbonyl stretching frequencies (which reflects the electron-density at the rhodium atom through back-bonding), the variation observed in the rate is reflecting an effect on the transition state of the reaction. It has been proposed that the lone pairs of electrons on the substituents can become delocalized over the cyclopentadienyl ring which is only coordinated in an &#x03B7;<sup>3</sup> mode in the transition state of an associative mechanism.</p>

<p class="noindent">If we consider a simple metal complex as shown in <a href="#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>, consisting of a metal surrounded by a number of ligands in a defined geometry (in this case an octahedron), there are three general classes of reactions which can occur.</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;the addition or removal of a ligand <i>substitution;</i></li>

<li>(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;attack at a ligand <i>activation of ligands.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">These three categories make up the main sections of this book, and are the principal reactions associated with transition metal chemistry. Combinations of these processes lead to other well-known reactions typical of these sites. Thus a combination of categories (1) and (2) make up the area of <i>redox-catalysed substitution</i> (<a href="Chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>) and <i>oxidative-addition </i>(<a href="Chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>). A combination of categories (1) and (3) make up <i>insertion reactions</i> (<a href="Chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>), and finally a combination of categories (2) and (3) is associated with <i>redox-catalysed insertion reactions</i> (<a href="Chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent1">The wide range of metal complexes that make up any discussion of inorganic reaction mechanisms means that a variety of reaction rates will be observed, ranging from the so-called &#8216;instantaneous&#8217;, through to those that take several days to complete. The general terminology to describe these widely different reactivities is that sites undergoing very rapid reactions are termed <i>labile,</i> while the sites that react sluggishly are termed <i>kinetically robust</i> or <i>inert.</i> The best working discrimination between these two types of complexes is that a labile reaction is one that is complete within the time of mixing the two reagents.</p>
