<p class="noindent">The oxidative-addition reaction is one in which there is a simultaneous increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal and in its coordination number, as shown in a generalized manner in <a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The molecule designated as YZ in this representation can be a wide variety of species, most importantly: H<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, RSSR, HX, RSH, SiHR<sub>3</sub>, SnXR<sub>3</sub>, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, RCOX, and RX (X = Cl, Br or I). Not all the mechanistic details of all these reactions have been defined. In this chapter we will concentrate on just one system: the oxidative-addition of alkyl halides.</p>
<p class="indent">An important aspect of the oxidative-addition reaction is that the term oxidative-addition does not describe the mechanism of a reaction but is merely a stoichiometric definition of the result of the reaction. As we shall see even for the one substrate, RX, the reaction represented in <a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a> can be accomplished by very different mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent">The types of complexes that undergo the oxidative-addition reaction fall into a relatively narrow group. In general the complexes contain a metal centre with a formal d<sup>8</sup> or d<sup>10</sup> electron configuration, but in addition are coordinatively unsaturated or potentially so, because of their lability. Thus the reactions are restricted to the following: Ru(0), Os(0), Rh(<small>I</small>), Ir(<small>I</small>), Pd(0 or <small>II</small>), and Pt(0 or <small>II</small>). In addition, whereas complexes such as <i>trans-</i>[IrCl(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] are square-planar and formally have two preformed vacant sites ready for interacting with the addition molecule, the species [Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] must dissociate a triphenylphosphine ligand before it can react.</p>

<p class="noindent">Conceptually, the simplest interaction between a metal site and an alkyl halide which results in the oxidative-addition of the latter, is one in which the metal site acts as a nucleophile with respect to the carbon centre, as shown on the left-hand of <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>. This interaction is analogous to the classic S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction in organic chemistry. However, with a metal site acting as the nucleophile other types of interactions are possible, most notably that shown in <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a> in which the metal can interact not only with the carbon centre but also with the halide. In the analogous oxidative-addition reactions of H<sub>2</sub> the initial interaction with the metal is almost certainly analogous to that shown in the right-hand structure.</p>
<p class="indent">These two different geometries for the transition state of the reaction<a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, The oxidative-addition reaction</a> with RX will have different stereochemical consequences on the reaction, both with respect to the alkyl group and the metal site.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Nucleophilicity of the metal site</h3>
<p class="noindent">A wide variety of complexes can act as a nucleophile towards alkyl halides, most notably the following. In group VI: [M(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup> (M = Cr, Mo or W); in group VII: [M(CO)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>-</sup> (M = Mn or Re); in group VIII: [M(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup> (M = Fe or Ru); in group IX: [M(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)(PR<sub>3</sub>)] (M = Co, Rh or Ir) and [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>L]<sup>-</sup> (dmgH = ONC(Me)C(Me)NOH), and finally in group X: [M(PR<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] (M = Ni, Pd or Pt). Within each group the relative nucleophilicities towards alkyl halides varies down the group, however there is no uniform trend. For instance, in group X the relative nucleophilicities are in the order Ni &#62; Pd &#62; Pt, whereas in group IX the order is the opposite, Ir &#62; Rh &#62; Co.</p>
<p class="indent">These metal-based complexes are some of the strongest nucleophiles known, and this has led to them being termed &#8216;supernucleophiles&#8217;. It is very difficult to define a scale of nucleophilicity for all these metal species because of the marked influence of the solvent on the nucleophilicity, and the problem of ensuring that the complex is always acting as a nucleophile rather than switching over to a free radical mechanism, which will be discussed later. However it has been possible to determine the nucleophilicity of some of these complexes. Using the Pearson scale of nucleophilicity, <i>n</i> = <i>k</i><sub>N</sub> / <i>k</i><sub>O</sub> where <i>k</i><sub>N</sub> is the second order rate constant for the attack of the nucleophile on MeI and <i>k</i><sub>O</sub> is the corresponding rate constant for the attack of methanol on MeI. The &#8216;supernucleophilicity&#8217; of the complex, [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>L] is reflected in the value <i>n</i> = 12&#8211;14; this is to be compared with the value for the strong, conventional nucleophiles, CN<sup>-</sup> or I<sup>-</sup> for which <i>n</i> = 7.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to generalize about the relative nucleophilicities of even a single class of metal complex since the ligands have a profound influence on the nucleophilicity. Thus [RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] reacts rapidly with Mel, but simple replacement of one of the phosphine ligands by the more electron-withdrawing carbon monoxide renders <i>trans</i>-[RhCl(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] only poorly nucleophilic towards MeI. Even less drastic changes in the ligand environment of a complex changes the nucleophilicity of the metal centre. This effect has been most extensively studied in [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>L]<sup>-</sup>, where the nucleophilicities varies with the nature of L in the order: 2,6-Iutidine &#62; 2-picoline &#62; pyridine &#62; aniline &#62; 4-cyanoaniline &#62; Me<sub>2</sub>S &#62; SbPh<sub>3</sub> &#62; AsPh<sub>3</sub> &#62; PPh<sub>3</sub>. This series reflects the decreasing &#963;-donor, and increasing <i>&#960;</i>-acceptor strength of L, and hence the decreasing electron density at the metal centre.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Stereochemical change at the carbon</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already mentioned the influence of the transition state geometry shown in <a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a> in defining the stereochemical consequences on the carbon centre. It is of paramount importance that the species whose<a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, The oxidative-addition reaction</a> stereochemistry is being measured is the initial product from the reaction, and not a complex that has undergone subsequent, secondary reactions which have destroyed any stereochemical integrity associated with the nucleophilic displacement process.</p>
<p class="indent">Certainly the most convincing evidence that the complex is acting as a nucleophile, via the two-centre transition state, is the demonstration that the carbon centre undergoes an inversion of configuration as a consequence of the oxidative-addition, as shown in <a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The lack of crystallographic information confirming the absolute configurations of metal-alkyl complexes means that the determination of the stereochemistry at carbon is not a simple or direct experiment, and workers in this field have used a variety of ingenious methods to overcome this problem.</p>
<p class="indent">In the reaction of the iron complex and optically pure 2-bromobutane shown in <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>, the initially formed alkyl complex is reacted with PPh<sub>3 </sub>which induces the migration of the alkyl group onto one of the carbonyl ligands. As we shall see in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> these migration reactions occur with retention of stereochemistry at the carbon centre.</p>

<p class="indent">Subsequent cleavage of the acyl group from the iron site is accomplished by Cl<sub>2</sub>, and since this reagent cleaves the iron-carbonyl bond it does not affect the stereochemistry at the chiral carbon atom. In this way it was shown that the initial reaction of the iron nucleophile with the chiral alkyl bromide occurred with inversion of the configuration at the organic centre. In a similar manner the reactions of [Pd(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] with PhCHDBr have been shown to proceed with inversion of configuration at the carbon centre.</p>
<p class="indent">A direct means of determining the stereochemistry of an alkyl complex is to use an NMR spectroscopic method to distinguish between diastereoisomers. This has been accomplished for the nucleophiles [Mo(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>py]<sup>-</sup> and [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup> in their reaction with <i>erythro</i>-3,3-dimethylbutan-l-bromobenzenesulfonate-l,2-d<sub>2</sub>, as shown in <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Fig. 7.5</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The <i>threo-</i> and <i>erythro</i>-diastereoisomers can be distinguished by their characteristic vicinal coupling constants. In the reaction of the metal nucleophiles with the <i>erythro</i>-sulfonate, the product showed a single AB quartet (&#948; 1.38, J = 4.4 Hz) in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. Independent preparation of the complex containing either the <i>threo-</i> or <i>erythro-</i>diastereoisomer confirmed that the product was the <i>threo-</i>isomer, J = 4.4 Hz, which was very different from the <i>erythro-</i>species, J = 13.1 Hz. Inversion at the carbon centre had been demonstrated.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we have only addressed the stereochemistry of the carbon centre in its reactions with nucleophiles operating via the two-centre transition state. If the reaction operates through the three-centre transition state then one might expect that the reaction will occur with retention of configuration at the carbon centre. Although this remains an intriguing possibility, it has not so far been demonstrated.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidative-addition by radical mechanisms</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, we have seen a mechanism for the oxidative-addition reaction which is dominated by the nucleophilicity of the metal site. As a consequence, the reactivity towards alkyl halides with any particular nucleophile is in the order: RI &#62; RBr &#62; RCl; Me &#62; Et &#62; Pr<sup>i</sup> &#62; Bu<sup>t</sup>, the same as is observed with the more conventional nucleophiles operating by an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. However, there are oxidative-addition reactions in which the order with respect to the alkyl group is the reverse of that shown above: PhCH<sub>2</sub> &#62; Bu<sup>t</sup> &#62; Pr<sup>i</sup> &#62; Et &#62; Me. Also, the oxidative-addition reactions of some complexes are not clean and significant amounts of products other than the alkyl complex are observed, as shown by the example in <a href="#fig7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The rates of these reactions can be sensitive to traces of dioxygen, paramagnetic impurities or light. All these features point towards a free radical mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">Detailed analysis of the reaction between [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> and Mel demonstrated the reaction involved the rate-limiting halogen atom abstraction pathway shown in <a href="#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>. The released methyl radical is scavanged rapidly by a second molecule of [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent">The analogous reaction with EtI produces significant amounts of [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>H]<sup>3-</sup>formed by hydrogen atom abstraction from the ethyl radical and the accompanying evolution of ethylene.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most extensively studied systems that undergoes oxidative-addition by a free radical pathway is the reactions of [Pt(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] with RI shown in <a href="#fig7.8">Fig. 7.8</a>. This reaction gives essentially stoichiometric amounts of [PtI(Me)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>].</p>

<p class="indent">The reaction is rate-limited by iodine atom abstraction. The most important feature of this reaction is the detection of paramagnetic species which are formed after the rate-limiting step. In the presence of MeI, and the radical trap, Bu<sup>t</sup>NO, strong signals attributable to the Pt(<small>I</small>) species and Bu<sup>t</sup>MeNO<sup>-</sup> can be observed directly by EPR spectroscopy. These radicals are not derived from the individual reactants or from secondary reactions associated with the products.</p>
<p class="noindent">Using 6-bromohex-l-ene as the substrate, further evidence for the radical nature of these reactions can be obtained. Using this alkyl bromide<a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, The oxidative-addition reaction</a> some of the product is the cyclopentylmethyl-platinum complex, formed from the rapid (<i>k</i> = 1 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> ) ring closing reaction of the hexene radical formed in the initial bromine atom abstraction step.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to note that the analogous palladium complex, [Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], reacts with alkyl halides by means of the nucleophilic route; clearly the factors which discriminate between the two mechanisms are extremely subtle, and even in the reactions of [Pd(PEt<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] with PhCHDBr at least part of the reaction goes by way of the radical mechanism.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry at the carbon atom</h3>
<p class="indent">When the oxidative-addition reaction is accomplished by the nucleophilic pathway, inversion of the stereochemistry of the carbon centre is usually observed, as noted above. If the reaction operates via a pathway involving an alkyl radical it is clear that we would expect the free carbon radical to lose all &#8216;memory&#8217; of its origins, and thus the reaction to be associated with loss of optical activity at the carbon centre.</p>
<p class="indent">This has been demonstrated in several systems, for instance in the reaction of <i>trans</i>-[IrCl(CO)(PR<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (PR<sub>3</sub> = PMe<sub>2</sub>Ph, PMePh<sub>2</sub> or AsMe<sub>2</sub>Ph) with MeCH(CO<sub>2</sub>Et)Br and in the reaction of [Pd(PEt<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] with PhCHDBr.</p>
<p class="indent">A system which demonstrates another general method of establishing the stereochemistry at a carbon centre using NMR spectroscopy is that employing the 2-substituted bromocyclohexanes, as shown in <a href="#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>. A similar strategy can be adopted using 4-substituted bromocyclohexanes</p>
<figure id="fig7.9" style="width:70%;">

<p class="noindent2">Fig. 7.9</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This technique uses the principle that the bulky metal fragment prefers to enter a less congested equatorial site of the cyclohexyl ring, in so doing this defines the relative position of the 2- or 4-substituent. The stereochemistry of the product can be determined by comparison with the tert-butyl analogues, where again the bulky Bu<sup>t</sup> residue prefers an equatorial site. In particular the magnitude of the coupling constants: J(ax-ax) = 8&#8211;14 Hz &#62; J(eq&#8211;eq) or J(ax&#8211;eq) = 1.7 Hz are a good diagnostic tool.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Discrimination between nucleophilic and radical pathways</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is not a simple matter to know whether the radical or nucleophilic pathway is being followed in any particular oxidative-addition reaction. The relatively brief discussion of this chapter reveals that a metal complex can react with subtly different alkyl halides by different mechanisms, and changes in the ligands on the metal can also dramatically alter the reaction pathway. Clearly, determination of the stereochemistry of the reaction can unambiguously define the pathway, although this probe may not always be available to the experimenter. One simple test of the mechanism is to look at the reactions of alkyl tosylate, ROTs (TsO = <i>p</i>-toluenesufonate). This reagent is reluctant to react via the radical pathway, and hence a rapid reaction with MeI and MeOTs is indicative of a nucleophilic mechanism, whereas a rapid reaction with MeI but slow with MeOTs is more consistent with a free radical mechanism.</p>
