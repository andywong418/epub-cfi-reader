<p class="noindent">Having concentrated on reactions which centre on the metal, either in changing the oxidation state or changing a ligand, we will now briefly address the general reactivity of the ligand. This area of research defines many of the elementary reactions in catalysis involving metal sites, in particular, defining the action of metalloenzymes at the atomic level. For instance, studies on the cleavage of phosphates by metal ions give valuable insight into the hydrolysis of ATP in biochemistry. Also, understanding the factors controlling the attack of hydroxide at organic carbonyl compounds is of direct relevance to the action of the zinc-containing enzymes carboxypeptidase (which specifically cleaves peptides at the peptide carbonyl of the C-terminus) and carbonic anhydrase (which catalyses the equilibriation between CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O). Similarly, understanding the factors that favour the protonation and reduction of coordinated dinitrogen, is important to the understanding of the action of the nitrogenases (which contain iron, together with molybdenum or vanadium and convert dinitrogen to ammonia by a sequence of electron and proton transfer reactions).</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Influence of the metal on the ligand</h2>
<p class="noindent">Simple consideration of the interaction between a metal and a ligand reveals that there are three types of bonding which we must consider, as shown in <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides the lowest energy interaction of &#963;-bonding from the ligand to the metal, the other interactions are &#960;-bonding in nature either in the sense that electron density on the ligand is donated to the metal (&#960;-donation) or the removal of any excess of electron density on the metal back to the ligand (&#960;-backbonding). The relative magnitudes of these three interactions will define the final electron density on the ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">If the dominant characteristic of the metal is that it removes electron density from the ligand through both the &#963;-bonding and the &#960;-donation characteristics, then the electron density on the ligand will be diminished<a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Activation of ligands</a> compared with the situation where it is not bound to the metal. Hence the ligand will be more susceptible to attack by nucleophiles and any bonds within the ligand may be more prone to cleavage. This type of activation of ligands is most associated with &#8216;hard&#8217; metal sites, that is a relatively high formal oxidation state and often a first row transition metal, making complexes that are best described as being electron-poor. The metal that dominates this area of chemistry mechanistically is cobalt(<small>III</small>).</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, if the dominant characteristic of the metal is to push electron density onto the ligand via the &#960;-backbonding then the increased electron density on the coordinated ligand will result in an increased susceptibility to attack by electrophiles and an increased nucleophilicity of the ligand. This type of bonding is most associated with &#8216;soft&#8217; metal sites, that is a relatively low formal oxidation state and often a second or third row transition metal. These complexes are described as being electron-rich.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course the electron density distribution in metal complexes is not as clear cut as implied by the above discussion, and the relative contributions from each type of bond, results in a graduation of reactivities associated with the ligand. For instance, the d<sup>6</sup> &#8216;Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub><sup>3+</sup>&#8217; activates coordinated esters towards hydroxide attack, whereas &#8216;Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub><sup>2+</sup>&#8217; (which is also a d<sup>6</sup> metal) is much less efficient at activating esters in this fashion, but will readily bind dinitrogen: a ligand which binds extensively by &#960;-backbonding. However, the ruthenium site does not release sufficient electron density onto dinitrogen to activate it towards attack by protons. In order to activate dinitrogen towards protic attack we must move to a much more electron-releasing d<sup>6</sup> site, the &#8216;Mo(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#8217; core.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch8.2">
<h2 class="h2">8.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ligand activation by electron-poor sites</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this section we will discuss briefly the two dominant modes of activation of ligands at electron-poor sites: heterolytic cleavage of bonds within the ligand as exemplified by the studies on substituted phosphates, and attack by nucleophiles at the ligand as exemplified by the attack of hydroxide at the esters and amides of coordinated amino acids.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Cleavage of phosphates</h3>
<p class="noindent">The hydrolysis of substituted phosphates occurs by means of a dissociative pathway, as shown in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Binding of the phosphate to a simple labile metal site such as Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> (n = 2 or 3), Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup> (all &#8216;hard&#8217; sites) results in the rapid cleavage of the phosphate, as shown in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>. This increased rate of dissociation upon coordination of the metal is attributable to the metal withdrawing the electron density from the phosphorus-oxygen bond undergoing cleavage. The influence of the metal is entirely one involving polarization of the electron density within the ligand.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Nucleophilic attack at ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">The hydrolysis of peptides, esters, amides, etc., as shown in <a href="#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>, is catalysed by labile &#8216;hard&#8217; metal ions such as Co<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and has been known since the early 1950s.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The generally accepted mechanism for this catalysis as shown in <a href="#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a> was described in these early studies and remains to this day, essentially unchanged. The formation of the five-membered chelate ring is favoured by the large number of labile sites available on these metal centres. The binding of the peptide to the &#8216;hard&#8217; metal ion renders the carbonyl carbon atom more susceptible to hydroxide attack since the metal pulls electron density away from this carbon. This type of activation of the carbonyl functional group is quite general and similar to the electron-withdrawing effect we saw in the hydrolysis of phosphates.</p>
<p class="indent">The uncertainty concerning the binding of the ligand in the studies on these substitutionally labile metal sites can be circumvented by using substitutionally robust complexes. By using simple cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes, such as that shown in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>, the hydrolysis of amino acid derivatives has been defined.</p>
<p class="indent">In the reactions shown, the linear quadridentate trien ligand (H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) acts as a spectator to the reactions occurring at the other two sites, and does not even change its geometrical orientation during the course of the reaction. By using this robust system it is possible to:</p>

<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;establish the geometries of the reactants and any detectable intermediates.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The robust chloro-complex shown in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a> can be activated rapidly by removal of the chloro-group using either Hg<sup>2+</sup> or HO<sup>-</sup> (by a D<sub>cb</sub> mechanism). The site vacated by the chloro-group can then be attacked by either the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ester to form the ring-closed species (top pathway) or by hydroxide (bottom pathway). In the D<sub>cb</sub> reaction, both pathways are observed. Subsequent hydrolysis of the carbonyl group occurs by:</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;the intermolecular attack of hydroxide at the carbonyl carbon of the ring-closed species, or</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;by intramolecular attack of the coordinated hydroxide on the ester, as shown in the bottom line of <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Clearly, in a system based on a labile metal site these two pathways would be indistinguishable. However in the cobalt(<small>III</small>) study it is possible to start with <sup>18</sup>O-labelled glycine ester with the isotopic label specifically in the carbonyl oxygen atom. Now the products of the two pathways can be distinguished. For the intermolecular pathway (involving the ring-closed ester) the product will contain the isotopic label within the chelate ring, whereas in the intramolecular pathway the isotopic label will remain uncoordinated to the cobalt.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar distinction is possible using <sup>18</sup>O-labelled water.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The hydrolysis of carbonyl compounds is quite general and much work has also been done on the analogous amide systems, such as that shown in <a href="#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>. The hydrolysis of the glycine amides occurs about 10<sup>5</sup> times more slowly than the reactions of glycine esters and so it has been possible to isolate the ring-closed species analogous to that shown in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the reactions of the glycine amides, the coordinated hydroxide reacts about 10<sup>2</sup> times faster than external attack of free hydroxide on the chelated amide. Interestingly, coordinated water reacts even more rapidly than coordinated hydroxide.</p>
<p class="indent">At first sight it is a little surprising that the hydroxide coordinated to cobalt(<small>III</small>) is such a good nucleophile in these systems; the cobalt(<small>III</small>) centre is a &#8216;hard&#8217; metal ion and thus a coordinated hydroxide ion would be expected to be significantly less nucleophilic than free hydroxide, since the metal will drain the hydroxide of electron density. Certainly a hydroxide coordinated to cobalt(<small>III</small>) is about 10<sup>8</sup> times less basic than free hydroxide ion. Despite this, the intramolecular pathway, is about 10<sup>9</sup> times faster than the intermolecular route for the reactions of the amides. This increased activity of the intramolecular pathway is due to the coordinated hydroxide being in the correct position, at the correct time to accomplish the hydrolysis reaction. In the intermolecular pathway the hydrolysis of the carbonyl residue has to wait for the arrival of the hydroxide ion from the bulk solvent. An important feature of metal-mediated reactions is the availability of several coordination sites on the same metal to bring reagents close together and hold them in position until the reaction is ready to proceed.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus we see that the role of the cobalt centre in these hydrolysis reactions is not only to polarize the carbonyl group and make it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack, but also to coordinate the nucleophile so that it is in the correct position to accomplish the hydrolysis.</p>
<p class="indent">A further reaction in which a coordinated hydroxide is involved is shown in <a href="#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Again we observe a dramatic increase in the rate of hydrolysis of coordinated nitriles of about 10<sup>11</sup> compared to the free species.</p>

<p class="noindent">Binding of small molecules to electron rich metal sites can result in an increased basicity of that molecule, and hence its ready protonation under conditions where the free molecule is only weakly protonated or not protonated at all. In the same way that activation of ligands at electron-poor sites is dominated by cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes, the activation of ligands at electron-rich sites is dominated by reactions at the &#8216;M(diphosphine)<sub>2</sub>&#8217; core (M = Mo, W, Fe, etc.), at least from a mechanistic point of view. As shown in <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>, molecules as diverse as isonitriles, unsaturated hydrocarbons and dinitrogen are all readily protonated when coordinated to this site.</p>
<p class="indent">Of these examples, the system most well examined mechanistically is the diprotonation of coordinated dinitrogen.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Protonation of coordinated dinitrogen</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reaction of the complexes <i>trans</i>-[M(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (M = Mo or W) with HX (X = Cl, Br or I) in tetrahydrofuran results in the diprotonation of one of the coordinated dinitrogen residues to form the hydrazido(2-)-complex, as shown in <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>. The exact mechanistic pathway chosen depends upon the nature of both the acid and the metal. The general mechanism is shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Fig. 8.8</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The simplest pathway involves monoprotonation of one of the dinitrogen ligands. This has the effect of withdrawing electron density from the metal centre and hence weakening the bonding of the <i>trans</i> dinitrogen ligand, which subsequently dissociates from the metal centre in the rate-limiting <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Activation of ligands</a>step of the reaction. Attack of halide ion at the vacant site generates the diazenido-complex. The coordinated halide is significantly more electron-releasing than the dinitrogen molecule that has just departed and hence increases the basicity of the diazenido-ligand sufficiently to bind the second proton rapidly and form the product. An important feature of these reactions is that the acts of protonation of the dinitrogen residues are extremely rapid, being diffusion-controlled or close to the diffusion-controlled limit.</p>
<p class="indent">At relatively high concentrations of acid, or with the stronger acids (remember that in the aprotic solvents the hydrohalic acids are not &#8216;levelled&#8217;, that is HX is not completely dissociated into H<sup>+</sup> and X<sup>&#8722;</sup>), increasing contributions from a pathway involving diprotonation of the dinitrogen ligand prior to the rate-limiting dissociation is observed. In addition, the contribution from the diprotonation pathway is always more prominent with the tungsten complex than in the analogous reactions with the molybdenum species. This is a consequence of the greater electron-releasing nature of the heavier elements in the group.</p>
<p class="indent">A problem which recurs in studying the protonation reactions of electron-rich sites is the formation of hydrido-complexes formed by proton attack at the metal. This occurs in the reactions based on the &#8216;M(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#8217; core in the reactions with HCl, which ultimately results in the deactivation and dissociation of dinitrogen. However, protonation at the metal need not always lead to deactivation of the dinitrogen and just a subtle change in the reaction site can change the mechanism. As shown in <a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>, the reaction of <i>trans</i>-[Mo(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Et<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] with HCl results in the formation of the hydrazido(2-)-complex but now the initial intermediate detected is the hydrido-species.</p>
<figure id="fig8.9" style="width:70%;">

<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 8.9</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The ethyl-substituted phosphine is more electron-releasing than the corresponding phenyl-derivative. Protons will still bind to the dinitrogen ligand in <i>trans</i>-[Mo(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Et<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] at the diffusion-controlled rate, but once bound to the dinitrogen they do not labilize the <i>trans</i><a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Activation of ligands</a> dinitrogen ligand sufficiently because of the strong electron-releasing capability of the ethyl-substituted phosphine. Consequently, although protons are rapidly binding and dissociating from the dinitrogen ligand the coordination sphere of the complex remains intact. Now the slower protonation of the metal can occur. Protonation at the metal is much slower than the diffusion-controlled limit, in part because of the diffuse nature of the electron density at the metal (there is no stereochemical lone pair of electrons as there is on a terminal nitrogen atom). Protonation at the metal can only occur under conditions where protonation at the dinitrogen is non-productive, as in this case. Protonation of the metal has a strong labilizing effect on the proximal dinitrogen ligands, and rate-limiting dissociation can now occur. As we saw in the previous example, binding of the more electron-releasing chloro-group to the metal renders the remaining dinitrogen residue sufficiently basic that, at high concentrations of HCl, it is able to pick up protons and proceed through to the hydrazido(2-)-product, after dissociating the hydrido-ligand as a proton. At low concentrations of acid the second dinitrogen dissociates before it can be protonated.</p>
<p class="indent">Studies on the other small molecules bound to the &#8216;M(diphosphine)<sub>2</sub>&#8217; core shown in <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>, indicates that similar factors are involved in the protonation of these residues to those described for dinitrogen. The only difference appears to be a more prevalent intramolecular pathway, involving migration of hydrido-groups onto the ligand. Despite many attempts to observe migrations in the reactions of the type shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a> and <a href="#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>, it appears that the reaction of dinitrogen, at least in the initial protonation steps, is dominated by proton addition and dissociation steps.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dialkylation of dinitrogen ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">Despite the superficial similarity between protonation and alkylation of ligands bound to electron-rich sites, studies on the dinitrogen complexes makes it clear that the mechanism of one reaction cannot be used to imply the mechanism of the other. As we have seen in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>, alkyl halides can avoid being attacked by nucleophiles, and this is what happens in the reactions with complexes of the type <i>trans</i>-[M(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(diphosphine)<sub>2</sub>]. The mechanism for the initial alkylation of the dinitrogen ligand involves rate-limiting dissociation of a dinitrogen ligand, as shown in <a href="#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig8.10" style="width:70%;">

<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 8.10</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Once the dinitrogen ligand has departed the alkyl halide, RX, can bind to the vacant site via the halide and subsequently undergoes homolytic fission to give the alkyl radical, which then rapidly attacks the dinitrogen ligand to generate the monoalkylated species. This mechanism is the atom abstraction process we have met before in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#ch6">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7">7</a>.</p>
<a id="page_76" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 76, Activation of ligands</a>
<p class="indent">In contrast to the non-chain, radical pathway for the addition of the first alkyl group to a dinitrogen ligand, the second alkylation step involves a simple nucleophilic attack of the alkyldiazenido-residue on an alkyl halide, as shown in <a href="#fig8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig8.11" style="width:70%;">

</figure>
<p class="indent">This mechanism we have also met before in oxidative-addition reactions. This recurring comparison with the mechanisms observed for the oxidative-addition reactions and the dialkylation of these dinitrogen complexes is no coincidence; the alkylation of dinitrogen complexes can be considered as an oxidative-addition process since the metal increases its formal oxidation state by two units for each addition of an alkyl halide molecule. The only difference between the reactions discussed here and those discussed in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a> is that in the present case, the alkyl group adds to a ligand rather than to the metal.</p>
