<p class="noindent">The detailed understanding of substitution processes relates to several areas of chemistry, for instance, the binding of substrates to the active site in both metalloproteins and homogeneous catalysts. It is also an important feature in many electron transfer reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">In deciding how to present the substitution mechanisms of transition metal centres, there is the problem of assessing which is the most logical approach. Here, as in other texts, the substitution mechanisms will be discussed in terms of the coordination number and geometry of the metal site. Although this is probably the best strategy it has certain limitations which are briefly discussed below. Knowing these limitations the parallels and analogies between mechanisms at very different reaction sites, that are distributed throughout the book can be more fully appreciated.</p>
<p class="indent">The discussion of substitution mechanisms in terms of coordination number has as its main proposition that each coordination type has a particular group of mechanisms which, on the whole, are typical of it, but are different to those observed with other coordination numbers. It is now becoming increasingly clear that this is not the case. Both associative and dissociative mechanisms are now well established in four-, five-, six-, and seven-coordinate complexes. Also, the factors which dictate the relative contributions of these two extreme mechanisms in all types of complexes are the same. There is, however, a more profound problem even within the discussion of, for instance, substitution mechanisms of six-coordinate complexes. Even the most casual of readers would appreciate that there are distinct differences between a complex such as [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub>]. The former contains cobalt (a first row transition metal in group ix) in the +3 oxidation state, is a &#8216;hard&#8217; metal centre with the corresponding set of &#8216;hard&#8217; ligands, whereas the latter contains molybdenum (a second row transition metal in group vi) in the zero oxidation state, is a much &#8216;softer&#8217; metal centre with its corresponding carbonyl ligands. Yet we want to discuss the mechanisms of these two species at the same time, even though they are not soluble in the same <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Substitution mechanisms at transition metal sites</a>solvent. Despite all this though, they do have many mechanistic features in common.</p>
<p class="indent">Back in the early days of inorganic reaction mechanism studies it was contended that the reaction mechanisms of each system were peculiar to itself and that there was no reason why there should be common features, even for the same metal with various coligands. From the descriptions that follow in the remainder of this book, it will become clear that this proposition is not true. There is no point in establishing the principles of a reaction mechanism for one type of system only to find that an entirely different set of principles operates in an analogous system. Mechanistic studies must aim at establishing generalities to be of value to chemistry in general.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General considerations</h2>
<p class="noindent">In considering any substitution mechanism in very general terms it is clear that there are three classes of mechanism, as shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Following the nomenclature devised by Langford and Gray, these mechanisms can be categorized as follows. On the far left hand side is the associative mechanism (A) in which the entering group binds to the reaction centre before any bond weakening of the leaving group has occurred. In this mechanism the reaction profile consists of a single <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Substitution mechanisms at transition metal sites</a> intermediate (containing the entering and leaving group bonded to the reaction centre), and two transition states leading to the formation and decomposition of this intermediate. On the far right-hand side of <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> is the dissociative mechanism (D) in which the leaving group has left the reaction centre prior to any interaction with the entering group. This mechanism has a reaction profile consisting of a single intermediate and two transition states. Now, the intermediate has a lower coordination number than either the reactant or the product. The difference between the profiles for the A and D mechanisms is the relative barrier heights on either side of the intermediates. In the A mechanism the barrier to the decomposition of the intermediate is the larger of the two, whereas in the D mechanism, the formation of the intermediate has the larger barrier height.</p>
<p class="indent">In the centre we see the third possibility, namely that the loss of the leaving group and the approach of the entering group are synchronous. In this mechanism, as the entering group approaches the reaction centre, the leaving group responds in a concerted manner and progressively leaves the site, until the point when the entering group becomes tightly bound and the leaving group is entirely dissociated. This so-called interchange mechanism (I) necessarily has a reaction profile containing no intermediate, only a single transition state.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course these three designations represent only the two extremes and the dead centre of all the possible substitution types that can operate. In reality there is a spectrum of mechanism types which covers all the subtle variations between the I and A mechanisms on the one hand, and the I and D mechanisms on the other. In order to account for these grey areas, and to give them some formal designation, they have been termed I<sub>a</sub> and I<sub>d</sub>, respectively. These mechanisms are best considered as perturbations of the I mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">For the I<sub>a</sub> mechanism, the leaving group does not respond sufficiently rapidly to the approach of the entering group and thus retains a tighter hold on the reaction centre than it does in the I case, right up to the time when the entering group becomes completely bound to the site. On the other hand, in the I<sub>d</sub> mechanism the leaving group is very sensitive to the approach of the other group and readily relinquishes its hold on the reaction centre, even before the entering group has become tightly bound. It can be seen that these subtle variations to the identity of the reaction mechanism are associated with the relative heights of the barriers, and hence the relative energies of the transition states.</p>
<p class="indent">Operationally it is relatively easy to establish that a mechanism proceeds through a D or A mechanism, when the intermediate attains sufficiently high concentration to be detected. However, it is not easy to be so confident as to what the exact intimate mechanism is, in cases where the intermediate is less willing to reveal itself. In the remaining discussions it must be remembered that all pathways can operate in all systems, at least in principle, and which pathway dominates depends on the relative barrier heights associated with the various pathways.</p>
