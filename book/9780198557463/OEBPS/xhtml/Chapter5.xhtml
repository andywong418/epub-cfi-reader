<p class="noindent">In the previous chapter, substitution reactions at a variety of metal sites were discussed. In this chapter we will see how the rates of these substitution processes can be accelerated by base, acid or electron transfer.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Base catalysed hydrolysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The most extensively studied system showing base catalysis is that of the Werner-type complexes of cobalt(<small>III</small>), chromium(<small>III</small>), ruthenium(<small>III</small>), rhodium(<small>III</small>), and iridium(<small>III</small>). Again the majority of the details have been established for the cobalt systems and thus we will concentrate exclusively on the reactions of this element. The initial interest in these reactions was the apparent anomaly that the reaction of hydroxide, such as that shown in <a href="#fig5.1">Fig.5.1</a>, appeared to be an exception to the general rule that the rate of substitution at cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes showed the characteristics of a D mechanism and was independent of the nature and concentration of the nucleophile.</p>

<p class="indent">Also, the reactions with hydroxide were in general several orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding rates of solvolysis typically studied in acidic solution. There was much discussion, mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, concerning the mechanism of this reaction but it is now established beyond doubt that the mechanism is that first described in 1937 by Garrick, which in turn was based on an analogous proposal as early as 1907 by Bjerrum. The now accepted mechanism is that shown in <a href="#fig5.2">Fig.5.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The key feature of this mechanism is the deprotonation of an amine ligand to generate the conjugate base of the complex, which then undergoes dissociation of the leaving group to generate a five-coordinate intermediate. Subsequent attack by water on the five-coordinate, deprotonated intermediate yields the product. The dissociative nature of this mechanism (often the dissociation step is rate-limiting), and the essential formation of the conjugate base has led to this mechanism being labelled D<sub>cb</sub> (dissociative conjugate base). The evidence that favours this<a id="page_36" class="page">page 36, Catalysed substitution reactions</a> mechanism comes from several sources and we shall discuss each separately.</p>

<p class="noindent">Clearly the presence of easily abstracted protons is essential for the D<sub>cb</sub> mechanism to operate. Complexes that are devoid of such protons, e.g. [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>Cl]<sup>3&#8722;</sup> and <i>trans-</i>[CoCl<sub>2</sub>(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, do not undergo a base catalysed reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Another requirement for the D<sub>cb</sub> mechanism is that the protons on the ligands are easily abstracted. In the majority of cases the rate of proton exchange is usually close to the diffusion-controlled limit and is much faster than the dissociation of the leaving group. Thus for [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = 7-100&#215;l0<sup>5</sup>. However, under certain circumstances proton exchange can be rate-limiting; most particularly for the complexes shown in <a href="#fig5.3">Fig.5.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">This demonstration that the act of deprotonation (shown by measuring the rate of proton exchange or investigating the general base catalysis of the reaction) represents one of the best proofs of the D<sub>cb</sub> mechanism.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dissociative mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">The dissociative activation of the vast majority of cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes undergoing the base hydrolysis mechanism is substantiated by the values &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = +80 to +160 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> and &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = +19 to +43 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>. However, the multistep nature of the mechanism means that these parameters relate to the accumulation of several elementary processes making the interpretation of these values ambiguous. Somewhat surprisingly, the values of &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> are independent of whether dissociation of the leaving group or deprotonation of a coordinated amine is rate-limiting.</p>
<p class="indent">Increasing the steric bulk on the complex increases the rate of base hydrolysis, as would be expected if the reaction is dissociatively activated. Thus the reactions of [CoCl(NH<sub>2</sub>Me)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> or [CoCl(NH<sub>2</sub>CHMeEt)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with hydroxide are 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> times faster than that of [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. This increased lability is not due to a change in the rate of deprotonation or acidity of the amine.</p>
<p class="indent">The best evidence that the reaction is dissociatively activated, would come from the demonstration that a five-coordinate intermediate was <a id="page_37" class="page">page 37, Catalysed substitution reactions</a> generated in the base hydrolysis reaction. So far, no five-coordinate intermediate has accumulated in sufficient concentrations to be detected directly by spectroscopic methods, although it is possible to demonstrate the existence of an intermediate of reduced coordination number by competition experiments, such as those illustrated in <a href="#fig5.4">Fig.5.4</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Studies on this system rely on the large difference in sensitivity of the complexes to base hydrolysis depending upon the nature of the leaving group. Thus when the leaving group is chloride, bromide, etc., the base hydrolysis reaction is very rapid, whereas the azide or thiocyanate analogues react very sluggishly. Hence the azide and thiocyanate ions can be used as &#8216;competition ions&#8217; during the base hydrolysis of the chloro- or bromo-complexes.</p>
<p class="indent">Such competition studies have demonstrated the following.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;The competition ratio, [CoY(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> / [Co(OH)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> is linearly dependent on the concentration of Y<sup>&#8722;</sup> as expected from the simple consideration that the more Y<sup>&#8722;</sup> present, the more five-coordinate intermediate will be &#8216;trapped&#8217; by it.</li>
<li>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;The competition ratio is independent of the concentration of hydroxide ion, as expected since the role of the hydroxide is purely catalytic.</li>
<li>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;The least solvated end of the nucleophile, Y<sup>&#8722;</sup>, is captured by the five- coordinate intermediate. Thus for NCS<sup>-</sup> it is the sulfur end which is initially captured by the five-coordinate cobalt atom. Of course the &#8216;hard&#8217; cobalt centre dislikes being bound to the &#8216;soft&#8217; sulfur and relatively rapidly, the system isomerizes to the thermodynamically more stable N-bound isomer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">A key demonstration of the existence of a five-coordinate intermediate is that the competition ratio should be independent of the nature of X, the leaving group. However this is not strictly observed in the cobalt systems: there is a slight variation in the competition ratio depending on the leaving group. A five-coordinate intermediate will only behave independently of its origins, if it has time to equilibrate with its surroundings prior to capture. This means, not only dissociating the leaving group from the metal, but also for the leaving group to have time to leave the solvation shell. If the leaving group is still present in the solvation shell at the time of the intermediate's capture, then it may influence the outcome of the competition between water and Y<sup>&#8722;</sup>; in effect it acts as a &#8216;memory&#8217; for the intermediate.</p>

<p class="noindent">The unusually rapid reactivity of cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes in the base hydrolysis reaction must be ascribed to the extreme lability of the conjugate base. The conjugate base would be expected to be more labile than its conjugate acid purely on charge grounds, since it has one less positive charge. The leaving group is often anionic, and so charge separation problems in the transition state of the dissociation are less for the conjugate base than they are for the parent complex. This effect alone cannot account for the very large differences in reactivity of the acid-base pair. The major labilizing force in the reaction has been proposed to be the formation of a &#960;-bond, by overlap of the lone pair of electrons on the deprotonated amine ligand with the metal as shown in <a href="#fig5.5">Fig.5.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In effect, the overlap of the lone pair of electrons with the metal orbitals pushes the leaving group out, whilst retaining a formal 18 electron configuration at the cobalt.</p>
<p class="indent">That the lone pair of electrons on the amido-ligand overlaps with the orbitals on the metal has been shown in the system shown in <a href="#fig5.6">Fig.5.6</a>.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="fig5.6">

<p class="indent">The two dichloro-complexes differ only in the orientation of the secondary amine protons. As a direct consequence of the act of base hydrolysis both complexes give rise to the same <i>RS</i>-diastereoisomeric product. In order that this can have happened with the <i>RR,SS</i>-diastereoisomer, the secondary nitrogen atom must have become planar during the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The formation of a &#960;-bond is a strongly labilizing force and this has been illustrated with systems of the type shown in <a href="#fig5.7">Fig.5.7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the use of linear quadridentate ligands such as O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> gives rise to species with very different &#960;-bonding capabilities at the secondary amine donors (the only acidic protons in the complex). With the &#945;-<i>cis</i> geometry (top) the constraints of the quadridentate ligand preclude effective overlap of the lone pair of
<a id="page_39" class="page">page 39, Catalysed substitution reactions</a> electrons with the metal orbitals, whereas with the &#946;-<i>cis</i> geometry (bottom) effective overlap is achieved. Consequently the &#946;-<i>cis</i> complex reacts over 10<sup>4</sup> times more rapidly than the &#945;-<i>cis</i> isomer. The rates of aquation of the &#945;-<i>cis</i> and &#946;-<i>cis</i> isomers are essentially the same.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry of base hydrolysis reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to the solvolysis reactions, the base hydrolysis reactions of these cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes occur with extensive rearrangement. However, accurate product analyses show that the product distribution is independent of the leaving group and the isomeric form of the starting material. For instance, for the complexes,<i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-[Co(OH)X(en)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (X = Cl or Br, en = NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), shown in <a href="#fig5.8">Fig.5.8</a>, the distribution of isomeric products, [Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>(en)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, was the same:<i>cis</i> = 7 &#177; 3 per cent,<i>trans</i> = 94 &#177; 3 per cent. This behaviour is not only consistent with a dissociative mechanism, but is also indicative of a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="fig5.8">

<a id="page_40" class="page" style="width:70%;">page40, Catalysed substitution reactions</a>
<p class="indent">Use of the isotopically labelled <i>trans</i>-[CoX(<sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> gives a particularly interesting stereochemical result, as shown in <a href="#fig5.9">Fig.5.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of this isotopic label in such a simple complex, permits determination of the stereochemical consequences of base hydrolysis reaction free from complications such as, stereochemical influences of various coligands, presence of hydrophobic residues on coligands and specific, or localized solvation effects, all of which may introduce a distortion into the stereochemistry of the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The observed product distribution, <i>cis/trans</i> = 1.0, is independent of the nature of X and can be rationalized in terms of a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate in which the site of deprotonation is <i>cis</i> to the leaving group. However there is a restriction on the position of attack of the water on the five-coordinate intermediate, and that is it must attack at the same relative position from which X has left. For an intermediate that has had time to equilibrate with its surroundings, this means attack at the trigonal plane at a site adjacent to the &#960;-bond and would give rise to the observed product distribution, as illustrated in <a href="#fig5.9">Fig.5.9</a>. This study also indicates that it is a <i>cis</i> ammonia ligand which generates the active amido-group.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Base hydrolysis of imido-complexes</h3>
<p class="noindent">A system that has many similarities to the classic base hydrolysis mechanism, is the base catalysed substitution of halide for methoxide in the reactions of <i>trans</i>-[M(NH)X(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (M = Mo or W; X = Cl, Br or I) shown in <a href="#fig5.10">Fig.5.10</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism consists of the rapid deprotonation of the imido-ligand to generate the nitrido-species. Notice here that the nitrido-group is <i>trans</i> to the leaving group but the nitrido-ligand operates such a strong <i>trans</i> labilizing effect that the halide rapidly dissociates. This dominant <i>trans</i> effect is rare in substitution at octahedral sites as we have pointed out before, and is more usual in substitution at square planar geometries.</p>
<a id="page_41" class="page" style="width:70%;">page41, Catalysed substitution reactions</a>

<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.10</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Once formed, the derived five-coordinate intermediate can now be attacked by methoxide. The replacement of a halide by methoxy group renders the nitrido ligand sufficiently basic that it abstracts a proton from the solvent, methanol, to form the imido-product. This change in the basicity of a ligand as a consequence of other changes in the coordination sphere is a general phenomenon which we shall meet again in <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8</a>. The important and rare aspect of this reaction is that the five-coordinate, square-based pyramidal intermediate is sufficiently long- lived, and attains sufficiently high concentrations, that it can be detected and characterized spectroscopically. Its spectral characteristics and reactivity are independent of its origins, entirely consistent with a D mechanism. To be able to monitor the formation and decomposition of a five-coordinate intermediate is not common, since the system has to fulfil some fairly stringent requirements. Not only must the intermediate be formed rapidly, but once formed it must react subsequently relatively slowly; this is often difficult to accomplish in the presence of a coordinating solvent. The success of the <i>trans</i>-[M(NH)X(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> is that the five-coordinate intermediate is impervious to attack by methanol, and reacts only with low concentrations of methoxide ion.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Acid catalysed hydrolysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The influence of acid on the outcome and lability of transition metal complexes is a wide area. The interaction of protons with transition metal complexes can be classified into three types:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;protonation of a ligand which then dissociates from the metal;</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;protonation of a ligand which then labilizes another ligand to dissociation;</li>
<li>(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;protonation at the metal labilizing the substitution of a ligand.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">We shall discuss each of these areas in turn. However, we will restrict our discussion to truly catalytic roles for protons, that, is in which there is no nett consumption of protons. The general types of reactions also extend to reactions which are not catalytic in protons.</p>
<a id="page_42" class="page" style="width:70%;">page 42, Catalysed substitution reactions</a>
<h3 class="h3">Protonation of the leaving group</h3>
<p class="noindent">Protonation of a ligand can facilitate the dissociation of that ligand, particularly when the ligand in question is the conjugate base of a relatively weak acid. The only requirement of the ligand is the availability of a lone pair of electrons to which the proton can bind. Thus for complexes of the type, <i>trans</i>-[CoX<sub>2</sub>en<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (X = F, Cl, Br or I, en = NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), the rate of substitution of the first halide in acidic aqueous media is independent of the acid concentration for X = Cl, Br or I since each of the corresponding acids are strong acids in this solvent. However for X = F the substitution is strongly acid catalysed because of the much weaker acidity of HF in water. The mechanism of the reaction is shown in <a href="#fig5.11">Fig.5.11</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig5.11" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0046.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.11</p></figcaption>
</figure> 
<p class="indent">Protonation of the fluoro-group changes the nature of the leaving group from an anionic species to the neutral HF molecule. This will help the dissociation of the residue since now in the transition state of the dissociation problems of charge separation are not so pronounced: the cationic metal fragment releases the neutral residue from its coordination sphere more readily than it releases an anion.</p>
<p class="indent">This principle of protonating a leaving group is manifest in the non- catalytic acid catalysed hydrolysis of various coordinated oxyanions, particularly at cobalt(<small>III</small>) centres. Probably the most well studied system is the hydrolysis of carbonato-complexes such as [Co(O<sub>2</sub>CO)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. The mechanism of the acid-dependent pathway is shown in <a href="#fig5.12">Fig.5.12</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig5.12" style="width:70%;">

<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.12</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In this system, rapid substitution is observed not only because of the susceptibility of the system to protonation but also because the subsequent cleavage step does not involve any cleavage of a cobalt&#8211;oxygen bond, as demonstrated by the fact that the isotopically labelled oxygen on the carbonato-ligand is retained in the product.</p>
<a id="page_43" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 43, Catalysed substitution reactions</a>
<p class="indent">Another example of protonation of a leaving group is the acid catalysed dissociation of chelate rings in multidentate ligands, as shown by the example in <a href="#fig5.13">Fig.5.13</a>, of the reactions with <i>trans</i>-[FeCl<sub>2</sub>(Et<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>].</p>
<figure id="fig5.13" style="text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0048.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.13</p></figcaption>
</figure> 
<p class="indent">In this reaction the acid is not involved in the dissociation of the chelate ring, rather the initial dissociation occurs without the intervention of protons and is occurring all the time in solution. In the absence of acid the pendant donor atom of the ring-opened chelate rapidly returns to metal. However, in the presence of acid, protonation of the pendant donor atom can effectively compete with the ring-closure reaction, and by binding to the lone pair of electrons, blocks the binding to the metal, leading ultimately in the loss of the chelate. This type of reaction is very general and is found for a wide range of metals, oxidation states and coordination geometries.</p>
<p class="indent">Another general class of acid catalysed reaction is typified by the reactions of <i>trans-</i>[M(O)(OH)(CN)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> (M = Mo, W, Tc or Re) shown in <a href="#fig5.14">Fig.5.14</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig5.14" style="text-align:left;">

<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.14</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Here, protonation of the coordinated hydroxide generates the labile aquo-ligand. Rate-limiting dissociation of the aquo-ligand is followed by rapid capture of the five-coordinate intermediate by the thiocyanate ion.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Protonation of a non-labile ligand</h3>
<p class="noindent">The electronic influence of the proton can be felt at some distance from its binding site, and in this way protonation of one ligand can lead to labilization of another. This behaviour is seen in the protonation of a<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Catalysed substitution reactions</a> dinitrogen ligand in <i>cis</i>-[M(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PMe<sub>2</sub>Ph)<sub>4</sub>] (M = Mo or W), as shown in <a href="#fig5.15">Fig.5.15</a>. Here diprotonation of one dinitrogen ligand (to form a hydrazide ligand) has the effect of withdrawing electron-density from the metal centre and thus labilizing the other dinitrogen ligand and a tertiary phosphine ligand, both of which bond to the metal by &#960;-backbonding from the metal d orbitals to vacant orbitals on the ligand. The decrease in electron-density at the metal upon protonation is reflected in an increased lability of these residues. Indeed the whole basis of this type of labilization is such that it will only operate on ligands that bind to metals by use of synergic bonding.</p>
<figure id="fig5.15" style="text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0050.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 5.15</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Upon dissociation of the dinitrogen and phosphine ligands, the solvent, methanol, can bind to the metal. In so doing, the two coordinated methanol residues each release a proton, thus regenerating the two protons consumed in the initial activating step, and fulfilling the catalysis. Clearly the use of a protic solvent is essential in systems such as this if the reaction is to be catalytic in protons; in an aprotic solvent similar activation of coordinated dinitrogen can occur but the reaction will consume protons. One final point about the mechanism shown in <a href="#fig5.15">Fig.5.15</a> is worthy of comment. The dissociation of dinitrogen and phosphine and their replacement by the more electron-releasing methoxy-residues changes the acidity of the hydrazido(2-)-residue from a relatively strong acid to a relatively weak acid; the same effect as we saw in the base catalysed substitution of [Mo(NH)X(Ph<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Protonation at the metal</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are, surprisingly, few examples where protonation of the metal centre labilizes the system to substitution. One example is the acid catalysed exchange of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>], where it has been proposed that formation of [FeH(CO)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup> labilizes the carbonyl ligands to dissociation. This interpretation is however not unambiguous. In the reactions of acid with complexes containing metals in very low oxidation states, such as in this example, due consideration must be given to the possibility that the acid is behaving not as a proton source but as an oxidant. The effect of one electron oxidizing [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] to [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup> on the lability of the carbonyl ligands would be similar to that of protonation.</p>
<p class="indent">We will meet other examples of protonation at a metal in <a href="Chapter8.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">5.3 Redox catalysed substitution</h3>
<p class="noindent">Changing the oxidation state of a metal can alter the lability of that metal dramatically. It is by making use of this redox property of metal complexes that the substitution reaction can be accelerated. This is best explained by the two examples described below.</p>
<p class="indent">Chromium(<small>III</small>) complexes are substitutionally robust, but the addition of catalytic amounts of chromium(<small>II</small>) results in the rapid substitution of the chromium(<small>III</small>) species by the mechanism shown in <a href="#fig5.16">Fig.5.16</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The chromium(<small>II</small>) species is substitutionally labile and hence binds X<sup>-</sup> rapidly. Subsequent electron transfer to the Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup>Y complex generates the Cr<sup>III</sup>Y species (which is now substitutionally robust) and the labile Cr<sup><small>II</small></sup>Y. The overall effect is the rapid substitution of Y for X at the chromium(<small>III</small>) site.</p>
