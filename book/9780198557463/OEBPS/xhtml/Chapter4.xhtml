<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch4.1">
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Undoubtedly the most common coordination number in transition metal chemistry is six. Consequently a great deal is known about the substitution mechanisms at octahedral sites, but significantly less about these same processes at five- or seven-coordinate sites. We shall see in this chapter that dissociative mechanisms dominate the substitution reactions at six-coordinate species, but associative mechanisms can, in certain circumstances, also operate. There is no need, at least on a mechanistic basis, to differentiate between the classic Werner-type complexes, such as [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, and the systems which fall in the realm of organometallic chemistry, such as [Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub>]. However, it is true that the detailed understanding of substitution mechanisms is greatest for the six-coordinate, Werner-type cobalt(<small>III</small>)complexes, and it is only relatively recently that the factors influencing the substitution mechanisms at organometallic-type sites has received attention. The reason for this is largely historical, in that the Werner-type complexes were the first to be investigated back in the early 1950s, when organometallic chemistry was far from developed.</p>
<p class="indent">The factors which discriminate between associative and dissociative mechanisms in six-coordinate complexes should be the same as those that operate for any coordination number. In particular we will see that for organometallic systems, a few simple principles allow us to understand which mechanism will dominate for coordination numbers from four to eight.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The role of the solvent</h3>
<p class="noindent">We saw in the studies on square-planar complexes that the solvent is actively involved in the substitution mechanism. The solvent also plays an important role in the substitution mechanisms of octahedral complexes, but in a different way. If the generalized substitution reaction shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a> is considered at the crudest level of mechanistic sophistication, it is clear that the reaction can occur by direct substitution of coordinated X for Y or by the initial replacement of coordinated X for solvent followed by the replacement of the solvent molecule by Y.</p>
<p class="indent">This latter pathway is of most importance when the solvent has a reasonably high affinity for the metal site, and indeed dominates the substitution characteristics of the Werner-type complexes performed in <a id="page_24" class="page">Page24, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> water. In contrast, the substitution of the relatively low oxidation state complexes is often performed in solvents with relatively low coordinating power, and hence the reaction proceeds without the intermediacy of a solvento-species.</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="fig4.1"><img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0024.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 4.1</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">It is important to bear in mind that typically the kinetics of these substitution reactions would be studied at only millimolar concentrations of Y, whereas the solvent would be present in several molar concentration (for example, [H<sub>2</sub>O] = 55.5 mol dm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, [MeOH] = 31.3 mol dm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>) and thus is present in such a large excess that it will invariably win in the competition for the vacant site on the metal centre even if it is only a relatively weak nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly, to build up a detailed picture of substitution behaviour at six-coordinate sites we need to understand the details of all the steps shown in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>:</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;the solvolysis reaction;</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;the displacement of coordinated solvent;</li>
<li>(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;the direct replacement of one group for another without the intermediacy of a solvento-species.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> The solvolysis reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In defining the details of the solvolysis reaction we are interested in a common type of entering group, the solvent. One problem in studying this type of reaction is that any kinetic analysis will not reveal the dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of the nucleophile, the solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">The most comprehensive accumulation of data for this type of reaction comes from the studies of classical Werner-type cobalt(<small>III</small>)complexes. For the generalized substitution reaction shown in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>, the reaction is invariably associated with a positive &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> and &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> consistent with a dissociatively activated reaction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, increased steric crowding of the reaction centre by increasingly <a id="page_25" class="page">Page25, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> more bulky coligands leads to an increase in the reaction rate, consistent with the dissociative mechanism. Thus the rate of aquation (displacement of a ligand by a water molecule) of the complexes, Co(NH<sub>2</sub>R)<sub>5</sub>Cl]<sup>2+</sup>, progressively increases as R is varied from R = H to R = Bu<sup>i</sup>.</p>

</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Influence of the leaving group</h3>
<p class="noindent">In these dissociatively activated reactions the nature of the leaving group is of major importance in defining the rate of the reaction. In general, the propensity of the leaving group to depart, correlates with the metal-ligand bond strength, which in its turn is related to the type of site. In relatively crude terms if the metal centre is &#8216;hard&#8217; as in [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>X]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> then the harder ligands will dissociate less readily than the softer ligands. We observe the trend in the first order rate constants: I &#62; Br &#62; CI &#62; F.In contrast, if the reaction centre is &#8216;softer&#8217; (by introducing electron-releasing ligands around the same metal in the same oxidation state) as in[Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>X]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> then the &#8216;hard&#8217; ligands tend to dissociate more readily, F &#62; CI &#62; Br &#62; I.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Influence of the spectator ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">Any substitution reaction is sensitive to the nature of the other ligands around the metal centre, since it is these ligands which help define the relative electron-richness of the metal site and hence its substitution characteristics. However, when compared to square-planar complexes, the reactions of octahedral compounds show a remarkable insensitivity to the nature of the spectator ligands. Thus there is no dominant effect from the <i>trans</i>-ligand as we saw in square-planar substitution; only hydrido-, nitrido- and sulfito-ligands come close to operating a significant, and general, <i>trans</i> labilizing effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Again the most comprehensive collection of data concerning the electronic influences of various spectator ligands is that on the cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes,<i> cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-[Coen<sub>2</sub>ACl]<sup>n+</sup> (en = NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). Two types of labilizing effects are realized in these systems:</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry of the substitution</h3>
<p class="noindent">In general the substitution reactions at an octahedral site occur with complete retention of stereochemistry and, as shown in <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>, this is consistent with a square-based pyramidal five-coordinate intermediate.</p>
<figure id="fig4.4" style="width:70%;"><img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0027.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 4.4</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">However the energy difference between this intermediate and the alternative trigonal bipyramidal form must be very small, since for the complexes [CoL<sub>4</sub> AC1]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> (L = NH<sub>3</sub> or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), if the group A is capable of &#960;-electron donation then stereochemical change is observed giving a mixture of<i> cis</i> and<i> trans</i> isomers. This stereochemical change seems most likely to be a consequence of the &#960;-donation being most effective when the group A is contained within the trigonal plane of a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. Once formed, this trigonal bipyramidal intermediate can then be attacked by the solvent nucleophile. The attack occurs in the trigonal plane of the intermediate, and on purely statistical grounds we would expect that 66.6 per cent of the product would be stereochemically <i>cis</i> (attack adjacent to the group A) and 33.3 per cent of the product would be stereochemically <i>trans</i> (attack opposite the group A).In practice, of course, these statistical values are not observed, at least in part because the sites of attack in the trigonal bipyramid are subject to various electronic and steric factors which leads to discrimination by the nucleophile as to which position is attacked.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span> Displacement of coordinated solvent</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Solvent exchange reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Having replaced the leaving group by a solvent molecule, we now look at the pathways by which the solvento-ligand is replaced by another molecule. One of the simplest reactions, at least conceptually, is the solvent exchange process shown in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>. This type of reaction has been studied for a relatively wide range of transition metal ions in oxidation state n and in. In particular we are able to discuss the effect on the intimate mechanism of the substitution reaction of moving along the first row of the transition metals whilst keeping all the following constant:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;the oxidation state of the metal;</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;the geometry of the metal;</li>
<li>(3)&#160;&#160;the leaving group;</li>
<li>(4)&#160;&#160;the entering group.</li>
</ol>
<a id="page_27" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page27, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a>
<p class="indent">Hence the influence of size, charge and electron configuration on the rate and mechanism can be described.</p>

<figcaption><p class="noindent2">Fig. 4.5</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The experimental problem with this type of this study (as in the previous section) is that the solvent is also the entering group and hence the determination of the rate law of the reaction reveals little about the mechanism. Consequently, our interpretation of the mechanism of the reactions is based on the extra kinetic parameters, primarily &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> and &#916; <i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">From the data shown in <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> it is clear that upon moving from left to right across the first row of the transition metals there is a change from an associative to a dissociative mechanism irrespective of the oxidation state of the metal. Why this should be, is relatively easy to rationalize considering the approach of a water molecule to an octahedral complex, as shown in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">For a six-coordinate metal centre, the direction of attack of the water molecule must be along one of the <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> axes, along which the <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> orbitals point. Consequently if these orbitals are not occupied by electrons then they are ideally suited to accept the pair of electrons from the incoming nucleophile. However, as we proceed across the first period of the transition metals these orbitals become progressively filled with electrons and the now full (or partially filled) <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> orbitals will repel the approaching water molecule, leaving the complex little option but to accomplish the substitution reaction by a dissociative pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">Inspection of the first order rate constants for these exchange reactions shows that a wide range of labilities is observed. For many years these rates, and in particular the kinetic robustness of d<sup>3,</sup> typified by Cr(<small>III</small>), and low spin d<sup>6,</sup> typified by Co(<small>III</small>), were rationalized in terms of the crystal-field stabilization energy associated with these electron configurations in their substitution reactions. Briefly, this stabilization energy is calculated assuming that each electron in a <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> orbital is stabilized by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math>&#916;<sub>0</sub> and each<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> electron is an <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbital destabilized by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math>&#916;<sub>0</sub> (where &#916;<sub>0</sub> is the energy separation between the <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> and <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbitals in an octahedral field). Thus for high spin Cr(<small>II</small>), <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> <sup>3</sup><i>e</i><sub>g</sub><sup>1</sup> ion, the crystal-field stabilization energy is 3(<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math>&#916;<sub>0</sub>) + (&#8722;<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math>&#916;<sub>0</sub>) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math>&#916;<sub>0</sub>. A similar calculation is then performed on the putative intermediate structures (square-based pyramid or trigonal bipyramid for dissociative mechanisms, and pentagonal bipyramid or octahedral wedge for associative mechanisms). The difference in the stabilization energies for the octahedral and intermediate structures is the crystal-field activation energy (CFAE), which is a contributor to the total activation energy of the system. This calculation is particularly successful in predicting that the CFAE is at a maximum at d<sup>3</sup>, low spin d<sup>6</sup> and d<sup>8</sup> ions, which consequently are the most robust species kinetically. This rationalization may be largely fortuitous since CFAE contributes only a small part to the total activation energy and there are many other factors which control whether a site reacts rapidly or slowly. However it must be remembered that a full or half full-shell of electrons imparts a degree of kinetic robustness on the metal ion. Thus we would expect to see relatively low rates of substitution for metal ions with d<sup>3</sup>, d<sup>5</sup> (high spin) and d<sup>6</sup> (low spin) configurations.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Substitution of coordinated solvent</h3>
<p class="noindent">Having considered the simple exchange reaction of the first row transition metal ions, we next consider what happens to the reactivity pattern when the nature of the entering group is changed. In essence, we would expect only relatively minor changes to the reactivity pattern described above. Any changes would reflect the varying nucleophilicity of the entering group. A large number of studies on a wide range of complexes with electron configurations d<sup>0</sup> to d<sup>10</sup> and in a wide variety of coordination numbers has shown that the intimate mechanism of substitution of the metal ions is the Eigen-Wilkins mechanism shown in <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this mechanism the initial step involves an outer sphere association of the nucleophile with the metal complex; that is the nucleophile enters the solvation sphere of the complex. The major force holding these two species in close proximity at this stage is often predominantly coulombic, reflecting their different charges, in which case this outer sphere association is correctly considered as an ion-pair. When either species is uncharged, or both species have the same charge, then hydrogen bonding or much weaker van der Waal&#8217;s forces bind the two together. Once in the solvation sphere, the nucleophile can either attack the metal centre if the electron configuration of the metal permits it, or must await the dissociation of one of the coordinated water molecules before it can then enter the coordination sphere of the metal ion. If the nucleophile is on the side remote from the dissociating water molecule, it will stand little chance of being able to bind at the vacant site before another, much closer water<a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> molecule in the solvation sphere binds. The nucleophile must await the dissociation of a water molecule in close proximity to itself. The important point about any dissociatively activated substitution reaction involving the replacement of coordinated water is that not all acts of dissociation of the coordinated solvent lead to a substitution.</p>
<p class="indent">This last point is further amplified when we look at the replacement of coordinated water in the reactions of the substitutionally robust [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(OH <sub>2</sub>)]<sup>3+</sup>, shown in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this system, when Y<sup>2&#8722;</sup> = SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8722;</sup>, deviations from a simple first order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile are observed at relatively high concentrations of sulfate ion. This deviation from simple kinetics is attributable to a buildup of a significant concentration of the ion-pair, because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the 3+ cation and the 2&#8722; anion. Because of this deviation, it is possible to determine the values of <i>K</i><sub>o</sub> and <i>k</i> separately. Studies with a wide range of nucleophiles and a similar kinetic analysis (or estimations of the value of <i>K</i><sub>o</sub> using an electrostatic approach) shows that the value of <i>k</i> (the interchange process) is independent of the nature of the nucleophile as would be expected for an I<sub>d</sub> mechanism. However, the value of <i>k</i> is about one-sixth the value for the water exchange rate constant established for [Co(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. This has been interpreted in terms of the outer sphere complex with the nucleophile in the solvation sphere jostling for position with the water molecules, and only once in every six dissociations of the coordinated water molecule does the nucleophile manage to beat the water molecules in the solvation sphere to the vacant site.</p>
<p class="indent">This relationship between the value of the interchange rate constant, k, and the exchange rate constant, <i>k</i><sub>ex</sub>, (<i>k</i><sub>ex</sub> / k &#8771; 6), for the reaction of [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(OH <sub>2</sub>)]<sup>3+</sup> should not be looked on as simply reflecting the relative numbers of dissociable water molecules in this species and [Co(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. There are many other factors operating, not least of which are the relative nucleophilicities of Y and water for the particular metal site, and the differing steric requirements of the various nucleophiles and water. Even for the generalized series of complexes, [M(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>OH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>, the ratio <i>k</i><sub>ex</sub> / <i>k</i> varies dramatically from a value of about 30 (M = Cr) to about 0.1 (M = Rh).</p>
<p class="indent">The important feature about the kinetics of the replacement of coordinated water, as exemplified by the system shown in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>, is that<a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> the first order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile is not ascribable to associative, bimolecular attack on the metal centre, but is attributable to the formation of the outer sphere complex. The mechanism of the reaction is best described as I<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of substitutionally robust complexes to study the rates of solvent exchange has several advantages over the more labile complexes. For instance, the nature of the coligands can be varied and hence their steric and electronic influences on the mechanism can be investigated. Most importantly we can study the stereochemistry of the reactions, an impossibility in the [M(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> systems without some rather elaborate isotopic labelling in the more kinetically robust systems. One other advantage is that the reactions of the isolated solvento-complex can be studied in a different, non-interacting solvent. This allows us to look at the influence of the released solvent molecule on the kinetics, as shown in the example in <a href="#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this study, the substitution of the coordinated dmso (dmso = Me<sub>2</sub>SO) by PPh<sub>3</sub> is studied in the non-coordinating 1,2-dichloroethane, and the mechanism has been shown to involve rate-limiting dissociation of dmso because of the form of the rate law: the addition of free dmso inhibits the reaction and at high concentrations of PPh<sub>3</sub> the rate of the reaction becomes independent of the concentration of the nucleophile. The similarity in the kinetic form for this reaction and that of the reaction shown in <a href="#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a> is clear but the origin of the saturation behaviour in the two systems is very different. In the reactions with [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>3+</sup> the limiting zero order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile is due to the buildup of appreciable concentrations of the outer sphere complex. In contrast there is no accumulation of intermediates in the system shown in <a href="#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>. The deviation from first-order dependence on the concentration of PPh<sub>3</sub> occurs only when <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[PPh<sub>3</sub>] &#8811; <i>k</i><sub>&#8722;1</sub>[dmso].</p>
<p class="indent">In the solvent exchange reactions of [MH<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (S = MeCN or Me<sub>2</sub>CO, M = Rh or Ir), a dissociative mechanism is indicated by &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 10&#8211;30 J K<sup>&#8722;1</sup> mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. In this case there is a strong <i>trans</i>-labilizing force of the hydrido-ligands which favours the dissociative mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, in this section, the replacement of the tetrahydrofuran (thf) ligands in [M(CO)<sub>5</sub>(thf)] (M = Cr, Mo or W) by piperidine, P(OEt)<sub>3</sub> or PPh<sub>3</sub>, has been studied by measuring &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> of the reactions. This study<a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> shows that as we go down Group VI the reaction becomes increasingly more associative in nature. This is a trend we will see again in other reactions and is attributable, at least in part, to the increased size of the metal atom as we go from the first row to the third row metal.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Associative and dissociative pathways</h3>
<p class="noindent">The preceding section of this chapter describes the details of how octahedral complexes undergo substitution involving the intermediacy of a solvento-species. The description that results is highly detailed because of the use of kinetically robust complexes, permitting the independent isolation and mechanistic characterization of each of the two stages in these reactions. However, it is clear that there is nothing special about these robust complexes, and that analogous pathways also operate in the reactions of the more labile complexes. Also, we have seen that complexes containing metals in both high and low oxidation states use similar mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent">The topic of this section is direct substitution reactions and involves a wide variety of reactions, covering a multitude of complexes and nucleophiles. The approach that can be taken in this area is, as a consequence, not so rigorous. Nevertheless, we will see the same general characteristics: a preponderance of dissociative activation pathways, especially for first row transition metal compounds, but an increasing amount of information showing the operation of associative pathways. For instance, in the reactions of [MnX(CO)<sub>5</sub>] (X = halide) with molecules such as 1,10-phenanthroline to form [MnX(CO)<sub>3</sub>(phen)] the positive values of &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 37J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> and &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 20.6 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> demonstrate the dissociative nature of the these reactions. However in the reactions of [Mn(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>] with phosphines, the first order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile together with the negative values of &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> strongly implicate an associative mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">In a further example of associative mechanisms, the displacement of carbon monoxide ligands in [V(CO)<sub>5</sub>(NO)] by phosphines occurs by two pathways: a dissociative route (independent of the concentration and nature of the phosphine) and an associative route which shows a first order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile. Hence for a six-coordinate, closed shell, vanadium(O) complex, both associative and dissociative activation are of comparable energy. Indeed this sort of behaviour is by no means restricted to first row transition metal elements and although the reaction of PPh<sub>3</sub> with [WX(CO)<sub>4</sub>(NO)] (X = Cl, Br, or I) occurs by a purely dissociative pathway, the reaction with the more nucleophilic PBu<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup> occurs by a mixture of dissociative and associative pathways. The latter route is characterized by a first order dependence on the concentration of PBu<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup> and &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = -87.4JK<sup>-1</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Why then do these coordinatively saturated complexes have available<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> both an associative and a dissociative pathway for substitution? The only other cases of an associative pathway in octahedral complexes that we have met so far are the reactions of the early transition metals containing empty <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> orbitals: a situation clearly not pertaining here. In order to render the associative mechanism energetically viable in closed shell complexes there must be a way in which these species can attain coordinative unsaturation, without entirely dissociating a ligand. Inspection of the coligands in the complexes that undergo these associative pathways reveals that they all have the common feature that they can donate varying numbers of electrons to the metal. The range of ligands that can do this is really quite large and just a few of the more common ones are shown in <a href="#fig4.10">Fig. 4.10</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In our original example of the two manganese complexes we see that [MnX(CO)<sub>5</sub>] contains none of the ligands illustrated in <a href="#fig4.10">Fig. 4.10</a> and thus a dissociative mechanism is enforced. In contrast, [Mn(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>] contains the pentahapto-cyclopentadienyl ligand and upon approach of a nucleophile towards the manganese, the cyclopentadienyl-ring can change its bonding to the metal to become a trihapto-ligand. In this way the metal centre relieves itself of the burden of the extra two electrons donated by the nucleophile. In effect the metal pushes two electrons onto the cyclopentadienyl-ligand without having to completely dissociate any ligand, and hence retains its closed shell configuration. In a similar manner we see that in the complexes containing nitrosyl ligands the attack of a nucleophile at the metal can trigger a change in bonding of the nitrosyl from a linear, three electron donor to a bent, one electron donor, exactly the same effect as we saw in the substitution reactions of tetrahedral sites in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>. Once the leaving group has departed, the cyclopentadienyl- or the nitrosyl-ligand can revert to its original form of bonding to the metal in order to retain the closed shell configuration of the product.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Evidence for the shift mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Direct evidence for a cyclopentadienyl-ligand changing its bonding during associative substitution pathways comes from studies on the rhenium system shown in <a href="#fig4.11">Fig. 4.11</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this reaction the substitution of the carbon monoxide ligand by PMe<sub>3</sub><a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a> shows a first order dependence on the concentration of the nucleophile and thus implicates the intermediate containing a trihapto-cyclopentadienyl residue. In the presence of an excess of PMe<sub>3</sub> this intermediate can be trapped, isolated and characterized as the bis(phosphine) complex which necessarily contains the monohapto-cyclopentadienyl-ligand: This demonstrates the rapid response and flexibility of the cyclopentadienyl-ligand to changes in the coordination sphere of the metal.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>More general considerations: other coordination numbers</h2>
<p class="noindent">The activation of systems towards associative mechanisms by some ligands as described above is not restricted to six-coordinate complexes of the reactants, but to the presence of ligands on a coordinatively saturated centre.</p>
<p class="indent">In the five-coordinate complexes of Group IX, [M(&#951;<sup>5-</sup>C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>] (M = Co or Rh) substitution of the carbonyl ligands occurs by an associative mechanism. In this example we see a group trend in that the rhodium complex reacts faster than the cobalt analogue, which can be rationalized in terms of the larger size of the rhodium atom and the weaker binding of the CO ligand to the rhodium centre. However there is a lesson to be learnt from studies on this type of system: just the presence of a ligand capable of changing the number of electrons that it formally donates to the metal does not mean that the complex will always adopt an associative mechanism. In the reaction of the analogous [Co(&#951;<sup>5-</sup>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] with PMe<sub>3</sub> the pathway is exclusively dissociative.</p>
<p class="indent">In the nine-coordinate complexes, [M(&#951;<sup>5-</sup>Ind)Cl(CO)<sub>3</sub>] (M = Mo or W, Ind = CqH<sub>7</sub>) substitution of a carbonyl ligand by PPh<sub>3</sub> occurs by a mixture of dissociative and associative pathways. Again, we see the trend we have observed before in other systems, that the heavier element reacts more rapidly. In this case this greater lability of the tungsten analogue is entirely due to a faster associative pathway, and the dissociative pathway is faster for the molybdenum species.</p>
<a id="page_34" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 34, Substitution at sites with coordination number greater than four</a>
<p class="indent">In the complexes, [M(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>(tht)] (M = V, Nb or Ta; tht = C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>S) substitution of the tetrahydrothiophen ligand by phosphines occurs by a dissociative pathway for vanadium but for the niobium and tantalum analogues, with their larger metal centres, an associative route is observed.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, in eight-coordinate complexes, [M(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>] (M = Ti, Zr or Hf), displacement of a carbonyl ligand by a phosphine shows the same trend as we observed for the Group V metals above, namely, the first row metal reacts by a dissociative pathway exclusively whereas the heavier members of the group react, at least in part, by an associative route.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Substitution at seventeen and nineteen electron species</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have seen how an associative pathway in coordinatively saturated complexes can proceed via an intermediate which retains the closed shell electron configuration. But what happens if the metal cannot attain the closed shell configuration in the intermediate? This situation is met in the relatively rare cases when the reactant complex has formally either a seventeen or nineteen electron count.</p>
<p class="indent">In the reactions of [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>] or [W(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>] with PR<sub>3</sub> in which the phosphine replaces a coordinated carbonyl, the mechanism of the reactions is associative, as indicated by the first order dependence on the concentration of phosphine and the large negative values of &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup>. Thus the pathway involving a 19 electron intermediate is energetically more favourable than the dissociative route involving a 15 electron species. It has been proposed that the associative pathway in the reactions of 17 electron species is favoured because of the interaction of the nucleophile with the singly occupied orbital on the metal (a two-centre, three electron interaction), or that the odd electron is delocalized onto a ligand. In the reactions of the seven-coordinate, 17-electron species, [V(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CO)], again we see an associative mechanism for the CO exchange reaction associated with &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 37.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 88 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>. The factors which decide whether the mechanism of a substitution reaction operates by an associative or a dissociative pathway seem to remain the same irrespective of coordination number.</p>

<p class="indent">There are very few 19 electron species which have been the subject of mechanistic studies. The studies that have been performed show the same general characteristic: that the 19 electron species must convert to a 17 electron species either intramolecularly or by employing a dissociative pathway. Thus the six-coordinate 19 electron species, [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(&#951;<sup>6</sup>- arene)], has to rearrange to [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(&#951;<sup>4</sup>-arene)] before it is susceptible to attack by PR<sub>3</sub> which subsequently displaces the arene. The five-coordinate complex shown in <a href="#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a> is better considered as an 18 electron species with the odd electron delocalized on the phosphine ligand. Here the substitution of one of the CO ligands occurs by a dissociative mechanism with &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 100 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#8225;</sup> = 47 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>. In both cases the systems have a prohibitively slow associative pathway, whether it contains a formal 21 electron configuration, or a formal 20 electron count at the metal and the odd electron on a ligand.</p>
