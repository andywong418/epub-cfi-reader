<h1 class="fmmain">Preface</h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">Even if not everyone agrees that mechanistic studies are the jewels in the crown that is inorganic chemistry, it is undeniable that this topic represents an important course in the undergraduate syllabus. This book is aimed squarely at just such a course and covers those aspects of transition metal mechanistic chemistry that I consider essential. The book was written with the idea that it would act as a &#8216;guide&#8217; and that the course lecturers will expand and elaborate on the topics covered and introduce the student to areas which I have not had space to address.</p>
<p class="fmindent">If this book manages to fire the imagination of even only a few students sufficiently that they read the more advanced texts on inorganic reaction mechanisms, or go on to do research in this area, it will have all been worthwhile.</p>
<p class="fmindent">My thanks go to Sundus and Matthew for spending so many fine spring weekends at home during the writing of this book; to Kay Oglieve for help in preparing the final script and, of course, to all my colleagues at Sussex for moulding the basic ideas and ideals on which this book relies. Last, but by no means least, I thank Martin Tobe for getting me addicted to mechanistic inorganic chemistry.</p>
