<p class="noindent">Electron transfer reactions are a dominant feature of transition metal chemistry, and are of fundamental importance in defining the characteristics of this area of the periodic table. The mechanisms of electron transfer between two metal complexes have received considerable attention and two distinct types of mechanisms operate: the inner sphere and the outer sphere pathways. The distinction between the two mechanisms resides in whether the reactants share a ligand during the act of electron transfer (as they do in the inner sphere pathway) or not (as in the outer sphere route). Clearly, in the inner sphere electron transfer mechanisms, substitution processes are an important component of the overall reaction. We are now familiar with substitution mechanisms and hence we will start the discussion of the mechanisms of electron transfer by relating the inner sphere pathway, and then move on to the mechanism of the outer sphere pathway. This order of presentation has several advantages. First, we start with a mechanism which contains elements with which we are familiar, and secondly the detailed theoretical treatments of electron transfer reactions, which relate more to the outer sphere mechanism can be delayed until we are familiar with all the nuances of this reaction type.</p>

<p class="noindent">The majority of the reactions with which we will be concerned are those between two complexes, in which the reductant transfers a single electron to the oxidant, as illustrated by the general equation in <a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">However it is important to be clear from the outset that there are certain restrictions on the transfer of this electron.</p>
<p class="indent">The most obvious barrier to electron transfer is the distance that the electron has to travel. The intervening solvent molecules and ligands act as insulation to the two participants and thus the reactants must approach one another sufficiently closely to transfer an electron. Irrespective of the<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> intimate details of the mechanism of electron transfer the close contact of the redox partners minimizes the barrier to electron transfer arising from the solvent and maximizes the electronic coupling between the oxidant and reductant. However even if the two species can approach one another closely enough to transfer an electron, and the reaction is thermodynamically favourable (as determined from the relative redox potentials, <i>E&#176;</i> as defined in <a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>), there still remain significant problems.</p>

<p class="indent">Probably the most important barrier to electron transfer has its origins in the bond distances of the oxidant and reductant. Consider the thermodynamically neutral reaction between [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> and [Fe(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, as shown in <a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">This type of reaction is known as a self-exchange reaction since there is no nett chemical change. In order to follow reactions such as this experimentally, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between the two partners without effecting the process in any way, this is accomplished by isotopically labelling one of the reagents at an iron atom.</p>
<p class="indent">The larger effective nuclear charge of the Fe(<small>III</small>) complex means that the equilibrium bond length to the water ligands (Fe<sup><small>III</small></sup>&#8211;O = 2.05 A) is significantly shorter than that for the Fe(<small>II</small>) species (F<sup><small>II</small></sup>&#8211;O = 2.21 A). Since the Franck&#8211;Condon restrictions dictate that atom movements are much slower than the transfer of electrons, if electron transfer occurred with the complexes in these equilibrium configurations then it would give rise to products with the bond distances associated with the other oxidation state. This situation cannot prevail and hence both redox partners must change their bond lengths to an intermediate distance prior to the transfer of the electron. After the redox reaction, the two partners can readjust their bond distances to that corresponding to their respective oxidation states. During these reorganizations of the coordination spheres, the solvent molecules in the solvation shell are not inactive, but also have to reorganize themselves to reflect the changing bond lengths during the reaction profile and the change of charge on the complex when the reaction is accomplished.</p>
<p class="indent">Another restriction on electron transfer is that there can be no change in the spin state of the electron when it is transferred. Most of the time there is no major problem in this respect. For instance in the self-exchange reactions of [Co(phen)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>h+</sup>, the Co(<small>III</small>) and the Co(<small>II</small>) species have a low spin electron configuration, and the electron is transferred from an <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbital in the reductant to an <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbital in the oxidant. However in most cobalt(<small>II</small>) complexes the electron configuration is high spin, whereas the cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes are low spin.</p>
<a id="page_48" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 48, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<p class="indent">As shown in <a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a> this can lead to problems upon electron transfer. If an electron in the <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbital of the Co(<small>II</small>) species is transferred to an <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbital in the Co(<small>III</small>) complex, then we end up with strange electron configurations for both products: a Co(<small>II</small>) species with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>6</mn></msubsup><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mtext>g</mtext><mn>1</mn></msubsup></math> (the low spin configuration) and a Co(<small>III</small>) species with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>5</mn></msubsup><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mtext>g</mtext><mn>1</mn></msubsup></math> configuration in which incompletely filled <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub> and <i>e</i><sub>g</sub> orbitals are present!</p>

<p class="indent">In order to overcome this problem Co(<small>III</small>) complexes must change their electron configuration prior to electron transfer from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>6</mn></msubsup><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mtext>g</mtext><mn>0</mn></msubsup></math> to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>g</mtext></mrow><mn>5</mn></msubsup><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mtext>g</mtext><mn>1</mn></msubsup></math>. Once in this excited state electron transfer can occur to give a Co(<small>II</small>) species with the correct electron configuration. The necessity that electron transfer to Co(<small>III</small>) complexes only occurs when the bond lengths have reached an intermediate distance between that of the oxidized and reduced forms, together with the change in spin states of the oxidant, leads to low rates of electron transfer for these complexes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The inner sphere mechanism</h2>
<p class="noindent">The inner sphere mechanism of electron transfer is shown in <a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this mechanism the initial diffusion-controlled association of the reductant and oxidant is followed by a substitution reaction in which a ligand on one of the reactants (usually the oxidant) penetrates the coordination sphere of the other to form the precursor complex. Thus it is<a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> essential that at least one of the reactants is either coordinatively unsaturated, such as [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>, or at least labile to dissociation, such as [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<figure id="fig6.5" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0057.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.5</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Up to the formation of the precursor, the reaction has only the characteristics of the substitution reactions we saw in the earlier section, in which a ligand on one partner acts as a nucleophile for the other metal centre, and no transfer of electrons has occurred yet. The only prerequisite for the bridging ligand is that it must have a means of binding to the new metal site. Once the precursor complex has been formed then electron transfer can occur from the reductant to the oxidant, thus generating the postcursor complex, which is identical to the precursor species except for the relative oxidation states of the two metal sites. Finally the postcursor complex can now dissociate to give the products.</p>
<p class="indent">The first demonstration of the inner sphere mechanism was in the reaction between [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [CoC(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, as outlined in <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig6.6" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0058.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.6</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The success of this demonstration resides in the relative substitution labilities of the reactants and the products. The Cr(<small>II</small>) reductant is extremely labile, whereas the Co(<small>III</small>) species is substitutionally robust. Upon transfer of the electron the resulting Cr(<small>III</small>) product is substitutionally robust and the Co(<small>II</small>) site is labile. This has the consequence, as shown in <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>, that the chloro-group which is brought into the precursor complex by the Co(<small>III</small>) species, leaves the postcursor complex with the Cr(<small>III</small>) site. In order to prove the intervention of the<a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> inner sphere pathway, it was essential not only to show that the [CrCl(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> is formed quantitatively, but also to show that [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> incorporates Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> from solution much more slowly than the production of [CrCl(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> in the redox reaction, thus ensuring that the chloride is not incorporated into a Cr(<small>III</small>) species after the redox reaction. In addition it must be shown that the solvolysis of the Co(<small>III</small>) complex is slow compared to its reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">Other examples in which ligand transfer from the oxidant to the reductant has been observed include the reaction of [FeCl(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and the reaction of [V(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with [Co(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>en<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (en = NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). In this last example the oxidized product, [V(N<sub>3</sub>)(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, is detected as the short-lived product of the electron transfer reaction before it solvates to [V(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">If we consider the generalized inner sphere mechanism shown in <a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>, it is clear that the rate-limiting step can be any of the following.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li style="width:70%;">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;The formation of the precursor complex;</li>
<li style="width:70%;">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;the transfer of the electron;</li>
<li style="width:70%;">(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;the dissociation of the postcursor complex.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Assigning which step is rate-limiting is not usually possible from the form of the rate law in electron transfer reactions. Nearly always, the rate of these reactions exhibits a simple first order dependence on the concentration of both the reductant and the oxidant. Consequently other criteria must be employed to establish which is the slowest step in the mechanism.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">Formation of the precursor complex</h3>
<p class="noindent">Electron transfer reactions which are rate-limited by the formation of the precursor complex are those involving species whose substitution lability is very low, as typified by the reactions of [V(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Notice here that V<sup>2+</sup> is a d<sup>3</sup> ion and is consequently expected to be kinetically robust (see <a href="Chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). In this class of reactions, the rate of the overall redox reaction is independent of the thermodynamic driving force of the redox reaction (measured by the difference in the redox potentials for the two half-reactions of the reacting couple, &#916;<i>E</i> = <i>E</i>&#176;<sub>ox</sub> &#8722; E&#176;<sub>red</sub>), and, for a dissociatively activated process, the nature of the bridging ligand. In addition, of course, the rate of the reaction is close to that of the rate of solvent exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, the substitution rate at the metal site may be so slow that the complex opts to transfer an electron by an outer sphere pathway. In such a situation it becomes a problem in deciding (for a series of reactions) which are true inner sphere reactions.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">Rate-limiting electron transfer</h3>
<p class="noindent">The electron transfer step will be rate-limiting in systems in which the formation of the precursor complex and decomposition of the postcursor complex are both rapid; that is when at least one of the metal sites is substitutionally labile. This is typified by the large number of reactions<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> studied with various cobalt(<small>III</small>) complexes and [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, such as that in <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Under advantageous conditions, the precursor complex can be detected and the subsequent slow electron transfer monitored. This has been observed in the reaction between [Fe(CN)<sub>5</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>3-</sup> and the cobalt(<small>III</small>) complex shown in <a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig6.7" style="width:70%;">

<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.7</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">We are rarely able to detect precursor complexes, but it is possible to investigate electron transfer within this type of binuclear species by alternative means. Binuclear complexes such as those shown in <a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a> can be prepared independently in which both metal sites are oxidized. Subsequent reaction of this species with a reducing agent such as [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> or Eu(<small>II</small>) selectively reduces the Ru(<small>III</small>) site in the binuclear complex, and the irreversible transfer of the electron to the Co(<small>III</small>) site can then be monitored.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.8</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Studies on systems such as these give detailed information about the transfer of electrons within inner sphere complexes. In particular, by varying the separation of the metal centres, it is found, as expected, that the free energy of activation for electron transfer (&#916;<i>G</i><sup>&#8225;</sup>) varies inversely with the distance between the two metals.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">Role of the bridge in electron transfer</h3>
<p class="noindent">A question of fundamental importance in understanding the details of the inner sphere pathway for electron transfer is the role played by the bridging ligand. Is the bridge the mediator of the electron as it travels from one metal to the other or is it just a means of keeping the two sites close to one another? Certainly there are some systems such as that between [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and <i>cis</i>-[Co(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>en<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> where a double bridge is formed between the reductant and the oxidant, and clearly not both bridges are<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> required to mediate the transfer of the single electron.</p>
<p class="indent">The two possible intimate mechanisms of electron transfer within the precursor complex are as follows.</p>
<p class="noindent">Resonance transfer: in which the electron is transferred directly from one metal to the other by a tunnelling mechanism.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chemical transfer: in which the electron is transferred initially to the bridge and then onto the oxidant, as shown in <a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig6.9" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0061.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.9</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Various lines of evidence now favour the chemical transfer mechanism in systems containing reducible ligands. This evidence includes the following.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The detection of radical cations by EPR spectroscopy during the electron transfer reaction, in which the electron can be shown to be on the bridging ligand.</li>
<li>2.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The rate of electron transfer to complexes containing Co(<small>III</small>)-L and the conjugate acid of L (H&#8722;L<sup>+</sup>) occur at much the same rate.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">A distinction between the chemical transfer and resonance transfer mechanisms is possible using isotope effects. By comparing the rates of electron transfer to [CoL(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> and [CoL(ND<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup><i>n</i>+</sup> (when L is non-reducible, L = HO, CN, NCS or MeCO<sub>2</sub>) the isotope ratio, <i>k</i><sub>H</sub> / <i>k</i><sub>D</sub>, is in the range 1.3 to 1.5. This is consistent with the reorganization of the coordination sphere prior to electron transfer (Franck&#8211;Condon restrictions). However for the complexes in <a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a> containing reducible ligands the isotope ratio is much smaller, <i>k</i><sub>H</sub> / <i>k</i><sub>D</sub> = 1.1 &#177; 0.02, consistent in these cases with rate-limiting transfer to the reducible ligand.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure id="fig6.10" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0062.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.10</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The advantages of the chemical transfer mechanism over the resonance transfer pathway are two-fold. First, the Franck&#8211;Condon restrictions do not have to be met by both metal centres at the same time during chemical transfer, thus leading to an increased rate of electron transfer. Secondly, a direct interaction between the oxidant and the reductant means that an electron transferring between them has to overcome the activation barriers for both the release of the electron from the reductant and the acceptance of the electron by the oxidant, all in one action. In contrast, for the chemical transfer pathway, these same barriers are met successively, and hence the energy required at each stage of the reaction profile is correspondingly less.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Remote attack in electron transfer</h3>
<p class="noindent">For an inner sphere mechanism, the two metal sites can be separated by several atoms and still transfer electrons at an appreciable rate, provided the ligand system that bridges the oxidizing and reducing centres is unsaturated, and hence conducting. This concept of electron transfer at a distance mediated by the bridge is enforced on the system, such as in the reduction of [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(iso-nicotinamide)]<sup>3+</sup> shown in <a href="#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>, since it is only the remote atoms which contain a lone pair of electrons for binding the reductant.</p>
<a id="page_53" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 53, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<figure id="fig6.11" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0063.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.11</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Remote attack has also been demonstrated in the reaction between [Fe(<span class="underline">N</span>CS)(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> where the product is [Cr(<span class="underline">S</span>CN)(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. However it should not be assumed that the metals will always want to be at extreme ends of an unsaturated molecule and rely on the ligand to mediate the transfer of the electron. For instance in the reaction of [Co(N<sub>3</sub>)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> the reductant binds not at the azido-nitrogen atom remote from the cobalt, but at the nitrogen atom bound to the cobalt.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Rate-limiting postcursor dissociation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Having brought the reactants together and transferred the electron, the only stage left to be rate-limiting is the dissociation of the postcursor complex. This stage will be rate-limiting if both the metals, in their new oxidation states, are substitutionally robust. This happens in the reaction shown in <a href="#fig6.12">Fig. 6.12</a> where the postcursor complex is isolable.</p>
<figure id="fig6.12" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0064.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.12</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In a similar vein, a postcursor complex can be detected in the reaction of [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(iso-nicotinamide)]<sup>3+</sup> with [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. The identification of this detected species as the postcursor, rather than the precursor complex, relies on its spectroscopic and reactivity properties. Thus the complex shows strong &#960;<sup>*</sup>&#8211;d absorptions in the electronic spectrum consistent with a Ru(<small>II</small>) coordinated to the pyridine residue, but inconsistent with a Ru(<small>III</small>) species. In addition the intermediate exhibits the characteristic d&#8211;d absorption spectrum of a Cr(<small>III</small>) entity in an oxygen-ligated environment, and the aquation characteristics of a Cr(<small>III</small>) species. With this evidence then, despite the fact that the reaction involves no transfer of the bridging ligand as a consequence of electron transfer, the nature of the reaction can still be identified unambiguously.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dead-end species: a warning about detected intermediates</h3>
<p class="noindent">At first sight, the reaction between [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> and [Co(edta)]<sup>2-</sup> (edta = (O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>4-</sup>) looks as if it falls in the category discussed above. Study of this reaction reveals an accumulation of the binuclear intermediate shown in <a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>, apparently a postcursor complex.</p>
<a id="page_54" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 54, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<figure id="fig6.13" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0065.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 6.13</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">However detailed kinetic arguments demonstrate that this species is not on the pathway leading to products. Rather it is a dead-end species which accumulates in significant concentrations but does not react further to give the redox products. The mechanism by which an electron is transferred in this system is the outer sphere pathway. Any material present as the binuclear dead-end species must dissociate to reactants and then proceed through the outer sphere mechanism to give products.</p>
<p class="indent">The important message for all mechanistic studies is that just because a species accumulates during the reaction, does not ensure that this species is an intermediate on the pathway to products. Even the form of the rate law in the mechanism shown in <a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a> suggests that the binuclear is an intermediate on the pathway, when in fact, the situation is different.</p>

<p class="indent">The outer sphere mechanism is ensured in the reaction between two coordinatively saturated complexes such as in the reaction between [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(pyridine)]<sup>3+</sup>, or the oxidation by Cr(<small>III</small>) complexes or [Co(<i>o</i>-phenanthroline)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> of a variety of metal carbonyl anions, [Re(CO)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [Mo(&#951;<sup>5-</sup>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup> and [Mn(CO)<sub>4</sub>L]<sup>-</sup> (L = CO or PR<sub>3</sub>). This last series of studies demonstrates the insensitivity of the reaction mechanism to the coordination number of the reactants.</p>
<p class="indent">The outer sphere mechanism is also ensured in the reactions of species such as [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> with [Coen<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> (en = NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). Although the Cr(<small>II</small>) centre is substitutionally labile, the robust nature of the Co(<small>III</small>) site together with the lack of any potential bridging ligand, precludes an inner sphere complex being formed. In addition, as we saw in the reactions of [V(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, when one of the redox partners contained a potential<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> bridging ligand but the other species is only borderline labile, the mechanistically simpler outer sphere pathway may be the dominant route. In the absence of any complicating features the outer sphere pathway would be expected to be faster than the inner sphere pathway, since the energetic demands of the former mechanism are less.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The limiting rate law</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most commonly observed rate law for outer sphere electron transfer reactions between two metal sites is a simple first order dependence on the concentration of both the oxidant and the reductant. This rate law is the limiting form of the generalized expression shown in <a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>, under conditions where there is no significant accumulation of the outer sphere adduct, 1 &#8811; <i>K</i><sub>o</sub>[M<sub>o</sub><sup>&#8242;</sup>], when the reaction is studied in the presence of a large excess of the oxidant. However, the general form of the rate law shown in <a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a> is observed for redox reactions between species of large and opposite charge, since the large electrostatic interaction between the two species leads to an accumulation of the outer sphere adduct.</p>
<p class="indent">The general form of the rate law is observed in reactions of the type shown in <a href="#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a> between oxidants with a 2+ or 3+ charge and the [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> reductant.</p>

<p class="indent">With the values of the independent equilibrium and rate constants available it is possible to probe the characteristics of the adduct formation and the electron transfer step in isolation. Thus the association constants for the formation of the outer sphere adduct are in good agreement with those values derived from calculations based on simple electrostatic arguments. The rate of the electron transfer step within the outer sphere complex depends upon the nature of the substituent, <b>R</b>, on the carboxylate group. The rate of electron transfer increases as the p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> associated with these residues decreases. The decreasing p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> through this series is associated with these residues becoming progressively better electron-withdrawing ligands. The same general trend, in the rates of electron transfer with the nature of the substituents, has been observed in the reactions of these same oxidants with the reductant, [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. In this case the formation of the outer sphere adduct is not observed but the value of <i>K</i><sub>o</sub> can be estimated from simple electrostatic arguments.</p>
<a id="page_56" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 56, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<h3 class="h3">Geometry of the outer sphere adduct</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although the stereochemical requirements of the outer sphere mechanism are less stringent than those of the inner sphere pathway, it would be wrong to consider that the outer sphere adduct is entirely devoid of stereochemical interactions between the two reactants. These reactants are not like two hard spheres; they have a geometry which can be highly symmetrical (e.g. [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>) or one with distinctly different areas associated with different ligands (e.g. [CoX(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>n+</sup>, where X can be a neutral or anionic ligand, the ligand itself consisting of a single atom or a great many atoms).</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Theoretical treatment of electron transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent">Reactions which proceed by the outer sphere mechanism are well suited to theoretical treatment since there is no bond-making or bond-breaking processes involved. The treatment of these reactions, developed predominently by Marcus and Hush, involve calculating the free energy of change (&#916;<i>G</i><sup>*</sup>) to bring the reactants together, from infinite separation, to form the activated, outer sphere complex. That is not just the energy to bring the two species together, but also to perturb their coordination and solvation spheres in line with the Franck&#8211;Condon restrictions. Also, the treatment assumes that the transfer of the electron is adiabatic, that is, the transfer of the electron does not involve the loss of energy from the system.</p>
<p class="indent">The value of &#916;<i>G</i><sup>*</sup> is made up of three separate components:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;the work necessary to bring the reactants together, and then separate them after the reaction (w<sup>r</sup> and <i>w</i><sup>P</sup>);</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;the energies to reorganize the coordination spheres and the solvation spheres of the two reactants (&#955;<sub>i</sub> and &#955;<sub>o</sub> respectively);</li>
<li>(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;the standard free energy change of the reaction (that is the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction, &#916;<i>G</i><sup>&#176;</sup>).
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The most difficult of these terms to estimate is the values for the reorganization of the ligands, &#955;<sub>i</sub>, prior to electron transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">We are not going to get bogged down in all the intricacies associated with this treatment, but just sufficiently to appreciate the more important derived relationships. The most important equations are shown in <a href="#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>, where <i>h</i> = Planck&#8217;s constant, <i>k</i> is the Boltzmann constant and <i>Z</i> is the diffusion-controlled collision frequency.</p>

<p class="indent">Of particular importance are the relationships between &#916;<i>G</i><sup>*</sup> and &#916;<i>G</i><sup>*</sup> and the rate constant for electron transfer, <span class="underline">k</span>. In the equation relating <i>k</i> and &#916;<i>G</i><sup>*</sup> the transmission coefficient, &#954; is approximately 1 for adiabatic reactions, and the term <i>Ar</i><sup>2</sup> is the effective collision frequency and approximates to <i>Z</i> = 10<sup>11</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Using these relationships, reasonable fits to the outer sphere electron transfer self-exchange rates are obtained. For example, the self-exchange rate constant for the [Tc(Me<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+/2+</sup> couple is found experimentally to be <i>k</i><sub>exp</sub> = 0.6 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and calculated to be <i>k</i><sub>calc</sub>=3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Considering the approximations necessary to arrive at the equations in <a href="#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a> this agreement in order of magnitude is very good.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important that self-exchange rate constants are determined directly to complement the data from the theoretical treatment. These rate constants can be determined using line-broadening in <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, etc. NMR spectra. In the example shown in <a href="#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>, <sup>59</sup>Co NMR. spectroscopy was used.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of the sulfurous ligands, both oxidation states of the cobalt complex are low spin species. Addition of the paramagnetic Co(<small>II</small>) complex leads to broadening of the signals attributable to the diamagnetic Co(<small>III</small>) species. Analysis of the data gives <i>k</i><sub>ex</sub> = 1.3 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, in reasonable agreement with the theoretically derived value of 1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Probably the most important approximation of the theoretical equations is given in <a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>, where <i>f</i><sub>12</sub> = <i>Z</i><sup>2</sup><sub>12</sub> / <i>Z</i><sub>11</sub> <i>Z</i><sub>22</sub>, the ratio of the collision frequencies associated with each species in the reaction system.</p>
<p class="indent">Using equations we can calculate the rate constant for a thermodynamically-driven outer sphere electron transfer reaction, <i>k</i><sub>12</sub>, from a knowledge of the self-exchange rate constants of each reactant and the equilibrium constant <i>K</i><sub>12</sub> of the reaction. In particular if <i>K</i><sub>12</sub> &#8764; 1, then<a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Electron transfer mechanisms</a> log <i>f</i><sub>12</sub> &#8764; 0 is a useful approximation. The value of <i>K</i><sub>12</sub> is determined from the redox potentials of the reactants. Agreement between and <i>k</i><sub>12</sub><sup>cal</sup> and <i>k</i><sub>12</sub><sup>exp</sup> can be used to indicate that a reaction operates by an outer-sphere pathway. Also for a series of reactions of, for instance, a given oxidant with a variety of reductants the graph of log <i>k</i><sub>12</sub> against log <i>K</i><sub>12</sub> will be a straight line if all the reactions operate by the outer sphere mechanism; deviations from the line may be indicative of a change in mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Non-complementary electron transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent">All of the discussion so far has concentrated on complementary electron transfer reactions, that is reactions in which the reductant and the oxidant want to give up and accept, respectively, the same number of electrons. Invariably this has been the transfer of a single electron since the energetic requirements to satisfy the Franck&#8211;Condon restrictions are too demanding for multi-electron transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">The redox chemistry of the metals in the p-block is dominated by stable oxidation states differing by two units (e.g. PC1<sub>3</sub> and PC1<sub>5</sub>). Hence the oxidation of p-block complexes by transition metals capable of transferring only a single electron has to proceed through two steps. Each step involves the transfer of a single electron, and the formation of a transient, unstable one electron oxidized p-block element. An example is shown in <a href="#fig6.20">Fig. 6.20</a>, and analogous reactions of Fe(<small>III</small>) with Tl(<small>I</small>) and Sn(<small>II</small>) are known. In al cases the reaction is rate-limited by the first step, producing the unstable oxidation state of the p-block element: that is the formation of As(<small>IV</small>), Tl(<small>II</small>) and Sn(<small>III</small>), respectively.</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly, in the reduction of p-block complexes by transition metal complexes a two-step pathway operates with the slow step again being the production of the unstable oxidation state of the p-block species. This is typified by the example shown in <a href="#fig6.21">Fig. 6.21</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the disulfate ion and the Ru(<small>II</small>) cation form a detectable outer-sphere adduct prior to electron transfer. The subsequent electron transfer and dioxygen cleavage step are synchronous, to produce SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and the unstable SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> The latter species then rapidly reacts with another molecule of the Ru(<small>II</small>) complex.</p>
<a id="page_59" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 59, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<p class="indent">Of course, non-complementary reactions can also be found between d-block species, for instance the three electron oxidation of Cr(<small>III</small>) to Cr(<small>VI</small>) by [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> is rate-limited by the initial formation of the Cr(<small>IV</small>) species.</p>
<p class="indent">In all these cases the intimate mechanism of the electron transfer can only be defined for the first electron transferred, the transfer of the second electron occurs after the rate-limiting step and thus is not reflected in the kinetics.</p>
<p class="indent">A non-complementary reaction can have an important effect on the products formed by the inner sphere mechanism. This is illustrated in the reaction shown in <a href="#fig6.22">Fig. 6.22</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Atom transfer pathways</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have seen in the above discussion that a reaction operating by an inner sphere mechanism can involve the transfer of an atom from one metal site to the other. The question then arises as to whether these reactions should really be considered as atom transfer reactions rather than electron transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">If we consider the reduction of alkyl halides by metal sites then this problem resurfaces. Two distinct mechanisms can operate in these reactions, as shown in <a href="#fig6.23">Fig. 6.23</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In the atom transfer pathway, the metal abstracts a halogen atom from the alkyl halide and the generated alkyl radical can subsequently react with another molecule of the metal complex. This pathway is analogous to the inner sphere electron transfer mechanism in that it can only be associated with a coordinatively unsaturated or substitutionally labile metal site such as, [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, [Cren<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> or [Co(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>.</p>
<a id="page_60" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 60, Electron transfer mechanisms</a>
<p class="indent">The electron transfer pathway is enforced on substitutionally robust complexes, and involves the transfer of an electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital on the alkyl halide (a C&#8211;X &#963;<sup>*</sup> orbital). For instance in the reaction between <i>trans</i>-[Mo(CO)<sub>2</sub>(Me<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] and Ph<sub>3</sub>CCl the transient Mo(<small>I</small>) intermediate and Ph<sub>3</sub>C can be detected by EPR spectroscopy.</p>
<p class="indent">Irrespective of the pathway adopted, the kinetics of the reaction between [Cr(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and alkyl halides generally exhibit a simple first order dependence on the concentrations of both the chromium complex and the alkyl halide. However it is possible to distinguish between atom transfer and electron transfer pathways if the products of the reaction are substitutionally robust. One such example is given in <a href="#fig6.24">Fig. 6.24</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If the mechanism involves atom transfer, then equimolar concentrations of Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup>-X and Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup>-R will be formed. However if the reaction proceeds by electron transfer then equimolar concentrations of Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup> and Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup>-R are obtained, since the initially formed Cr<sup><small>III</small></sup> is substitutionally robust and will only slowly bind with X<sup>-</sup>.</p>
