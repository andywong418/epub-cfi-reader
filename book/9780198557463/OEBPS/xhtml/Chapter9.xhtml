<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we will discuss a general class of reaction whose title is mechanistically misleading, that is the insertion reaction. The overall effect of the reaction is shown in <a href="#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>, but this bears no relationship to the mechanism. This reaction is accomplished by a variety of small molecules, most notably sulfur dioxide, alkynes, alkenes, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. These molecules can be inserted into metal&#8211;carbon bonds and sometimes into metal&#8211;hydrogen bonds.</p>

<p class="indent">In most cases it has been demonstrated that the mechanistic description of the reaction is that of an intramolecular migration process. However, in at least one case, the reaction of CO with [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>], a direct insertion into the Fe&#8211;CH<sub>3</sub> bond has been observed; but we will concentrate on the migration reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">In what follows there is no attempt to discuss the mechanistic studies on all the substrates listed above, rather a discussion of the general principles of the mechanism as they relate to the last three molecules: alkenes, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch9.1">
<h2 class="h2">9.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Insertion of carbon monoxide</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first mechanistic study of the reaction of an insertion involving carbon monoxide was that shown in <a href="#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">By use of the labelled <sup>13</sup>CO it can be shown that the attacking molecule of carbon monoxide is not the group that undergoes the insertion reaction, rather it is one of the carbon monoxide molecules already coordinated to the manganese. Also, other groups such as PPh<sub>3</sub> can facilitate the migration reaction. Irrespective of the nature of the molecule being added to the metal site, the immediate product of the reaction is the isomer with the added molecule, <sup>13</sup>CO or PPh<sub>3</sub>, <i>cis</i> to the acyl-residue. This is what<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, The insertion reaction</a> would be expected if the migrating group (methyl residue) and the migration terminus (carbon monoxide ligand) must be adjacent to one another, as shown in the generalized mechanism in <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>.</p>

</aside> 
<p class="indent">The pathways shown in <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a> illustrate the two limiting mechanisms for the migration reaction: the pathway in which the migration step occurs before the addition of the group L, and the bimolecular pathway in which the group L enters the coordination sphere as the migration occurs. The analogy between these two routes and the associative and dissociative substitution pathways we met in Part 2 of this book is obvious. Of course, under the experimental conditions used to investigate the mechanism of the reaction, the observed rate law is often much simpler than the generalized form shown in <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the example shown in <a href="#fig9.4">Fig. 9.4</a> the rate of the reaction exhibits a <a href="#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a> simple first order dependence on the concentration of the complex and is independent of the concentration and nature of the nucleophile. This is consistent with the reaction operating by the stepwise pathway exclusively with <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>[L] &#8811; <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">In another system shown in <a href="#fig9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>, when X = I, Br or Cl, the rate of the reaction exhibits a simple first order dependence on the concentration of both the complex and PPh<sub>3</sub>. This is consistent with the stepwise mechanism shown provided that <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> &#8811; <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>[PPh<sub>3</sub>].</p>

<p class="indent">However, when X = MeCO<sub>2</sub> or CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, the kinetics obey the full form of the rate law, as shown in <a href="#fig9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>. It is proposed that the carboxylate<a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, The insertion reaction</a> groups act as bidentate ligands in the coordinatively unsaturated intermediate and suppress the <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> pathway, ensuring that at high concentrations of PPh<sub>3</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>[PPh<sub>3</sub>] &#8819; <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Solvent effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some migration reactions are strongly influenced by the solvent. Thus in the reaction of [MnMe(CO)<sub>5</sub>] with C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> the rate of the reaction varies dramatically with the dielectric constant and coordinating power of the solvent such that the rate of the reaction in N,N&#39;-dimethylformamide is 10<sup>4</sup> times faster than in mesitylene. This influence of the solvent has ramifications in terms of the intimate mechanism for the migration reaction. In particular the existence of a true unassisted migration reaction seems unlikely. It is more likely that if the group L cannot assist the migration, then the large excess of solvent molecules will do so. This has been demonstrated in the system shown in <a href="#fig9.6">Fig. 9.6</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig9.6" style="width:70%;">

</figure>
<p class="indent">In this system the migration reaction is observed to be promoted not only by the tertiary phosphine in the direct pathway but also by the solvent (S), tetrahydrofuran, which is subsequently replaced by the phosphine. When the solvent is changed to 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran there is little change in the dielectric constant of the reaction mixture, but the methyl substituents are too bulky to permit strong binding of this molecule to the metal and thus <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>[PR<sub>3</sub>] &#8810; <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> and the kinetics maintain the first order dependence on the concentration of phosphine in the concentration ranges responsive to study. The role of the attacking solvent molecule is not just to stabilize the coordinatively unsaturated intermediate, but also to catalyse the formation of the unsaturated intermediate. This has been demonstrated in the reaction shown in <a href="#fig9.7">Fig. 9.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Detailed kinetic analysis of this reaction demonstrates that the solvent molecule dissociates from the metal site having accomplished its role of 'pushing' the migration step.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Movement of the alkyl group</h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most important questions to be addressed in insertion reactions is, which group moves in the migration? There are three possibilities, as shown in <a href="#fig9.8">Fig. 9.8</a>, the group R moves on to a static CO (top), CO moves towards a static R (bottom) or both move towards one another (middle).</p>
<figure id="fig9.8" style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198557463_0104.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 9.8</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The product distribution from the reaction of the isotopically labelled <i>cis</i>-[MnMe(<sup>13</sup>CO)(CO)<sub>4</sub>] with CO, shown in <a href="#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>, demonstrates that the intimate mechanism is one in which the methyl group migrates onto an adjacent CO group. The product distribution is inconsistent with a mechanism involving the movement of the CO ligand towards the Me residue, and if there was a co-operative movement of the two ligands towards one another then an increased ratio of the <i>cis-</i>[Mn(COMe)(<sup>13</sup>CO)(CO)<sub>4</sub>] to the <i>trans</i> isomer would be observed.</p>
<p class="indent">That it is the alkyl group that moves, is consistent with the retention of stereochemistry at the carbon centre during the insertion reaction. This has been shown by demonstrating that the optical activity of the equilibrium mixture illustrated in <a href="#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a> does not change with time.</p>
<a id="page_81" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 81, The insertion reaction</a>

<p class="indent">In addition, the observation that many Lewis acids increase the rate of insertion by up to a factor of 10<sup>8</sup> is readily rationalized in terms of the migration of the alkyl group. If the Lewis acid binds to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, as shown in <a href="#fig9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>, then it will pull electron density towards itself, thus rendering the carbonyl carbon atom more positively charged and accelerating the movement of the migrating electron-rich alkyl residue.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry at the metal</h3>
<p class="noindent">The stereochemical consequences of the insertion reaction on the metal centre has been little studied. However, in one study, shown in <a href="#fig9.12">Fig. 9.12</a>, the stereochemistry of the reverse reaction (the retro-insertion) has been established. We can use the principle of microreversibility to predict that the migration reaction at the same site occurs with inversion of configuration of the iron. The principle of microscopic reversibility is a useful tool in mechanistic elucidation. In its simplest and broadest terms ,the principle requires that the mechanism in the forward reaction is the same as in the reverse reaction. That is, the position of each atom at any time during the reaction, in either direction, occupies the same relative positions.</p>
<a id="page_82" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 82, The insertion reaction</a>

<figcaption>
<p class="noindent2">Fig. 9.12</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In order to accommodate the inversion of configuration at the iron site in the retro-insertion reaction, it is clear that the coordinatively unsaturated intermediate must maintain its configuration or, if a solvent molecule occupies the site, the alkyl group migrates into its position.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Influence of the migrating group</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to quantify the influence of the migrating group on the rate of the reaction, free from the complications of the other parameters. The most extensive study is on the migration reactions of niobocene hydrides or alkyls shown in <a href="#fig9.13">Fig. 9.13</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig9.13" style="width:70%;">

<p class="indent">The rates of these reactions were measured directly by an NMR spectroscopic technique, spin-saturation-transfer experiments. The order in which the groups migrate is H &#8811; Me &#62; CH<sub>2</sub>Ph. The much greater propensity of the hydride group to migrate reflects the greater flexibility of the non-directional s orbital employed in the three-centre, two electron bond that represents the transition state of the migration reaction. With alkyl-groups migrating, the directional nature of the p orbitals imposes constraints on the transition state.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the relative migrating ability of the alkyl groups varies with the nature of the metal site. Thus in the migration of [Rh(&#951;<sup>5-</sup> C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(I)(R)(CO)] the R = Me residue migrates four times slower than R = Ph, whereas for [MnR(CO)<sub>5</sub>] the R = Me residue migrates eight times faster than R = Ph.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Redox-induced migratory insertion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Using transient electrochemical techniques, the insertion reaction of the 17 electron species, [Fe(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)Me(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)]<sup>+</sup> with pyridine has been studied. The mechanism is that shown in <a href="#fig9.14a">Fig. 9.14(A)</a> in which the pyridine binds to the metal centre to catalyse the migration of the methyl group. Thus, the reaction involves the intermediacy of a nineteen electron species.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a> we saw that the substitution reactions of 17 electron species invariably proceeds via a 19 electron intermediate. The same mechanistic pattern is observed in the electrochemical reduction of the 18 electron cobalt complex shown in <a href="#fig9.14b">Fig. 9.14(B)</a>. Reduction in this case results in the rapid insertion reaction for the 19 electron species.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Insertion of nitric oxide</h2> 
<p class="noindent">Despite the superficial similarity between carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, insertion reactions of the latter molecule are rare. Detailed mechanistic study of the insertion of nitric oxide demonstrates marked differences between the mechanism for nitric oxide and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism of the insertion of NO into the methyl group of [Co(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)Me(NO)] is shown in <a href="#fig9.15">Fig. 9.15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this mechanism it is the linear nitric oxide ligand which undergoes the migration reaction, in the pathway involving subsequent attack of L = PPh<sub>3</sub>. Most importantly, the use of the more nucleophilic L = PEt<sub>3</sub> results in direct attack of this phosphine at the metal. Rather than pushing the methyl group to migrate to the nitric oxide ligand, the complex relieves the formal 20 electron count at the metal by the linear nitric oxide becoming bent. The bent form of nitric oxide is incapable of undergoing the insertion reaction at an appreciable rate and must await its reconversion to [Co(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)Me(NO)] before migration can occur.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Insertion of alkenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Despite the obvious importance of the insertion of alkenes to many catalytic processes, relatively little has been defined in terms of the intimate details of the mechanism. However, many of the general features established for the analogous reactions of carbon monoxide are operative. Thus in the study of the reversible insertion of <i>trans</i>-[RhH(&#951;<sup>2</sup>-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(PPr<sub>3</sub><sup>i</sup>)<sub>2</sub>] by magnetization-transfer techniques, the essential prerequisite that the <i>trans</i> complex rearranges to the <i>cis</i> isomer is observed for the reaction to proceed by an intramolecular pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">The most extensive study of the insertion reaction of alkenes, free from the complications of subsequent processes, is in the general system shown in <a href="#fig9.16">Fig. 9.16</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this system attempts to determine the value of <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> by a kinetic method (trapping the inserted product by a nucleophile L) were unsuccessful since with L = CO or MeNC, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[L] &#8810; <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> under all experimental conditions, resulting in simple first order dependence on the concentration of L. However, it is possible to determine the value of <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> directly by magnetization-transfer and coalescence techniques. This leads to a proposed four-centre transition state for the insertion, where the hydride group migrates as H<sup>-</sup>. By coordinating a (C<sub>&#945;</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>&#946;</sub>)HPh styrene and varying the nature of the <i>para</i>-substituents on the phenyl ring, it has <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, The insertion reaction</a>been possible to delineate the electronic effects of the migration reaction as follows.</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li>(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;Electron-withdrawing groups at C<sub>&#945;</sub> or C<sub>&#946;</sub> stabilize the ground state of the reactant by increasing the binding efficiency of the alkene to the niobium.</li>
<li>(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;Electron-releasing groups at C<sub>&#946;</sub> accelerate the rate of migration by stabilizing the incipient positive charge at this carbon atom in the transition state.</li>
<li>(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;Electron-withdrawing groups at C<sub>&#945;</sub> also accelerate the rate of insertion, probably by increasing the bonding between niobium and C<sub>&#945;</sub> in the transition state.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">These mechanistic conclusions are greatly aided by the results of an X-ray crystal structure on [Nb(&#951;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H(CH<sub>2</sub>CHPh)] which shows that the phenyl group is orientated so that the effect of a substituent on this ring is not transmitted to the carbon&#8211;carbon double bond in the ground state. However upon approaching the transition state the phenyl ring must twist back into conjugation with the alkene bond in order that the substituents influence the reaction rate.</p>
