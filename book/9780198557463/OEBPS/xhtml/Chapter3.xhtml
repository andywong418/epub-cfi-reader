<h2 class="h2">3.1 Substitution at a tetrahedral metal site</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are few transition metal sites associated with a coordination number less than four and hence we will start our discussion of substitution mechanisms by looking at tetrahedral metal sites. This has the advantage that the reader is presumably familiar with an analogous discussion at saturated carbon atoms, but more importantly, there are some general principles which, once established in this section, will be useful for the remaining chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">The reactions of the coordinatively saturated, tetrahedral complexes (those with a formal 18 electron count) such as [Ni(CO)<sub>2</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] or [Ni{P(OEt)<sub>3</sub>}<sub>4</sub>] all exhibit very simple kinetics: a first order dependence on the concentration of the metal complex, and an independence of the concentration and nature of the reacting nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">These simple kinetics have been interpreted in terms of a dissociative mechanism (D) as shown in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, and this conclusion is substantiated further by extra kinetic parameters. Thus in the reaction of [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> with PEt<sub>3</sub> the value of &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> = +8 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> has been determined.</p>

<p class="indent">In contrast, the phosphine exchange of [CoBr<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (15 electron species) and halide exchange of [FeBr<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#8722;</sup> (13 electron species) both show second order kinetics: first order in the concentrations of the complex and the nucleophile. The associative (A) nature of these reactions is further <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a> amplified by the large negative values of &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> and, for the cobalt system, the value of &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> = &#8722;12.1 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">One might be tempted to predict that the 18 electron species, [Co(CO)<sub>3</sub>(NO)] and [Fe(CO)<sub>2</sub>(NO)<sub>2</sub>], would react by a dissociative pathway. However, the rates of reaction of these nitrosyl systems are sensitive to both the concentration and nature of the nucleophile, characteristic of associative (A) mechanisms. This behaviour is due to the presence of the nitrosyl ligand. This ligand is capable of binding to a metal centre either by acting as a three electron donor (in which case the M&#8211;NO fragment is linear) or as a one electron donor (in which case the M&#8211;NO fragment is bent). Hence, at least in principle, nitrosyl complexes can readily become coordinatively unsaturated by simple intramolecular change in the nature of the metal nitrosyl interaction. The generated 16 electron species is then susceptible to attack by nucleophiles as shown in <a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">This is not a type of activation which is restricted to tetrahedral substitution, and we shall see this behaviour associated with higher coordination numbers and other flexible ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">A simple conclusion then is that the lowest energy pathways for substitution at coordinatively saturated, tetrahedral complexes are those involving 16 electron intermediates. But is this always true? Most mechanistic studies are performed relatively close to 25&#176;C. What happens to the relative energies of the associative and dissociative pathways as we move to more extreme temperatures? The answer to this problem is addressed by considering the substitution mechanisms of [Ni(CO)<sub>3</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>)] in liquid krypton (T = -160&#176;C), as shown in <a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Although this complex is isoelectronic with [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>] which, as we have seen, reacts by a purely dissociative pathway at 25&#176;C, the kinetics of the reactions of [Ni(CO)<sub>3</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>)] in liquid krypton demonstrate that both <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a> associative and dissociative pathways operate. When a reaction can proceed by two pathways, which one is the dominant pathway depends critically on the temperature, since it is highly unlikely that each pathway responds to changes in the temperature by identical amounts. Inspection of the free energies for the barriers for the reactions of [Ni(CO)<sub>3</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>)] shows that the ratio, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> changes by about five orders of magnitude over the temperature range 25&#176; to &#8722;160&#176;C. Thus, over this temperature range the relative energetics of the associative and dissociative pathways changes. If we were able to study the substitution reactions of [Ni(CO)<sub>3</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>)] at 25&#176;C we would find that the exceedingly rapid reactions operated exclusively by a dissociative mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Substitution at a square-planar site</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Rate law and mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">The substitution reaction at a square-planar site is one of the most extensively studied areas in inorganic reaction mechanisms, with most of the information established at a platinum(<small>II</small>) centre. However, other d<sup>8</sup> sites such as Ni(<small>II</small>), Pd(<small>II</small>), Au(<small>III</small>), Rh(<small>I</small>), and Ir(<small>I</small>) have been investigated, though less extensively.</p>
<p class="indent">If one considers the basic substitution reaction such as that shown in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>, then usually the rate law observed exhibits a mixed order dependence.</p>
<figure id="fig3.4" style="width:70%;">

</figure>
<a id="page_16" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 16, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a>
<p class="indent">By comparison with the discussion on the substitution mechanism at tetrahedral sites, one might expect a parallel dissociative (<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>) and associative (<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) pathways. However, when the reaction is performed in a solvent which is capable of acting as a nucleophile, there remains the possibility that both pathways are associative with the <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> route representing direct attack by the nucleophile at the platinum centre, and the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> route involving rate-limiting attack by the solvent. The solvent ligand is only relatively weakly held and is subsequently rapidly replaced by the nucleophile in a further associative pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a great deal of circumstantial evidence that the true mechanism is that shown in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a> with both pathways being associative. For instance the values &#916;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> = &#8722;50 to &#8722;180 J K<sup>&#8722;1</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup> and &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> = &#8722;6.4 to &#8722;10 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> for the reactions of [Pt(dien)Br]<sup>+</sup> (dien = H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) strongly implicate an associative mechanism, probably I<sub>a</sub>. Similarly, the repeated appearance of a two term rate law in the reactions of square-planar complexes indicates that both pathways are similarly sensitive to the same factors. In addition, performing the reactions in a poorly coordinating solvent leads to a rate law exhibiting only the nucleophile (<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) pathway. Increasing the steric congestion at the reaction centre by introducing bulky coligands decreases the rate of both the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> pathways by similar amounts. This is best illustrated in the extensive studies on the reactions of the series of complexes, [PdCl(R<sub>5</sub>dien)]<sup>+</sup> (R<sub>5</sub>dien = R<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NRCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NR<sub>2</sub>). These complexes react with I<sup>&#8722;</sup> showing the normal two term rate law, k<sub>obs </sub>= <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> [solvent] + <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[I<sup>&#8722;</sup>], but as the steric bulk around the metal is increased by varying the tridentate ligand (from H<sub>5</sub>dien to Et<sub>5</sub>dien), the rate constants associated with both pathways progressively decreases, such that the Et<sub>5</sub>dien complex reacts about 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> times slower than the H<sub>5</sub>dien species, and the <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> pathway becomes increasingly difficult to observe. It is often difficult to distinguish between true steric effects and electronic influences of the increasing alkyl substituents, or even a change in the mechanism through the series. However, measurement of the volume of activation for these systems shows that &#916;<i>V</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> = -12&#183;2 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>, and hence the reaction remains associative throughout the series.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The solvento-intermediate</h3>
<p class="noindent">A key feature of the two term rate law is the involvement of a labile solvento-species as an intermediate in the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> pathway. Several studies on isolated solvento-species, such as [Pt(dien)OH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, demonstrate that these species react rapidly with nucleophiles. This criterion alone is not sufficient to prove that these species are intermediates in the mechanism. However, the intermediacy of the solvento-species has been demonstrated by trapping the aquo-species with hydroxide ion, as shown in <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The reaction obeys the normal two term rate law with the assumed aquo-intermediate involved in the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> pathway. The trick employed in the trapping of this intermediate is the deprotonation of the aquo-ligand by hydroxide ion to form the hydroxy-species. This deprotonation involves no <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a>metal&#8211;oxygen bond cleavage and is very much more rapid than the substitution of the coordinated water by the nucleophile, Y<sup>&#8722;</sup>. In addition the derived hydroxy-species is essentially inert to substitution. By investigating the kinetics of the reaction in the presence of various concentrations of hydroxide ion, it is observed that the substitution of the iodo-group by the nucleophile is inhibited by hydroxide ion.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry of the substitution</h3>
<p class="noindent">The substitution reactions of the vast majority of square-planar complexes proceed with retention of stereochemistry: <i>trans</i> complexes give <i>trans </i>products and <i>cis</i> complexes give <i>cis</i> products exclusively. This stereochemical integrity is most readily rationalized in terms of a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate, as shown in <a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this description the nucleophile approaches the metal centre along a line perpendicular to the four ligands, that is along a line of minimized steric interference. As the nucleophile approaches the metal, the leaving group starts to weaken its hold on the platinum and distorts the regular geometry by bending away from the plane containing the <i>trans</i> ligand and the two <i>cis</i> ligands. In this way, the trigonal plane of the five-coordinate intermediate always contains the leaving group, the attacking nucleophile and the group originally <i>trans</i> to the leaving group. The two groups that were originally <i>cis</i> to the leaving group occupy the axial positions. Subsequent loss of the leaving group allows the, newly coordinated nucleophile to relax smoothly into the plane containing the other three ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">There are few exceptions to the stereochemical observations outlined <a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a>above. When exceptions are observed the origin of the effect can be traced to three possible causes.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a relatively low barrier to intramolecular rearrangement between the square-planar and the tetrahedral form. As can be seen in <a href="#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>, in the tetrahedral form the stereochemical relationship between the various ligands in the square planar forms is lost. This type of intramolecular rearrangement can clearly occur in either the reactant or the product.</li>
<li>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;Stereochemical integrity can be lost in the intermediate, as shown in <a href="#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>. If the trigonal bipyramidal intermediate is sufficiently long-lived, and the propensity of the axial ligands to enter the trigonal plane is high, then the intermediate may undergo an intramolecular pseudorotation process which will exchange the axial ligands with two ligands in the equatorial plane. Several of these exchanges result in the complete loss of stereochemical integrity of the trigonal bipyramid. The only restriction in the ensuing product-forming dissociation is that the leaving group is lost from the equatorial plane, but what else this plane contains will depend on the pseudorotation process.</li>
<li>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;A departure from the usual stereochemical pattern is observed if the substitution becomes dissociative, which will be discussed later.</li>

<h3 class="h3">Influence of the entering group</h3>
<p class="noindent">In any substitution reaction which operates by an associative mechanism it is possible, at least in principle, to set up a scale of the relative abilities of each nucleophile to accomplish substitution at the reaction centre. Of course this will not be a universal scale, the relative effects of each nucleophile is dependent upon the reaction centre being attacked. For instance, the well-known S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at a saturated carbon will have a different scale of nucleophilicity than that for the platinum centre of most interest here. The most obvious difference between the two is that the saturated carbon centre is a &#8216;hard&#8217; centre, being a first row p-block element, whereas the platinum(<small>II</small>) centre is much more &#8216;soft&#8217;, being a third row d-block element. The relative rates of nucleophilic attack will reflect the differing affinities of the nucleophile for these two sites.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In line with other scales of nucleophilicity, a scale has been established for platinum(<small>II</small>) sites with the nucleophilicity, <i>n</i><sub>Pt</sub>, given by the equation in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>, for the reactions of <i>trans</i>&#8211;[PtCl<sub>2</sub>py<sub>2</sub>].</p>
<p class="indent">The relative nucleophilicities reflect the &#8216;soft&#8217; centre of platinum. Thus the heavier halides react more rapidly with this centre than their lighter analogues, as do sulphur compounds than their oxygen analogues, or arsenic compounds than their nitrogen analogues.</p>
<p class="indent">For general applicability it is essential that this nucleophilicity scale be related to the rates of other platinum reactants. This has been accomplished with some success using the equation shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>. Here the parameter <i>n</i><sub>Pt</sub><sup>0</sup> (<i>n</i><sub>Pt</sub> corrected to zero ionic strength) is used. This empirical equation is associated with the two parameters <i>S</i> which is the gradient of the best straight line through the data, and C the intercept on the log <i>k</i><sub>Y</sub> axis.</p>
<p class="indent">The parameter <i>S</i> is called the nucleophilic discrimination factor and reflects the response of the reaction rate to the nucleophilicity of the attacking group and the centre being attacked. The parameter <i>C</i> is called the intrinsic reactivity and is much more difficult to assign a physical meaning. It can be shown that this parameter is the first order rate constant for the solvolytic pathway, were that reaction to be carried out in methanol at 30&#176;C at zero ionic strength. However this does not help too much in understanding the physical origin of this parameter.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the nucleophilicity scale described above works adequately for neutral complexes, when we consider cationic complexes the same scale is not strictly obeyed. The problem is compounded by the fact that new scales are required for monocations, dications, monoanions, etc. This shows the importance of charge in determining the nucleophilicity in these systems, but does tend to negate the utility of such scales.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Influence of the leaving group</h3>
<p class="noindent">There is very little to be said about the influence of the leaving group on the rate of the reaction. Often the ability of a ligand to be a good leaving group parallels the bond strengths of that residue. However, in any associative mechanism, the attacking nucleophile is present in the coordination sphere of the metal when the leaving group departs and this can clearly influence the rate of the dissociation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Influence of the spectator ligands</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen how the steric effects of the spectator ligands influence the reaction rates of square-planar complexes, we will now look at the electronic effects of these ligands. Stereochemically, there are two different types of ligands in a square-planar complex: the two that are <i>cis</i> to the leaving group and the single residue that is <i>trans</i> to the leaving group. It has been established that the nature of the <i>trans </i>ligand plays the dominant role in defining the product. The empirical observation is best explained by reference to the generalized reaction shown in <a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>.</p>
<a id="page_20" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 20, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a>

</figure>
<p class="indent">There are two possible products from the reaction with the general nucleophile, Y<sup>&#8722;</sup>, depending on whether the chloro-group <i>trans</i> to L<sub>1</sub> or L<sub>2 </sub>is replaced. What is observed is that the proportion of product depends upon the nature of each L, and that the effect is dominated by the <i>trans </i>ligand (not the <i>cis),</i> and is independent of the nature of the nucleophile. The effect of the ligands on the rate of substitution of the group <i>trans</i> to itself is known as the <i>trans</i> effect.</p>
<p class="indent">The order of the common ligand&#8217;s effect on the rate of substitution of the <i>trans</i> ligand is shown in <a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>. Simple inspection of this list reveals that the nature of the groups with a high <i>trans</i> effect is very disparate. Groups such as hydrides, alkyls and ammonia, which can only operate as simple a-donors are spread throughout this list, as are groups such as carbon monoxide, tertiary phosphines and pyridine which can act as reasonable &#960;-electron acceptors. In order to understand the various effects operating in the <i>trans</i> effect series at an atomic level we have to consider not only effects in the ground state of the reactant, but also effects that may operate in the transition state of the reaction. Thus an increase in rate of one reaction over another can arise from any factor making the activation barrier lower: either a destabilization of the ground state or a stabilization of the transition state. Both factors operate to differing degrees throughout the members of the <i>trans</i> effect series.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Ground state destabilization</h3>
<p class="noindent">This effect operates with the pure &#963;-donors such as hydride and alkyl, in which these groups are strongly polarizing and pull electron density towards themselves thus depriving the other ligands, and most particularly the group <i>trans</i> to itself, of electron density. This weakens the <i>trans </i>ligand&#8217;s binding to the metal and hence increases its lability.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Transition state stabilization</h3>
<p class="noindent">With groups such as coordinated alkenes, carbon monoxide, tertiary phosphines, etc., relatively low-lying vacant orbitals are available which can be used to form multiple bonds by accepting electron density from the metal centre. This is of most utility in the transition state where the metal has a potential buildup of electron density while the entering nucleophile and the leaving group are both bound to the metal. By making use of these vacant orbitals on the <i>trans</i> ligand at least some of this excessive electron density can be dissipated away from the metal, as shown in <a href="#fig3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>.</p>
<a id="page_21" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 21, Substitution at four-coordinate sites</a>
<p class="indent">It must be remembered that the <i>trans</i> ligand is the only group in the trigonal plane of the trigonal bipyramidal intermediate with the leaving group and the entering group, and so is uniquely positioned to accept the &#960;-electron density.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Dissociative mechanisms at square-planar sites</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is not easy to demonstrate that the reaction of a square planar complex operates via a dissociative pathway, rather than the usual associative routes we have discussed above. Clearly the demonstration that the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration and nature of the nucleophile is ambiguous in this type of system; it may correspond to a dominant pathway involving attack by the solvent on the complex (the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> pathway in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dissociative mechanisms at the square planar complexes, <i>cis</i>-[PtR<sub>2</sub>(OSMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (R = Me or Ph) and <i>cis</i>-[PtMe<sub>2</sub>(SMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] in their reactions with a range of bidentate ligands have been demonstrated unambiguously. With these complexes the complicated rate law, shown in <a href="#fig3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>, shows that the substitution proceeds by both an associative pathway (<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) and, most importantly, a dissociative pathway.</p>
