<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>What is alicyclic chemistry?</h2>
<p class="noindent">Alicyclic chemistry is the chemistry of organic compounds containing one or more non-benzenoid rings. The scope of the current text will focus on saturated and partially unsaturated carbocyclic ring structures but brief mention will also be made of saturated heterocyclic systems where appropriate. Whilst the major emphasis will be placed on monocyclic derivatives, some bi- and polycyclic systems will also be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">Alicyclic structures play a major r&#x00F4;le in organic chemistry. Many important natural products exploit saturated or partially unsaturated rings, either as the main structural framework <i>e.g.</i> in terpenoid derivatives such as limonene &#x0028;in citrus fruits&#x0029; and menthol &#x0028;in mint&#x0029;, or have rings fused together to form more complex structures as seen in the backbone skeleton of steroids like progesterone.</p>

<p class="indent">Small cyclic terpene derivatives provide scents in the plant kingdom. &#x0028;&#x002B;&#x0029;-Carvone smells of spearmint, whereas its enantiomer has the fragrance of caraway seed.</p>

<p class="indent">Large carbocyclic ring derivatives are found in pheromones such as muscone and have thus been important to the perfumery industry for many years.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">More recently there has been great interest from many areas of chemistry in large macrocyclic &#x0028;<i>i.e.</i> large ring&#x0029; structures containing several heteroatoms because of their abilities to selectively complex metal and other ions; these are the crown ethers discovered by Charles Pedersen in 1962 for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1987.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Crown ethers are large macrocyclic rings which adopt crown-like geometries when they complex metal ions:</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Ring compounds demonstrate a number of special properties which make them particularly valuable and rewarding to study. These include unusual reactivity, a variety of molecular shapes which in some cases are rigid whilst in others are very flexible, and stereochemical control of behaviour which can be manipulated by the presence of other functional groups. In addition, the synthesis of ring compounds provides a number of unusual challenges which require the application of special techniques.</p></section>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Nomenclature</h2>
<p class="noindent">The names applied to simple ring structures are generally derived directly from those of their acyclic analogues with <i>&#x201C;cyclo&#x201D;</i> added as prefix. For example, the 6-membered ring alcohol shown below is called cyclohexanol but when a carboxylic acid group is attached to a carbocyclic ring the compound is referred to as the cycloalkane carboxylic acid <i>not</i> the cycloalkanoic acid.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The names of alicyclic compounds are directly analogous to those of their open chain analogues:</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:0.5em;"><i>e.g.</i> the saturated four-membered ring is called cyclobutane</p>
<figure class="sfig"><img src="../images/Fig7.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:0.5em;">and the five-membered cyclic ether derived from hydrog&#x00E9;nation of furan is known as tetrahydrofuran &#x0028;or THF&#x0029;.</p>
<figure class="sfig"><img src="../images/Fig8.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Substituents are numbered according to their position around the ring with the usual conventions of using the lowest numbers and giving <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>the lowest number to the main functional group <i>e.g.</i> -OH. The description of isomers will be discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Alicyclic compounds are not limited to one ring. Polycyclic structures of various types can also be constructed. These can be divided into three general groups: spiro, fused and bridged systems.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <i>spiro</i> structure two rings are linked through one atom:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig9.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">This forces the two linked rings to be held in planes perpendicular to each other and gives rise to the possibility of optical activity in both the structures shown above.</p>
<p class="indent">A <i>fused</i> structure contains two rings linked through a common bond. For example, decalin, which is obtained from the hydrogenation of naphthalene, consists of two fused cyclohexane rings. Such structures are not planar and in many cases can adopt several geometries showing markedly different properties. Indeed whilst <i>trans-</i>decalin is rigid, the <i>cis</i> isomer is conformationally flexible.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Decalin consists of two fused cyclohexane rings which can be linked in a <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> manner.</p>
<figure class="sfig"><img src="../images/Fig12.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar">These two isomers not only have dramatically different overall shapes but the <i>cis</i>-isomer is flexible whereas the <i>trans-</i>fused structure is rigid. This results in marked differences in the behaviour of many of their derivatives.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig10.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent"><i>Bridged</i> ring systems consist of several rings joined through two common atoms which are not necessarily adjacent to each other. Some examples are shown below:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig11.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Compounds of this type have proved a rich source of interest to organic chemists. For example, they can provide rigid frameworks which allow the investigation of the effect of geometry on reaction pathways and the interactions between different functional groups. In addition, such structures are often significantly distorted or &#x201C;strained&#x201D; as a result of which they frequently have interesting and unusual chemical properties.<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<p class="indent">The naming of bi- and polycyclic structures clearly adds another level of complexity to the problem of nomenclature and this will be discussed briefly in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">The usual conventions have been used to provide an indication of stereochemistry <i>i.e.</i> a solid wedge implies a bond coming out of the page and a hatched line leads to a group behind the page. A squiggly line implies undefined stereochemistry.</p>

<p class="sidebar"><i>Stereochemical conventions:</i></p>

<p class="indent">At times in this text it is necessary to consider orbital interactions between various groups and molecular fragments. Orbital interactions are discussed using simple Frontier Molecular Orbital &#x0028;FMO&#x0029; theory, a basic knowledge of which is assumed.</p>
<p class="indent">The reader is strongly encouraged to have molecular models to hand while working though this text since the spatial arrangements of groups are an important factor in determining the course of reactions of alicyclic systems.</p>
