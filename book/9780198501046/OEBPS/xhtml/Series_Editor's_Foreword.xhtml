<p class="fm-noindent">The ability to understand chemistry in three dimensions is of fundamental importance. <i>Alicyclic Chemistry</i> provides an ideal template for gaining an understanding of 3D structure, dynamics, and reactivity of organic architectures. Alicyclic chemistry is an important topic in its own right since many natural products and modern pharmaceuticals are based on alicyclic ring systems.</p>
<p class="fm-indent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. In this Primer, Martin Grossel has produced an excellent pedagogical account of this fundamental area, which is clear and easy to read. This Primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
