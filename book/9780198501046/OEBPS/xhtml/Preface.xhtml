<p class="fmnoindent">I have enjoyed alicyclic chemistry since my days as a Ph.D. student in the University of London. This primer has evolved from lecture courses and tutorials given in Oxford and elsewhere. I have many people to thank for their help and encouragement, principally Prof. John Perkins and Dr Gordon Whitham. Both of them have, in their different ways, profoundly influenced my career and my chemical interests and I am particularly grateful to John who provided valuable advice about this text &#x0028;though the contents are entirely my responsibility&#x0021;&#x0029;. Dr Jonathan Essex and Dr Ian Stevens at Southampton also provided valuable comments. In addition I should like to thank a number of others, particularly Robert Parker and other members from my research group at Southampton; and Katherine Crapnell, Andrew Bond, Fred Boardman, and David Jones, and the many other former and recent Christ Church Chemists who have made helpful comments, provided encouragement, and nagged me to finish the primer so that they could write their essays&#x0021;</p>
<p class="fmindent">I am also very grateful to my family for their support.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Finally I should very much like to thank Prof. Steve Davies for his patience&#x0021;</p>
