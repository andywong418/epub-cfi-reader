<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Effect of substituent stereochemistry on reactivity of cyclohexane derivatives</h2>
<p class="noindent">As was shown earlier, a substituent on a cyclohexane ring can occupy an axial or an equatorial location, the latter being the generally favoured situation. However, the presence of other groups can perturb this conformational equilibrium and, if the other group is very bulky, this can lead to &#x201C;conformational locking&#x201D; of the ring geometry <i>e.g.</i> by a <i>tert-</i>butyl substituent. Under such circumstances it is possible to probe the effect of different conformations on the reactivity of substituted cyclohexanes. It is convenient to consider two main types of effect here, namely steric and stereo-electronic factors.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.2">
<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Steric Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Steric effects, <i>i.e.</i> van der Waals forces, derive from large and repulsive close contacts, or small attractive interactions operating over greater distances. Repulsive interactions are the most readily identified and can operate in both ground and transition states. When steric interference is significant in the transition state but of little impact in the ground state there will be an increase in the activation energy for the process and the reaction rate may be said to be retarded by &#x201C;steric hindrance&#x201D;. On the other hand, if the ground state is significantly more destabilised by steric interference than the transition state, the activation energy will be reduced leading to an accelerated reaction rate because of &#x201C;steric assistance&#x201D;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Increased steric repulsion in a reaction transition state slows the rate of reaction as a result of &#x201C;steric hindrance&#x201D;:</p>

<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig172.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="indent">From the rate constants it is possible to deduce a value for K<sub>inv</sub>, the equilibrium constant for the conformational inversion of ethyl cyclohexane carboxylate. If it is assumed that the rates of hydrolysis of the axial and equatorial esters are the same as their conformationally locked analogues, then:</p>

<p class="indent">where <i>N<sup>ax</sup></i> and <i>N<sup>eq</sup></i><b></b> are the mole fractions of the axial and equatorial isomers &#x0028;<i>i.e. N<sup>ax</sup> &#x002B; N<sup>eq</sup> =</i> 1&#x0029;. This gives a value for <i>N<sup>eq</sup></i> of 0.85 and <i>K<sub>inv</sub> =</i> 5.54 &#x0028;<i>&#x2206;G<sub>inv</sub> =</i> -4.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> at 298K&#x0029;.</p>
<p class="indent">During the rate-determining transition state for the hydrolysis process a hydroxyl group becomes attached to the carbonyl carbon atom which therefore changes from sp<sup>2</sup> to sp<sup>3</sup> hybridisation. This increases the bulk of this substituent &#x0028;whereas the planar ester group can readily reduce crowding by rotation&#x0029;. Consequently the activation energy for hydrolysis of the axial ester is significantly greater than that for its equatorial counterpart leading to a <i>ca.</i> 20-fold difference in reaction rates. &#x005B;This discussion ignores the fact that the transition state is negatively charged whereas the ground state is neutral leading to significant differences in solvation between the two which also favour the equatorial isomer.&#x005D; The rate of hydrolysis of the conformationally mobile unsubstituted ester is intermediate between those of the two 4-<i>tert</i>-butyl derivatives since this value is the mole fraction-weighted average of those for pure axial and pure equatorial esters.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.2.2 Steric assistance in the oxidation of cyclohexanols</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>An example of steric assistance is provided by the relative rates of oxidation of the anomeric 4-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexanols. In this case the axial <i>cis</i>-alcohol is oxidised by Cr<sup>VI</sup> <i>ca.</i> 3.2 times faster than its equatorial <i>trans</i>-isomer. The rate determining step is fragmentation of the bulky intermediate chromate ester as shown by a kinetic isotope effect of <i>ca.</i> 6 &#x005B;a value which indicates significant C-H &#x0028;or C-D&#x0029; bond cleavage in the rate determining step&#x005D;. In the axial isomer, this process is accompanied by strain relief and it therefore reacts faster.</p>

<p class="indent">Similar results are seen in steroidal systems. Here the rate enhancement brought about by relief of steric compression during the oxidation of rigid steroidal alcohols falls off rapidly as the distance between the interacting groups increases since this reduces the steric interactions:</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stereoelectronic effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Deslongschamps defines such effects as changes in reactivity arising from the spatial disposition of particular bonded or non-bonded electron pairs. For example, there is a stereoelectronic requirement for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to proceed with inversion of configuration which arises because the new &#x03C3;-bond is formed by attack of the nucleophile on the &#x03C3;*-orbital of the bond which is breaking. Nucleophilic substitution in epimeric alkyl halides proceeds at different rates:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig176.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Substitution of an equatorial substituent by an S<sub>N</sub>2 pathway requires backside attack by the nucleophile, a process which is sterically hindered by axial substituents around the ring:</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig177.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In general the axial isomer reacts faster than its equatorial equivalent, a result which reflects a combination of steric and stereoelectronic factors. In particular these include relief of ground-state compression &#x0028;a steric effect&#x0029; in the axial case, and steric hindrance to backside attack in the equatorial derivative &#x0028;for which the stereoelectronic requirement is attack from an axial direction&#x0029;.<a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></p>
<p class="noindentt" id="sec4.3.1"><span class="h3"><i>4.3.1 Addition and elimination</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Another reaction pathway which has a stereoelectronic requirement is bimolecular elimination &#x0028;E2&#x0029;. This process occurs most readily when the eliminated groups are located antiperiplanar with respect to each other. This leads to optimal alignment of the &#x03C3;-bond being attacked by the base and the &#x03C3;*-orbital of the bond attached to the leaving group, and requires minimum structural reorganisation to form the new &#x03C0;-bond.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig178.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The next best orientation from the point of view of optimal orbital overlap is a synperiplanar one, but this does not occur in a chair cyclohexane. Eliminations involving equatorial bonds involve a synclinal orientation which is unfavourable. Accordingly it appears that E2 eliminations in cyclohexanoid systems will occur using neighbouring <i>trans</i>-diaxial groups but not <i>trans</i>-diequatorial or <i>cis</i>-axial-equatorial substituents. So, for example, whilst <i>cis</i>-4-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexyl tosylate readily eliminates &#x0028;by an E2 mechanism&#x0029; the <i>trans</i> isomer, in which the tosylate group is equatorial, prefers El &#x0028;and competing S<sub>N</sub>&#x0029; reaction pathways. Cyclohexyl tosylate itself undergoes E2 elimination at a rate about 0.26 that of the <i>cis</i>-4-<i>tert</i>-butyl derivative, reflecting the preference for a conformation in which the tosylate group is equatorial.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig179.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The nine stereoisomers of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane include seven <i>meso</i> forms and a <i>d,l</i> pair. Only one of these &#x0028;shown left&#x0029; has no chlorine substituent antiperiplanar &#x0028;<i>i.e.</i> in a 1,2-<i>trans</i> diaxial relationship&#x0029; with respect to a hydrogen atom in its preferred conformation. Consequently this isomer undergoes base-catalysed elimination 7000 times slower than any of the other isomers.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The &#x201C;all- <i>trans&#x201D;</i> hexachloro-cyclohexane isomer &#x0028;below&#x0029; eliminates HCI much less readily than its stereoisomers because of the absence of a 1, 2-diaxial relationship of a C&#x2013;H and a C&#x2013;Cl bond.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig180.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another comparison of the relative ease of such diaxial and axial-equatorial eliminations is provided by the iodide-induced debromination of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Formation of cyclohexene from the <i>trans</i>-isomer is <i>ca.</i> 11 times faster than from the <i>cis,</i> but this does not give direct insight into the relative ease of these two processes <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a>since kinetic studies suggest that the <i>cis</i>-isomer undergoes a rate-determining substitution of bromide by iodide prior to elimination. Account must also be taken of the position of the diequatorial-diaxial conformational equilibrium for the <i>trans</i>-dibromo isomer. From this it is clear that diaxial elimination occurs faster than bimolecular substitution.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig181.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The addition of bromine to cyclohexene follows the reverse of this pathway preferring to form the <i>trans</i>-antiperiplanar product through nucleophilic attack on an intermediate bromonium ion. The alternative site of attack leads to a less-favourable diaxial twist-boat geometry. Each of these must then ring-invert into the corresponding 1,2-diequatorial chair form:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig182.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">When bromination of cyclohexene is carried out in water the result is the formation of a <i>trans</i>-1,2-bromohydrin, formed once again by diaxial opening of an intermediate bromonium ion.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig183.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="indent">The reactions of conformationally locked bromohydrins in the presence of base or Ag<sub>2</sub>O provide another nice illustration of stereoelectronic control; in each case the preferred pathway is determined by the nature of the substituent/bond antiperiplanar to the leaving group, a bromide ion.</p>
<p class="indent">When the hydroxyl and bromo substituents are both axial, an internal nucleophilic displacement leads to epoxide formation:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig184.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">whereas with bromine axial and the hydroxyl group equatorial, the favoured pathway involves a hydride shift &#x0028;or HBr elimination&#x0029; of the axial C-H bond.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig185.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">If both substituents are equatorial, ring contraction is possible involving a 1,2- &#x0028;Wagner-Meerwein&#x0029; shift of the C-C bond <i>trans coplanar</i> with the C-Br bond. This leads to a hydroxyl-stabilised carbocation which loses a proton resulting in formation of a carbonyl group. Further examples of such skeletal rearrangements are discussed later in <a href="#sec4.3">section 4.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if the conformational lock is not too bulky, ring inversion can occur to give the diaxial substituent geometry required for epoxide formation &#x0028;but with inverted stereochemistry relative to the example above&#x0029;.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig186.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.3.2 Elimination reactions in other alicyclic rings</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>We have already noted that whilst an antiperiplanar geometry gives optimum orbital alignment for an elimination process, a syn-periplanar arrangement of departing groups is almost as good. Such an elimination process becomes important when an antiperiplanar conformation cannot be achieved. For example, elimination of H&#x0028;D&#x0029;-X from norborn-2-yl derivatives such as that shown below &#x0028;which are effectively rigid, bridged cyclohexane boat conformations&#x0029; affords a norbornene which has no deuterium present, reflecting the favourable syn &#x0028;0&#x00B0; for D-C-C-X &#x0029; and unfavourable anti &#x0028;120&#x00B0; for H-C-C-X&#x0029; dihedral angles for elimination.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig187.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Six-membered rings are the only alicyclic structures between C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>14</sub> in which a strain-free antiperiplanar conformation can be readily achieved. Consequently syn elimination becomes more important for other ring sizes and is frequently the predominant process, particularly in cycloalkyltrimethylammonium hydroxides &#x0028;Hofmann elimination&#x0029;:</p>

<p class="indent">For medium ring derivatives the possibility of <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> isomer formation introduces a further complication. Whilst the <i>cis</i> isomer is more stable, Hofmann elimination gives almost pure <i>trans</i>-cycloalkene from both cyclononyl- and cyclodecyl trimethylammonium hydroxide.</p>

<p class="indent">Selective isotopic labelling has provided further information about this process. A substantial isotope effect &#x0028;indicative of an E2 mechanism&#x0029; is observed for the formation of both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> cyclodecenes only when H<sub>t</sub> is deuterated &#x0028;in 1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-7-cyclodecyl <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a>trimethylammonium hydroxide&#x0029;. This suggests that <i>only</i> the <i>trans</i> hydrogen is lost when either cycloalkene isomer is formed, <i>i.e.</i> that the <i>cis</i> isomer results from anti-elimination whereas the <i>trans</i> isomer is formed by syn-elimination. This interpretation, which is known as the &#x201C;syn-anti dichotomy&#x201D;, has however been questioned.</p>
<p class="indent">Even elimination in cyclo-octyl trimethylammonium hydroxide favours the formation <i>trans</i>-cyclo-octene &#x0028;<i>trans</i>:<i>cis =</i> 3:2&#x0029; despite the fact that this is thermodynamically much less stable than its <i>cis</i> isomer.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig191.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Such product ratios are very leaving-group dependent. For example, dehydrobromination leads predominantly to the <i>cis</i> isomer suggesting that leaving group bulk may be an important factor in determining the favoured reaction pathway.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reduction of ketones</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hydride reduction of cyclohexanones represents a controversial problem. Reaction of cyclohexanones with lithium aluminium hydride and its analogues can be regarded as nucleophilic addition of hydride to a carbonyl group. Reduction of 4-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexanone with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> gives a product mixture in which the more stable equatorial alcohol predominates &#x0028;see Table&#x0029; - a result which is typical for &#x201C;small&#x201D; reducing agents. However, when bulky hydride reducing agents such as &#x0028;L&#x0029;-selectride &#x005B;LiHB&#x0028;sec-Bu&#x0029;<sub>3</sub>&#x005D; are used, the product is almost exclusively the axial alcohol <i>i.e.</i> the <i>cis</i>-isomer.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig200.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">These results suggest that, in general, axial attack on the carbonyl group is favoured by nucleophiles, leading to equatorial alcohol product. However, axial addition may be hampered by steric factors resulting in an increased preference for equatorial attack &#x0028;favouring axial alcohol product&#x0029; as shown by the change in product distribution as the bulk of the nucleophile is increased &#x0028;see Table&#x0029;.</p>
<p class="indent">Substituents about the cyclohexane ring can also influence the stereochemistry of nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduction of 2-methylcyclohexanone favours axial-hydride addition whereas when the more bulky &#x0028;L&#x0029;-selectride &#x005B;LiBH&#x0028;<i>s</i>-Bu<sub>3</sub>&#x0029;&#x005D; is used only equatorial addition of hydride is seen.</p>

Felkin has proposed an explanation based on steric interactions in an early, reactant-like transition state:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig207.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">It is perhaps not surprising that bulky groups should favour attack from the equatorial direction in order to avoid unfavourable 1,3-diaxial interactions with substituents at C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>. However, when addition from an equatorial direction is viewed along the C<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;C<sub>1</sub>&#x0028;=O&#x0029; bond it is seen that, as the carbonyl carbon atom becomes tetrahedral, the C&#x2013;O bond sweeps into an axial position passing through unfavourable eclipsing interactions with neighbouring C&#x2013;H bonds on C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>6</sub>. Attack from the axial face by small nucleophiles is much less affected by 1,3-diaxial interactions and rehybridisation of the carbonyl group results in the C&#x2013;O bond twisting in the opposite direction, avoiding such unfavourable torsional clashes.<a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></p>
<p class="indent">An electronic explanation has also been proposed which suggests that during hydride reduction, a stabilising interaction occurs involving the &#x03C3;* molecular orbital of the developing C-H bond &#x0028;between the hydride moiety and the carbonyl carbon atom&#x0029; and the &#x03C3;-bonding molecular orbitals of the axial C-H groups at C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>6</sub>; this favours axial addition.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Neighbouring group effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The stereochemistry of displacement reactions on alicyclic rings can be modified by the presence of neighbouring groups. For example, both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-2-acetoxycyclohexyl tosylate are acetolysed &#x0028;reacted in AcOH/AcO&#x0029; to give <i>trans-</i>1,2-diacetoxycyclohexane as the sole product.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig209.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">If optically active <i>trans</i>-tosylate is used, it is found that pure racemic <i>trans</i>-fflacetate product is formed. Finally it is observed that the <i>trans</i> isomer reacts <i>ca.</i> 660 times faster than the <i>cis</i> &#x0028;at <i>ca.</i> 100&#x00B0;C&#x0029;.</p>
<p class="indent">The explanation for these observations arises from the fact that two different reaction pathways are occurring. The <i>cis</i>-isomer reacts by a simple S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement &#x0028;resulting in retention of optical activity&#x0029;.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig210.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="indent">However, neighbouring group participation is possible in the <i>trans</i>-ester. The &#x03C0;-electrons from the acetoxycarbonyl group participate in displacement of tosylate &#x0028;thereby facilitating its departure and enhancing the reaction rate&#x0029; to form an intermediate which has a time-averaged plane of symmetry &#x0028;hence the observed racemisation in this case&#x0029; and in which the carbocation centre is efficiently stabilised by two oxygen atoms &#x0028;a dioxalenium cation intermediate&#x0029;.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig211.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">As a result of neighbouring group participation the external nucleophile must attack the intermediate from the same face as that from which tosylate departed, but this can occur at <i>either</i> the carbon atom which originally bore the tosylate group <i>or</i> at that to which the acetoxy group had originally been attached, since both sites are now equivalent. These two alternatives lead to formation of equal amounts of the enantiomeric <i>trans-</i>1,2-diacetoxycyclohexanes.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.6.1 Hydroxylation of alkenes</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The above process has been exploited for the hydroxylation of alkenes in the Pr&#x00E9;vost reaction. Treatment of cyclohexene with iodine and silver acetate in acetic acid, followed by hydrolysis of the ester products affords either <i>cis-</i> or <i>trans-</i>cyclohexane-1,2-diol depending on whether wet or dry conditions respectively were used. An initially formed iodonium ion is captured by acetate to give <i>trans</i>-l-iodo-2-acetoxy-cyclohexane.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a>Ag&#x0028;I&#x0029; then induces loss of iodide which is accompanied by neighbouring group participation by the acetoxy group forming the intermediate seen previously &#x0028;above&#x0029;.

<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig213.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">However, water attacks this intermediate by addition to the carbocation centre to give a hemi-orthoester which can fragment to <i>cis-</i>2-acetoxy-cyclohexanol, further hydrolysis of which gives <i>cis-</i>cyclohexane-1,2-diol.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.7.1 Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The cyclohexane-1,2-diols resulting from hydroxylation of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene can, in the presence of 20% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, undergo a pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement. For example, in the <i>cis</i>-diol, one Me and one HO group are <i>trans</i>-diaxial and 2,2-dimethyl-cyclohexanone is formed by methyl group migration. The <i>trans</i>-diol, in which both OH groups are axial, rearranges by a ring contraction to give methyl-&#x0028;l-methylcyclopentyl&#x0029;ketone &#x0028;this involves migration of the ring carbon-carbon bond which is antiperiplanar to the -OH<sub>2</sub>&#x002B; leaving group&#x0029;.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig216.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Similar rearrangements can occur when 2-hydroxycyclohexyl amines are diazotised. The use of conformationally locked amines &#x0028;through the presence of a 4-<i>tert</i>-butyl group&#x0029; demonstrates that rearrangement always occurs by migration of the bond <i>antiperiplanar</i> to the diazonium ion intermediate.</p>
<p class="indent">When both the hydroxyl and amino groups are axial, diazotisation is followed by an internal S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement of nitrogen by the oxygen nucleophile resulting in the formation of an epoxide:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig217.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="indent">When the hydroxyl is equatorial and the amino group is axial, the substituent <i>trans</i>-coplanar with the leaving group is now a C-H bond and a 1,2-hydride shift occurs leaving an oxygen-lone-pair-stabilised carbocation which forms a carbonyl group after loss of a proton:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig218.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">When the amino substituent is equatorial neither the O-H nor the C-H bond have an antiperiplanar relationship with the C-NH<sub>2</sub> bond. Instead it is a C-C bond in the ring skeleton which is now optimally placed for neighbouring group participation, resulting in ring contraction to a hydroxyl-stabilised carbocation which loses a proton to form an aldehyde:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig219.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Similar stereochemical control operates in the acetolysis of decalin tosylates. When the tosylate leaving group is axial there is a methyl substituent antiperiplanar to it and a 1,2-methyl migration &#x0028;a Wagner-Meerwein shift&#x0029; occurs leading to the formation of a more stable tertiary cation. Elimination follows resulting in cyclohexene formation.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig220.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">An equatorial leaving group only has ring C-C bonds antiperiplanar to it and so in this case a ring contraction is seen, the <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a>driving force once again being the rearrangement of a secondary to a tertiary carbocation.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.7.2 Transannular rearrangements in medium rings</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>One aspect of the strained conformations of medium rings is that opposite sides of the ring are brought into close proximity. This adds some interesting complexities to their chemistry. When carbocation intermediates are formed in medium rings, 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5- and 1,6-hydride shifts are frequently observed. Transannular hydride transfers are particularly common during the acid-catalysed opening of medium ring epoxides. For example, rearranged products predominate in the peroxyformylation of cyclo-octene shown below. Labelling experiments confirm that both 1,3- and 1,5-hydride shifts are involved:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig222.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Using the deuterium labelled epoxide shown below it has been found that 1,5-hydride migration accounts for 94% of the cyclo-oct-3-en-1-ol and 61% of the 1,4-diol products.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig224.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">However, this reaction does not proceed by the simple mechanism suggested above since only the <i>trans</i>-1,2- and <i>cis</i>-l,4-diols are formed. This reaction cannot therefore involve free carbocations nor does the 1,5-hydride shift proceed by a concerted pathway as ring deuteriation shows only very small kinetic isotope effects &#x005B;indicating that the remote C&#x2013;H&#x0028;D&#x0029; bond is not significantly broken in the rate-determining transition state&#x005D;. It has been suggested that a 1,5-hydride-bridged carbocation intermediate may be formed after rate-determining epoxide ring opening:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig223.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a></figure>
<p class="indent">Several products are also formed from the bromination of cyclo-octene, cyclononene and cyclodecene, the two bromine substituents being found at various sites around the ring, whereas larger cycloalkenes only form the expected <i>trans</i>-1,2-dibromo adduct. The product distribution from bromination of cyclo-octene illustrates this behaviour. The reaction involves a bromonium ion intermediate which can be opened by an intramolecular transannular 1,5-hydride transfer. The resulting rearranged carbocation is finally captured by bromide ion.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig225.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">In the case of cyclodecene the only product isolated derives from internal hydride transfer:</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>4.7.3 Transannular cyclisations</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Double bonds can also participate in transannular reactions.

Such skeletal rearrangements are seen during the solvolysis reactions during which a carbon-carbon bond within the ring acts as an internal nucleophile <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Chapter 4 Conformation and reactivity in alicyclic compounds</a>helping to displace the leaving group.

Reactions of this type are thought to proceed through a cyclic intermediate and are therefore sensitive to the spatial disposition of the two hydroxyl groups involved. For example, cyclohexane <i>cis</i>-1,2-diol is cleaved by lead tetra-acetate about 22 times faster than its <i>trans</i>-isomer despite the fact that the dihedral angle between the C-OH bonds is the same in both isomers. The rate difference arises because the <i>cis</i>-isomer achieves an ideal intermediate geometry by flipping into a boat conformation - the <i>trans</i>-isomer cannot do this.</p>
