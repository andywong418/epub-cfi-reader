<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>5.1.2 Bicycloheptanes</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>One of the best studied bicyclic systems is bicyclo&#x005B;2.2.1&#x005D;heptane also known as norbornane. Derivatives of this hydrocarbon have a number of interesting properties partly arising from strain present in the structure, and provide a useful framework for testing aspects of reactivity and mechanistic pathways, particularly because of the rigid nature of the skeleton which facilitates well-defined stereochemical control. Perhaps one of the more remarkable features of the reactions of 2-norbornyl derivatives is that a number of skeletal rearrangements can occur during reactions in which the 2-norbornyl cation is an intermediate, but these simply regenerate another 2-norbornyl cation (but one in which the carbocation centre has moved to another location).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The nature of the 2-norbornyl cation has been a matter of considerable controversy. It behaves as a non-classical cation (<i>i.e.</i> a structure in which there is a 2-electron 3-centre bond) or a pair of classical but rapidly interconverting cations:</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig240.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar">At room temperature, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C nmr spectra of solutions of the 2-norbornyl cation show a single resonance because of fast 3,2- and 6,2- hydride shifts coupled with site scrambling by a non-classical (or the rapid equilibration of a pair of classical) cations.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Bredt&#x2019;s rule</h2>
<p class="noindent">In bicyclic and polycyclic structures it is sometimes not possible to locate a double bond at a bridgehead. This is a particular problem when the rings are small, as is the case in norborn-1-ene, since it is not possible to sustain an approximately planar geometry about each of the alkenyl carbon atoms as required for satisfactory p-orbital overlap to be maintained.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig241.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">This is the basis of <i>Bredt&#x2019;s rule</i> which implies that an elimination process in a bridged structure should always avoid the formation of an alkene at a bridgehead. It is therefore useful to try to determine the minimum ring sizes which will accommodate a bridgehead double bond. In a series of bicyclononenes it has been found that the &#x005B;3.3.1&#x005D;non-l-ene and the &#x005B;4.2.1&#x005D;non-l(8)-ene are relatively stable whereas the &#x005B;3.3.2&#x005D;non-1-ene isomer is as yet unknown. As a rule of thumb it is useful to look at the largest ring component in the structure and compare it with the corresponding simple cycloalkene. For example, the bicyclo&#x005B;3.3.2&#x005D;non-1-ene shown below, which dimerises as soon as it is formed, can be viewed as a derivative of <i>trans</i>-cycloheptene which is also only known as a short-lived intermediate. On the other hand the other two isomers shown can be viewed as <i>trans</i>-cyclo-octem derivatives and indeed have strain energies of a similar order of magnitude to that compound. Bicyclo&#x005B;3.3.1&#x005D;non-l(2)-ene has been prepared optically active and, in contrast with <i>trans</i>-cyclo-octene, cannot racemise because the single m&#x00E9;thyl&#x00E8;ne bridge prevents rotation into the <i>trans-chair</i> conformation.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Bredt&#x2019;s rule states that, in a small bridged ring system, it is not possible, for reasons of excessive strain, to have a double bond at a bridgehead position.</p>

<p class="indent">Whilst adamantene has not been prepared 4-adamantyl homoadamantane is very stable, despite being a <i>trans</i>-cycloheptene derivative:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig243.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The steric bulk of the adamantyl substituent on the double bond prevents dimerisation (<i>via</i> a thermal &#x005B;2&#x002B;2&#x005D;-cycloaddition process) which is the normal decomposition pathway for such unstable alkenes.</p>
<p class="indent">Small bicycloalkenes containing a <i>trans</i>-cyclohexene moiety are very unstable and have only been detected by trapping.</p></section>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Isomerism in bicyclanes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Norbornane (bicyclo&#x005B;2.2.1&#x005D;heptane) can be viewed as a bridged boat cyclohexane. In this structure the two bridgehead C-H bonds are pointing outwards relative to the carbocyclic skeleton; it would therefore be possible to have other geometric arrangements at these centres. Clearly no alternatives are possible in this very strained structure, but if the bridging chains were longer, bridgehead isomerism should be possible as is shown below.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Propellanes</h2>
<p class="noindent">These are compounds in which two carbon atoms, directly connected, are also linked by three other bridges. In norbornane the bridgehead bonds must point outwards whereas in the corresponding propellane they must point inwards to form the bridgehead carbon-carbon bond. The result is a &#x005B;2.2.1&#x005D;propellane.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig247.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">When such structures are viewed along the bridgehead-bridgehead bond they look like propellers, hence the name &#x201C;propellanes&#x201D;. In such structures the &#x201C;saturated&#x201D; (<i>i.e.</i> tetravalent) bridgehead carbon atoms must have all their bonds on one face of a plane leading to very low stability.</p>
<p class="indent">Propellanes can be prepared by the addition of carbenes across bicycloalkenes or by elimination of bromine from bicycloalkanes bearing bromine substituents at the bridgeheads.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig248.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">&#x005B;4.2.2&#x005D;- &#x005B;3.3.2&#x005D;- and &#x005B;3.2.1&#x005D;-propellane are all relatively thermally stable (up to 160&#x00B0;C) but the &#x005B;4.2.1&#x005D;-isomer is less so. All are sensitive to electrophilic cleavage of the central C-C bond, indeed this bond is cleaved in preference to addition to an alkene substituent within the same molecule:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig249.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The lowest member of the series, &#x005B;1.1.1&#x005D;&#x005D;propellane, is in fact more stable than its &#x005B;2.1.1&#x005D;- and &#x005B;2.2.1&#x005D;-homologues. The relative stability of &#x005B;1.1.1&#x005D;&#x005D;propellane (its infrared spectrum has been recorded at room temperature and its structure has been determined by electron diffraction) reflects the fact that the intermediate arising from central C&#x2013;C bond cleavage is also highly strained and therefore does not offer a convenient pathway for lowering the energy of the system.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">&#x005B;1.1.1&#x005D;Propellane has a very long central C-C bond (<i>ca.</i> 160 pm) reflecting the strain present in this structure.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Cubane and other &#x201C;Platonic solids&#x201D;</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cubane is perhaps one of the most aesthetically pleasing of all organic solids - a Platonic solid (<i>i.e.</i> a polyhedron of high symmetry). It was first synthesised in 1964 by Eaton and Cole by route which exploited a photochemically induced &#x007B;2&#x002B;2&#x005D;-cycloaddition and a Favorskii ring contraction as two of the key steps. A simpler route, involving trapping of cyclobutadiene was subsequently devised. The key steps of both are summarised below:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig251.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-22.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The Platonic solids, polyhedra of high symmetry, represent fascinating targets for synthesis and study. These structures include the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="sidebar">Dodecahedrane itself was first prepared in 1982:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig255.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar">An X-ray structural study repeals &#x201C;normal&#x201D; C-C bond lengths and a C-C-C bond angle of <i>ca.</i> 108&#x00B0;. Shown below is the carbon skeleton of 1,16-dimethyl-dodecahedrane</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig256.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An indication of the electronic structure of cubane comes from nmr spectroscopy, the coupling <i>J</i>(<b><sup>1</sup></b>H-<sup>13</sup>C)<b></b> having a value of 160 Hz indicative of significant s-character in the C-H bonds as a result of the need for considerable p-character in the C-C &#x03C3;-bonds required to accommodate the 90&#x00B0; bond angles.</p>
<p class="indent">Other Platonic solids, <i>e.g.</i> dodecahedrane and tetrahedrane derivatives have also been prepared, the latter being most readily obtained as its tetra-<i>tert</i>-butyl derivative:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig252.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Despite considerable strain (<i>ca.</i> 544&#x2013;628 kJ mol<sup>1</sup>), this derivative of tetrahedrane melts at 135&#x00B0;C without decomposition. The preparation of less substituted structures has proved much more difficult and it is thought that the tetra-<i>tert</i>-butyl derivative is stabilised by a &#x201C;corset effect&#x201D; since the tetrahedral geometry keeps the bulky <i>tert</i>-butyl groups as far away from each other as possible thereby minimising steric interference (an X-ray structural view of the carbon skeleton is shown below).</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Catenanes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The other great challenge for alicyclic chemistry is the construction of chains of interlocked rings. This was first achieved in <i>ca.</i> 0.1% yield using a statistical approach involving an acyloin reaction by Wasserman in 1960. In this experiment the acyloin reaction shown below was carried out in a deuterium-labelled hydrocarbon solvent. When the acyloin product was investigated, it was found to contain a very small amount of deuterium label which had arisen from the threading of the diester through the large hydrocarbon macrocycle and subsequent ring closure.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig257.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Under normal conditions catenanes (in which two macrocycles are interlocked as the first pair of links of a chain) are formed in very low yield.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">More recently intermolecular interactions have been exploited to template such syntheses and catenanes can now be made in yields comparable with those of more traditional reactions (<i>e.g.</i> as high as 70%). Indeed Stoddart, a pioneer in the field, has now successfully synthesised an Olympic ring symbol (<i>i.e.</i> 5 interlocking rings). An example of this approach to catenanes is illustrated below:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig258.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">When the pyridine ring alkylates, the resulting trication threads through the crown ether in such a manner that the final alkylation step of catenane formation becomes very favourable. This final step is favoured by a series of aromatic associative interactions and hydrogen bonding which help to pre-organise the structure of the intermediate.</p>
