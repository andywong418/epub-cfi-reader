<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Types of stereoisomerism</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before discussing the behaviour of alicyclic compounds it is useful to review several aspects of molecular stereochemistry which will be important later. For a given molecular formula various types of isomerism are possible. Firstly the atoms may be assembled in a variety of different ways (paying attention to the normal rules of valency&#x0021;). This leads to a number of alternative chemical structures having different atom-atom connectivity patterns; these are known as <i>structural isomers.</i> In general however a given structural arrangement may form additional isomers having the same connectivity but differing in the spatial arrangements of the atoms within the molecule; these are known as <i>stereoisomers</i> and fall into two classes: <i>enantiomers</i> and <i>diastereoisomers</i> (sometimes called diastereomers).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig17.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar">These mirror-image structures are a pair of enantiomers and cannot be superimposed on each other.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Enantiomers occur in pairs and may be most simply defined as structures which are non-superimposible mirror images of each other. All other stereoisomers derived from a particular structural formula are referred to as diastereoisomers. These latter include, for example, <i>E-</i>and <i>Z</i>-alkenes (often called geometric isomers) or any optically active isomers which are not related as enantiomers.</p>
<p class="indent">A consideration of isomerism in 1,2-dichlorocyclopentane illustrates the application of these concepts (it may be useful for the reader to construct models of these). Three different stereoisomers are found as shown below:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig16.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-27em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">In general 1,n-disubsfituted cycloalkanes bearing two identical substituents (<i>n</i> being any other position about the ring, such that n &#x003E; 1) have an achiral <i>cis</i> isomer (a meso form) and a chiral <i>trans</i> isomer (<i>i.e.</i> a pair of enantiomers). These <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> stereoisomers are diastereomers and are often referred as geometric isomers.</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:1em;">In some cases such as 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexanes the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers are both achiral:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig18.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar" style="margin-top:1em;">Note that the <i>trans</i> isomer also has a centre of symmetry and that, in such flexible ring structures, the stereochemical relationship between different groups is most easily determined by consideration of a planar ring geometry (<i>if</i> that can be formed).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In this case the two chlorine atoms may be located <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> with respect to the ring plane (the <i>Z,E</i> system of nomenclature is not used for cyclic compounds). The <i>cis</i> isomer has a plane of symmetry, but the <i>trans</i> isomer exists as a pair of enantiomers. Such a situation is generally true in 1 ,n-disubstituted cycloalkanes with two identical substituents. However, in even- membered rings when the substituents are at opposite corners of the structure neither isomer is optically active since in this case each isomer has a plane of symmetry along the line joining the two substituted atoms in addition to other elements of symmetry whether or not the substituents are the same.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a><span class="h3"><i>2.1.1 Nomenclature</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>When there are more than two substituents present in a ring the nomenclature must be extended to include the relative positions of each group. In such cases it is necessary to define a reference substituent relative to which the locations of the others can be referred. The reference group, which is designated by the prefix <i>r</i>, is chosen as that attached to the lowest numbered ring atom bearing a substituent which gives rise to cis-trans isomerism. Other substituents can then be described as <i>c</i> (cis) or <i>t</i> (trans) with respect to this reference position. Using these rules the compound shown below can be identified as <i>t</i>-5-chloro-<i>t</i>-2,<i>c</i>-3-dimethylcyclohexan-<i>r</i>-l-ol.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Configuration versus conformation</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is important to emphasise the difference between configurational and conformational isomerism. Different molecular configurations, <i>e.g.</i> enantiomers or diastereoisomers, can normally be interconverted only by the breaking of one or more bonds within the structure. However, flexible molecules can adopt a number of different geometries some of which will be more stable than others, a situation which is very common in alicyclic compounds. Such different molecular geometries which can be readily interconverted by bond rotation are known as conformers or conformations.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x005B;In practice, the difference between configurations and conformations is merely a matter of activation energy. There is a grey area when the activation energy for interconversion is such that the process can occur at a reasonable rate not far above room temperature.&#x005D;</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.3">
<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ring conformations</h2>
<p class="noindent">The earliest attempt to explain the behaviour of alicyclic compounds was made by Baeyer whose <i>ring strain theory</i> of 1885 assumed that rings were planar and that strain simply reflected deviation from a &#x201C;normal&#x201D; tetrahedral carbon bond angle <i>i.e.</i> 109&#x00B0; 28&#x2019; (as seen in methane, diamond etc.). If rings are considered to behave as regular planar polygons it will be seen that cyclopentane with an internal angle of 108&#x00B0; can most readily accommodate sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised carbon atoms; consequently this should be the least strained ring.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately this approach breaks down for larger rings because of their non-planarity (even cyclohexane was at that time thought to be planar) but angle strain is none-the-less one of several factors which control ring stability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a><span class="h3"><i>2.3.1 Methods for investigating molecular conformation and strain</i></span> A number of different techniques have provided valuable insight into the conformational behaviour of saturated carbocyclic rings. Single crystal X-ray structural studies provide direct insight into 3-dimensional geometries in the solid state but the results must be treated with caution in the case of flexible structures since crystal lattice/packing requirements may distort the ring conformation. Consequently such data must be used in conjunction with other approaches. Electron diffraction also provides structural information but this technique uses samples in the gas phase and thus at best only offers a 2-D projection-based view of the structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Infra-red spectroscopy gives direct information about bond vibrations and rotations. These depend on vibrational force constants which reflect the hybridisation states of the atoms involved. Increased &#x201C; s&#x201D; -character at a carbon atom makes a C-H or C-C bond shorter and stronger (the bond force constants change). This is seen in the C-H infrared absorptions of ethane, ethene and ethyne for which v<sub>max</sub> (C-H) changes from 2860 and 2950 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), to 3010&#x2013;3060 (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) and 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>). The C-H stretching bands for cyclopropane occurs at 3000 and 3062 cm<sup>-1</sup> suggesting alkene-like character.</p>
<p class="indent">Cyclopropanes and unsaturated systems also show absorptions in the uv-visible spectrum. Cyclopropane itself has an absorption band at <i>ca.</i> &#x03BB;<sub>max</sub> 195 nm, close to that for ethene (at 171 nm) and indicating the relatively weak nature of its C-C &#x03C3;-bonds (normal C-C &#x03C3;-bonds show no such ultra-violet absorption).</p>
<p class="indent">Of particular importance, however, is the use of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy. This can provide direct information about molecular geometry and dynamic behaviour in solution and can also give insight into the hybridisation state and relative geometries of various atoms in a structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of these techniques will provide important information in the subsequent discussion.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Chemical shift (&#x03B4;) and coupling constant (<b><i>J</i></b>) data which are obtained from nmr spectroscopy can give useful information about the geometry and conformational flexibility of a molecule in solution, and the hybridisation state of the various atoms in the structure.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Types of strain</h2>
<p class="noindent">Strain arises from a non-ideal molecular geometry and several factors may be considered to make important contributions to it. These include:</p>

<p class="indentt">When a molecule is in a very unfavourable geometry, its energy can be minimised by distorting bond angles and changing bond lengths (<i>e.g.</i> by rehybridisation) but it is not possible to completely compensate for a non-ideal situation. Consequently there remains some residual strain which leads to decreased stability.<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a></p>
<p class="indent">In principle it is possible to calculate the degree of strain present in different molecular geometries using an equation of the type:</p>

<p class="indent">Bond angle change may be thought of as arising from rehybridisation of the pivotal atom <i>i.e.</i> through variation of the s- and p-content of the various bonding orbitals. This has the &#x201C;knock-on&#x201D; effect of changing bond lengths, strengths and reactivity.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, in ethane there is free rotation about the C-C bond leading to a number of different conformations. However, these are not all of the same energy. The least stable arrangement occurs when all the bonds are closest together, <i>i.e.</i> when all the bonds eclipse each other when viewed from along the C-C bond, whereas rotation by 60&#x00B0; from this <i>eclipsed</i> geometry leads to the <i>staggered</i> conformation, the lowest energy structure in which all the bonds are as far away from each other as possible.

<p class="indent">The angle of twist, the dihedral angle between the two interacting bonds, &#x03D5;, is also known as the <i>torsion angle</i> and the interaction causing the variation in energy, <i>E

The energy profile shown above illustrates how the stability of the ethane molecule varies with rotation about the C-C bond. The hydrogen atoms in ethane are too far apart for direct van der Waals&#x2019; repulsion; the origin of this torsional strain is to be found in electronic interactions within the molecule.</p>

The potential energy of the system slowly falls to a minimum at an internuclear distance corresponding with the sum of the van der Waals&#x2019; radii.

<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rotation in butane</h2>
<p class="noindent">When larger groups are present the torsional energy profile, which has just been discussed for ethane, is significantly distorted. In butane, for example, rotation about the central C-C bond introduces two additional factors which must be considered, namely (i) interactions between the terminal methyl groups and (ii) those between a methyl group attached to C<sub>2</sub> and the hydrogens on C<sub>3</sub> (or <i>vice-versa).</i></p>
<p class="indent">During a 180&#x00B0; rotation about the central C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> bond a number of energy maxima and minima are encountered. Using the dihedral angle &#x03D5; between the two C-Me bonds (see below) to define the molecular geometry it is clear that the lowest energy conformation has the two methyl groups as far away from each other as possible with all bonds staggered (&#x03D5; = 180&#x00B0;). This orientation is known as the anti-periplanar geometry. The highest energy geometry has &#x03D5; = 0&#x00B0;; all bonds are eclipsed and the two methyl substituents are as close as possible - this is the syn-periplanar conformation. Two other key points occur during rotation, at &#x03D5; = 60&#x00B0; and &#x03D5;<i> =</i> 120&#x00B0;, and are known as the syn-clinal, or gauche, and the anticlinal conformations respectively. The gauche conformation is an energy minimum (all bonds staggered) whereas the anticlinal geometry is an energy maximum (all bonds eclipsed) on the rotational energy profile.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig24.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a></p>
<p class="indent">The relative energies of the different conformations are shown above. A C-methyl-C-methyl eclipsing interaction raises the energy by <i>ca.</i> 17 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (the syn-periplanar geometry is about 25 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the anti-periplanar form but allowance must also be made for two HC-CH eclipsing interactions, each costing <i>ca.</i> 4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which are present in the syn-periplanar conformation) whereas a MeC-CH eclipsing interaction costs <i>ca.</i> 5.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (the anticlinal conformation is <i>ca.</i> 15 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> higher in energy than the antiperiplanar situation; this value includes one HC-CH and <i>two</i> MeC-CH eclipsing interactions). The corresponding MeC-CMe gauche interaction (where &#x03D5;<i> =</i> 60&#x00B0;) destabilises the structure by <i>ca.</i> 3.8 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. &#x005B;<i>n.b.</i> these values are sensitive to the phase (solution or gas) under consideration&#x005D;</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to appreciate that the two eclipsing interactions noted here (MeC-CMe and MeC-CH) retain the electronic component discussed for HC-CH in ethane, but are augmented by a non-bonded steric (van der Waals) repulsion.</p>
<p class="indent">Rotation about either G-C bond in propane is much less complex since each eclipsed conformation involves two CH-CH and one HC-CMe interaction. The presence of this latter is reflected in the slightly raised energy barrier (<i>ca.</i> 14.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) for this rotation process in comparison with that for ethane, the additional 2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> presumably being a measure of CH<sub>3</sub>/H van der Waals repulsion in this structure.</p></section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.6">
<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Some other factors influencing conformation</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have so far only discussed the conformational behaviour of hydrocarbons in which electrostatic interactions between groups within the molecule are negligible. However, this situation is no longer true when polar substituents such as chlorine atoms are introduced into the molecule. The presence of dipolar bonds means that the overall molecular dipole moment is conformation dependent. For example the &#x201C;anti-gauche&#x201D; energy differences in gaseous 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane are <i>ca.</i> 4.5 and <i>ca.</i> 6.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> respectively.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig25.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">In both cases the energy difference is appreciably larger than that seen for butane despite the fact that the halogen substituents are significantly smaller than methyl groups. This implies strong dipole-dipole repulsion in the gauche conformation. The effect of this repulsion is significantly reduced in polar solvents since the conformation with the higher dipole moment gains more solvation energy under such conditions, thereby increasing the population of the gauche conformer.<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a></p>
<p class="indent">Another situation where the interaction between polar groups can play an important r&#x00F4;le in determining conformational preferences and thereby influencing reactivity is in structures of the type CH<sub>3</sub>O-CH<sub>2</sub>X where X = halogen, OR, OCOR, SR or NR<sub>2</sub>). In general in such cases it is found that a gauche conformation is preferred. In this situation the substituent X will be located antiperiplanar to an oxygen lone pair. In general there is a stereoelectronic preference for conformations in which the best donor lone pair or bond is placed antiperiplanar with respect to the best acceptor bond. This is known as the <i>anomeric effect</i> and plays an important r&#x00F4;le in sugar chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent">Originally this phenomenon was explained in terms of dipole-dipole repulsion between the C-X bond and the C-O-C subunit but the energetics of this interaction would not be enough to account for the magnitude of the anomeric effect. More recently, anomalies which have been noted in the bond lengths of molecules of the type MeO-CH<sub>2</sub>-X have led to the suggestion that the anomeric effect arises from an interaction between a non-bonded (lone-pair) orbital on oxygen and the C-X &#x03C3;* antibonding orbital. This would strengthen the MeO-CH<sub>2</sub> bond and weaken the CH<sub>2</sub>-X bond.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig26.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The <i>Anomeric Effect</i> can be considered as resulting from an n-&#x03C3;* interaction between a C-X bond and a lone pair on an adjacent heteroatom.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Gauche conformations can also be stabilised by other interactions such as intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The infrared spectra of the meso- and (d,l) isomers of butane-2,3-diol each show two distinct O-H bands, one due to free -OH, the other intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded OH. The band separation (&#x2206;<i>v</i><sub>max</sub>) is 42 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the meso and 49 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the (d,l) isomer. The larger separation observed for the (d,l) structures indicates more favourable intramolecular hydrogen bonding in this compound. For the (d,l) isomer hydrogen bonding increases the torsion angle between the C-Me bonds thereby lowering the energy of the structure whereas for the meso case this angle is reduced increasing torsional interaction between the methyl groups and raising the energy of the hydrogen bonded situation.</p>

<p class="indent">These data suggest that cyclopropane behaves more like an alkene than a saturated hydrocarbon. In particular <i>v</i><sub>C-H</sub> , r<sub>C-H</sub> and the H-C-H bond angle in cyclopropane and ethene are very similar; only the C-C bond length r<sub>C-C</sub> in cyclopropane is like that of ethane. A change from sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridisation leads to increased &#x201C;s&#x201D;-character at carbon in the C-H bonds and consequently increased &#x201C;p&#x201D;-character for the C-C bonds in cyclopropane. Since p-orbitals are 90&#x00B0; apart, such a situation more nearly fulfils the requirements for a three-membered ring geometry. Increased &#x201C;p&#x201D;-character in the C-C bonds does not lead to a reduction in bond length but does result in reduced bond strength as is evident from the chemical behaviour of cyclopropane.</p>
<p class="indent">It is thought that the electron density of the cyclopropane C-C bonds does not lie directly along the C-C bond axis but rather is splayed out in a manner which effectively widens the C-C-C bond angle. Such &#x03C3;-bonds are known as &#x201C;banana&#x201D; bonds.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig30.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">Most of the strain in cyclopropane arises from inefficient overlap of orbitals weakening the carbon-carbon bonds in the structure. From a <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a>chemical perspective, there is a continuous gradation in behaviour from a normal alkene like ethene via cyclopropane to cyclobutane (which behaves like an alkane). Despite their reactivity, cyclopropane derivatives are common and even occur in natural products <i>e.g.</i> the pyrethrins, compounds with insecticidal properties which are found in certain members of the chrysanthemum family.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>2.10.1 Cyclopentane</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Cyclopentane is a floppy ring of ill-defined structure. Heat of combustion data suggest that it is somewhat strained despite the near-perfect bond angle present in a planar five-membered ring. The problem is that in the planar geometry all the CH<sub>2</sub> groups are eclipsed introducing <i>ca.</i> 40 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> of torsional strain. However, the experimentally measured destablisation is rather less than this (27 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) reflecting strain relief brought about by twisting of the ring. X-ray crystallography indicates a C-C-C bond angle of 105&#x00B0;, <i>i.e.</i> less then tetrahedral.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two key geometries for cyclopentane, the envelope (which has C<sub>s</sub> symmetry) and the twist or half-chair form (C<sub>2</sub> symmetric), the envelope being the more stable by <i>ca.</i> 2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. Neither of these is a static conformation; there is rapid fluctuation between them. In this process every atom within the ring spends some time in each of the various different possible locations. There is effectively a continuous up-and-down flexing of the ring which equivalences all the atoms of each type - a process known as &#x201C;pseudorotation&#x201D;.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig34.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The presence of substituents distorts the energy profile, favouring a particular geometry, indeed the ring may adopt a conformation somewhere between the two extremes. For methylcyclopentane the most stable conformation (by 3.8 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) has the methyl group in an equatorial position (C<sub>1</sub> above) on the flap of the envelope whereas cyclopentanone favours the twist form with the carbonyl group at C<sub>1</sub><i><sub></sub></i> (above).</p>
<p class="indent">In general, for 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentanes the <i>trans</i> isomer is more stable than the <i>cis,</i> the major factor destabilising the latter being direct interaction between the substituents themselves, whereas for 1,3&#x2013;disubstituted derivatives the <i>cis</i> isomer usually appears to be the more stable.</p>
<p class="indent">In the solid state the preferred conformation is very sensitive to intermolecular interactions. For example, a study of a racemic mixture of <i>tans</i>-cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid reveals a twist geometry whereas that of the optically active acid shows an envelope conformation. Clearly packing forces can readily perturb the potential energy surface in such conformationally flexible structures &#x0021;</p>

Examination of a simple molecular model of cyclohexane reveals that, in order to satisfactorily accommodate a tetrahedral bond angle for each ring carbon atom, the structure must pucker - the ring is <b><i>not</i></b> planar.

<p class="indent">The chair conformation, which has the lowest energy, is rigid and has an almost ideal geometry. For example, it is the key structural building block of the diamond lattice.

The terminal carbon atoms of each &#x201C;butane-like&#x201D; ring segment are involved in a gauche-butane interaction as shown below.

This process occurs fast enough on the nmr time-scale at room temperature to make all of the protons appear equivalent but, at lower temperatures, it is slowed sufficiently that the ring appears to be frozen on the nmr time-scale. Ring inversion in cyclohexane is fast around room temperature (<i>ca.</i> 10<sup>4</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>5</sup> times per second at 300K) and interconverts the axial and equatorial positions.</p>

<p class="indent">Molecular mechanics calculations have been used to probe the pathway by which this chair-chair inversion occurs. These show that the two boat conformations are of higher energy than the chair (the twist boat being the slightly more stable) and are intermediates in the conversion of one chair geometry into the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The transition state through which chair is converted to boat is a twist chair (or half chair) geometry, <i>ca.</i> 42 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> higher in energy than the chair. In this structure four of the skeletal atoms are coplanar (see below).</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig41.jpg" alt="images"/>

The twist-boat conformation is flexible. It lies half way between two relatively inverted boat geometries. Indeed twist-boat conformations can readily intercon vert through true boat transtion states.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct experimental evidence has been obtained for the existance of the twist-boat. Cyclohexane vapour was passed through a hot tube at 800K and then rapidly condensed onto a Csl plate held at 20K. An <a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chapter 2 The Conformational analysis of alicyclic rings</a>infra-red spectrum of the condensed material was then recorded at 70K. This revealed new bands at 770, 869, 1153 and 1469 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> which were assigned to the twist-boat which appeared to comprise about 25% of the mixture. The rate of disappearance of the twist boat on slight warming of the mixture gave an activation energy &#x2206;G&#x2021; = 22.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for reversion to the chair form.</p>
<p class="indent">This elegant experiment relies on the fact that whilst the chair form is the enthalpically more stable structure, the twist-boat geometry is favoured entropically (by <i>ca.</i> 20 J. mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Consequently, whilst at room temperature (300K) K<sub>eq</sub> (chair-to-twist) has a value of 4000, at 800K it is <i>ca</i>. 3&#x0021;</p>

Firstly there is the need to accomodate two <i>ca.</i> 120&#x00B0; bond angles within the structure. An additional conformational constraint arises since both the alkene carbon atoms and their immediate neighbours need to be coplanar in order to maintain efficient &#x03C0;-overlap.

Once again half-chair&#x2014;half-chair inversion occurs through a &#x201C;half-boat&#x201D; geometry (which itself corresponds with an energy minimum in marked contrast with a cyclohexane boat) though this latter is not thought to be the energy minimum intermediate.

<p class="noindent">Reactions which are likely to be influenced by ring-size are those which involve a change in the co-ordination number at the reaction centre <i>e.g.</i> through a change of hybridisation from sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> or <i>vice-versa.</i> There are two classes of reaction to be considered:</p>
<p class="indent"><i>(i) Equilibrium-controlled processes</i></p>
<p class="disp">Here the outcome of the reaction (the position of the equilibrium) will depend solely on the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the starting materials and the products;</p>
<p class="indent"><i>(ii) Kinetically controlled processes</i></p>
<p class="disp">In this case the important factor is the activation energy (<i>i.e.</i> the energy difference between the reactants and the rate-determining transition state).</p>
<p class="indent">There is a concept known as &#x201C;<i>I</i>-strain&#x201D;. This refers to the strain changes brought about by a change of hybridisation which produces concomitant changes in angle, torsional and transannular strain all of which contribute to the I-strain.</p>
