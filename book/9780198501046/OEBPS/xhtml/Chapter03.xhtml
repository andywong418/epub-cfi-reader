<p class="noindent">Approaches to the synthesis of ring structures obviously provide a key component in the repertoire of synthetic techniques. Different ring sizes impose different constraints and problems requiring a variety of solutions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Principles controlling ring-closure reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The rate of a reaction depends on the activation energy of the process (strictly &#x2206;G<sup>&#x2021;</sup>); this is made up of two contributions, one enthalpic and the other entropic.</p>
<p class="indent">The enthalpy term (&#x2206;H<sup>&#x2021;</sup>) reflects not only bond making and bond breaking energies but also bond-bond repulsions plus angle and other strain factors present as the ring forms.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">A key factor determining the entropy of activation (&#x2206;S<sup>&#x2021;</sup>) is the loss of rotational freedom as the chain precursor is converted into a ring. The longer the chain, the more rotational freedom that is lost. As the chain length increases, &#x2206;S<sup>&#x2021;</sup> decreases (becomes more negative) because there is statistically less chance of the ends meeting as the chain lengthens, so the entropy term becomes less favourable (<i>n.b</i>. a negative &#x2206;S<sup>&#x2021;</sup> value reflects the increased order of the structure resulting from ring formation). Solvation changes can also significantly affect the entropy term.</p></section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.2">
<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Kinetic vs. thermodynamic control in ring-forming processes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most ring-forming reactions fall into one of two basic classes, <i>i.e.</i> reactions in which either (a) one bond, or (b) two bonds are formed at one time. Another factor which plays a key r&#x00F4;le in the success of ring-forming processes is whether they are equilibria or irreversible (kinetically controlled) reactions. In general, only 5 and 6-membered rings are formed under equilibrium-controlled conditions because in other cases the cyclic structure is less stable than the open-chain form. However, under kinetic control the energy cost involved in forming a strained ring is overcome by other more favourable energetic factors in the reaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Ring synthesis can involve the formation of one:</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig89.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="sidebar">or two bonds at a time:</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig90.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">For small rings, particularly cyclopropane, angle strain dramatically increases as the ring is formed and torsional (eclipsing) interactions are important in the transition state leading to the planar ring. In practice three-membered rings are relatively easy to form because of the very favourable entropy factor reflecting the close proximity of the sites being linked. Four-membered rings are less readily synthesised because the entropy term is less favourable (the reaction sites are further apart) whilst the strain problem remains significant.<a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 3 Ring synthesis</a></p>
<p class="indent">For normal rings the enthalpic contribution is favourable and the entropie term has not become too bad with the result that these rings are readily prepared by a wide variety of reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">However, for the medium rings neither enthalpic nor entropie factors favour cyclisation. Consequently such structures have proved to be a synthetic challenge and special techniques such as the use of high dilution conditions are required to encourage ring-formation. Since the rate of cyclisation (<i>i.e.</i> intramolecular reaction) <i>k</i><sub>intra</sub> &#x03B1; &#x005B;substrate&#x005D; whereas that for intermolecular reaction (<i>i.e</i>. polymerisation) <i>k</i><sub>inter</sub> &#x03B1; &#x005B;substrate&#x005D;<sup>2</sup>, high dilution significantly promotes ring formation.</p>
<p class="indent">For large rings there is no enthalpic penalty arising from cyclisation but the entropy factor is normally very unfavourable since the chances of the two ends of a long chain meeting are minimal. However, under some circumstances preorganisation of the chain around for example, a metal-ion template can overcome such problems. Thus the formation of large macrocyclic crown ethers such as 18-crown-6 (an 18-membered ring containing six oxygen atoms) occurs readily in the presence of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> because the poly ether chain wraps around the metal ion thereby bringing the chain termini into close proximity.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig91.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-26em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><b>High dilution promotes ring formation</b> because of the greatly reduced chance of a bimolecular (polymerisation) reaction relative to cyclisation.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">18-Crown-6 has a central cavity ideally suited for the complexation of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. When the crown is forming, complexation with this ion brings the reacting sites into close proximity, thereby helping to overcome the large entropie penalty associated with formation of such a large ring.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Other factors influencing the efficiency of ring closure processes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many reactions require tightly defined trajectories for attack on the reaction site in order to achieve the optimum geometry required for reaction via a minimum energy transition state. In cyclisation processes the nature of the chain linking the reacting centres often imposes severe constraints on the trajectories available for an intramolecular reaction and this frequently accounts for the failure of particular reaction types.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="h3"><i>3.3.1 Stereoelectronic control in cyclisation reactions</i></span><span class="space">&#160;</span>Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory regards chemical reactions as resulting from interaction of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one component and the lowest unoccupied/vacant molecular orbital (LUMO) of the other.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>3.3.1.1 The S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.</i> For example, an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction involving reaction of a nucleophile with an alkyl halide arises from interaction of the molecular orbital containing the lone pair on the nucleophile (the HOMO) with the lowest energy antibonding molecular orbital (the LUMO) of the substrate. This latter will be the &#x03C3;* MO for the carbon-leaving group bond (the weakest bond in the alkyl halide) which lies along the C-X bond axis but with highest probability on the opposite <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter 3 Ring synthesis</a>face of the carbon atom from that containing the leaving group X. Consequently the nucleophile, the reaction centre and the leaving group must be collinear in order to optimise the HOMO/LUMO interaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-21.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">FMO view of an S<sub>N</sub>2 process.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig92.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A number of elegant experiments have demonstrated this stereoelectronic requirement for the S<sub>N</sub>2 process. Intramolecular methyl transfer in the sulfonate ester shown below fails whereas cyclisation of the corresponding iodomethyl derivative is observed.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig93.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">The intramolecular alkyl-group transfer process involves a 6-membered ring transition state which cannot accommodate the linear geometry for the nucleophile, reaction centre and leaving group required by an S<sub>N</sub>2 process, whereas the iodide-displacement S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state involves a leaving group external to this ring (an <i>exo</i>-cyclisation; see 3.3.2), a situation which imposes no such constraints.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>3.3.1.2 Addition to unsaturated groups.</i> In this case there are several possibilities, the simplest of which is attack of an electrophile such as H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> on an alkene. Clearly the proton must provide the LUMO for the bonding interaction, and therefore the HOMO must be the &#x03C0; MO of the alkene. This has maximum charge density perpendicular to, and in the middle of the alkene plane and thus the initial trajectory of attack should be on the centre of the &#x03C0;-bond. Such considerations are reflected in the fact that carbocation cyclisations to give 6-membered rings occur much more readily those leading to cyclopentyl derivatives:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/Fig95.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig94.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter 3 Ring synthesis</a></p>
<p class="indent">Nucleophilic addition to a simple alkene is not normally observed but occurs readily for a carbonyl group. This process requires interaction of the HOMO, the nucleophile lone pair, with the LUMO of the carbonyl group, in this case the &#x03C0;* MO. Such a process must clearly occur at one end of and perpendicular to the double bond plane since the &#x03C0;* MO has a node between the two component atoms.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig96.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">In practice the optimum angle of addition to C=O has been found to be 109&#x00B0;. This tilting away from the carbonyl group is thought to occur in order to avoid destabilising overlap with the component of &#x03C0;* residing on the oxygen atom and to reduce a destabilising interaction with the HOMO of the substrate (the &#x03C0; MO). Similar considerations should apply to activated, <i>i.e.</i> electron-deficient alkenes.</p>
<p class="indent">Radical cyclisations involving addition to an alkene are also synthetically important. These involve interaction between a SOMO (a singly occupied MO <i>i.e.</i> the radical centre) and the LUMO of the &#x03C0; bond (<i>i.e.</i> the &#x03C0;* MO) and should therefore mimic the nucleophilic addition process. One consequence of this is that the hex-5-enyl radical cyclises exclusively to give a primary cyclopentylmethyl radical rather than the more stable 6-membered ring alternative reflecting problems in achieving a satisfactory six-ring cyclisation trajectory in the latter case. Similarly the but-3-enyl radical prefers cyclisation to a 3-membered ring:</p>

<p class="indent">The competing intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions described above are therefore a disfavoured 6-<i>endo</i>-<i>tet</i> process which fails, and a 6-<i>exo</i>-<i>tet</i> reaction which succeeds, both being in accord with prediction.</p>

<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/Fig99.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Chapter 3 Ring synthesis</a></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>endo-trig</i> reaction involving the enolate carbon readily occurs to give a 6-membered ring but fails to give a cyclopentyl product, cyclisation through the oxygen atom being favoured in this latter case. This result can be readily understood in orbital terms since though the pentenyl chain can adopt an almost planar C-cyclisation transition state in which the C-Br bond lies in the alkene plane, it cannot twist to bring the back of the C-Br bond down onto the alkene &#x03C0;-cloud as required for interaction with the enolate &#x03C0; MO. However, the enolate oxygen atom has lone pairs both perpendicular to and in the plane of the 5-ring transition state and can therefore readily react. No such problems arise for the more flexible 6-membered ring transition state where the normally favoured C-cyclisation is the preferred reaction.</p>

These are both more readily formed and more reactive than their four-membered analogues (the trimethylene oxides) reflecting the fact that the activation energy for three-membered ring formation is lower than that for the four-membered ring though the latter are more thermodynamically stable making opening of the four-membered ring a significantly slower process.</p>

For example, in the presence of two molar equivalents of sodium ethoxide, diethyl malonate can be alkylated twice. This process provides a convenient route to small and normal rings.

<p class="indent">The relative stereochemistries of substituents of both diene and dienophile are retained in the Diels Alder adduct, which considerably enhances the synthetic value of this process. In particular, intramolecular Diels Alder reactions provide an important method for the synthesis of polycyclic systems such as those present in terpenes, steroids and alkaloids. Such reactions can be used to form several chiral centres having predetermined configurations in one step:</p>

<p class="indent">Buta-l, 3-diene can in principle undergo either a thermally (conrotatory) or a photochemically (disrotatory) induced electrocyclic ring closure to form a cyclobutene. Whilst both processes are reversible, in practice the relative instability of the cyclobutene ring favours the thermal ring opening process, whereas the &#x03BB;<sub>max</sub> values for the alkene (<i>ca.</i> 190 nm) and the diene (<i>ca.</i> 220 nm) are such that under normal irradiation conditions only the diene absorbs light, leading to a photostationary state which favours cyclisation.</p>

<p class="indent">One problem which can occur in this reaction arises from the presence of ethoxide ion. This can act as a base causing competing side reactions such as Claisen condensation which is a particular disadvantage when trying to use this procedure for the synthesis of small rings. This is effectively overcome by carrying the reaction out in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride which scavenges the ethoxide ion and at the same time traps and protects the enediolate product. For example, in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride, good yields of four-membered ring acyloin are obtained and those of other rings sizes are improved. When diethyl succinate is reacted with Na metal in xylene, Dieckmann cyclisation gives the dimer, 2, 5-<i>bis</i>-(carboethoxy)-cyclohexane-l, 4-dione, but when Me<sub>3</sub>SiCl is present, the acyloin product 2-hydroxycyclobutanone is obtained in 70% yield. Under the same conditions diethyl suberate &#x005B;EtO.CO&#x2013;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>&#x2013;CO.OEt&#x005D; gives 2-hydroxycyclo-octanone (in 75% yield)</p>
