Input and output transducers</h2>

<p class="noindent">The objective of the instrumentation described in this book is to convert some phenomenon of chemical interest to an electrical signal, then to process and manipulate that signal, and finally to turn the processed result into something useable by the experimenter. In this chapter and the next, we examine the output and input interfaces with the experiment and the experimenter. The devices that provide the interface are <i>transducers</i> because they convert a non-electrical phenomenon to or from an electrical one. In modern instrumentation, of course, the final link may be a computer and its associated memory and storage, so that the interface with the investigator may be the screen display, the printed results, or similar output.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">We start by discussing the final link, the output transducer, since these devices are often in reality rather familiar electrical measuring instruments, such as meters, pen recorders, and oscilloscopes. Different senses of the observer may be called into play. The three devices just mentioned depend primarily on vision. Hearing may also be used, as, for example, in the detection of an audiofrequency a.c. signal. Before getting involved with the transducers themselves, it is useful to consider the types of electrical signal that they are called on to convert for interpretation by the experimenter.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Analogue signals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Electrical signals may often be in the form of a voltage, current, or, more rarely, charge or power generated by the chemical system under investigation. These signals may be converted from one form to another (e.g. from current to voltage) in the electrical part of the instrumentation, but the measured quantity remains the amplitude of one of the variables, and its variation with time or experimental conditions as explained on <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_9">pp. 9</a>-<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_11">11</a>. All values of the amplitude are essentially possible since the unit of &#x2018;quantization&#x2019; is the tiny charge on a single electron, and voltage, current, charge, and power are all <i>continuous</i> quantities. Determinations of them are <i>analogue</i> measurements.</p>

<figcaption><p class="aside" style="width:130%;"><b>Fig. 2.1</b> A train of pulses that can be counted digitally. Six pulses have arrived between the start and the end of the measurement in this example</p></figcaption></figure></aside>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Digital signals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Information can be conveyed electrically in a quite different manner. The presence or absence of a voltage may define a logical 0 or 1 (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_19">see p. 19</a>), and the data of interest are encoded in the pattern of 0s and 1s. For example, <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> shows a train of pulses that might be generated by a detector of radioactive particles. The quantity of interest is the total <i>number</i> of pulses detected between the start and the end of the measurement. Although some voltage must define the threshold between the two logic levels, shown in the<a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>
diagram as the dotted line labelled <i>V<sub>t</sub></i> the magnitude of the voltages making up the pulse train are unimportant so long as the 0s are all below <i>V<sub>t</sub></i> and the 1s all above it. The signal is <i>digital</i> because it conveys a number; the minimum &#x2018;quantized&#x2019; difference between successive numbers is evidently one unit (although it might be larger). Our example is of a series of sequential discrete events that are counted. Such a signal is referred to as <i>serial.</i> One single binary digit is encoded by the pulses. In computer and logic jargon, this single digit is called a <i>bit. Parallel</i> encoded digital signals are also frequently used. Instead of the data being sent bit-by-bit (a very appropriate expression in plain English, since it is also precise in logic terms), more data can be sent simultaneously over several wires. Consider the four-wire digital device of<a href="#fig_2.2"> Fig. 2.2</a>. Each of the wires can carry a 0 or a 1. If the wires are connected to indicators that read 1, 2, 4, 8 when activated, then the device can show any number between 0 and 15(1&#x002B;2 &#x002B; 4 &#x002B; 8). As set up in the figure, the number indicated is 11 (1 &#x002B;2 &#x002B; 0 &#x002B; 8). The minimum number change is still unity, and the <i>resolution</i> is one part in 16. If there had been eight parallel wires, the eight bits of information sent simultaneously would have been said to constitute one <i>byte.</i> (The eating analogy is not discarded for the four-bit case, which is a <i>nibble,</i> or half a byte). There is nothing to prevent a series of pulses being sent over several parallel lines more or less simultaneously, and that is what happens in computers and many other digital and logical devices. The specification of a computer as containing &#x2018;eight-bit&#x2019; or &#x2018;sixteen-bit&#x2019; parallel processing gives some indication of its capabilities, although speed of the operations is a key element as well.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Time measurements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Yet another class of measurement uses information from the timing of signals. The timing operations are generally carried out on voltages present as logical Os and Is, although these signals might have started out as analogue voltages. The simplest measurements are those in which the time between two successive events is determined. This time might be the period between two transitions between logical 0 and 1, the <i>period</i> (<i>t<sub>p</sub></i> in <a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>), or the <i>pulse width</i> itself <i>(t<sub>w</sub></i> in the figure). Typical real-life examples of period and width are the time between successive trains passing a road crossing and the time taken for the individual train to go over the crossing.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A slightly more involved use of time measurements is in determining the number of events that occur in unit time. If, in the example of <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>, the &#x2018;start&#x2019; and &#x2018;end&#x2019; were separated by unit time (one second, one minute, or whatever other unit is chosen), then the measurement would have been of number of events per unit time, or the <i>rate.</i> The <i>frequency</i> of an a.c. signal is a very similar quantity. Here, it is necessary to know the number of cycles per unit time (usually one second), and thus the number of times the pure a.c. component (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>,<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_11"> p. 11</a>) crosses zero in the same direction.<a href="#fig_2.4"> Figure 2.4(a)</a> marks the crossings as the signal goes from negative to positive.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>Modern frequency measurements often start by converting an analogue a.c. voltage to a series of digital logic pulses at the crossing point (<a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4(b)</a>), and then counting the number of pulses in a fixed time period. Finally, the number is divided by the time to give the frequency.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Consideration of the techniques suggested for measuring rates or frequencies will indicate that the accuracy of the determination increases with the length of the sampling period. In a very short period there might be no pulses to count, but that does not mean that the rate or frequency is zero. Conversely, one pulse might just occur in that short sampling time, and would translate to a high frequency, even though the true frequency might be quite low. In<a href="#fig_2.1"> Fig. 2.1</a>, the &#x2018;start&#x2019; and &#x2018;end&#x2019; may or may not just include the first and the last pulses. There is apparently no substitute for making measurements over a sufficiently long time that these sampling errors are reduced to an acceptable extent. An intimate connection exists between this problem and the impossibility of knowing the frequency of a truncated waveform that is not repeated for ever (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_6"> pp. 6</a> <i>et seq</i>.)</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Interconversion of analogue, digital, and time signals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Much modern instrumentation takes advantage of the increasing ease with which the three types of signal can be interconverted. Complex integrated circuits, in particular, have removed many of the difficulties associated with the conversions. It is thus often convenient to obtain the initial information from the experiment in one form (frequently analogue), manipulate it in the instrument perhaps in several forms, and final display it another (for example, digitally). <i>Analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs)</i> and <i>digital-to-analogue converters (DACs)</i> are commonplace. An example of time-to-analogue conversion is found in the <i>time-to-amplitude converter (TAC),</i> which we shall encounter again in  Chapter 7, and the <i>voltage-controlled oscillator</i> <i>(VCO</i>) has an output frequency that depends on input voltage, and furnishes an example of a device that converts analogue-to-time signals.</p>

<figcaption><p class="aside" style="width:130%;"><b>Fig. 2.5</b> The elements of a moving-coil meter movement</p></figcaption></figure></aside>

<p class="noindent">The most familiar of all output transducers must be the simple meter. There are various constructions, but the only one with which we shall be concerned is the moving-coil meter. In essence, the meter consists of a coil of wire suspended between the poles of a magnet, and held against the action of a spring (see <a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). When a current passes through the coil, the induced magnetic field opposing the field of the fixed magnet generates a repulsive force that is balanced against the tension in the spring. The extent of (angular) movement of the coil is thus dependent on the magnitude of current flowing in the coil. A needle is attached to the coil, and it moves against a scale, which the observer reads. By great good fortune, the displacement on the scale of a properly made moving coil meter is a linear function of the current flowing. The device is strictly analogue in behaviour, although the
<a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>
resolution may be limited by the ability of the operator to read the position of the needle against the scale. To some extent, the result is subjective, since the skill of the experimenter enters into making the reading. The electrical quantity measured is the current flow, and the moving-coil meter is sometimes called an <i>ammeter</i> (or <i>milliammeter</i> or <i>microammeter,</i> depending on the current to be measured). The sensitivity of the meter is determined both by the field of the fixed magnet, and, more especially, by the number of turns of wire in the coil. Meters with large numbers of turns of fine wire may give a <i>full-scale deflection</i> for 100 microamps or less. Less delicate devices with fewer turns of thick wire can be used to measure currents running into hundreds of amps. It is, however, usual in instrumentation applications to measure currents in excess of a few hundred milliamps with a more sensitive meter equipped with a <i>shunt</i> (<a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). Simple application of Ohm&#x2019;s and Kirchhoff s laws (cf. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>) allows the required parallel shunt resistance, <i>R<sub>p</sub>,</i> to be calculated for any desired sensitivity, so long as the resistance of the meter, <i>R<sub>m</sub>,</i> is also known.</p>

<p class="aside" style="width:130%;">The current flowing through the complete parallel circuit is a factor of <i>(R<sub>p</sub> &#x002B; R<sub>m</sub>)/R<sub>p</sub></i> times larger than that flowing through the meter itself, so that the meter range is increased by this factor</p>
</figcaption></figure></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Although the moving coil meter responds to currents flowing through the coil, it can be adapted to the measurement of voltages as well. For this purpose, a series resistance is incorporated in the circuit (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>). Once again, the simple electrical laws allow the value of the series resistance, <i>R<sub>s</sub>,</i> to be calculated. If <i>R<sub>m</sub></i> <b>&#x02C2;</b> <i>R<sub>s</sub>,</i> the current flowing is nearly equal to the applied voltage divided by <i>R<sub>s</sub>.</i> Thus, for a meter that gives full-scale deflection for a current of 100 &#x03BC;A, a series resistor of 10<sup>6</sup> &#x2126; (1 M&#x2126;) would provide a voltage sensitivity of roughly 100 V. For a sensitivity of 1 V, the value of <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> would have to be about 10<sup>4</sup> &#x2126; (10 k&#x2126;). A real 100&#x03BC;A meter might have a coil resistance of 10<sup>3</sup> <i>&#x2126;.</i> (1 k&#x2126;), so that the correct series resistance for an accurate reading of 100 V full scale would be (10<sup>6</sup> - 10<sup>3</sup>) &#x2126; &#x003D; 999 k&#x2126;, and for the 1 V meter the corresponding value of <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> is 9 k&#x2126;. Whatever the values of the series resistance needed, it is evident that the meter needs to draw some current to make it work, and the total resistance of the circuit, <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> &#x002B; <i>R<sub>m</sub>,</i> is imposed as a load across the voltage source being measured. For low impedance sources, this may not matter very much, but for sources where the impedance is comparable with or larger than the meter-circuit resistance, very considerable measuring errors may be introduced by the loading. Even if the meter resistance is ten times larger than the source resistance, there is an error of approximately ten per cent in the voltage measurement. The distinction between <i>electromotive force</i> (<i>e.m.f</i>) and <i>potential difference (p.d.)</i> was glossed over in the first Chapter. The essential distinction is that e.m.f. refers to the load-free voltage produced by a source, while p.d. applies to the voltage under load, whatever that load may be. It follows that a moving-coil voltmeter is not capable of measuring true e.m.f.s, and that is one reason why it is not suitable for determining electrode potentials ( <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_48">pp. 48</a> <i>et seq.)</i> directly. Different instrumentation must be used that does not draw a current. Alternative methods must be used that either intrinsically draw no current (e.g. the potentiometer,<a href="#page_31"> p. 31</a>) or that <i>buffer</i> the meter from the voltage source (see <a href="#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a> below and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_56"> pp. 56</a>-<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_57">57</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The moving-coil meter is polarity sensitive, because the magnetic field produced in the coil depends on the direction of current flow. The suspension of the coil can be arranged so that the needle points to a central position when there is no current flowing, and such a meter is capable of measuring currents (or voltages) of either negative or positive polarity. However, the moving-coil meter in unmodified form is not suitable for measuring a.c. currents or voltages, because the coil and needle movement cannot keep up with fluctuations on time scales shorter than tenths of a second to seconds. If the meter is to be used for a.c., some rectification circuit must be used to convert the a.c. to d.c. (cf. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_17"> p. 17</a>).<a href="#fig_2.9"> Figure 2.9</a> shows a simple way of achieving the objective. Some care has to be taken in interpreting the voltages measured, partly because of the forward voltage drop of the diode in this circuit, but also because, depending on the <i>RC</i> time constants in the circuit, the meter may read the peak voltage of the a.c. waveform, or some averaged value. The average most often used in calculations is the <i>root-mean-square</i> (<i>rms</i>) value.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A very common electrical test instrument combines many of the functions just described in a <i>multimeter.</i> Switches or plugs enable the user to select measurement of d.c. or a.c. voltages or currents at several different sensitivities, and resistance ranges are often included as well.</p>

Digital meters</h2>





<p class="noindent">Modern instrumentation relies heavily on digital displays, which have superseded analogue meters for many purposes. Some of the most convenient of the displays show decimal digits (0 to 9) directly, and can be placed alongside each other to allow any number of digits to be presented. These displays rely either on the light emitted by certain types of semiconductor diode <i>(light emitting diode,</i> or <i>LED</i>) when a current is passed through it, or on the rotation of the plane of polarization of light by certain liquid crystals when exposed to an electric field, which forms the basis of the <i>liquid crystal display,</i> or <i>LCD.</i> The numbers that are seen are made up as a matrix of dots or as a group of segments that are illuminated (LED) or that show up as dark against a lighter background (LCD).<a href="#fig_2.10"> Figure 2.10</a> illustrates one common arrangement of seven segments, here showing the number two. The selection of which segments to activate is performed by an integrated circuit decoder, the principle of which is outlined in <a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a> for a four-bit parallel input where only the &#x2018;two&#x2019; line is at logical 1 level, and the outputs are at logical 1 for the appropriate segments of the display (numbers beyond nine would have to be dealt with specially in this simplified illustration). Sometimes the display and decoder circuits are put together in one integrated circuit package.</p>



<p class="indent3-ka"><a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So far, we have considered only the display aspects of these digital circuits. The display has to be preceded by processing of the input signal. The <i>digital voltmeter</i> (<i>DVM)</i> uses suitable amplifiers and an ADC (see <a href="#page_22">p. 22</a>) to convert the analogue input voltage to the required parallel digital logic levels. Circuits in common use at present often have very high input impedances (typically 100 M&#x2126; for a 200 mV sensitivity). Currents drawn are thus of the order of nanoamps, and the system under test is virtually unloaded by the DVM, in contrast to the situation that arises with a moving-coil voltmeter (<a href="#page_23">p. 23</a>), and something approaching true e.m.f.s may be measured. One important point to note is that the resolution of the DVM is limited by the &#x2018;quantization&#x2019; of the least significant digit; on the other hand, the reading of the numbers is objective and does not depend on any particular operator skill. With the addition of suitable resistor networks, currents can also be measured digitally, and, with a voltage source, resistance determinations can be made. Digital multimeters are now commonly found as laboratory testgear.</p>

Counters and tinners</h2>



<p class="noindent">Digital displays have other valuable uses in providing an interface Detween instrumentation and the human user in <i>counters</i> and <i>timers.</i> The building block on which these instruments are based is usually a <i>flip-flop</i> (also sometimes known as an <i>astable multivibrator)</i> that changes its logic state from a 0 to a 1, or from a 1 to a 0, for every input pulse that it receives. A counter accepts a sequence of logic pulses to change the logic state of a flip-flop, and each time there is a transition from 1 to 0, a &#x2018;carry&#x2019; pulse is sent to a similar binary device that counts the next significant (binary) digit, as illustrated in<a href="#fig_2.12"> Fig. 2.12</a>. A stack of such binary counters produces as many bits as required of an output that corresponds to the total number of input pulses. The binary output is then taken to the decoder (<a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>) and display (<a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>) to produce a readable value of the count. Maximum count rates are typically 100MHz (ie one hundred million counts per second). Many counters are equipped with &#x2018;start&#x2019; and &#x2018;stop&#x2019; controls, usually operated by electrical impulses supplied by the user.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Timers work in a similar way, except that the pulses are derived from a high-accuracy quartz-crystal controlled oscillator of known frequency. The &#x2018;start&#x2019; and &#x2018;stop&#x2019; signals now allow the counting of these internal pulses. Simple division of the total number of counts by the oscillator frequency gives the elapsed time, which can be displayed as described in the last paragraph (note that dividing by 2, 4, 8, etc merely requires shifting the connections to the display one binary digit higher up the chain of binary outputs from the counter). A <i>clock</i> made up of an electronic timer of this kind can also be used to generate the &#x2018;start&#x2019; and &#x2018;stop&#x2019; pulses of a second counter, which then forms the basis of a <i>digital ratemeter</i> or <i>frequency meter.</i></p>

The oscilloscope</h2>


<p class="noindent">The <i>cathode-ray oscilloscope</i> (<i>CRO</i>), a term usually shortened to just &#x2018;oscilloscope&#x2019;, is one of the most valuable of all electronic devices for use in scientific instrumentation and in testgear. Its value derives largely from its ability to display a.c. waveforms, including pulses and trains of pulses, in a way that looks like an amplitude-time graph, and that is thus capable of instant interpretation by the user. There are other uses besides, as will appear later in this section, and the <i>cathode-ray tube</i> (<i>CRT)</i> which is at the heart of the oscilloscope is also the key component of the <i>visual display units</i> (<i>VDUs</i>) associated with most computer terminals.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_2.13">Figure 2.13</a> shows the essential features of one type of CRT. Contained in an evacuated enclosure are an <i>electron gun,</i> two sets of electrostatic <i>deflection plates,</i> and a fluorescent target <i>screen.</i> A cathode heated by a filament produces electrons that are accelerated by a large potential difference and focused by further appropriate fields. Without any field applied to the deflection plates, this arrangement would produce just a single sharply defined spot where the beam of electrons hit the fluorescent screen. With a field across a pair of plates, the electrons are attracted towards the positive plate (and repelled from the negative one), so that the beam is deflected from its straight-ahead direction. One set of plates is arranged to give horizontal deflection (usually called the X-plates, in accord with the convention for labelling graph axes), while the other pair of plates, the Y-plates, is arranged perpendicular to the X-plates, and gives vertical deflection. Each pair of plates is normally connected to an amplifier so that small voltages applied to the inputs of the amplifiers move the spot substantial distances across the screen, the distance being proportional to the applied voltage.</p>

<figcaption><p class="aside" style="width:130%;"><b>Fig. 2.14</b> Waveform of a saw-tooth ramp voltage used to drive the X-plates of an oscilloscope</p></figcaption></figure></aside>



<h3 class="h3"><b>Linear sweep display</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the most usual way that the oscilloscope is used, the X-plates are connected to a <i>time-base</i> that generates an a.c. voltage with a saw-tooth waveform like that shown in <a href="#fig_2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>. The spot is driven by this voltage from left to right across the screen as the voltage increases up the ramp for the period &#x03C4;, and then it immediately returns to its starting position at the left-hand side of the screen during the <i>fly-back</i> period, and the cycle starts over again. With a sufficiently slow time-base (long &#x03C4;, the spot can be seen to move across the screen and fly back again repeatedly, but at time-base frequencies above about 10 Hz, the motion blurs out, and the eye perceives a straight horizontal line on the screen. Application of a d.c. voltage to the Y-plate amplifier will now shift the horizontal line up or down according to the polarity of the field. If, on the other hand, an a.c. signal is applied to the Y-plates, then the spot is moved up and down as it traverses the screen, and a pattern is seen that corresponds to the waveform of the a.c. applied. A sinusoidal a.c. signal produces a sine-wave pattern on the screen, and so on. The oscilloscope thus provides a way of &#x2018;seeing&#x2019; the waveform of the a.c. The frequency of the time-base must, of course, be adjusted so that a suitable part of the waveform
<a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>
of interest, often many cycles, fits onto the screen. Laboratory oscilloscopes in common use have frequency responses covering a range from d.c. to 100 MHz or more, with the time-base frequency being selected by a range-switch and fine control. Not only can the presence of a.c. signals be detected and their waveforms examined, but the frequency can also be estimated if the time-base is calibrated. In a development of the simple oscilloscope, an additional electron gun can be added (or simulated electronically) to give a <i>dual-beam oscilloscope,</i> and even more beams are possible. The dual-beam oscilloscope allows two waveforms to be examined simultaneously, and the frequency and phase relationships between them can be investigated. The X-Y display to be discussed in the next section is, in fact, more useful for accurate measurements of frequency and phase of sine and related waveform signals, but the dual-trace oscilloscope is valuable for examining the amplitude and shape relationships between different signals, and is particularly useful in following the timing of pulse signals in various parts of a circuit.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">One essential feature of an oscilloscope used in the linear-sweep mode is a means of synchronizing the start of each sweep with the waveform under examination. The details of how the <i>synchronization</i> or <i>triggering</i> are achieved need not concern us, but without the synchronization, each sweep would produce a pattern on the screen shifted at random with respect to its predecessor, and the eye would see only a muddle of lines. An important operator skill in adjusting an oscilloscope lies in being able to set up the triggering correctly.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although we have described the linear-sweep display in terms of a repeated saw-tooth X-plate field, the oscilloscope can also be employed as a single-shot instrument with linear sweep. For example, the oscilloscope might be used to follow the intensity-time dependence of a single laser pulse, a suitable photodetector (see  <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>) being used to convert the light to an electrical signal. In this application, the start of a single sweep up the X-voltage ramp is triggered by some external event (such as an electrical pulse that also triggers the laser), and the electron beam traverses the fluorescent screen just once. It is evident here that the triggering is critical to the success of the experiment, since it is no good the spot having finished its travel, or not even having started it, when the laser fires. To make an accurate measurement of the time evolution of the light pulse from the moment of triggering the laser, it is essential that the relation between the start of the oscilloscope sweep and the initiation of the laser pulse be known exactly.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The use of the oscilloscope in the single-shot mode illustrates a difficulty that is associated with the recording of very fast transient signals that are not repeated. The event is over much more quickly than the eye can record it. One fairly simple way out of the difficulty is to make the fluorescent screen have a relatively long <i>persistence,</i> so that the glow remains for some time after the electron beam has passed by. Another is to photograph the screen, with the camera shutter being opened just before or as the triggering pulse is received. A whole variety of more sophisticated <i>storage oscilloscopes</i> has<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>been devised that memorize, by one means or another, the transient waveform, and keep it available for display. Many of the storage oscilloscopes are, in reality, computers that store a digitized version of the signal in memories that are addressed sequentially by a time-base. The memory contents are then read out repeatedly and converted to an analogue voltage to give an apparently continuous display on the oscilloscope. We are entering the realms of using computers in data acquisition, which is touched on in  <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>; further discussion can be found on <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_76"> pp. 76</a>&#x002D; <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_77">77</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>X-Y display</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">An alternative valuable way of using the oscilloscope is to drive both the Y and the X plates with voltages derived from the experimental system, rather than energizing the X plates from an internal source. In this case, the oscilloscope gives a plot of the Y-voltage against the X-voltage rather than of the Y-voltage against time. However, if both the applied voltages are repetitive a.c. ones, then the oscilloscope spot repeatedly traces out the way in which one voltage varies with time as a function of the way the other one varies with time. If the frequencies of the two a.c. signals bear a fairly simple relationship to each other, then the pattern appears stationary. Such a pattern is called a <i>Lissajous figure.</i> Let us first consider the case where two sine wave signals of the same frequency are used. The Lissajous figure then reveals the phase <i>relationship</i> between the signals (see  <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_6">pp. 6</a> and  <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_12">12</a>, and  <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.8">Figs 1.8</a> and  <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.15">fig 1.15</a>. It is easy to anticipate what happens in easy cases by imagining the spot position in slow motion. The simplest situation is that in which the two a.c. amplitudes are the same, and in which the voltages are in phase. The electron beam then traces out points that always have the same displacements in vertical and horizontal directions, so that a diagonal line of slope 45 degrees appears (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15(a)</a>). If the two voltages are 180 degrees out of phase, the Y plates deflect the spot downwards as the X plates deflect it to the right, so that a straight line is drawn out, but this time with the 45-degree slope in the reverse sense (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15(b)</a>). Now let us consider what happens when the voltage applied to the Y plates is in advance of (leads) the voltage applied to the X plates by 90 degrees. At the moment that the a.c. voltage on the X plates is about to start its positive half cycle, the voltage on the Y plates is already at its maximum and is about to start decreasing. The spot on the screen therefore starts in the horizontal centre position but at the maximum of its vertical displacement, and as the horizontal displacement increases, the vertical displacement decreases. By the time the spot is at the extreme of its right-hand motion, it has also reached the centre of the vertical position, and is about to start being depressed below the centre. Following this kind of reasoning through a complete cycle soon shows that the complete motion is a circle drawn out in the clockwise direction (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15(c)</a>). If the frequency is above roughly 10 Hz, the human eye will not be able to see the direction of motion, but will still observe a circle on the screen. It is obvious that if the Y-plate voltage is behind (lags) the X-plate one by 90 degrees (or leads by 360 - 90 &#x003D; 270 degrees), a circle will again appear, but the direction
<a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>
of rotation will, in principle, be counterclockwise. For any intermediate phase angle, an ellipse will be seen, and the phase angle between the two voltages can be calculated simply from the dimensions of the ellipse, as shown in <a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>. Thus, if some device is used to vary the phase angle &#x0444; between two a.c. signals of identical frequency, then as  &#x0444;  is increased from zero degrees, the straight line of<a href="#fig_2.15"> Fig. 2.15(a)</a> opens up to become an ellipse, and then a circle at 90 degrees, collapsing again to an ellipse with increasing &#x0444;, until the straight line of <a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15(b)</a> is obtained at 180 degrees. The reverse sequence of changes occurs for &#x0444; between 180 and 360 degrees, with the pattern being the same for an angle 360 - &#x0444;) as it is for an angle &#x0444; (but with the opposite direction of motion of the spot).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Stationary patterns on the screen like those shown in<a href="#fig_2.15"> Fig. 2.15 </a>can only be obtained if the frequencies of the two voltages applied to X and Y plates are exactly the same. If there is even a small difference, the phase relation between the two will change with time, and the patterns will vary continuously over the entire sequence just described at the end of the last paragraph. This result affords a method of <i>frequency comparison.</i> The number of times that the sequence of patterns repeats itself in one second is equivalent to the frequency difference between the two a.c. voltages. Since it would be fairly easy to observe the sequence over a period of one hundred seconds or more, it is apparent that the difference in frequencies can be determined to better than one-hundredth of a hertz, or that one source can be tuned to another within that accuracy. Given that the oscilloscope might be examining a.c. signals of frequencies of 100 MHz or more, these numbers would represent a precision of one part in 10<sup>10</sup>, which is hard to match in anything but the most sophisticated digital frequency meters, and yet is achieved by a simple and familiar piece of laboratory equipment that presents the information in a way immediately assimilated by the human eye.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">So far, we have confined ourselves to the patterns obtained when the frequencies of the two a.c. signals are identical. It is only a small step to work out the patterns for other simple frequency relationships.<a href="#fig_2.16"> Figure 2.16</a> shows the results for a verticalihorizontal frequency of (a) 2:1 and (b) 1:3. Ratios such as 2:5 and 3:2 also give quite easily distinguished patterns, but once the ratios require larger integers for their description, the number of crossing lobes in the pattern increases to such an extent that only a blur is seen. At frequency ratios <i>just</i> off the small integer ratios, a &#x2018;revolving&#x2019; pattern is seen of the same nature as that seen for nearly equal frequencies. The use of the oscilloscope in the X-Y mode thus allows simple frequency ratios to be determined or permits frequencies to be matched to set ratios within very close tolerances.</p>

Potentiometers and bridges: null methods</h2>


<h3 class="h3"><b>Null methods</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">Underlying all null methods is the possibility of balancing one voltage or current against another in order to get a net zero output. The idea is shown
<a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>
schematically in<a href="#fig_2.17"> Fig. 2.17 </a>for the balancing of two voltages. Voltage <i>V<sub>t</sub></i> is the voltage to be tested, and <i>V<sub>r</sub></i> is a reference voltage whose value can be varied. If <i>V<sub>r</sub></i> is equal to <i>V<sub>t</sub>,</i> there is no potential difference across the output terminals, a condition that can be tested either with a high resistance voltmeter or a (relatively low resistance) current measuring device.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Null methods play a conceptually most significant part in electronic instrumentation, and, although for some applications they have become superseded by newer electronic devices, they continue also to be of great practical importance. There are several reasons why null methods are potentially so useful. The first is that the measurement of output current or voltage does not have to be accurate or even performed with a calibrated instrument. The only requirement is that the instrument be capable of detecting the balance point with the desired sensitivity. Accuracy in the determination depends on the accuracy with which the reference quantity is known. Comparison of the known and unknown quantities is the essential feature. Exact analogies can be found with the most basic scientific measurements such as weighing. Given adequate delicacy of the suspension, a null-reading two-pan balance has an accuracy of measurement that rests on the accuracy with which the mass of the counterweight is known. In contrast, a spring balance needs to be calibrated in advance (and the calibration may alter with factors such as the local acceleration due to gravity). For many years, electrical null points were determined with various forms of <i>galvanometer,</i> often using a mirror attached to a suspended moving coil movement in order to deflect a light beam. High sensitivities could be obtained, but the absolute sensitivity was often unknown and of no importance if the instrument was to be used only to detect a balance point. Null points are now usually measured with more convenient detectors, although galvanometers from a previous era are quite often to be found lurking within sophisticated and modern pieces of chemical instrumentation. Whatever balance detector is used, the principle remains the same, and the relative unimportance of absolute calibration brings with it great benefits.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A second advantage of the null method of voltage comparison is immediately apparent if it is remembered that zero current flows at the balance point. No load is imposed on the test voltage source, so that the true e.m.f. is measured (cf.<a href="#page_23"> p. 23)</a>, so long as the balance point is found exactly.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The potential divider</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The resistive <i>potential divider</i> provides an important way in which known voltages can be can be derived from a source of higher voltage.<a href="#fig_2.18"> Figure 2.18</a> illustrates a two-element divider. Since a common current flows through each resistor, the voltages across each are in the ratio of the resistances themselves, and it is therefore a trivial task to calculate these voltages in terms of the applied source voltage. Some quantitative voltage relations are shown in the text accompanying the figure. The accuracy with which the relative voltages are known depends on the accuracy with which the resistances are known; the source voltage must be known accurately to obtain accurate absolute output</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>voltages. Precision resistors are relatively easy to fabricate from measured lengths of wire, and laser trimming of deposited conductive films also plays its part in modern technology. A continuously variable voltage source can be made by tapping off a potential from a length of resistance wire (which itself may be stretched out straight or wrapped in a spiral), as indicated in <a href="#fig_2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>. Two points are worth making about the use of a potential divider. To retain the inherent accuracy of the divider, whatever is connected to it must not alter appreciably the resistance across which it is connected. In other words, the load resistance must be high compared with the dividing element, and the load must draw negligible current. This condition can be often met in practice, especially in the two applications that are to be discussed in the next sections. The second point is that the load presented by the divider resistance itself (<i>R<sub>1</sub></i>&#x002B; <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>) to the voltage source must be considered in designing the circuit and interpreting its behaviour.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The potentiometer</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The <i>potentiometer</i> is a familiar piece of laboratory equipment that combines the features of a null voltage measurement (<a href="#fig_2.17">Fig. 2.17</a>) with a potential divider network (<a href="#fig_2.18">Figs 2.18</a> and <a href="#fig_2.19">2.19</a>) to generate a known reference voltage. <a href="#fig_2.20">Figure 2.20</a> shows the variable reference source of <a href="#fig_2.17">Fig. 2.17</a> replaced on the left-hand side by the circuit of <a href="#fig_2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>. A combination of switched fixed resistors and sliding variable resistors is often used in the divider. The balance point, obtained by adjusting the divider, is determined with a meter of suitable sensitivity. Laboratory potentiometers are often calibrated by determining the resistance ratio needed to balance the voltage of a <i>standard cell,</i> which is an electrochemical cell of closely specified construction and chemical composition, whose load-free potential (i.e. its e.m.f.) is known accurately at a specified temperature. As pointed out earlier, a correctly balanced potentiometer does not load either the test source or the standard cell.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Bridges</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">From the potentiometer, it is only a small step to the <i>Wheatstone bridge.</i> <a href="#fig_2.21">Figure 2.21</a> shows the circuit in a rather unusual form in order to emphasize the connection between the bridge and the potentiometer. In the bridge, the test source of voltage of <a href="#fig_2.20">Fig. 2.20</a> is replaced by a second potential divider energized by the same voltage source as the left-hand divider. No current flows through the meter, and the bridge is thus balanced, when V, &#x003D; <i>V<sub>3</sub>.</i> The relationship between the four resistors for balance can be expressed in several ways, of which the form <i>(R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>)</i> &#x003D; (<i>R<sub>3</sub>/R</i><sub>4</sub>) is one of the most useful. In <a href="#fig_2.22">Fig. 2.22</a>, the bridge is drawn in the conventional way:	the circuit isunchanged.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The application of the Wheatstone bridge is in determining unknown resistance values. For this purpose, the unknown resistance constitutes one &#x2018;arm&#x2019; of the bridge, such as the <i>R,</i> position, and the other three resistors altered to achieve the balance. Usually two of these resistors would be left <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>fixed and only the third altered. For example, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> might be chosen to equal to <i>R<sub>4</sub>,</i> and <i>R<sub>3</sub></i> adjusted. The value of <i>R<sub>3</sub></i> at the balance point is then directly equal to that of the unknown <i>R<sub>1</sub>.</i></p>

</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">For some purposes in the laboratory, it is desirable to energize the bridge with a.c. rather than d.c., but so long as all four arms behave as pure resistances (that is, current and voltage are in phase at all times), all the arguments advanced so far remain valid at each point of the a.c. cycle. Balance points in audiofrequency a.c. bridges are sometimes obtained using headphones to detect audibly an off-balance situation. The absence of an absolute sensitivity calibration for the headphones is no disadvantage because the bridge balance is a null point. However, other methods of detection are often used, and some of these rely implicitly on the phase relations between input and output signals. Just as in the d.c. case, the output is positive on one side of the balance point and negative on the other side of it, so with the a.c. bridge the output waveform is in phase with energizing waveform in one direction of off-balance and reverses phase by 180 degrees on the other side of the balance, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_2.23">Fig. 2.23</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The situation becomes more complicated if there is capacitance (or inductance) associated with the resistive elements. &#x2018;Stray&#x2019; capacitance is usually present (for example, in cells used to determine the conductivity of solutions, as described on the next page). The capacitative reactance (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_12">pp. 12</a>-<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_13">13</a>) produces currents and thus voltages in the bridge that are 90 degrees shifted in phase from the energizing waveform, and can thus never be balanced by a resistance in which currents and voltages are exactly in phase. An easy way of dealing with the problem is to compensate the out-of-phase voltages with a small variable capacitance (it could just be a pair of twisted, but insulated, wires), as indicated in <a href="#fig_2.24">Fig. 2.24</a>. The voltages at the &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; ends of the two capacitors now have the correct phase relationships with each other to be able to balance independently of the purely resistive part of the circuit. Several methods exist for finding the balance of resistive and capacitative elements separately, including the use of dual-beam oscilloscopes to examine the phase relationships between output and input waveforms. A more subtle method uses the Lissajous figures produced by the oscilloscope in X-Y mode (see <a href="#page_28">pp. 28</a>-<a href="#page_29">29</a>). The horizontal plates are connected to the bridge-energizing supply and the vertical plates to the bridge output. Off balance, an ellipse will be seen in general (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15(b)</a>). As the compensating capacitance is adjusted towards the correct value, the ellipse should collapse to a straight line (<a href="#fig_2.15">Figs 2.15(a)</a> and <a href="#fig_2.15">2.15(b)</a>). The variable resistor can now be adjusted to balance the in-phase voltages and flatten the diagonal line to become a horizontal one at balance.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The use of the compensating capacitor just described is really an extension of the use of the a.c. bridge to measure capacitances and inductances. <a href="#fig_2.25">Figure 2.25</a> shows a capacitance bridge. In this circuit, there are no resistors at all in the lower two arms. The two upper resistors allow currents to flow in the capacitors (it leads the voltage by 90 degrees, as discussed on <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_13">p. 13</a>). If the capacitances, and thus the reactances, are equal, the voltages at points <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, 2 Simple measuring instruments</a>&#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; will be identical at all parts of the a.c. cycle, even though they are both leading the applied voltage by 90 degrees. The bridge is therefore balanced. The balance point can be found using any of the a.c. detectors discussed previously, and an unknown capacitor may be balanced against a known one to determine its capacitance. Similar bridges constructed with two inductors in place of the capacitors are used to measure unknown inductances.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Solution conductivity measurements in chemistry</h3>
<p class="noindent">One important use of the a.c. bridge in chemistry is in determining the conductivity of ionic solutions. Such measurements give access to a variety of important quantities, including the mobilities and concentrations of ions, that can be used ultimately to obtain information about chemical equilibria in the solution and the solvation of the ions. In these determinations, a cell is used in which two platinum plates are immersed in the solution under test (<a href="#fig_2.26">Fig. 2.26</a>), and the resistance measured. The conductance is the inverse of the resistance. The specific conductance (the conductance across opposite faces of a cube with sides of unit length: see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>) can, in principle, be calculated from the known dimensions and separations of the plate, although it is more usual to calibrate the cell with a test solution of known specific conductance. Just because the conduction is due to the movement of ions from one electrode to another, it follows that ions of positive charge will move towards the negative plate, and ions of negative charge will migrate towards the positive plate. If this separation of charged ions is allowed to continue, the electrical and chemical properties of the solution may be altered: the solution will become <i>polarized,</i> and it may even be <i>electrolysed.</i> One way of avoiding these problems is to make the resistance measurements using a.c. rather than d.c. voltages. Since the bridge is the obvious way of obtaining accurate resistance determinations, the a.c. bridge is of particular value in electrochemical conductivity measurements. However, it should be recognized that the the two parallel plates constitute a small capacitor in their own right. The problem about the out-of-phase current raised on the last page is thus inevitably present. A compensating capacitor, and the appropriate null detection techniques described earlier, can be used to offset the cell capacitance. A neater trick is to replace the compensating capacitor with a dummy cell, connected in a similar way to the bridge as the main cell, and identical to it in all respects except that it contains pure solvent rather than the solution under investigation. The capacitances of the two cells and their associated wiring should then be virtually the same. If they are not, a very small &#x2018;trimming&#x2019; capacitance can be added to one arm or the other of the bridge. The configuration has the further advantage that the dummy cell also provides compensation for the conductivity of the solvent, so that only the component resulting from the solute ions is measured.</p>
