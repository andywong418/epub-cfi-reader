<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series is designed to contain books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Richard Wayne has produced an authoritative, easy-to-read introductory account of Chemical Instrumentation. The Primer introduces essential basic ideas required to understand and exploit the instrumentation encountered by chemistry students in the laboratory at all stages up to and including research level. This Primer will be of lasting and broad value to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
