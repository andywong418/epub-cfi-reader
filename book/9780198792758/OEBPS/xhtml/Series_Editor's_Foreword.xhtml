<p class="fmnoindent">An understanding of stereochemistry, the three-dimensional properties and behaviour of molecules, is an intrinsic part of all organic chemistry. The ability to think in three dimensions is a prerequisite to being able to understand and utilise the basic principles of organic chemistry. It is not surprising therefore that stereochemistry plays a vital role as a fundamental topic throughout all undergraduate organic chemistry courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. In the present Primer Mike Robinson presents the basic concepts of stereochemistry in a logical and easy to follow fashion. This Primer provides essential reading for apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
