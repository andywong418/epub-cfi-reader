<h1 class="main">5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Racemates and resolution</h1>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter I enlarge the concept of stereoisomerism to groups of molecules, e.g., in crystals, or a molecule surrounded by a solvent or adsorbed on a surface. These are essential in some methods for <i>resolving</i> racemic compounds, i.e., separating mixtures of enantiomeric compounds.</p>
<p class="indent-sp">Scalar properties such as interatomic distances and energies are independent of the absolute configuration of a chiral molecule that is either isolated or in an achiral environment. This is no longer true if the chiral molecule is put into a <i>chiral</i> environment. Enantiomeric chiral molecules interact differently with other chiral molecules because such interactions are <i>diastereomeric.</i> Examples of chiral environments are chiral solvents or chiral stationary phases in chromatography (<a href="#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_64">pages 64</a>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_65">65</a>), enzymes (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.8">Section 6.8</a>) or, simply, homomers (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_37">page 37</a>) and enantiomers of the chiral molecule itself. This last possibility appears in the difference in properties of crystals of homochiral and racemic chiral compounds.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.1">
<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Properties of racemates</h2>
<p class="noindent">If a chiral compound is synthesized from achiral or racemic reactants (and catalysts, etc.) then it will be formed as a <i>racemate</i>, a (statistically) 1:1 mixture of enantiomeric compounds (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_78">page 78</a>). Racemates may also result in reactions that (i) allow enantiomers to interconvert (<i>racemization</i>) or (ii) go through achiral transition states or intermediates. Enantiomeric compounds have identical vapour pressures, solubilities, etc. and therefore racemates, 1:1 mixtures, cannot be separated by the methods used for ordinary mixtures. <i>All</i> methods for separating racemates depend on <i>diastereomeric</i> interactions. There are few generalisations to guide the choice of method used. If a single enantiomer is required resolution will usually waste at least half of a racemic mixture. Resolution is therefore often wasteful as well as uncertain and it is usually better to generate pure enantiomers directly through enantioselective synthesis if this is possible (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.8">Section 6.8</a>, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_78">pages 78-83</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2-bh">If a chiral compound has two or more <i>chiral</i> centres (or other stereogenic elements) <i>all</i> of them must change in order to get to the enantiomer. This is often overlooked by students.</p> 
<p class="noindent2"><i>Epimerization</i> is a change at only one of two or more chiral centres, generating a <i>diastereomer</i> of the reactant.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:2em;">Waste of the unwanted enantiomer may be avoided if it is possible to racemize it, particularly if this can be done under the conditions used in a resolution (see next page).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Not only is it difficult to separate racemates but it can be difficult to determine how well a separation has succeeded (see <a href="#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_64">pages 64</a>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_65">65</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">There is a small difference in the interactions between two like chiral molecules, i.e., <i>R,R</i> and <i>S,S</i> pairs, and between enantiomeric molecules, i.e., <i>R,S</i> pairs. When <i>liquid</i> enantiomeric compounds are mixed there are small changes, typically &#8764;200 J mol<sup>&#8211;1</sup> or less, in heat content that will cause, at most, very small changes in vapour pressure. In crystals, where the lattice controls the relative positions of neighbouring molecules, these differences in heat content and related properties can be much larger and may lead to useful differences. In practice most racemates form <i>achiral</i> crystals with a 1:1 ratio of enantiomers (<i>racemic compounds</i>), &#8764;10&#x0025; give a mixture of chiral crystals, each containing a single enantiomer (<i>racemic conglomerates</i>), and a small number form crystals containing both enantiomers distributed more or less randomly <i>(racemic solid solutions).</i> </p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Mixing enantiomers always leads to an increase in <i>entropy.</i> Racemization in dilute solutions is therefore always thermodynamically favourable.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Crystal structures of racemates</h3>
<p class="noindent">When a mixture of enantiomeric molecules crystallizes there are three limiting types of behaviour. If enantiomeric molecules prefer to crystallize together in an ordered achiral crystal (a <i>racemic compound)</i> the latter may be higher melting (as in tartaric acid) or lower melting (as in <a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1(a)</a>) than either enantiomer. If enantiomeric molecules co-crystallize with little or no preference as to which is next to which a <i>racemic solid solution</i> is formed: this is rare. Racemic solid solutions may be lower melting (very rare) or higher melting (as in <a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1(b)</a>) than the enantiomers, or the melting point may be (almost) the same for all compositions. Racemic compounds and racemic solid solutions cannot be separated by crystallisation.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-25em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Some racemates show more complex behaviour, e.g., (i) temperature induced changes between conglomerates and racemic compounds and (ii) solid solutions for a <i>limited</i> range of compositions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the third possibility (<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1(c)</a>) identical molecules interact better with one another than with enantiomeric molecules. In this case enantiomeric compounds in a racemate crystallize separately in enantiomeric chiral crystals, giving a simple eutectic mixture, a <i>racemic conglomerate</i> (preferred term: sometimes <i>racemic mixture</i> is used). If the enantiomeric crystals are visibly different then they can be separated by hand sorting (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.1">Section 1.1</a> for the first example); if not, a single crystal may be enough for a number of experiments, e.g., the helicene <b><a href="#side_5.1">5.1</a></b>&#x0021; An effective variant, that has been used on a commercial scale, is to seed a supersaturated solution of a racemic conglomerate alternately with crystals of one or the other enantiomeric form. Unfortunately the formation of a conglomerate, as in (c), has been observed for fewer than 300 pairs of enantiomers.</p>

<p class="indent">A special case arises when enantiomers interconvert at an appreciable rate in solution or melt, spontaneously or with catalysis.

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Resolution through diastereomeric derivatives</h2>
<p class="noindent">If the enantiomeric components of a racemate can be converted into a mixture of diastereomeric derivatives, from which the enantiomers of the original compound can be recovered eventually, using an enantiomerically pure chiral reagent, then the problem of separating a racemate is changed to separating <i>diastereomeric</i> compounds, usually by crystallization or chromatographically.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Racemates that are acids or bases are commonly resolved by formation of diastereomeric salts with a chiral base or acid respectively (<a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>). It is easy to make salts and easy to recover acids and bases from them. A small difference in the packing of ions can have a large differential effect on the lattice energies and thence on the solubilities of such salts. It is the less soluble of the diastereomeric salts that is the easier to purify and this makes one enantiomer much easier to isolate pure. If both enantiomers of the resolving agent are available, however, alternation in their use can lead to resolutions giving both enantiomeric compounds in good yield and high e.e. (Marckwald&#x2019;s principle). Natural and semi-synthetic chiral acids and bases are usually available in one enantiomeric form only but an increasing number of synthetic agents are now made commercially in both enantiomeric forms (<a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>).</p>

The &#x2013;OH group allows it to hydrogen bond to suitable solutes, notably alcohols and amines. The effect of the hydrogen bonding is to limit the relative orientations of solvent-solute pairs and thereby minimise the extent to which perturbations of the chemical shifts of groups in the solute average out. The other three groups in <b><a href="#side_5.30">5.30</a></b> are very different in size and polarity and this further limits the relative orientations and maximises the diastereomeric differences for enantiomeric solute molecules in solvent-solute complexes. Finally the <i>ring current</i> of the aromatic ring is very effective in inducing differences in <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts of groups in enantiomeric solutes. The commonest chiral shift reagents are paramagnetic chiral 1,3-diketone complexes of lanthanides such as europium or praseodymium, e.g., <b><a href="#side_5.31">5.31</a></b>. They are effective for molecules that can coordinate <i>rapidly</i> and <i>reversibly</i> with the lanthanide (increasing its coordination from 6 to 7), e.g., ethers, alcohols, ketones, esters, and amines. The use of chiral solvents and chiral shift reagents depend on mobile equilibria, very fast on the n.m.r. timescale, between free and complexed solute molecules.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a subtle but very important advantage in methods depending on chiral environments rather than diastereomeric derivatives to differentiate enantiomers. High enantiomeric excess in the chiral chromatographic stationary phase, solvent or shift reagent is <i>not</i> essential, in contrast to the use of chiral reagents to make diastereomeric derivatives. The <i>separation</i> of bands for enantiomers in chromatographic analyses, or <i>differences in chemical shifts</i> in n.m.r. spectra, depend on the enantiomeric excess for the chiral &#x2018;reagent&#x2019; but the <i>analysis</i> depends on the areas of the bands or peaks.</p>
