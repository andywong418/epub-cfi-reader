<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>							  
<p class="noindent">Understanding of organic stereochemistry benefits, more than most branches of chemistry, from a knowledge of how it has developed. This chapter is a very brief survey of the history of organic stereochemistry to about 1960 and introduces many of the more important terms used in organic stereochemistry.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1">
<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Before van&#x2019;t Hoff and Le Bel</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first experimental evidence that the shapes of molecules might be significant came from the observation of <i>optical activity</i> (rotation of the plane of polarization of plane polarized light) in organic liquids (Biot, 1815). This was taken by Fresnel (1824) to imply that such molecules are helical but this was not followed up.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Pasteur&#x2019;s recognition of <i>enantiomerism</i> in tartaric acids was hugely influential. At the beginning of his work three &#x2018;tartaric acids&#x2019; were known. He showed that <i>racemic</i> tartaric acid was a 1 : 1 mixture of the known (&#x002B;)-form and a new (-)-form (1848). These two forms of tartaric acid were indistinguishable by most chemical and physical criteria but were related as an object to a non-identical mirror image. For example, these acids had optical rotations of <i>equal magnitude but opposite signs</i> in solution and the crystal habits of some of their salts were related as a left hand is to a right hand. He correctly inferred that because the differences persisted in solution the <i>molecules</i> of these two tartaric acids must have enantiomeric structures, like a pair of hands. He also showed how a pair of enantiomeric compounds could be separated and that they underwent <i>biochemical</i> reactions at different rates. Pasteur described the optically active tartaric acids as <i>dissymmetrique</i> (meaning lacking reflection symmetry) which unfortunately was translated as <i>asymmetric</i> (having <i>no</i> symmetry). The confusion has been removed by using the term chiral (derived by Kelvin from the Greek word <i>&#x0025;sip, cheir,</i> for hand).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-26.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Enantiomeric molecules are related as an object to its <i>non-identical</i> image in a plane mirror. (&#x002B;)- and (-)-, from the sign of optical rotation of a compound under standard conditions, are used as prefixes to chemical names of enantiomeric forms of a compound showing optical activity.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.2em;">The first three forms of tartaric acid to be isolated were the (&#x002B;)-form from wine fermentation and two optically inactive forms, <i>racemic</i> and <i>meso</i>. <i>Racemic</i> is now used as an adjective for all 1 : 1 mixtures of enantiomeric compounds. <i>Meso</i> is similarly used for <i>achiral</i> compounds containing compensating pairs of chiral centres or other chiral elements (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_45">pages 45-47</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_51">51</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The understanding of these stereochemical differences required an understanding of (i) the <i>constitutions</i>, i.e., the connections between atoms, of organic molecules and (ii) the geometry of carbon atoms. The first required the recognition of the tetravalency of carbon (Kekul&#x00E9;, 1858). The second came from van&#x2019;t Hoff and Le Bel.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The tetrahedral carbon atom</h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The first reference to a tetrahedral carbon atom was made by Patern&#242; (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_3">page 3</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Van&#x2019;t Hoff and Le Bel in 1874 independently explained the existence of pairs of enantiomeric molecules such as (&#x002B;)- and (-)-tartaric acids and other newer examples, notably the two lactic acids from milk and from muscle. They supposed that the four valencies of a carbon atom were directed towards the <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1: Introduction: development of methods and concepts in organic stereochemistry</a>four apices of a regular tetrahedron with carbon at the centre and that there is free rotation about single bonds. Four <i>different ligands</i> (atoms or groups) can be attached to such a carbon atom in <i>two</i> distinguishable ways to form enantiomeric molecules. Van&#x2019;t Hoff developed this model further. He showed that if two such carbon atoms were joined by a <i>double bond</i>, i.e., were joined through two pairs of tetrahedral apices forming two <i>bent</i> bonds, there should be no rotation about such a bond and with suitable substituents <i>geometrical</i> isomerism should result. He used this to explain the previously puzzling relationships between <i>maleic</i> and <i>fumarie</i> acids and similar &#x2018;geometrical isomers&#x2019; (now called <i>diastereomers).</i></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Van&#x2019;t Hoffs work prompted a famous and ill-judged polemic by Kolbe that served to draw attention to the younger chemist&#x2019;s work.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
 <img src="../images/page2-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent2">Van&#x2019;t Hoffs and Le Bel&#x2019;s work on stereochemistry came before Nobel prizes were instituted but van&#x2019;t Hoff was later awarded a Nobel prize for his work in <i>physical</i> chemistry.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">One of van&#x2019;t Hoffs predictions, that certain disubstituted <i>allenes</i>, molecules with the unit C&#x003D;C&#x003D;C, should exist in enantiomeric forms, was not verified until 1935&#x0021; His assumption of free rotation about single bonds was shown to be misleadingly incomplete at about the same time (see <a href="#sec_1.5">Section 1.5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The idea of the tetrahedral carbon atom led to studies of stereoisomerism in molecules with tri- and tetracoordinate atoms such as silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur until such methods were made obsolete by physical methods for determining the shapes of molecules (<a href="#page_3">pages 3</a>, <a href="#page_4">4</a>).</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3">
<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Relative configurations</h2>
<p class="noindent">When van&#x2019;t Hoff and Le Bel explained the structures of the enantiomeric tartaric acids they had no way of telling which acid was which, i.e., whether the molecules of (&#x002B;)-tartaric acid matched the three dimensional structure <a href="#fig_1.1">1.1</a> or its mirror image <a href="#fig_1.1">1.2</a>: note that rotation about the single bonds does <i>not</i> interconvert <a href="#fig_1.1">1.1</a> and <a href="#fig_1.1">1.2</a>. This problem was intriguing but its solution was not urgent because enantiomeric molecules differ only in properties that change on reflection, e.g., optical rotation. Many chemists thought that this problem would never be solved and a general solution came only in 1951 (<a href="#page_3">page 3</a>).</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Stereoisomeric molecules with two or more chiral carbon atoms, however, presented a much more pressing problem. Two such molecules are <i>either</i> enantiomeric <i>or diastereomeric.</i> Diastereomeric molecules differ in <i>all</i> properties that depend on intramolecular distances, e.g., heat of formation, and it was necessary to know <i>relative</i> configurations, i.e., the relative arrangements of ligands around two or more chiral atoms, if properties and reactions were to be correlated with stereochemical structure.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A tetra-coordinate tetrahedral atom is <i>chiral</i> if a distinguishable molecule results from the exchange of <i>any</i> two ligands. A right hand is the non-identical mirror image of a left hand.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Simple sugars (polyhydroxy-aldehydes and -ketones) provided the first major problem in determining relative configurations. This was solved by E. Fischer who was able to show that, e.g., the structure of the molecules of (&#x002B;)-glucose is <i>either</i> <a href="#fig_1.3">1.3</a> <i>or</i> <a href="#fig_1.3">1.4</a> but not a member of one of the other seven pairs of enantiomers with the same constitution. With no prospect at the time of solving the problem of absolute configuration Rosanoff (1906) suggested that the simplest chiral sugar, (&#x002B;)-glyceraldehyde <a href="#fig_1.5">1.5</a>, should <i>arbitrarily</i> be assigned the configuration shown and that the configuration of other chiral molecules should be chemically correlated with that of (&#x002B;)-glyceraldehyde.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">A limitation of Fischer&#x2019;s methods for determining relative configurations was that he had no way of determining whether or not reactions at chiral centres could change the arrangement (retention or inversion of &#x2018;configuration&#x2019;: a different use of configuration, see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_3">pages 3</a>, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_66">66</a>) of groups on such an atom. This required studies of <i>reaction mechanisms.</i></p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms</h2>
<p class="noindent">Chemists originally assumed that a simple substitution R-X &#8594; R-Y would take place without any change in R, i.e., with <i>retention of configuration</i> at R if the reaction site was a chiral carbon atom. Some reaction sequences that converted chiral compounds into their enantiomers (Walden, 1896) showed that <i>inversion</i> of configuration must occur in some substitutions but failed to show which. In yet other substitutions <i>chiral</i> compounds formed <i>racemic</i> products. These problems were solved only by applying quantitative methods to the study of organic reaction mechanisms.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Simple <i>nucleophilic</i> substitutions were shown to take place in <i>either</i> a single step bimolecular mechanism (S<sub>N</sub>2), invariably with <i>inversion</i>, <i>or</i> a two step reaction with an initial unimolecular step (S<sub>N</sub>1) with more or less racemization (Ingold, 1927-1930). <i>Retention</i> was shown to be a less common result of a more complex mechanism. This was followed by studies of the stereochemistry of additions, eliminations, and rearrangememts, leading finally to an understanding of <i>pericyclic</i> reactions (Woodward and Hoffmann, 1969). The stereochemical course of most reactions is now predictable.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conformational analysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first reference (Patern&#242;, 1869) to the possible significance of internal rotation about the a C-C single bond, that in 1,2-dichloroethane, <i>preceded</i> van&#x2019;t Hoff&#x2019;s and Le Bell&#x2019;s work but was not followed up. In 1936 Pitzer found a small difference between experimental and computed entropies of ethane and showed that this implied that internal rotation about the C-C bond is not free but has a small barrier. Such barriers are too small to allow separable isomers in derivatives such as 1,2-dichloroethane but force most molecules into a limited number of <i>conformers</i>, detectable by diffraction and spectroscopic methods (see <a href="#sec_1.6">Section 1.6</a>), corresponding to the conformations close to potential energy minima for such internal rotations.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The relative rotation of the groups at the two ends of a single bonds is called <i>internal rotation.</i> The (infinite number of) arrangements that result are <i>conformations.</i></p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Sachse (1890) showed that six tetrahedral carbon atoms could form two non-planar forms of cyclohexane. Because the number of isomers of derivatives of cyclohexane could be explained by a <i>planar</i> ring, Sachse&#x2019;s idea was neglected until Mohr (1918) used it to predict two isomers of &#x2018;decalin&#x2019;, which were isolated by H&#x00FC;ckel (1925). The general significance of non-planar rings was largely ignored until Hassell (1943) showed by electron diffraction that cyclohexane and <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>decalin existed in chair <i>conformers.</i> Soon Barton (1950) demonstrated the relationship between conformation and reactivity in complex compounds and founded <i>conformational analysis.</i></p>

<h2 class="h2">1.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>X-ray diffraction: absolute configuration</h2>
<p class="noindent">The discovery of X-ray diffraction in simple inorganic crystals (von Laue, 1913) in time led to studies of organic molecules: the first was the <i>planar</i> hexamethylbenzene (Lonsdale, 1929). Later studies confirmed the qualitative reliability of van&#x2019;t Hoff&#x2019;s predictions but refined them by determining bond lengths and bond angles. The growing power of the method for stereochemistry can be gauged from some landmark structures and dates:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A neutron diffraction experiment analogous to Bijvoet&#x2019;s with X-rays allowed the absolute configuration of HOCHDCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to be determined (1965).</p>
</aside>

<p class="noindent3-ka">cholesteryl iodide: <i>relative</i> configuration (8 chiral centres; Crowfoot, 1945); sodium rubidium tartrate: first <i>absolute</i> configuration (Bijvoet, 1951); double helix in DNA (Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin, 1953); tertiary structure of haemoglobin (Perutz, 1970) <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1: Introduction: development of methods and concepts in organic stereochemistry</a>
</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">The determination of the absolute configuration of (&#x002B;)-tartaric acid and therefore the absolute configurations of the many chiral compounds which had been related to it by chemical correlations resolved the intellectual problem left by Fischer and others. It is now almost routine to determine the absolute configuration of molecules in chiral crystals studied by X-ray diffraction and there are very reliable <i>networks</i> of evidence establishing the absolute configurations of most chiral molecules beyond doubt.</p>

<p class="noindent">X-ray diffraction has enormous power to determine structure but the crystalline state normally allows only one conformation of a molecule to be present in a crystal. This limitation is removed by physical methods that may be applied to fluid phases.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Electron diffraction (gas phase) and vibrational spectroscopy (all phases) are mostly limited to simple molecules so far as stereochemistry is concerned. The establishment of the preferred conformations of 1,2-dichloroethane (1935) showed how close Patern&#242; had been in 1869&#x0021;</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Pure rotation (microwave) spectra are even more limited than vibrational spectroscopy in terms of the complexity of molecule that can be studied fully. However, they give invaluable and very detailed information about bond lengths, bond angles, conformational equilibria, shapes and heights of barriers to internal rotation, and dipole moments and their directions within molecules.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy holds a unique place in stereochemistry in general and conformational analysis in particular because there are such a great variety of experiments possible, many yielding information not otherwise available, e.g.:</p>
