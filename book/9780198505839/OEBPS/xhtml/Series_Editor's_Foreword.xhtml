<p class="fmnoindent"><i>Foundations of organic chemistry: worked examples</i> is the companion Primer to the internationally highly acclaimed <i>Foundations of organic chemistry</i> (OCP 9). Together these Primers are designed to facilitate the transition from Chemistry studies at school to those at University by providing a concise and elementary coverage of core topics both descriptively and by way of worked examples. These Primers have been written in a very user friendly format by two Master chemistry teachers and will stimulate young people reading chemistry at advanced level in school, and serve to excite still further the interest of those students just starting their apprenticeships in chemistry at University.</p>
