<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subjects, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraudate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Devinder Sivia and Steve Rawlings present an exceptionally clearly written and elegant introductory account of <i>Foundations of Science Mathematics</i>. The book explains in simple terms the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is essential knowledge for any practising scientist. This Primer will be of interest to all students of science (and their mentors).</p>
