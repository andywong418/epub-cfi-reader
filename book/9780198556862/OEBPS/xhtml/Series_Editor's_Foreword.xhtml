<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Gary Attard and Colin Barnes present a logical, simply written and stimulating account of the fundamental concepts of <i>Surface Science</i> and the methods used to investigate the properties of interfaces; a topic of intense research activity&#x2014;both academic and industrial. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
