<h1 class="fmmain"><b>Series Editor&#x2019;s Foreword</b></h1>
<p class="fm-no1">The Oxford Chemistry Primers provide concise introductions to a range of topics encountered by both chemistry and chemical engineering students. The series has been designed to contain only the essential material that would be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. This Primer provides a thorough, yet easy to understand, introduction to heat transfer phenomena by radiation, and complements the earlier Primer of Winterton which considered heat transfer by conduction, forced convection and natural convection with only a brief introduction to the concept of radiation.</p>
<p class="fm-in">Howard Jones has based this text on a popular lecture course he gave for many years in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Cambridge. Throughout the Primer he illustrates the theory with examples that are easy to follow, thereby making this an invaluable text for anyone who wants to be able to solve commonly encountered, relevant problems in radiative heat transfer.</p>
