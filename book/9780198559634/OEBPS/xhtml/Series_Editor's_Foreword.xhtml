<p class="fm-no1">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fm-in">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Gareth Price presents a clearly written and elegant introductory account of <i>Chemical Thermodynamics</i>. The book explains in simple terms the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is essential knowledge for any practising chemist. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
