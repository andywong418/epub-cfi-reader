<p class="noindent">During the latter part of the nineteenth century sufficient structural information had been amassed by early investigators into some of the components of &#x2018;essential oils&#x2019; of plants to establish basic family likenesses. Many of these volatile, commonly fragrant, compounds were found to be unsaturated hydrocarbons or their oxygenated derivatives containing ten carbon atoms and were given the name <i>terpenes</i> or <i>terpenoids.</i> However, although the molecular formulae of these compounds could be obtained by combustion and cryoscopic analysis, attempts at deducing the carbon skeleta by degradative techniques frequently gave baffling results.</p>

</aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">It was Georg Wagner in 1899 who made the first breakthrough of realising that the problems encountered by others were a consequence of the ease with which terpenes undergo skeletal reorganisations. The second key to the conceptual puzzle was provided by Hans Meerwein in 1922 (from studies on the camphene hydrochloride-isobornyl chloride interconversion) when he proposed that cationic species were involved. Later, in 1927, Meerwein generalised the carbocationic mechanism to account for other terpenic rearrangements and, in 1932, Frank Whitmore unified a series of apparently unrelated acyclic reactions, including the Hofmann, Curtius, Lossen, and Demjanov rearrangements, by stating that they involved the initial formation of electron deficient carbon centres.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Upon these proposals are laid the foundations for our understanding of nucleophilic rearrangements. With the benefit of hindsight it can be difficult to appreciate the fundamental value of the contributions of Wagner and Meerwein, but it is a fitting tribute to these two chemists that the archetypal nucleophilic rearrangement should be called after them. Although originally applied to 1,2-migration in bridged bicyclic molecules such as the camphenyl system, the term is now generally used for all nucleophilic 1,2-migrations of alkyl or aryl groups from carbon to carbon.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A common way of generating the intermediate carbocation involves loss of a good leaving group such as in protonation of a hydroxyl group and loss of water. Carbocations of this type may undergo direct elimination or substitution reactions depending upon the nucleophilic species present. However, <i>Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement</i> will occur if it leads to the new carbocation being more stabilised than the original. This is usually the case if the carbon adjacent to the positively charged centre is secondary or tertiary.</p>


<a id="page_19" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 19, Carbocation induced alkyl and hydride shifts </a>

<p class="noindent">The fate of the rearranged carbocation depends upon the structure of the
molecule but commonly involves quenching by elimination or, less
frequently, addition of a nucleophile. Alternatively, further rearrangement
may occur to give a more stabilised carbocation and such cascade
rearrangements are the basis of the biological construction of complex
terpene molecules.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">If there is a choice of protons which might be lost in an elimination, Saytzeff s rule is obeyed to give the most substituted alkene. In the first sequence shown below, rearrangement of the carbocation derived from isoborneol produces a new species for which there is no such choice (elimination in the alternative sense would produce an <i>anti-Bredt</i> bridgehead alkene) and, on elimination, forms camphene possessing an ejro-methylene group. On the other hand, rearrangement of neopentyl chloride in the presence of aqueous base forms the most substituted alkene on deprotonation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the incoming nucleophile is the same as the initial leaving group the overall reaction is that of an isomerisation. We have already seen one such example in the ready equilibration of camphene hydrochloride with isobornyl</p>



<p class="noindent"><a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Carbocation induced alkyl and hydride shifts </a></p>


<p class="noindent">chloride on dissolution in an inert solvent. Under kinetic conditions, Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements are directed <i>via</i> the stablest carbocationic intermediate but, in this case, the camphenyl system exists in equilibrium with the isobornyl system due to the higher propensity of camphene hydrochloride to ionise. In other words, the overall product distribution can be the result of a fine balance of kinetic and thermodynamic factors.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In particular, 1,2-alkyl shifts have a rigorous stereochemical requirement for the bond at the migration origin to lie very close to the axis of the vacant <i>p</i>-orbital of the carbocationic centre. Whilst acyclic systems can usually adopt the correct conformation for optimal alignment by rotation about single bonds, this option may not be open to cyclic systems - particularly those found in the terpenes. This requirement, coupled with the poorer relative migratory aptitude of the methyl group and the reluctance to form a four-membered ring in the case of migration of the tertiary substituent, are the factors which control the selective conversion of isoborneol into cam phene.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Polycyclic systems provide some very good examples of rearrangements under thermodynamic control and this has been put to good synthetic use for the preparation of .i.adamantane; and its derivatives. Adamantane, possessing the structure of repeating units of the diamond lattice, is the stablest alkane of molecular formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> and all other isomeric tricyclic alkanes are converted to adamantane if subjected to vigorous Lewis acid treatment in the presence of an initiator such as an alkyl halide. The stablest molecule of any set of isomeric alkanes (sometimes referred to as the <i>stabilomer)</i> will be formed by treatment with Lewis acid catalysts under equilibrating conditions.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Notice that, under these vigorous conditions, even alkanes can act as sources of the carbocationic species. Precursors suitable for promotion of Wagner-Meerwein shifts under relatively mild conditions are azides, halides, and alkenes, and we will look at examples of the use of these substrates later.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Hydride shifts can also occur in place of alkyl shifts if to do so would generate a more stable carbocation or if the alkyl migrations are not stereoelectronically favourable. In the 2-norbornyl system, a degenerate 1,2-hydride

<h3 class="h3">1,2-Methyl shifts in terpenes: the Nametkin rearrangement</h3>

<p class="noindent">This particular type of Wagner-Meerwein shift has been singled out for special recognition due to its importance in the field of terpene chemistry. Single Nametkin rearrangements are often observed in monoterpenes during exposure to acid; for instance the conversion of a-methylcamphene to 4-methylisoborneol involves both a Nametkin and a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. (In this case notice that methyl migration competes successfully with the Wagner-Meerwein shift, unlike in the 2-bornyl cation considered earlier. This is presumably due to the fact that 4-methylisoborneol is the stablest product possible from the rearrangement sequences.)</p>


<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_21_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Nametkin rearrangements are commonly encountered in acid catalysed dehydrations of 3,3-dimethyl[2.2.1]jbicycloheptan-2-ols such as in the camphenilol derivatives shown below and these can be seen to be further examples of rearrangements of neopentyl derivatives.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_21_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">However, when it comes to examples of Nametkin rearrangements, the chemist has been comprehensively upstaged by Nature in the construction of polycyclic terpenes when cascades of 1,2-shifts can occur causing wholesale reorganisation of the carbon skeleton of the substrate molecule. All evidence points to the biological processes being essentially the same mechanistically (albeit enzyme mediated) as the acid catalysed rearrangements we have been

<a id="page_22" class="page" >Page 22, Carbocation induced alkyl and hydride shifts </a>

considering, and it is possible to emulate some of these processes <i>in vitro</i> with suitable substrates. The few examples shown here cannot do justice to the range and complexity of the types of cation initiated rearrangements that occur in living systems.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Steroids are <i>triterpenes</i> derived from a common acyclic C<sub>30</sub> precursor squalene <i>via</i> oxidative multiple cyclisation initiated by acid catalysed ring opening of squalene epoxide. This forms initially a tetracyclic enzyme-bound intermediate which is ideally disposed to undergo a series of cation induced 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts. In animals the process is terminated by deprotonation to form lanosterol which is the precursor to cholesterol and then on to the sex hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">Notice that, as a consequence of the antiperiplanar stereochemistry of these migrations, the backbone of the tetracycle undergoes a fundamental and completely stereospecific reorganisation. The elimination and nucleophilic termination processes in these biological systems are exactly analogous to the fates of rearrangement products in non-biological systems.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The triterpene fern-9-ene, produced by the fern <i>polygodium vulgare,</i> is also derived from squalene <i>via</i> a non-oxidative, acid catalysed polycyclisation, followed by a cascade containing four 1,2-hydride shifts and two 1,2-methyl shifts. This series of shifts once again results in total rearrangement of the backbone of the molecule.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">That the stereospecificity of such migrations is dictated by the electronic requirements of the system and is not simply a result of enzyme control can be demonstrated in the laboratory by the acid catalysed cascade rearrangement of 3&#x03B2;-friedelanol. This gives 13(18)-oleanonene on treatment with acid <i>via</i> a stereospecific sequence of three 1,2-hydride shifts and four 1,2-methyl shifts.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>pinacol rearrangement</i> refers to the treatment of 1,2-diols with acid with
subsequent conversion to carbonyl compounds. A variant of this reaction,
sometimes known as the <i>semipinacol rearrangement</i> occurs with p-amino
alcohols as substrates which, on diazotisation with nitrous acid, undergo
similar transformation. In all instances, the major driving force for the
rearrangement is the energetic advantage of generating a carbonyl group.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The diol substituents R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>4</sup> may be alkyl, aryl or hydrogen, but typical pinacol rearrangement substrates are tetrasubstituted. The 1,2-diol precursors may be constructed by dihydroxylation of alkenes or by reductive coupling of ketones, the latter reaction only being of practical value for the preparation of symmetrical diols. The different ways of converting an alkene to a 1,2-diol permit greater flexibility, particularly in the stereochemistry of addition to the double bond and alkenes are usually the substrates of choice for the preparation of such systems (OsO<sub>4</sub> and KMnO<sub>4</sub> give <i>syn</i>-dihydroxylation; whereas peracid epoxidation followed by cleavage, or I<sub>2</sub>-RCO<sub>2</sub>Ag followed by hydrolysis, result in overall <i>anti</i>-dihydroxylation).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">We have already seen that, with unsymmetrical substrates, the group migrating is largely determined by a combination of factors such as carbocation stability and relative migratory aptitudes of the substituents, but mixtures frequently result. Reaction conditions may also play a part in
<a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Carbocation induced alkyl and hydride shifts </a>
deciding which group migrates. For instance, the action of cold concentrated sulphuric acid upon 2-methyl-l,l-diphenylpropane-l,2-diol results in the formation of the kinetic product, the methyl group migrating as a consequence of the initial formation of the most favoured carbocation. Under conditions where equilibration may occur however, the product is the one in which the phenyl group migrates to give the most stable material, presumably due to lower steric encumbrance in the product.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Aldehydes may be produced if substrates possessing either secondary or primary alcohol centres are rearranged under mild (kinetic) conditions. More rigorous conditions often result in further isomerisation of the aldehydic products to ketones.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The pinacol rearrangement is particularly useful for the generation of <i>spirocyclic</i> systems. For example, the two substrates shown below both give rise to the same spirobicyclic ketone on treatment with acid.</p>

For this reason the best yields are usually obtained with strained ketones which more readily undergo skeletal rearrangement than their unstrained counterparts. The reaction works best in alcoholic solvents, presumably due to the hydroxylic solvent acting as a proton donor for the adduct. Although lower yielding, this one-step procedure is often convenient for the rapid preparation of small quantities of a particular ketone.

This approach is particularly efficient in the case of 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexa- 2,5-dienones as 1,2-migration of one of the substituents permits the new cationic species to be quenched by deprotonation resulting in an aromatic ring. The reaction is known as the <i>dienone-phenol rearrangement</i> after the substrates and products involved.

One proposed mechanism (path a) involves two 1,2- alkyl shifts in opposite senses; whereas the alternative (path b) invokes two 1,2-alkyl shifts in the same direction, accompanied by a shift of the oxygen in the opposite direction. Labelling studies have been carried out which support the existence of both pathways in certain substrates. Note that in the second pathway, one of the intermediates is simply a protonated epoxide, and epoxides are known substrates for rearrangements of the semipinacol variety.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">&#x03B1;-Amino ketones may undergo a similar rearrangement on heating to give products in which two substituents have switched positions. The mechanism involves initial protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, followed by 1,2-migration and quenching of the rearranged cation by loss of a proton from the amino substituent. An intramolecular proton transfer can be envisaged for this process and the general mechanism is supported by the observation that fully substituted &#x03B1;-hydroxyimines also undergo this rearrangement</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Hydride shifts</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Just as alkyl groups may undergo 1,2-shifts, hydride is also a candidate for
such rearrangements although, given the choice, it is usually the alkyl group
which migrates as this normally results in the greatest steric relief. However,
if steric requirements over-ride this control, 1,2-hydride shifts occur readily
and we have seen several examples of multiple hydride shifts in the backbone
rearrangements of steroids (<a href="#page_22">pages 22</a>-<a href="#page_24">24</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Another system in which rapid 1,2-hydride migration may occur is the 2-
norbornyl cation (<a href="#page_20">pages 20</a>, <a href="#page_21">21</a>). In this case it is the well disposed <i>exo-</i> hydrogen at C-3 which migrates to the carbocation at C-2 and this has led to
the rather confusing terminology of <i>'3,2-shift'</i> for this rearrangement.
Although rapid, this rearrangement is degenerate and is normally
overshadowed by the slower 1,2-alkyl shift typical of the isoborneol-</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The inverse situation holds for the rearrangement of primary alkyl cations such as may be generated by the action of Lewis acids on 1-haloalkanes. In the freely rotating carbocation there is no steric bias for either alkyl or hydride shift but, whereas the alkyl shift is a degenerate process, hydride shift leads to a stable carbocation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Such migrations mean that Friedel-Crafts alkylations of aromatic substrates with haloalkanes usually furnish branched chain products irrespective of the position of the initially generated carbocation. This restricts further the use of Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions which, in any event, tend to form mixtures of polyalkylated materials due to the activating inductive effect of an alkyl group on the aromatic nucleus.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Transannular hydride migrations</h3>

<p class="noindent">Hydride migrations involving more than neighbouring centres in open chain substrates appear generally to be highly disfavoured and most 1 ,<i>n</i>-hydride shifts can be accounted for by a number of 1,2-hydride shifts occurring in series.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">However, hydride rearrangements over large distances are well documented in medium ring (8-11 membered) carbocycles. In such cases, many of the ground state conformations available to medium rings bring opposing members of the ring into close proximity to each other permitting <i>transannular hydride migration</i> on generation of a carbocationic centre although alkyl groups do not undergo the same process.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Representative conformations for cyclooctane and cyclodecane indicating the close approach of opposed hydrogens (all other hydrogens omitted for clarity).</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Such shifts were first noted when the acid catalysed opening of medium ring epoxides was found to give only small amounts of the desired <i>trans-</i>1,2- diols. For example, cyclooctene epoxide gave a mixture of products consisting of <i>trans-</i>1,2-octanediol and <i>cis-</i>1,4-cycloctanediol as well as 3- and 4-cyclooctenols.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_31_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">The 1,4-diol and cyclooctenols could arise by either 1,3- or 1,5-hydride shift and studies with 5,6-dideutero-l,2-epoxycyclooctane have shown that both occur, although 1,5-migration predominates. The formation of specifically cis-l,4-cyclooctanediol provides strong evidence for epoxide opening, hydride migration, and quenching of the carbocation occurring in a highly concerted manner, as a free carbocation would be expected to produce a stereorandom mixture of diols. However, kinetic isotope effect studies of the cyclooctyl system have given a value
 for <i>k</i><sub>H</sub> / <i>k</i><sub>D</sub> of 1.21 which is too small

<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Carbocation induced alkyl and hydride shifts </a>
for significant cleavage of the C-H bond to be occurring in the rate determining step. Thus, the mechanism probably involves rate determining cleavage of the epoxide ring followed by rapid hydride migration with concommitant backside quenching of the developing carbocationic centre.</p>

<p class="indent">Hydride bridged species may be detected spectroscopically in superacid

spectrum shows the lowest field absorption at 152.8 &#x03B4; integrating for two
carbons. These data can be interpreted by invoking a bridged structure in
which a hydride is shared between two centres.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A good example of the reluctance of alkyl groups to take part in such
transannular migrations is provided by 1 -methyl-1,6-cyclodecanediol which,
on treatment with acid, rearranges to form 6-methylcyclodecanone with none
of the alternative product resulting from methyl migration being detected.
The fact that this was indeed a 1,6-hydride shift was clearly demonstrated by
studying the substrate in which the carbinol proton had been replaced with a
deuterium label.</p>
