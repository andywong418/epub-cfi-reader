<p class="fmnoindent">Polar rearrangements have always fascinated organic chemists. They have provided rich
and rewarding areas of study particularly in the fields of biosynthesis, mechanistic
studies, and stereochemistry. Many reliable and useful synthetic methods have resulted
from studies of polar rearrangements.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions
relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would
normally be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. In this fifth primer of the series, Laurence
Harwood has done a magnificent job in bringing together the wide range of mechanistic,
stereochemical, and synthetic topics that make up polar rearrangements. This primer will
be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
