<h3 class="h3"><b>What will this book cover?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Before launching into any discourse about polar rearrangements, it is first necessary to decide what kinds of reaction are to be included. This apparently simple objective immediately leads us into a multitude of pitfalls. It is impossible to compose a rigorous definition to encompass all reaction types which might conceivably fall within the framework of polar rearrangements without introducing a large degree of superfluity and far outgrowing the space available in this book. In any event rigorous definitions which become entangled in semantics are counter-productive to the aim of producing an accessible, easily read introduction to this fascinating area of chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Drawing the line between &#x2018;polar&#x2019; and &#x2018;non-polar&#x2019; rearrangements presents us with the need for making an arbitrary decision, because it can be justifiably argued that almost all organic reactions must display a certain amount of polarity. Therefore we will disregard simple polarisation effects and consider a polar rearrangement to be one in which some degree of formal charge separation occurs at the reacting sites prior to, or during, migration.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In its most general sense, a rearrangement may be defined as any chemical process involving the breaking and forming of &#x03C3; or &#x03C0;-bonds, in which an atom or group moves from one atom to another, resulting in structural reorganisation of the original molecule. We often talk about &#x2018;migrations&#x2019; for such processes, but this terminology implies an intramolecular process with the migrating group maintaining some communication with its partner throughout reaction. It is certainly true that the vast majority of reactions that we will consider in this book will fall into this category. However, to adhere too rigidly to such an interpretation would exclude such reactions as ally lie and Pummerer rearrangements, which result in a reorganisation of the original substrate by initial elimination of a group from the substrate, with subsequent attack by it, or another of the same species, at the new position. These reactions will be discussed in the final chapter.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Most rearrangements we will consider involve the migrating species bonding at the migration terminus through the same atom that was originally bonded at the origin. However, we will not ignore migrations involving anchimeric assistance, nor will we exclude sigmatropic rearrangements which proceed <i>via</i> charge separated precursors such as the Stevens rearrangement or the sulphoxide-sulphenate rearrangement.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Conversely, we will not include <i>prototropic</i> rearrangements&#x2014;reactions which involve deprotonation-reprotonation sequences only. As a result, a large number of isomerisation reactions such as keto-enol and imine<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Mechanism and theory</a>enamine tautomerism, which might quite justifiably be considered to be rearrangements, will not be dealt with here.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Therefore, our answer to the rhetorical question at the head of this section is: <i>This book will cover structural reorganisation processes involving the</i>
<i>breaking and forming of &#x03C3; or &#x03C0;- bonds</i>, <i>in which some degree of charge</i> <i>separation is generated at the reacting sites prior to</i>, <i>or during</i>, <i>migration 
of</i> <i>a group</i>, <i>or an atom other than a proton, from one atom to another.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Let us now consider briefly the various categories of rearrangement mechanism and decide which are likely to involve polar intermediates.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Heterolytic rearrangements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In such stepwise reactions, initial fragmentation gives rise to a positively or negatively charged species which can undergo rearrangement. In the first instance, the migrating group retains the electrons <i>(nucleophilic</i> or <i>anionotropic rearrangement</i>); whereas in the second case it gives up its electrons <i>(electrophilic</i> or <i>cationotropic rearrangement).</i> Nucleophilic rearrangements are encountered far more commonly than electrophilic rearrangements.</p>

<p class="aside">In heterolytic bond cleavage both bonding electrons become associated with one fragment.

<img src="../images/page_2_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>



<h3 class="h3"><b>Homolytic rearrangements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These reactions are also stepwise, with initial bond cleavage taking place to produce a radical species possessing an unpaired electron prior to migration.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_2_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<figure class="fig1"  style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_2_4.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">By their very nature, such rearrangements are usually non-polar, but there are some which involve charged radical intermediates as the reacting species. For instance, the Hofmann-Loffler-Freytag reaction involves an intramolecular hydrogen atom abstraction by a nitrogen radical cation:</p>
<figure class="fig1"   style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_2_5.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Pericyclic rearrangements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These single step rearrangements do not involve the formation of recognisable intermediates and were once referred to as &#x2018;no mechanism reactions&#x2019;, although they actually fall into the categories of pericyclic reactions known as <i>electrocyclic</i> and <i>sigmatropic rearrangements.</i> Pericyclic rearrangements do not proceed <i>via</i> any intermediates but pass through highly ordered transition states. As such they are relatively insensitive to external influences and are generally very non-polar in nature. <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Mechanism and theory</a>The Claisen and Cope rearrangements, in which one three-carbon fragment migrates across another three-carbon fragment, are typical examples of molecular rearrangements and are termed 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangements.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;text-align:center">The Claisen rearrangement (X &#x003D; O) and Cope rearrangement (X &#x003D; CH<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although typically non-polar, some molecular rearrangements, such as the 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement of an allylic sulphur ylid to a homoallylic sulphide, involve substrates in which charge separation in the substrate plays a necessary role.</p>
<figure class="fig1"   style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_3_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Others, for instance Lewis acid catalysed variants of the Claisen rearrangement, involve charged reactive species. How much such reactions have ceased to be truly concerted, and have developed some step-wise character is a matter for debate.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">From this brief introduction it should be fairly clear that the bulk of &#x2018;polar rearrangements&#x2019; considered in this book will be those reactions which fall into the category of heterolytic rearrangements and these will be discussed first. However, it is useful to consider some of the general mechanistic and theoretical aspects of these reactions before looking at specific examples.</p>

Heterolytic rearrangements: sub-classification</h2>



<h3 class="h3"><b>Migrations to electron deficient carbon</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Nucleophilic rearrangements occur when an electron deficient site is generated close to a group capable of migrating using either a lone pair or a bonding pair of electrons. The commonest situation occurs when the <i>migration origin</i> and the <i>migration terminus</i> are on adjacent atoms with the migrating species being either a hydride or an alkyl group, and these processes are referred to as
1,2&#x002D;	<i>hydride shifts</i> (so called because one atom moves across two atoms) or
1,2&#x002D;	alkyl shifts ,respaetively</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">1,2-hydride shift</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="aside">1,2-alkyl shift</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_3_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Mechanism and theory</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Many nucleophilic rearrangements, often grouped under the heading of <i>Wagner-Meerwein shifts</i>, occur by the 1,2-migration of an alkyl group to a carbocationic centre. The different variants of this reaction will be considered individually in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2 </a>but, while they may differ in the way that the initial carbocation is generated or the way that the product carbocation is quenched, they all follow the same overall mechanistic pathway. Almost invariably the main driving force for such rearrangements is the formation of a more stable (usually more substituted) carbocation, perhaps with some associated relief from steric compression.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The stability of carbocations is benzylic, allylic &#x003E; 
3&#x00B0; &#x003E; 2&#x00B0; &#x003E; 1&#x00B0;</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">The rearrangement sequence may then be terminated either by reaction with a nucleophile or by loss of a positively charged species, such as a proton, to regenerate the neutral rearrangement product. The following reaction of neopentyl iodide with silver nitrate exemplifies these features; neopentylic systems are renowned for their readiness to undergo rearrangements and reluctance to undergo direct S<sub>N</sub>1or S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions of the leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="width:70%;text-align:center" >
<img src="../images/page_4_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside"><i>S<sub>N</sub>1</i>: Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution</p>
<p class="aside"><i>S<sub>N</sub>2</i>: Bimolecular nucleophilic sub-stitution</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p class="aside"><i>S<sub>N</sub>1</i> reaction of neopentylic substrates is 
disfavoured as formation of a 1&#x00B0; carbocation is necessary. <i>S<sub>N</sub>2</i> reaction is sterically disfavoured due to the presence of alkyl groups (3- to the centre undergoing substitution.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="aside"><i>E1</i>: Unimolecular elimination</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">As this scheme demonstrates, one way of initiating such nucleophilic migrations involves loss of a good leaving group in exactly the same way as in the initial rate determining step of S<sub>N</sub>1 and El reactions. In fact rearrangements often compete with such processes, and may dominate if the carbon adjacent to the initial carbocation is highly substituted such as in neopentylic systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">It is extremely doubtful whether alkyl groups are capable of undergoing migrations over greater distances than between neighbouring atoms. One convincing piece of evidence to support this view is the fact that the 3,3- dimethyl-1-butyl cation only undergoes 1,2-hydride shift with no evidence for 1,3-methyl shift, despite the fact that this would furnish a much more stable carbocation.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:2em">
<img src="../images/page_4_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Likewise it seems that 1,3-hydride shifts only occur if very special geometric requirements are met and many apparent 1,3-hydride shifts actually turn out to be two successive 1,2-hydride shifts.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Mechanism and theory</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Migrations to electron deficient nitrogen</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This category of very closely related reactions which occur <i>via</i> 1,2-alkyl shifts induced by the generation of a <i>nitrene</i> represents a very important class of reaction from the viewpoint of synthetic utility. A nitrene is a neutral,electron deficient species in which the nitrogen possesses only a sextet of electrons in its outer shell instead of the usual octet. One means of generating a nitrene is <i>via</i> decomposition of an azide, frequently an acylazide, but we will consider other important precursors in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_5_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The related Hofmann rearrangement probably occurs <i>via</i> a concerted mechanism without forming the intermediate nitrene.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_5_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Another important reaction in this series is the Beckmann rearrangement of oximes in which concerted stereoselective migration of the alkyl group <i>anti</i> to the hydroxyl group is a key feature.</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_5_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The common fate of the initial migration products involves nucleophilic addition of the hydroxylic solvent in which such rearrangements are usually carried out.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Migrations to electron deficient oxygen</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This small group of reactions consisting of the Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement and hydroperoxide rearrangements, in which heterolytic cleavage of a peroxide 0-0 bond occurs in concert with an alkyl group migration, parallels carbon-to-nitrogen rearrangements. The leaving group is commonly a carboxylic acid or its conjugate base.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em" >
<img src="../images/page_5_4.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The concerted alkyl migration avoids the formation of what would be a highly unstable positively charged oxygen species, but you should note that these migration reactions are at variance with the standard reactivity of the peroxide linkage which usually undergoes homolytic cleavage. An interesting mechanistic feature of the Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement is that
<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Mechanism and theory</a>
unsymmetrical ketones show highly selective migration of only one of the groups. The rule is that the group which is more highly substituted at the &#x03B1;-position to the carbonyl group is the one which migrates.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Other nucleophilic migrations</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">So far our criterion of classification has been based upon the nature of the migration terminus, assuming the migration origin to be a carbon atom. However boron as well as a wide range of transition metals can act as migration origins for nucleophilic migrations of alkyl and acyl groups and some of these reactions will be discussed in the final chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Transannular hydride migrations</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Despite the extreme reluctance towards migration over more than two atoms in <i>acyclic</i> systems, hydride migrations are possible over several carbons if the migration origin and the carbocation at the terminus are in close proximity. This situation can occur in medium ring systems (8-12 carbon atoms) when 1,4-, 1,5-, and 1,6-transannular hydride shifts are possible. Notice in the example shown here that the methyl group does not migrate. It is generally the case that such transannular rearrangements are not demonstrated by alkyl groups and only in special instances have aromatic groups been shown to migrate over these distances.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_6_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Electrophilic migrations</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These less frequently encountered heterolytic migrations commonly involve
the migration of an alkyl group from a heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen,
and sulphur to a carbanionic centre. The Stevens rearrangement of tetra-
alkylammonium salts and the Wittig rearrangement of ethers are examples of
such rearrangements which have synthetic utility.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_6_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A concerted electrophilic rearrangement is a four-electron process and orbital symmetry requirements dictate that this should take place with stereochemical inversion at the migrating carbon centre under thermal conditions. Studies on the mechanism of the Stevens rearrangement have shown it to be intramolecular, with the migrating centre retaining its stereochemistry. Such observations therefore rule out a concerted process and migration is now believed to proceed <i>via</i> initial homolytic fragmentation to yield a pair of radicals which remain in close contact with each other within a solvent cage. Recombination to form the rearranged product must be rapid to account for the absence of racemisation in the migrating group.</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Mechanism and theory</a></p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:1em" >
<img src="../images/page_7_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">A similar mechanism is envisaged to operate for the sulphur ylid and Wittig rearrangements, although of course in the Wittig rearrangement homolytic cleavage furnishes a radical and a radical anion.</p>
<figure class="fig1"   style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_7_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Some electrophilic aryl migrations are known; for instance it has been demonstrated that Ph<sub>3</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>l</sub> produces some Ph<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>Ph on treatment with metallic sodium.</p>

Mechanistic aspects of nucleophilic migrations</h2>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Nature of the rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">There can be much variability in the timing of the steps of nucleophilic rearrangements between true stepwise generation of the carbocation followed by migration, and migration occurring in concert with the initial ionisation. These two situations can be considered as intramolecular analogues of S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, respectively.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="width:70%;text-align:center" >
<img src="../images/page_7_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">This can have profound stereochemical implications at both the migration origin and the migration terminus; although this is only detectable when both centres are chiral and if the migration origin is not converted to an <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> centre by subsequent elimination of the rearranged cation. With non-racemic substrates the generation of a <i>free carbocation</i> at either the migration terminus or origin will result in loss of stereochemcal integrity at that centre; whereas a <i>concerted migration</i> with no intermediate will result in <i>inversion</i> of the absolute stereochemistry at the migration terminus.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Thus, in the following diagram depicting a generalised stepwise mechanism, the single enantiomer of the substrate gives rise to all possible diastereoisomeric rearrangement products. This is a result of the possibility of free rotation in the intermediates and planarity of the carbocations.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Free carbocations are planar and hence may be attacked by nucleophiles
 from either face leading to enantiomeric products.</p>

<p class="aside1">The inversion in S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution reactions is a consequence of the
 backside attack of the nucleophile upon the substrate.</p></aside>

<img src="../images/page_8_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Conversely, a concerted mechanism with the same substrate would furnish only one enantiomer. In this case, the migrating group R must be positioned antiperiplanar to the leaving group X and is undergoing <i>neighbouring group participation</i> (also termed <i>anchimeric assistance).</i> We will consider neighbouring group effects in a later sub-section.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Two groups <i>antiperiplanar</i> to each

<h3 class="h3"><b>Nature of the migrating species</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">Having considered what goes on at the migration sites, let us now turn our attention to the migrating group itself. In nucleophilic 1,2&#x002D;shifts the migrating group remains co-ordinated to some degree with the substrate throughout the reaction. Crossover experiments, in which no exchange is observed, confirm the intramolecularity of the rearrangements. Even stronger evidence for how closely the two partners are associated during rearrangement can be obtained from the use of chiral migrating groups. Studies on Baeyer-Villiger, pinacol, Curtius, and Wagner&#x002D;Meerwein rearrangements have confirmed that the migrating group always <i>retains</i> its absolute configuration.For example, in the case of 3&#x002D;(S)&#x002D;2,2,3&#x002D;trimethylaminopentane, deaminative rearrangement furnished the alcohol with 98&#x0025; retention of the chiral centre.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_9_4.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>



<h3 class="h3"><b>Migratory aptitude</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ease with which any particular group will undergo nucleophilic 1,2-shift is known as its <i>migratory aptitude.</i> Although related to electron donating capacity, such values are not quantifiable as a single group will show different migratory aptitudes for different reactions or even for the same reaction under different conditions. Nevertheless, some general ranking system for different alkyl and aryl groups is very useful for predicting the outcome in situations where two different groups might undergo migration.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">There are two ways in which relative migratory aptitudes may be determined. One way involves the comparison of relative rates of rearrangement in a homologous series of substrates, each possessing just one type of migrating group, under exactly the same reaction conditions. An alternative method analyses the product mixtures obtained from a substrate containing two different competing substituents at the migrating origin.</p>



<p class="noindent"><a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Mechanism and theory</a></p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_10_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">This second method provides a more direct comparison between two groups but, of course cannot be applied in all instances. In the Beckmann rearrangement for example, only the group <i>anti</i> to the oxime hydroxyl substituent migrates regardless of relative migratory aptitude of the two substituents. Similarly this technique cannot be applied to study relative migratory aptitudes in unsymmetrical pinacol substrates when formation of the most stable cation controls the reaction pathway. We have already seen one case of such control in the preferential migration of hydride over methyl or ethyl in the pinacol rearrangement of (S)2-methylbutan-l,2-diol on <a href="#page_8">page 8</a>. In the following example, migration of the methyl group is determined by initial formation of the more stabilised carbocation rather than by a higher migratory aptitude of methyl over phenyl.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em" >
<img src="../images/page_10_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Of course, the way to carry out direct comparison of relative migratory aptitudes of methyl <i>versus</i> phenyl in the pinacol rearrangement is to use 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol as loss of either hydroxyl group generates the same carbocation.</p>

<figure class="fig1" >
<img src="../images/page_10_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="aside">Substrate for the direct comparison of Me <i>versus</i> 
Ph migration.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">A wide range of other factors, such as steric and conformational  effects,play subtle roles in determining whether a particular migration is favoured or not and so it is not surprising that hard and fast predictions cannot be made. Generally aryl groups migrate more readily than alkyl groups, and within the aryl series, electron donating substituents increase the propensity for migration. However, the position of hydrogen within this framework is highly unpredictable. The following are some relative migratory aptitudes for pinacol rearrangement of various aromatic substituents:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Neighbouring group participation (anchimeric assistance)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a substituent is capable of stabilising an adjacent carbocation by acting as an intramolecular nucleophile it is said to be undergoing <i>neighbouring group participation.</i> Winstein coined the term <i>anchimeric assistance</i> to indicate the fact that such reactions occur more readily than would be expected without this participation and the two terms are now effectively interchangeable.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Any &#x03B2;&#x002D;substituent possessing an unshared electron pair or a double bond is a prime candidate for participation in this way as the effective concentration of the group is very high (it is adjacent to the cationic site) and relatively little molecular reorganisation is necessary to achieve the transition state. These two factors overcome the disadvantage of increased strain involved in formation of the bridged transition states.</p>

<p class="aside">&#x03C3;-Participation in concerted 1,2- nucleophilic 
migration.</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">We have already noted (<a href="#page_7">page 7</a>) that concerted migration of a group with loss of a leaving group, in a process akin to an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, constitutes one example of neighbouring group participation. This type of interaction is sometimes referred to as <i>&#x03C3;-participation</i> as it is the electrons of a &#x03C3;-bond which are stabilising the developing electron deficiency at the adjacent site. Such participation can be detected by the resulting stereochemical inversion of the migration termini, and it turns out to be rare in open chain or unstrained cyclic compounds if the carbocation is generated at a secondary or tertiary centre and the migrating group is hydride or alkyl. The lack of neighbouring group participation in the pinacol rearrangement has been neatly demonstrated by allowing partial reaction of unlabelled pinacol in acidic <sup>18</sup>O labelled water and finding that unreacted pinacol had incorporated <sup>18</sup>O label. This observation is totally consistent with the generation of a free carbocation which either rearranges or adds water again and is inconsistent with a concerted migration process.</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_11_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Such &#x03C3;-participation by alkyl groups is known to occur in strained ring systems however, and will be considered later in the next sub-section on &#x2018;non-classical carbonium ions&#x2019;. Neighbouring group participation is very favourable if the adjacent substituent has lone pairs available for donation, and is commonly encountered when oxygen, nitrogen or halogen containing functional groups such as the following are present:</p>

<p class="aside"> Meso- compounds have a plane of symmetry and therefore cannot 
exhibit optical activity.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">One of the earliest pieces of evidence for neighbouring group participation came from the demonstration by Winstein that the two different diastereoisomers of 3-bromobutan-2-ol behaved differently in their reaction with HBr. The optically active thero-diastereoisomer was converted to a racemic mixture of the <i>threo-</i>dibromides whereas the optically active erythro-diastereoisomer cleanly gave the meso-dibromide. This showed that substitution of the hydroxyl group had occurred with retention of the original relative stereochemistry in both instances. These observations strongly

<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Mechanism and theory</a>
support the intervention of the adjacent bromine atom in the departure of the protonated hydroxyl group to form an intermediate <i>bromonium ion.</i></p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_12_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">Notice that the symmetry of the bromonium ion intermediates means that there is the possibility of nucleophilic attack by bromide at either C-2, to which the hydroxyl group was attached, or C-3, to which the bromine was originally attached. It is this feature that leads to racemisation in the <i>threo-</i> series and, in the case of bromide attacking C-3, the bromine originally present undergoes 1,2-shift.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Similar experiments by Cram have led to acceptance of the existence of the <i>phenonium ion.</i> Solvolysis of the optically active threo-diastereoisomers of the tosylate esters of 3-phenylbutan-2-ol in acetic acid resulted in the formation of racemic <i>threo-</i> acetates; whereas similar reaction of the optically active erythro-diastereoisomer furnished the optically active -acetate.</p>

<p class="aside">The p-toluenesulphonate (tosylate) group (&#x002D;OTs) is a

<p class="indent3-ka">Further evidence was obtained by isolating the starting material before complete reaction and finding that the <i>threo-tosylate</i> was almost totally racemised whereas the <i>eryt hr o-tosy late</i> had retained its optical activity. These <a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Mechanism and theory</a> results indicate that the intermediate phenonium ions can either revert to starting materials or be attacked by acetic acid and go on to form substitution products. However, the phenonium ion derived from the <i>threo</i>-precursor which possesses a plane of symmetry bisecting the bond joining the two stereogenic centres (the so-called so-configuration) is optically inactive, and hence gives rise to racemic starting material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The formation of a phenonium intermediate may be envisaged as being equivalent to an intramolecular electrophilic substitution reaction and, by analogy, electron rich aryl groups might be expected to participate more readily. This expectation was indeed borne out by experimental observation of the effect of varying the aryl group in a series of brosylate (a slightly better leaving group than tosylate) esters of threo-3-arylbutan-2-ols upon reaction rate and product distribution. Whilst some of the products obtained were due to direct nucleophilic displacement of the leaving group by solvent, a good correlation between electron density of the aryl ring and propensity to undergo neighbouring group participation was observed, with the <i>p-</i> methoxyphenyl derivative reacting some 500 times faster than the phenyl derivative.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The symmetrically bridged structure of the phenonium ion has been demonstrated by 13<sub>C</sub> n.m.r. spectroscopic analysis of the parent ion which may be generated in super-acid media. The studies showed that the bridging ring carbon had a chemical shift typical of a tetrahedral centre and the remaining ring carbons had chemical shifts comparable to benzenonium ions.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Non-classical carbonium ions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">While alkyl groups do not usually undergo &#x03C3;-participation in acyclic or unstrained ring systems, there is much evidence to suggest that this does occur in strained rings. The species formed contain a two-electron, three- centre bond and are known as &#x2018;<i>non-classical carbonium ions',</i> although in the correct terminology they are simply <i>carbonium ions.</i> Unfortunately this nomenclature causes much confusion, since organic chemists are accustomed to the incorrect use of the term <i>carbonium ion</i> to describe species of the form R<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> which are correctly termed <i>carbenium ions</i> or simply <i>carbocations.</i> To put the matter straight once and for all; a carbenium ion only contains two-electron, two-centre bonds; whereas a carbonium ion contains a two- electron, three-centre bond and the cationic centre has a coordination number of five.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1" >
<img src="../images/page_13_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The most studied system in which &#x03C3;-participation is envisaged to occur is the 2-norbornyl system. Winstein found that solvolysis of optically pure norbornyl 2-exo-brosylate in acetic acid gave a racemic exo-acetate as the sole product with no endo-material. Furthermore, this solvolysis occurred 350 times faster than the optically active <i>2-endo-isomer</i> which also furnished solely exo-material but this time with between 3 and 13&#x0025; retention at the 2- position depending upon solvent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">These results were interpreted as implying that the reaction of the <i>exo-</i> substrate occurred solely <i>via</i> a non-classical carbonium ion; whilst the <i>endo-</i> substrate reacted by initial formation of a classical carbenium ion which then rearranged to the non-classical carbonium ion, but not before a small amount had reacted with solvent, attack being sterically directed to the <i>exo-face.</i></p>

<p class="aside">Brown&#x2019;s &#x2018;windscreen wiper&#x2019; proposal.
 Note that the two cations are enantiomeric and rearrangement leads to racemisation.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">This claim and others like it were hotly contested at the time by Brown who, playing the devil&#x2019;s advocate, made the point that these results could also be explained by invoking an extremely rapidly interconverting pair of classical carbenium ions coupled with the established propensity for norbomyl systems to be attacked from the sterically more accessible <i>exo-</i>face. Nucleophilic attack at a rate much slower than the interconversion of the two carbenium ions would lead to the observed racemisation. Brown&#x2019;s hypothesis concluded that the rate of solvolysis of the exo-brosylate was not enhanced by neighbouring group participation but that the solvolysis of the <i>endo-</i>bro- sylate was retarded due to steric reasons.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The experimentally rigorous distinction between a non-classical carbonium ion and a pair of very rapidly interconverting carbenium ions is extremely difficult. Possibly some of the best evidence for the existence of such species comes from Olah&#x2019;s n.m.r. studies in super-acid media at low temperatures. The 2-norbornyl cation was shown to exhibit the symmetry properties expected of a non-classical species which could not be frozen out; whereas the the 2-phenylnorbornyl cation showed essentially classical behaviour.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Mechanism and theory</a>&#160;&#160;Another system which has attracted much interest is that of the cyclopropylmethyl cation for similar reasons to the 2-norbornyl system: namely the great ease of solvolysis of cyclopropylmethyl substrates accompanied by formation of rearrangement products. Of particular interest is that, regardless of the method of generation of the cationic species, the ratio of products is always very similar. Both hydrolysis of cyclopropylmethyl chloride under conditions favouring S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution and diazotisation of cyclopropylamine produce cyclobutanol and but-3-en-l-ol as well as cyclopropylmethanol in approximately 47&#x0025;, 5&#x0025;, and 48&#x0025; yields respectively. Moreover, diazotisation of cyclobutylamine also produces the same three alcohols in the same ratios.</p>

<img src="../images/page_15_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Additional information is obtained from studies using 1-<sup>14</sup>C labelled cyclopropylmethylamine which show much (but not total) scrambling of the label over all of the methylene carbons in the products.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">So far the data might be interpreted by invoking a set of very rapidly interconverting classical carbocations, but difference in rates of solvolysis of cyclopropylmethyl derivatives compared with the corresponding 2-methyl-1- propyl derivatives (10<sup>6</sup> : 1) appears to demand &#x03C3;-participation. The scheme involving the formation of non-classical <i>bicyclobutonium ions</i> proposed by Roberts is generally accepted to explain all the features of this system. This envisages the initial formation of two equivalent three-centre carbonium ions by methylene assisted loss of the leaving group, followed by equilibration of these structures through a whole array of equivalent intermediates. These subsequent equilibria result in ultimate scrambling of the carbon atoms.</p>
