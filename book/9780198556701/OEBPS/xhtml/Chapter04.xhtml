<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">This far we have only discussed nucleophilic l,2-alkyl shifts to carbon termini, but now we will turn our attention to two very important classes of rearrangement in which the migration terminus is either an electron deficient nitrogen or oxygen atom.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the case of nucleophilic rearrangements to nitrogen, migration could be considered to occur concurrently with displacement of a substituent from the nitrogen, or by a stepwise process involving initial fragmentation to form a<b> <i>nitrene</i></b> at the terminus, followed by migration.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_46_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Nitrenes are neutral, six electron species analogous to carbenes and react in a similar manner with nucleophilic species to regain an octet of valence electrons. While nitrenes are implicated in certain transformations, there is little support for their intermediacy in the migration reactions we will be considering in this chapter and the rearrangements are generally considered to follow concerted mechanisms with migration occurring at the same time as loss of the leaving group from nitrogen. In these reactions, it is the departure of a leaving group from the nitrogen which initiates rearrangement and may also control which group migrates. This contrasts with nucleophilic 1,2- migrations to carbon when factors such as relative migratory aptitudes of the migrating groups control the course of reaction.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Nucleophilic rearrangements to electron deficient oxygen involve peroxy species and are initiated by protonation and heterolytic cleavage of the labile peroxide bond. As with electron deficient nitrogen induced rearrangements, the migration usually occurs in concert with the breaking of the peroxy linkage.</p>

<img src="../images/page_46_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Both types of rearrangement have great synthetic utility and a reflection of this is the confusing number of named reactions which follow the same general mechanism. We shall now consider these various examples, but
<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47,  Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a>
always bear in mind that they are all closely related and follow the same fundamental mechanism just outlined.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen</h2>
<h3 class="h3">The Beckmann rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">Treatment of oximes with reagents which convert the hydroxyl into a leaving group results in rearrangement to form a secondary amide. Often phosphorus pentachloride is used to initiate migration but concentrated sulphuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, formic acid, thionyl chloride, and silica have all been applied with success in specific cases. Commonly the group which migrates is the one <i>anti-</i> to the hydroxyl group and this is taken to indicate a high degree of concertedness in the rearrangement, with the alkyl group migration occurring in a synchronous manner with loss of the leaving group to generate a <b><i>nitrilium ion.</i></b> Note that this is in complete contrast to the pinacol rearrangement discussed in<a href="Chapter02.xhtml"> Chapter 2</a> where the nature of the rearrangement depends upon the relative migratory aptitudes of the migrating species</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_47_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, stereospecificity in the Beckmann rearrangement is not as general as may be implied in some texts. Sometimes the group which was <i>syn-</i> to the hydroxyl is found to have migrated and, even more commonly, mixtures of amides may be formed &#x2014; particularly if  R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> are both alkyl groups.This does not invalidate the mechanism shown above as oximes are known to undergo ready  <i>syn-anti</i> isomerism under the types of acidic condition used to initiate rearrangement but it does require caution in adopting oversimplistic explanations.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_47_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Oximes derived from aldehydes are not usually good substrates for Beckmann rearrangement and yields of primary amides obtained in this manner are commonly poor. However, cyclic ketones undergo a very useful
<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48,  Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a>
ring enlargement to give cyclic lactams and this reaction forms the basis of the.industrial production of &#x03B5;-caprolactam, an important feedstock chemical for the preparation of nylon 6 by alkaline polymerisation. In the laboratory cyclic ketones can be converted to lactams in a &#x2018;one-pot&#x2019; process using hydroxylamine sulphonic acid in the presence of formic acid <i>via</i> sequential conversion to the oxime sulphonate and Beckmann rearrangment.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_48_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">With certain substrates, particularly those in which one of the substituents on the oxime is a tertiary alkyl group or possesses a &#x03B2;-heteroatom substituent, a nitrile may be formed by a fragmentation process instead of a rearrangement. This <i>&#x2018;second order Beckmann reaction</i>&#x2019; is a consequence of the enhanced stability of the carbocation produced under these circumstances.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_48_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Another variant involves the reaction of toluenesulphonate derivatives of oximes with organoaluminium reagents when the intermediate nitrilium ion is attacked by the organometallic nucleophile. In this manner, oximes may be converted to imines.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_48_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">The Neber rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ketoxime toluenesulphonates may also be rearranged in the presence of base, when Beckmann type side reactions are suppressed, to yield &#x03B1;-aminoketones; although aldoximes do not undergo this reaction. The mechanism involves initial deprotonation at the migration origin (for this reason the reaction is more efficient if this group is benzylic) and internal displacement of the leaving group to form an intermediate <b><i>azirine</i></b>. Subsequent attack by water on work-up gives the product.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_48_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Unlike the Beckmann rearrangement, the Neber rearrangement shows no dependence upon the stereochemistry of the oxime sulphonate. Instead it is the substituent possessing the most acidic &#x03B1;-position which migrates. There is some debate as to whether deprotonation and internal displacement of the arylsulphonate group are stepwise as shown in the diagram, or concerted. Similarly it has been suggested that the formation of the azirine might proceed by stepwise loss of the toluenesulphonate group from the deprotonated intermediate to form a nitrene before cyclisation to the azirine.</p>

<img src="../images/page_49_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">The curtius rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">This reaction, and the Lossen and Schmidt rearrangements considered next, provides the means for degrading a carboxylic acid to a primary amine containing one less carbon atom and all bear a generic similarity. In the Curtius rearrangement the key step is the thermal conversion of an acyl azide to an isocyanate. The acyl azides are usually prepared by the action of sodium azide on an acid chloride or by the action of nitrous acid upon hydrazides. Azides must be treated with caution as they may decompose explosively.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_49_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The sequence is very useful for preparing isocyanates as it may be carried out under non-aqueous conditions; nevertheless, the usual course of events involves subsequent hydrolysis of the isocyanate. If the solvent is an alcohol the product is the corresponding carbamate ester, but if the solvent is water the initial adduct undergoes subsequent decomposition to liberate carbon dioxide and an amine.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_49_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The rearrangement step has some analogies with the Wolff rearrangement
(see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_40">pages 40</a>-<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_43">43</a>) although the Wolff rearrangement proceeds <i>via</i> a carbene
intermediate whereas the Curtius rearrangement is almost certainly concerted
and does not involve the intermediacy of a nitrene. However, there is evidence
to support the existence of nitrene species when <i>tertiary alkyl</i> azides undergo
Curtius rearrangement to form imines.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_49_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">This reaction may also be carried out at lower temperatures using an acid catalyst, although these conditions usually result in hydrolysis of the imine to the corresponding ketone.</p>



<p class="noindent"><a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Lossen rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Lossen rearrangement refers to the conversion of <i>O</i>-acylhydroxamic acids
to isocyanates on treatment with base and is mechanistically very similar to
the Curtius rearrangement. As the reaction is normally carried out in water,
the process furnishes the amine directly. However, the relative difficulty in
obtaining hydroxamic acids which are used to prepare the rearrangement
precursors means that this method is used less frequently than the Curtius or Schmidt rearrangements.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_50_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Schmidt reaction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The commonest version of the Schmidt reaction involves the acid catalysed
addition of hydrazoic acid to a carboxylic acid to furnish initially a protonated
acyl azide. This subsequently undergoes rearrangement to form an isocyanate
which is then hydrolysed with decarboxylation to form an amine. Effectively
the rearrangement step is the same as in the Curtius rearrangement and it is
only in the means of generation of the acyl azide that these sequences differ.
The reaction works well for aliphatic carboxylic acids but less so for aromatic
carboxylic acids. However, sterically hindered aromatic substrates such as
2,4,6-trimethylbenzoic acid (mesitoic acid) give good yields and this provides
support for the view that the initial step is an example of the rare A<sub>AC</sub>1 type
of process for ester cleavage which occurs under strongly acidic conditions
(concentrated sulphuric acid is commonly used). Thus, protonation of the
hydroxylic oxygen followed by loss of water leads to the formation of an
<b><i>acylium</i> </b>ion which is then attacked by the hydrazoic acid to form the
protonated acyl azide which undergoes rearrangement. The rearrangement and
subsequent steps are the same as in the Curtius rearrangement.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_50_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, unlike the Curtius and Lossen rearrangements, carbonyl compounds, alcohols, and alkenes can also be substrates. In fact dialkyl ketones react more readily than carboxylic acids. In the case of ketones, the end product is the amide in which the nitrogen has been inserted between the carbonyl carbon and the substitutent. Once again the reaction requires strongly acidic conditions, and diaryl ketones are sufficiently unreactive that chemoselectivity between diaryl and dialkyl ketones is possible.</p>

<a id="page_51" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 51, Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">
There is little control over which group migrates; although with aryl alkyl ketones it is usually the aromatic group which does so. Aldehydes, which are not such good substrates for this reaction, give rise to nitriles although further hydrolysis under the reaction conditions is possible. Nitrile formation may also be a troublesome side-reaction with ketones, particularly those in which a substituent may be lost as a stable carbocation.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Hofmann rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Primary amides, on treatment with aqueous sodium hypobromite (usually generated <i>in situ</i> from bromine and sodium hydroxide), undergo a degradative rearrangement to give an amine containing one carbon atom less than the starting amide. This procedure can be particularly useful for degrading aromatic amides to amines. By now it should come as no surprise to learn that the mechanism involves the formation of an isocyanate by migration of the amide substituent from the carbonyl carbon to the nitrogen, followed by hydrolysis to the amine. However, the process by which the isocyanate is formed differs from those discussed previously.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_51_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The first step in the reaction sequence is the formation of the <i>N-</i> bromoamide which then undergoes removal of the remaining proton on the nitrogen, the acidity of which is enhanced due to the presence of the electronegative bromine in addition to the acyl group. The deprotonated intermediate subsequently undergoes rearrangement by what is generally accepted to be a concerted mechanism although a two step process involving loss of bromide and formation of a nitrene would also be compatible with the data available.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In a modification used for high molecular weight amides, methanol may be substituted for aqueous sodium hydroxide to form the methyl carbamate
which may be isolated or hydrolysed as peviously described. Yields are low
when aqueous sodium hydroxide is used with these substrates, presumably
due to their low solubility in the reaction medium.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A similar type of conversion can be achieved by reacting primary amides with lead tetraacetate which converts the amide to the isocyante and then to the amine, liberating acetic acid in the process. The amine can then either undergo acetylation to form an ethanamide derivative or react with the iso-cyanate to give a disubstituted urea.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3 Rearrangements to electron deficient oxygen</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is by far the most important reaction involving 1,2-migrations to an
electron deficient oxygen terminus and has great synthetic utility as it
permits the conversion of ketones into esters, while cyclic ketones generate
lactones. Even more importantly the conversion often shows high
regioselectivity with unsymmetrical substrates, the oxygen atom being
&#x2018;inserted&#x2019; between the carbonyl carbon and the most substituted &#x03B1;-carbon.
The relative ease of migration increases in the order Me &#x003C; RCH<sub>2</sub> &#x003C; Ar &#x003C; R<sub>2</sub>CH 
&#x003C; R<sub>3</sub>C. The methyl group has such low migratory aptitude in the
Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement that oxygen insertion between a carbonyl and a
methyl group never occurs in practice. With aromatic groups, electron
donating groups increase the migratory aptitude and electron withdrawing
groups decrease it. Aldehydes also react, usually by migration of the
hydrogen to give carboxylic acids.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_53_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction is conveniently accomplished by oxidation with peracids, and peracetic acid, 3-chloroperbenzoic acid and magnesium monoperoxyphthalate are all convenient to use. For more reluctant substrates such as ketones with primary alkyl residues, trifluoroperacetic acid is the reagent of choice, although its strong acidity usually requires the reaction mixture to be buffered. For example, cyclohexanone reacts 200 times more rapidly with trifluoroperacetic acid than with peracetic acid. Other reagents which have been used to accomplish the same conversion include H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-BF<sub>3</sub>.Et<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. One limitation of this reaction is that double bonds present in the molecule are frequently epoxidised and thioethers oxidised to sulphoxides or sulphones.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reasons for the regioselectivity of the reaction and the enhanced reactivity of trifluoroperacetic acid can be explained by consideration of the reaction mechanism. The first step involves nucleophilic attack of the peracid at the carbonyl carbon of the protonated ketone to give a tetrahedral<a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a>intermediate, often referred to as the <i>Criegee intermediate</i> after the proposerof the mechanism. This then collapses to regenerate the <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i>-centre by 1,2-nucleophilic migration of one of the alkyl substituents to the adjacentoxygen with concomitant loss of the carboxylic acid. The overall reactionpathway shows similarities to carbonyl homologation with diazomethane.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_54_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Note that in the above mechanistic scheme, the rearrangement has been shown to occur on the protonated Criegee intermediate. However, although the Baeyer-Villiger reaction is catalysed by acid, it also proceeds in the absence of strong acids and so another rearrangement pathway, operating through the unprotonated Criegee intermediate with loss of carboxylate anion, must also be possible.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_54_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Evidence for the overall mechanism comes from the use of <sup>18</sup>O labelled acetophenone, when the oxygen label in the product ester is found to reside totally in the carbonyl oxygen. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect using C-l <sup>14</sup>C labelled aryl groups is interpreted to mean that the migration is involved in the rate determining step and therefore must occur in concert with loss of the carboxylic acid residue. In keeping with a concerted mechanism, chiral groups have been demonstrated to migrate with retention of absolute stereochemistry.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_54_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">From consideration of the above mechanism it is possible to understand why trifluoroperacetic acid is the reagent of choice for Baeyer-Villiger reactions. The inductive electron withdrawing effect of the three fluorine atoms stabilises any negative charge on the carboxylate group. One immediate effect of this is that trifluroacetic acid (<i>p</i>K<sub>a</sub> &#x003D; 0.2) is a far stronger acid than acetic acid (<i>p</i>K<sub>a</sub> &#x003D; 4.70. Consequently, trifluoracetate is a better <i>nucleofuge</i> than acetate and therefore is more readily lost in the rearrangement step.</p>
<a id="page_55" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 55, Rearrangements to electron deficient nitrogen and oxygen</a>
<p class="indent">The relative migratory aptitude of different substituents in the Baeyer- Villiger reaction (Me &#x003C; RCH<sub>2</sub> &#x003C; Ar &#x003C; R<sub>2</sub>CH 
&#x003C; R<sub>3</sub>C) can be related to the ability of the group to sustain a positive charge in the transition state which in turn implies the involvement of some sort of bridged non-classical species in the migration step. It is often forgotten that the nature of the peracid can have a modifying effect upon the reaction, with the more reactive trifluoroperacetic acid lowering the selectivity, but the underlying migratory aptitudes still expressing themselves. For instance, phenyl cyclohexyl ketone rearranges 90&#x0025; <i>via</i> cyclohexyl migration with peracetic acid, but with trifluoroperacetic acid the proportion drops to 80&#x0025;.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The Baeyer-Villiger reaction achieves an extremely useful synthetic conversion and this, together with its ease, selectivity, and generality has made it a popular choice of chemists involved in total synthesis. One example which illustrates the power of the reaction is the preparation of a key intermediate for the total synthesis of a wide range of physiologically active molecules called prostaglandins. The intermediate is now usually known by the name of &#x2018;Corey lactone&#x2019;, after the 1990 Nobel Prize winning chemist E. J. Corey who introduced it. Many variants of its synthesis have been developed but all utilise a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to convert a norbornenone to a lactone, setting up three centres of relative stereochemistry. Note that the regioselectivity of the oxidation is in keeping with that predicted on the basis of substitution at the &#x03B1;-position to the carbonyl group. In this instance chemoselective conversion of the ketone to a lactone is possible in the presence of an alkene. For steric reasons norbornenes selectively undergo epoxidation from the <i>exo-</i>face, but in this instance this face is sterically protected by the pendant benzyl ether moiety.</p>

However, catalysis of the decomposition by acid suggests that heterolytic decomposition can play some role.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Dakin reaction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Aromatic aldehydes and ketones possessing a hydroxyl or amino group in
either the <i>ortho-</i> or para-position can be converted to phenols on treatment
with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. The conversion occurs <i>via</i> hydrolysis of the
corresponding esters which are formed by a rearrangement process bearing a
strong mechanistic resemblance to the Baeyer-Villiger reaction. The carbonyl
carbon is attacked by the hydroperoxide anion and the tetrahedral intermediate
then collapses with migration of the aryl group from carbon to the
neighbouring oxygen with displacement of hydroxide. The ester thus formed
undergoes hydrolysis under the aqueous alkaline conditons of the reaction;
although ester intermediates have been isolated, lending support to the
proposed mechanistic rationale.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Electron releasing substituents are necessary for efficient migration of the aromatic group, the electronic requirement having a direct analogy with the Baeyer-Villiger reaction. With benzaldehyde, hydride migration is favoured over the phenyl group to give benzoic acid almost exclusively.</p>
