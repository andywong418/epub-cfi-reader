<h2 class="h2">7.1<span class="space"></span>	<b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Despite all attempts to classify polar rearrangements neatly into particular categories, based upon mechanistic or structural criteria, there are inevitably many reactions which fall outside any framework which might be devised. This final chapter is reserved for these reactions and the heading &#x02018;<i>miscellaneous</i>&#x2019; is simply a reflection of the diversity of the mechanisms. In this chapter we will consider some cationic processes in the section on allylic rearrangements, some sigmatropic migrations which rely upon total or partial charge separation, and a radical rearrangement in which the radical species are undoubtedly charged. It might be argued that some &#x2014; or all &#x2014; of these rearrangements should have been included in other chapters within this book, but none sits really comfortably into any of the previous categories, so they appear here.</p></section>

<h2 class="h2">7.2<span class="space"></span>	<b>Allylic rearrangements</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mechanisms</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Allylic substrates are particularly prone to rearrange during nucleophilic substitution reactions. There are three major reaction pathways (S<sub>N</sub>1&#x00B4; S<sub>N</sub>2&#x00B4; and S<sub>N</sub>i&#x00B4;) by which rearrangement can occur, and these are directly analogous to the commonly encountered nucleophilic substitution mechanisms. Reaction under conditions which favour first order substitution (polar solvent, poor nucleophile, good leaving group) always leads to mixtures of isomeric products. This mechanism involves initial ionisation to form the resonance stabilised allylic cation. Under kinetic conditions, the site of nucleophilic attack is largely directed by the degree of positive character at each of the two carbons of the allylic resonance hybrid, with steric effects playing a secondary role. Consequently, it is impossible to avoid formation of mixtures of positional and geometric isomers in S<sub>N</sub>l reactions of acyclic allylic substrates under kinetic conditions. </p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Second order nucleophilic substitution is favoured by reaction conditions involving strong nucleophiles, apolar solvents, and poor leaving groups<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Miscellaneous rearrangements</a>With allylic substrates the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x00B4; mechanism may compete with direct S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction and the degree to which either occurs can sometimes be controlled. As a result, it may be possible to choose reaction conditions to obtain displacement with or without rearrangement.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em"><img src="../images/page_83_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">An additional feature of the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x00B4; reaction is the possibility for the incoming nucleophile to approach from the same side as the leaving group, giving <i>syn</i>&#x002D; attack, or from the opposite side in an <i>anti</i>&#x002D; manner. The syn&#x002D; pathway is usually predominant but the degree to whicheither occurs is dependent upon the nature of the leaving group and the nucleophile.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em"><img src="../images/page_83_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption> <span style="margin-left:-16em"><b><i>sync attack</i></b></span><span style="margin-left:9em"><b><i>anti attack</i></b></span></figcaption></figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">Alcohols react with thionyl chloride to furnish chlorides by the 
intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>i reaction. This process involves front&#x002D;side nucleophilic attack and means that the carbon undergoing substitution retains its original stereochemistry. Similarly, allylic alcohols undergo S<sub>N</sub>1&#x00B4; rearrangement with thionyl chloride to give chlorides by the S<sub>N</sub>1&#x00B4; mechanism.Optically active alcohols give optically active chlorides indicating a highly ordered reaction.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em"><img src="../images/page_83_5.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">When the incoming nucleophile is the same as the leaving group (for example halide), the end result is a rearrangement of the allylic substrate. In such equilibrations, the ratio of the two products in the final mixture is dependent upon their relative thermodynamic stabilities.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em"><img src="../images/page_83_6.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">Among the factors which determine the stability of a particular acyclic 
allylic system are the degree of substitution of the double bond, possibility for conjugation,
 and steric hindrance. In cyclic allylic systems there are the additional considerations of 
conformational preference, ring strain, and allylic strain. In an acyclic example, the equilibration between 3&#x002D;bromoprop&#x002D;l&#x002D;ene <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Miscellaneous rearrangements</a>and l&#x002D;bromoprop&#x002D;2&#x002D;ene leads to a mixture in which the product with the most substituted double bond predominates.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_84_5.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The degree of double bond substitution is even more marked when conjugation effects come into play. For instance, the equilibrium between 3&#x002D; chloro&#x002D;l&#x002D;phenylprop&#x002D;l&#x002D;ene (cinnamyl chloride) and 3&#x002D;chloro&#x002D;3&#x002D;phenylprop&#x002D; lene (1&#x002D;phenylallyl chloride) almost completely favours the former.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Although bulky substituents on a cyclohexane ring prefer to be equatorial, in cyclohexene systems allylic strain means that allylic substituents prefer to adopt an axial disposition.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_84_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Thermal equilibraton of the phthalate half esters of <i>syn</i>&#x002D; and <i>anti</i>&#x002D; 5&#x002D; methylcyclohex&#x002D;2&#x002D;en&#x002D;l&#x002D;ol leads to a mixture in which the <i>anti</i>&#x002D; isomer predominates. This isomer is more stable as it can adopt a conformation in which both ring substituents lie in quasi&#x002D;equatorial environments.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_84_2.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent3-ka">When optically active syn&#x002D;3&#x002D;chloro&#x002D;5&#x002D;methylcyclohexene was solvolysed in ethanol and the rate of solvolysis measured both titrimetrically and polarimetrically, it was found that the polarimetrically determined rate was faster than that obtained by measuring the amount of HC1 liberated. This was interpreted as involving initial ionisation to form a tight ion pair which may either lead on to a free carbocation which is attacked by solvent or undergo recombination. Due to the symmetrical nature of the allylic carbocation, there is an equal likelihood of internal return of chloride to either position giving racemic starting chloride </p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_84_3.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Rearrangements which would migrate a double bond to an exocyclic position appear to be disfavoured. This effect is presumably a consequence of steric compression of the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>&#x002D;carbon angle when it is constrained within a ring compared to an acyclic environment. This is graphically illustrated by the fact that, although tertiary allylic alcohols are generally very rapidly rearranged in acid, this is not the case if such an isomerisation would make the double bond exocyclic.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Miscellaneous rearrangements</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Allylic esters</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Depending upon reaction conditions, the rearrangement of allylic esters may occur either by a dissociation&#x002D;reassociation process to give solvent caged or totally separated ionic species, or by an intramolecular process. As a result of studies on uncatalysed rearrangements of aryl esters of 1&#x002D; and 3&#x002D;phenylprop&#x002D;3&#x002D; en&#x002D;l&#x002D;ol, Burton and Ingold decided that the process involved total heterolytic cleavage followed by recombination.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_85_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The evidence for this came from their observations that the ease of rearrangement was increased by the presence of electron withdrawing groups on the aryl group and by carrying the reaction out in ionising solvents. They were also able to demonstrate that addition of other nucleophilic species could divert the reaction giving both rearranged and unrearranged substitution products. All of these results provided strong evidence for the existence of free ions. In further support of this conclusion, Meisenheimer demonstrated the reaction to be first order in ester.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, later studies with specifically labelled substrates showed that the acyl oxygen of the starting ester largely became the alkyl oxygen in the rearranged product. In addition, it was found that, although addition of labelled common anions to the mixture led to some incorporation into both the starting material and rearranged product, the rate of rearrangement was more rapid than incorporation into the rearranged material. This led to the conclusion that rearrangement was occurring largely <i>via</i> an internal delivery mechanism in which a large degree of ionic character exists at the transition state.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_85_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">Further support for the existence of an internal delivery system was obtained from the rearrangement of the <sup>18</sup>O&#x002D;carbonyl labelled 4&#x002D;nitrobenzoate ester of optically active pent&#x002D;2&#x002D;en&#x002D;4&#x002D;ol which would lead to the enantiomeric material on rearrangement. It was found that the rate of distribution of oxygen label between alkyl and acyl positions was only about a third as fast as racemisation.</p>





<figure class="fig1"><a id="page_86" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 86, Miscellaneous rearrangements</a>

<img src="../images/page_86_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">In contrast to uncatalysed rearrangements of allylic esters, acid catalysed processes always appear to occur <i>via</i> dissociation and reassociation of the protonated species. For example, rearrangement of optically active 1&#x002D; phenylprop&#x002D;2&#x002D;enyl <sup>14</sup>C&#x002D;acetate in unlabelled acetic acid resulted in isotopic scrambling and racemisation of both product and recovered starting material.</p>

<p class="aside">Resonance stabilisation in the allenyl&#x002D;propynl cation</p></aside>

<p class="noindent">The propynyl (propargyl) cation can also profit from resonance stabilisation in the same way as the allyl cation. However, in this case the alternative extreme resonance canonical form is the allenyl cation and this is not such an important contributor to the resonance hybrid. Nevertheless, propynylic alcohols undergo acid catalysed rearrangements in a manner directly analogous to the corresponding allylic alcohols, with the distinction that the resultant allenic alcohols undergo subsequent tautomerism to form &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;&#x002D;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in a reaction known as the <i>Meyer&#x002D;Schuster rearrangement.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The mechanism of the rearrangement probably involves a dissociation&#x002D; reassociation mechanism. Evidence for this comes from the observation of an alternative pathway, the <i>Rape rearrangement</i> in certain substrates. In this variant, deprotonation of the propynylic cation precedes reassociation and this is followed by simple Markownikoff hydration of the alkyne. </p>

<a id="page_87" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 87, Miscellaneous rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">A base catalysed variant of the Meyer&#x002D;Schuster rearrangement is also known and this has been shown to occur via the expected S<sub>N</sub>2&#x00B4; mechanism. Propynylic chlorides may be rearranged to allenic chlorides in the presence of copper (I) chloride, and optically active propynylic alcohols have been shown to react with thionyl chloride to furnish optically active allenes <i>via</i> an internal delivery mechanism.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The Hofmann-Loffler &#x002D;Freytag reaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Radical rearrangements are typically apolar processes, but the Hofmann&#x002D; Loffler&#x002D;Freytag reaction, which involves the radical mediated rearrangement of amine derivatives in the presence of strong acids, must occur <i>via</i> the protonated species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Heating <i>N</i>&#x002D;haloamines possessing a hydrogen at C&#x002D;4 or C&#x002D;5 in the presence of acid results in a radical mediated rearrangement to form the 4&#x002D; or 5&#x002D; haloamine which can be converted into the corresponding pyrrolidine or piperidine on subsequent mild base treatment. Photochemical and peroxide initiation of the reaction is also possible.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_88_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The mechanism involves a radical chain reaction which is initiated by protonation of the nitrogen, and propagated by homolytic cleavage of the <i>N</i>&#x002D; halogen bond followed by hydrogen atom removal from C&#x002D;4 or C&#x002D;5.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Rearrangements of alkyl boranes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Trialkylboranes react with carbon monoxide at elevated temperatures in the presence of ethane- 1,2&#x002D;diol to form a 2&#x002D;borato&#x002D;l,3&#x002D;dioxalane. Oxidative cleavage of the carbon&#x002D;boron bond results in the formation of a tertiary alcohol. The mechanism has been shown to involve a series of three intramolecular 1,2&#x002D;nucleophilic alkyl shifts from boron to the carbon <i>via</i> intermediate organoborates or ate complexes. The migrations occur with retention of the absolute configuration of the alkyl groups.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_89_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">Cyclic boranes derived from hydroboration of dienes or trienes are converted to cyclic alcohols by this route which has been termed <i>ring stitching</i> with boron by the Nobel Prize winning chemist H. C. Brown.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em"><img src="../images/page_89_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the reaction is carried out in the presence of water only two alkyl groups migrate to form an intermediate dihydroxy compound which may be decomposed with alkali to form a secondary alcohol. When the borane possesses different alkyl groups, the relative migratory aptitudes are in the order primary &#x003E; secondary  &#x003E; tertiary. The (l,l,2&#x002D;trimethyl)propyl substituent (commonly referred to as the &#x2018;thexyl&#x2019;group) is frequently used for reactions where specific migration of other substituents is required. The only experimental disadvantage in this case is the necessity for using high pressures for the initial carbonylation step</p>

<p class="noindent">Treatment of vinylboranes with iodine in the presence of base results in the formation of an alkene in which an alkyl group has undergone 1,2&#x002D; nucleophilic migration from the boron. Migration occurs with retention of absolute stereochemistry of the alkyl group and the alkene is formed with defined geometry. This stereospecificity is a consequence of the mechanism which involves initial formation of an iodonium species, followed by migration and <i>anti</i>&#x002D;elimination of the alkylboron diiodide.</p>
