<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1 Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">With the exception of <i>prototropic</i> rearrangements (H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> migrations), electrophilic rearrangements &#x2014; in other words those rearrangements in which a group migrates formally as a cationic species &#x2014; are far less commonly encountered than the nucleophilic types of rearrangement we have considered up to now. This is largely due to the fact that an intramolecular electrophilic rearrangement, has four electrons involved in the transition state one pair of which has to be accommodated in an antibonding orbital of the migrating species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The situation can be visualised most easily by considering the migration to be an intramolecular 
S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction and looking at the frontier molecular orbitals of the migrating group and the migration terminus. In the initial species, the anionic migration terminus acts as the nucleophile and hence we must consider the <i>highest occupied molecular orbital</i> (HOMO) at this centre interacting with the <i>lowest unoccupied molecular orbital</i> (LUMO) of the migrating group. In the initial anionic species the non-bonding <i>p</i>-orbital on the migration terminus is the HOMO. During the initial stages of migration, the pair of electrons in this orbital begins to interact with the LUMO of the the migrating group which is the <i>antibonding</i> &#x03C3;-orbital. As the reaction proceeds to completion, the original bonding electrons finish in the nonbonding orbital at the migration origin and the remaining pair form a &#x03C3;-bond between the migrating group and migration terminus. This is a grossly oversimplified picture, but serves our purpose at this level.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">At the outset of migration this unfavourable transition of electrons from a non-bonding into an antibonding orbital means that the reaction possesses a high activation energy barrier and is kinetically disfavoured. Note that, with our hypothetical symmetrical system, there is no overall energy change but, in practice, unsymmetrical substrates lead to electrophilic rearrangements in which the product is more stable than the starting material. The process then becomes thermodynamically favourable, although kinetically disfavoured.</p>




<a id="page_61" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 61, Electrophilic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">In addition to molecular orbital considerations, the positioning of the antibonding orbital on the migrating group requires rear-side attack of the migration terminus upon the migration centre, and places additional steric constraints upon electrophilic migrations.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">As a consequence of the above reactivity requirements, the migrating group is usually an aromatic ring which is better able to accommodate the additional pair of electrons. As we shall see shortly, the constraints of a concerted migration are so strong that, when electrophilic rearrangements do occur, that they probably do so in a stepwise manner and not <i>via</i> a concerted mechanism.</p>

<img src="../images/page_61_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">In all of the examples we will consider, rearrangement is initiated by generation of a carbanion at the migration terminus. The most commonly encountered and synthetically useful electrophilic rearrangements involve migration of a group from a heteroatom (nitrogen, sulphur, or oxygen), but some rearrangements with a carbon atom at the migration origin are known.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.2 Rearrangements from nitrogen</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Stevens rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If a quaternary ammonium salt possessing an electron withdrawing group &#x03B1;- to the nitrogen is treated with base an <i>ylid</i> can be generated which may rearrange in such a manner that the overall result is transfer of one of the remaining nitrogen substituents to the deprotonated position. The reaction is named after T. S. Stevens, who was responsible for discovery of this rearrangement in 1928 and carried out investigations into its mechanism.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_61_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Crossover experiments showed the mechanism to be intramolecular and migration of groups with an asymmetric &#x03B1;-position led to products in which the stereochemical information at that centre had been retained. These data were originally considered to rule out an elimination-addition process which would involve loss of stereochemical integrity of the migrating centre. Instead they were interpreted to indicate a pathway proceeding by &#x03B1;- deprotonation followed by concerted electrophilic migration with inversion of the absolute stereochemistry of the migrating group. The stereochemical inversion would give the required stereochemistry for a concerted migration proceeding by an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_61_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>




<a id="page_62" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 62, Electrophilic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, further studies demonstrated that rearrangement occurs with
<i>retention</i> of absolute stereochemistry at the migrating centre and later
spectroscopic examination indicated that free radical intermediates are formed
during the reaction. Subsequently this has led to the adoption of the
mechanism, shown in the following diagram, involving deprotonation
followed by homolytic cleavage to generate a pair of radicals. In such a
mechanism it is necessary to invoke a rapid recombination of the radicals
which do not escape from a tight solvent cage in order to explain the
observed intramolecularity and the lack of racemisation. In fact it is now
thought possible that some reactions may involve the addition-elimination
process (originally discarded on the basis of lack of racemisation) with the
ion pairs remaining trapped in a solvent cage.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_62_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Addition of more than one equivalent of base results in little increase in reaction rate and this is interpreted as meaning that complete anion formation precedes any rearrangement. Substrates often possess a carbonyl group (&#x03B2;- to the quaternary nitrogen and this serves to ease anion formation further. When the migrating group is benzylic, electron withdrawing substituents on the aromatic nucleus increase the rate of rearrangement.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_62_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A variant of the Stevens rearrangement occurs with sulphonium salts which are deprotonated, forming a sulphur ylid which subsequently rearranges in a directly analogous manner to the more usually encountered nitrogen based Stevens rearrangement. Once again there is spectroscopic evidence pointing to the intermediacy of tightly bound radical pairs. Eliminationof the resultant thioether provides a synthetic alternative to the Ramberg -Backlund reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, Electrophilic rearrangements</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">This rearrangement is related to the Stevens rearrangement often competing
with it, and may even supercede it. The reaction bears the name of its French
discoverer M. Sommelet who, in 1937, reported that trimethyl
(diphenylmethyl)ammonium hydroxide rearranged on standing to give (2-
benzyl)benzyldimethylamine. Similar by-products are obtained when Stevens
rearrangements are carried out on benzyl trialkylammonium substrates. The
reaction became synthetically useful with the discovery in 1951 by C. R.
Hauser that the use of alkali metal amides in liquid ammonia led to almost
total exclusion of Stevens type rearrangement products. The reaction
mechanism involves initial deprotonation of the benzylic position which is
in equilibrium with a second ylid. It is this ylid which, despite being present
as the minor species, undergoes 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement to generate
the product after reprotonation. The lack of crossover with labelled substrates
is taken as strong evidence that rearrangement does not occur by a
dissociation-recombination process, although the small amount of material
resulting from migration to the para-position may be formed by such a
mechanism. Whilst polar sigmatropic rearrangements are largely dealt with in
<a href="Chapter07.xhtml">chapter 7</a>, the Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement is covered here due to its
close relationship with the Stevens rearrangement.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_63_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">As the product is a tertiary amine, it may be converted to its quaternary salt and the process repeated if there is a free <i>Ortho</i>-zoposition available.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Meisenheimer rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Once again this reaction bears a close resemblance to the two preceding reactions. In this case a tertiary <i>N</i>-oxide undergoes thermal rearrangement to furnish the corresponding <i>O</i>-substituted hydroxylamine.</p>

<a id="page_64" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 64, Electrophilic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The migrating group is usually benzylic or allylic and the remaining groups may be alkyl or aryl. However, if any of the groups possesses a (&#x03B2;- hydrogen, Cope elimination predominates, limiting the synthetic utility of this rearrangement.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3">
<h2 class="h2"><b>5.3 Rearrangements from oxygen</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Wittig rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Wittig rearrangement is directly analogous to the Stevens rearrangement in mechanism and outcome (not be confused with the better known <i>Wittig reaction)</i> and takes its name from Georg Wittig who carried out definitive investigations into the mechanism of the reaction after its discovery in 1924 by Schorigen. Compared with the Stevens rearrangement stronger bases, such as rc-butyllithium or sodium amide, are used to initiate Wittig rearrangement as the reaction proceeds <i>via</i> negatively charged species, rather than ylid formation as is the case in the nitrogen series. There is no restriction upon the nature of the oxygen substituents as long as there is at least one hydrogen present &#x03B1;- to the oxygen; although many functionalities will not be able to withstand the strongly basic conditions. As with the Stevens rearrangement, a radical pair mechanism is probably operating with each of the pair of radicals recombining before escaping from the solvent cage. Migratory aptitudes are in the order allyl &#x2248; benzyl &#x003E; alkyl &#x003E; methyl &#x003E; aryl, with electron withdrawing substituents increasing aryl group migratory aptitude.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_64_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The evidence for such a mechanism is strong. Crossover experiments have demonstrated that the rearrangement is largely intramolecular, although some leakage can occur, consistent with a tightly bound dissociative pathway. The migratory aptitudes are in accord with relative radical stability and chiral groups have been found to migrate with partial racemisation; although the main pathway results in retention of configuration. The same type of product also results if ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals prepared from different starting materials are combined.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">When R<sup>3</sup> is allylic a concerted 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement can operate.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_64_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">In all cases the driving force for reaction is the conversion of the initial carbanion to the thermodynamically more stable alkoxide.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangements from sulphur</h2>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that a variant of the Stevens rearrangement involves generation of a sulphur ylid and its subsequent rearrangement. The following pair of reactions are most commonly encountered with sulphur as the migration origin.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Smiles and Truce-Smiles rearrangements</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Smiles rearrangement refers to an intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and the general mechanism can be shown as follows:</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_65_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Both A and B are heteroatoms in the Smiles rearrangement. Commonly the heteroatom A is S, SO, or SO<sub>2</sub> (although examples are also known where A is O), and B may be O, NR, or S. In the Truce-Smiles modification, B is a carbon centre and in this latter case, it is not necessary for electron withdrawing groups to be present on the migrating aryl group.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_65_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although the couple of examples shown above possess two aromatic rings, the chain linking A-B can also be aliphatic. In cases where this second ring is aromatic however, an important accelerative effect is noted for those substrates possessing an additional substituent at C-6. The basis for this effect can be shown to be steric rather than electronic as isomeric substrates with the substitutent at C-4 rearrange about 10<sup>5</sup> times more slowly.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_65_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">This effect is due to the fact that the favoured ground state conformation for the 2,6-buttressed substrate is close to that required for migration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Carbon to carbon electrophilic migration</h2>
<p class="noindent">The exceptional ease with which many substrates undergo <i>carbocation</i> induced 1,2-migration of alkyl groups compares starkly with the dearth ofexamples in which the equivalent <i>carbanion</i> induced rearrangement occurs.Indeed, only in very exceptional circumstances, when steric and electroniceffects combine, are such rearrangements found to occur.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">This type of rearrangement is however found to occur in metallation reactions of l,l,l-triaryl-2-haloalkanes, when it is not possible to detect the initial carbanion, the rearranged species being the sole detectable material present.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_66_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Clearly the driving force for this reaction is the relief of steric compression from C-l and the greater stabilisation of the rearranged carbanion compared with the initially formed primary anion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">As the process of metallation of halides occurs <i>via</i> two single electron transfers, it is possible to envisage that rearrangement actually occurs after formation of the intermediate radical species before the second electron has been transferred.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_66_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, a series of elegant experiments, in which l-chloro-2,2- diphenylpropane was metallated followed by a CO<sub>2</sub> quench have demonstrated that anion formation very probably precedes migration. The study found that 2,2-diphenylpropyl magnesium chloride was stable at temperatures up to 100&#x00B0;C with carbonation yielding 3,3-diphenylbutanoic acid. The lithio- derivative however, was found to be stable at 0 &#x00B0;C but rearranged at 40 &#x00B0;C, and the potassium derivative yielded only the rearrangement product.</p>

<img src="../images/page_66_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<a id="page_67" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 67, Electrophilic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The progressive ease of rearrangement in the series Mg &#x003C; Li &#x003C; K was proposed to be a consequence of the increasingly ionic nature of the carbon- metal bond. Note that the alternative migration of the methyl group was not observed, despite the fact that this would have led to the more stabilised rearranged carbanion. This is in accord with the greater ability of the phenyl group to stabilise the negative charge during migration.</p>
