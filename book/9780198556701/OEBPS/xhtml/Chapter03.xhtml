<p class="noindent">The Wagner-Meerwein and related rearrangements considered in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> are characterised by the requirement for a high degree of carbocationic character at the migration terminus in order to initiate rearrangement. While constituting a very important sub-division of nucleophilic rearrangements, not least for their historical significance, such carbocation induced shifts are by no means the whole story. Since the migrating terminus simply has to be electron deficient relative to the group undergoing migration, it is not necessary to involve full carbocations.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In many nucleophilic rearrangements it may be simply sufficient for the migration terminus to possess a leaving group, and in such cases the migrating species is frequently negatively charged. In comparing Wagner- Meerwein type rearrangements with such anion induced rearrangements it is useful to draw the analogy of nucleophilic substitution reactions, considering the former to be related to an internal S<sub>N</sub>1 process and the latter to an internal S<sub>N</sub>2 process. Synthetically useful anion induced processes include the Favorskii and Ramberg-Backlung rearrangements.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In another synthetically very important group of nucleophilic rearrangements, electron deficiency at the migration terminus is provided by generation of a valence satisfied but coordinatively unsaturated carbene.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">
The most frequently encountered carbene induced nucleophilic rearrangement, the Wolff rearrangement, generates the carbene centre by loss of nitrogen from &#x03B1;-diazoketone substrates and may be used to effect ring contraction of cyclic ketones or homologation of carboxylic acids, the latter procedure being known as the Arndt-Eistert synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A useful formalism to adopt when dealing with mechanisms involving carbenes is to consider the carbene centre to be &#x2018;C<sup>&#x002B; -</sup>&#x2019; as it is then much easier to see how to push curly arrows. In fact &#x2018;C<sup>&#x002B; -</sup>&#x2019; is a means of representing <i>singlet carbene</i> which possesses an empty <i>p</i>-orbital with the spin-paired non-bonding electrons residing in one <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i>orbital. The alternative electronic configuration is <i>triplet carbene</i> in which the electrons reside in different atomic orbitals. Generally, dihalocarbenes have singlet ground states whereas carbene itself and alkyl carbenes have triplet ground states. The different electronic configurations of singlet and triplet carbenes result in differences of reactivity of these species in electrocyclic reactions but both undergo the same sorts of rearrangements.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The Favorskii rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Favorskii rearrangement refers to the skeletal reorganisation of a- halogenated carbonyl compounds on reaction with alkoxides to furnish esters.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_36_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">It is named after its discoverer who, in 1894, first reported the conversionof dichloroketones to unsaturated carboxylic acids on heating with potassiumcarbonate. However, the Favorskii rearrangement can be applied to a widerange of different &#x03B1;-halogenated ketones and finds a particularly usefulapplication in the conversion of cyclic substrates to ring contractedcarboxylic acid derivatives.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_36_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>


<a id="page_37" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 37, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>
<p class="indent3-ka">
An interesting example of a double Favorskii ring contraction is the key step in the synthesis of the architecturally fascinating compound &#x2018;cubane&#x2019;. In this reaction two fused &#x03B1;-bromocyclopentanone units were contracted to</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_37_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The actual mechanism of the rearrangement has been the subject of intense study and it is generally accepted that the conversion proceeds <i>via</i> a reactiveorcyclopropanone intermediate. The mechanism therefore occurs by initialdeprotonation at the &#x03B1;&#x2019;-position followed by intramolecular displacement ofthe halide to generate an intermediate cyclopropanone which is opened under the reaction conditions to furnish the carboxylic acid derivative (an ester, acid amide depending upon the nucleophile used). The net effect of this processis the nucleophilic migration of an alkyl group from the carbonyl carbon tothe &#x03B1;-position with loss of halide.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_37_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Very strong evidence for this cyclopropanone mechanism is provided by the observation that certain isomeric substrates form the same ester. A consequence of such a mechanism is that the structure of the initial chloroketone should have little influence upon the outcome of the reaction, the structure of the product ester resulting from the direction of ring opening
of the cyclopropanone intermediate. This has been found to be the case,</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_37_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Compelling evidence for the intermedicy of cyclopropanone species comes from the observation that 2,3-double <sup>14</sup>C labelled 2-chlorocyclohexanone gives cyclopentane carboxylic acid with one label remaining on the carbonyl carbon and the other label split equally between C-1 and C-2.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_37_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>


<a id="page_38" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 38, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The observation that both C-l and C-2 were labelled to the same extent is in keeping with the equal likelihood of cleavage at either of the two bonds to the carbonyl group of the cyclopropanone intermediate. Further evidence to support this mechanism is provided by the observation that cyclopropanones prepared by other means react with alkoxides to give the predicted ester products, although cyclopropanone intermediates have not been isolated from the Favorskii reactions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The exact timing of the cyclopropanone formation step has also been the subject of much scrutiny. It is generally accepted that there is a discrete initial deprotonation, with carbanion formation preceding loss of halide, as loss of stereochemical information is usually observed at the migration origin, in keeping with the formation of a planar enolate. Stereochemical evidence has indicated that, in certain circumstances at least, attack by the carbanion occurs simultaneously with loss of halide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 type ring closure. For instance, the diastereomeric substrates in the following scheme led selectively to diastereomeric acid rearrangement products with no stereochemical crossover occurring. The relationship between the product and starting material in each case shows that an inversion of configuration has occurred at the chlorine bearing terminus.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_38_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, this stereocontrol at the migration terminus is not observed in solvents such as methanol, and this may be due to an S<sub>N</sub>l type of process occurring in the polar medium, in which a dipolar intermediate is formed.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_38_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A variant of the Favorskii reaction occurs with &#x03B1;,&#x03B1;- and &#x03B1;,&#x03B1;&#x2019; dihaloketones which lead to the production of &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated esters. The reaction has also been carried out on &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-epoxyketones which give &#x03B2;- hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_38_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A further variant, sometimes referred to as the <i>quasi Favorskii rearrangement</i> is demonstrated by &#x03B1;-halocyclobutanones and &#x03B1;-haloketones which do not possess a hydrogen at the &#x03B1;&#x2019;-position. Substrates of this nature cannot rearrange <i>via</i> cyclopropanone intermediates and instead undergo a base<a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>catalysed pinacol type rearrangement, sometimes referred to as a <i>semibenzilic rearrangement.</i></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This proposed mechanism, implies a stereochemical inversion at the migration terminus and this has been demonstrated experimentally using the
conformationally locked a-bromocyclohexyl phenyl ketone shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_39_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A few examples of Favorskii rearrangements in substrates other than &#x03B1;- haloketones have been reported. For instance, certain &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-epoxyketones afford hydroxy acids and the corresponding lactones on treatment with base, and a procedure has been developed in which &#x03B1;-hydroxyketones may undergo a similar conversion on treatment with diethyl carbonate and sodium hydride. In this latter reaction, use of carbonyl oxygen <sup>18</sup>0 labelled substrate confirmed the intermediacy of a cyclopropanone.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Ramberg-Backlund rearrangement</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">This is another rearrangement which involves the formation of a cyclic intermediate and refers to the base promoted conversion of &#x03B1;-halosulphones into alkenes with the extrusion of sulphur dioxide. These substrates do not readily undergo substitution of the halogen by external nucleophiles. Instead exposure to base results in deprotonation at the &#x03B1;&#x2019;-position, the protons of which are relatively acidic due to stabilisation of the resultant anion by the adjacent sulphone group. Generally &#x03B1;-halosulphones possessing an &#x03B1;&#x2019;- hydrogen readily undergo the reaction to give mixtures of alkene geometric isomers, the ease of reaction increasing in the order Cl &#x003C;&#x003C; Br &#x003C; I. The cyclic intermediate is called an <i>episulphone</i> or <i>thiirane dioxide</i> and these compounds, prepared by other routes, are known to eliminate sulphur dioxide readily upon heating by a process known as <i>cheletropic extrusion.</i></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This rearrangement is particularly useful for preparing alkenes in small rings or highly substituted alkenes as the alkene is not formed until the final very favourable extrusion step.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The benzil-benzilic acid rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"> </p>
<p class="noindent">This rearrangement is named after the parent reaction but is not restricted solely to aromatic &#x03B1;-diketones as aliphatic diketones and &#x03B1;-ketoaldehydes will also undergo the reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_40_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The process is irreversible and use of an alkoxide in place of hydroxide
leads directly to the corresponding ester. However, a side reaction is possible
with readily oxidised alkoxide groups such as Me<sub>2</sub>CHO<sup>-</sup> (these reduce the
starting material to the corresponding &#x03B1;-ketol), and phenoxides are
insufficiently basic to participate in the reaction. A similar reaction may be
initiated by carbon nucleophiles.</p>

carbenes</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Wolff rearrangement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Aliphatic diazo compounds are generally far too labile to isolate under normal conditions. However, the presence of a carbonyl group renders these substrates much more stable and &#x03B1;-diazoketones are readily prepared by the nucleophilic attack of diazoalkanes on acid chlorides with subsequent loss of<a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>chloride and deprotonation. Despite this enhanced stability compared to theirsimple aliphatic counterparts, &#x03B1;-diazoketones readily undergo decomposition to liberate the very stable nitrogen molecule and a neutral, valence unsatisfied carbene. This tendency to decompose rapidly, liberating a gaseous product makes &#x03B1;-diazoketones liable to explode and they need to be handled with great caution and their isolation is avoided wherever possible. The decompositon can be carried out either thermally or by photolysis and, depending upon the reaction conditions, the carbene may be formed in either the singlet or the triplet state (see <a href="#page_36">page 36</a>). Whilst the nature of the carbene has fundamental effects upon its reactivity in reactions such as cycloadditions, it is irrelevant to the outcome of the Wolff rearrangement in which a 1,2-nucleophilic migration of the alkyl residue attached to the carbonyl group occurs to form a ketene intermediate. There has been much debate about the timing of the mechanism and many attempts to distinguish between the two step process involving the intermediacy of a carbene or a concerted process in which migration occurs at the same time as loss of nitrogen.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The general concensus appears to be that carbenes are intermediates in the photochemically initiated Wolff rearrangement but there is still controversy about the thermal process. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the carbene intermediate appears to exist in equilibrium with a cyclic isomer called an <i><b>oxirene</b>.</i> The existence of this equilibrium has been demonstrated by the equal distribution of <sup>14</sup>C label in the acid produced by the photochemically induced rearrangement of carbonyl labelled 2-diazobutan- 3-one in the presence of water. A carbene intermediate would have given an acid which only possessed labelling at the carbonyl carbon.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Studies on the thermal reaction have indicated that there is no observable kinetic isotope effect if the migrating carbon is <sup>l4</sup>C which favours a stepwise process in which the rate determining step is the generation of the
<a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>
carbene. Generally the thermal reaction is carried out in the presence of silver salts which catalyse the decomposition of the diazoketone. Invariably the reaction is carried out in the presence of water, alcohols or aqueous ammonia when the product is the carboxylic acid, ester or amide resulting from attack of solvent on the ketene intermediate produced by the migration step. The overall conversion is directly equivalent to that achieved by Favorskii rearrangement of &#x03B1;-haloketones (see <a href="#page_36">pages 36</a>-<a href="#page_39">39</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Wolff rearrangements are of particular utility in preparing ring contracted carboxylic acids <i>via</i> cyclic &#x03B1;-diazoketones.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_42_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The Wolff rerrangement finds a neat industrial application in certain lithographic plates known as <i>diazo plates.</i> In essence a lithographic plate consists of a metal sheet coated with a thin layer of polymer to which is bound a photosensitive material. Selective irradiation of areas of the plate through a mask representing the image to be captured results in photochemical reaction in the exposed areas. This alters the properties of the irradiated coating, either hardening it (<i>negative working)</i> or rendering it soluble <i>(positive working).</i> In diazo plates the photosensitive material is one of a family of orr/io-napthoquinone diazides. These undergo Wolff rearrangement on irradiation to produce carboxylic acids by reaction with traces of water present in the film.</p>

<a id="page_43" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 43, Nucleophilic rearrangements to carbon involving carbanions and carbenes </a>
<p class="indent3-ka">This sequence renders the exposed areas soluble in aqueous alkali and they can be stripped from the plate, leaving behind the unexposed areas of coating which can then be used to transfer ink to another surface &#x2014; usually paper. Colour pictures may then be constructed by superimposing images from a series of four different plates, each corresponding to a different primary colour or black.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><b>The Arndt-Eistert homologation</b></h2>
<p class="indent3-ka">As &#x03B1;-diazoketones are most conveniently prepared from the reaction of diazoalkanes with acid chlorides, themselves derived from carboxylic acids,
Wolff rearrangement in the presence of water results in a sequence by which a carboxylic acid may be converted to its homologue. This procedure is of such importance that it is usually referred to as the <i><b>Arndt-Eistert homologation.</b></i></p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%;margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/eq_43_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">In order to minimise side reactions leading to the formation of &#x03B1;- haloketones of the type RCOCH<sub>2</sub>CI, it is usual to add the acid chloride to an excess of diazomethane. It is neither necessary, nor desirable to isolate the intermediate diazoketone. The overall yields for the three step sequence are usually in the region of 50-80&#x0025;. Examples of the application of the Arndt- Eistert homologation in synthesis include the preparation of norprogesterone and the conversion of &#x03B1;-amino acid derivatives to their &#x03B2;-amino acid analogues such as the &#x03B3;-glutamyl peptide
