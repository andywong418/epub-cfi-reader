<p class="noindent">In this chapter we must plunge yet again into the realm of arbitrary distinction in order to create this classification of <i>&#x2018;aromatic rearrangements&#x2019;.</i>Many of the reactions we will consider here are initiated by the generation of an <i>arenium ion</i> and involve migration either around the aromatic ring, or from a side chain onto the aromatic nucleus. In all cases the migration terminus is a position on an aromatic ring. Such reactions are initiated either by protonation or by a Lewis acid and are commonly a consequence of equilibration to form the thermodynamically most stable products.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Intramolecular migration is believed to occur <i>via</i>a &#x03C0;-complex which leads to equilibration between arenium ion species. The notation for &#x03C0;-complexes, as shown in the above reaction sequence, indicates that the electrophilic species is coordinated to the entire &#x03C0;-system and is positioned above the plane of the aromatic ring. The orbital interactions involve the lowest unoccupied orbital of the electrophilic partner (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the aromatic ring (benzene has two degenerate HOMOs). It is this extended<i> p</i>-system that provides the means for migration. In the case of alkyl group migration over the ring, the LUMO is a &#x03C3;-orbital and, as a result, asymmetric alkyl groups migrate with retention of tetrahedral geometry and hence their absolute stereochemistry.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">An intramolecular mechanism of rearrangement as outlined above is certainly attractive, but it is difficult to rule out a dissociation-reassociation<a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>process with certainty. The usual means of differentiation involves crossover experiments, but need not lead to valid results with aromatic rearrangements as the reactivities of the intermediate &#x03C0;-complexes and arenium ions are such as to permit additional intermolecular scrambling, despite the fact that the initiating reaction may be intramolecular.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Perhaps not surprisingly, the mechanism of arenium ion generation bears a close resemblance to the mechanism for electrophilic aromatic substitution, the two pathways differing in the way in which the initially generated arenium ion reacts. In electrophilic substitution H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is lost to regenerate the aromatic ring; whereas in the rearrangement the group migrates to generate a new arenium ion. Indeed, aromatic migrations may be considered formally to be intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution processes. Perhaps the best illustration of this relationship is to consider the Fries rearrangement, which is effectively the intramolecular variant of the Friedel-Crafts acylation. In both cases an acylium ion undergoes substitution into an aromatic substrate with the important difference that the acylium ion precursor in the Fries rearrangement is the aryl ester substrate itself.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Acid catalysed rearrangements around the aromatic ring</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Lewis acid catalysed equilibration of polyalkylbenzenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds is rarely a synthetically useful reacton, usually resulting in complex mixtures of polyalkylated materials as the initial alkylation products are more electron rich and hence more reactive than the starting materials. Nevertheless, in studies it was noted that Friedel-Crafts alkylations carried out under non-forcing conditions (mild catalysts, low temperatures) gave rise to so-called &#x2018;<i>normal</i>&#x2019; products in which the alkyl substituents bore 1,2- and 1,4-relationships to each other, in keeping with the known <i>ortho</i>/ <i>para-</i>directing effect of alkyl groups.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In contrast to this, it was found that use of higher temperatures and longer reaction periods gave rise to increasing quantities of 1,3- and 1,3,5-<a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>substituted materials. This changeover can be attributed to the equilibration of the initially formed products to form the thermodynamically most favoured products. For instance, heating 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-dimethylbenzene with catalytic quantities of HF-BF<sub>3 </sub>resulted in the formation of the same equilibrium mixture, in agreement with the proportions expected from a consideration of the relative stabilities of the three isomers</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_71_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The equilibration is set up by initial complexation of the Lewis acid,followed by methyl group migraton in the resultant complex with subsequent liberation of the Lewis acid to continue the reaction cycle.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_71_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, this is not the complete story as it was also found that use of higher concentrations of catalyst led to product mixtures in which the proportion of 1,3-dimethylbenzene approached 100&#x0025;.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_71_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka"> This effect is attributed to the fact that 1,3-dimethylbenzene is able to form stable complexes with the Lewis acid and is removed from the equilibration. Disproportionation to toluene and trimethylbenzenes was found not to compete under the reaction conditions indicating that the intramolecular rearrangement is energetically more favourable than dissociation- reassociation pathways. The same effect was also noticed with HBr-AlBr<sub>3</sub> as the catalyst system and with HF-BF<sub>3</sub> on trimethyl and tetramethylbenzenes.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_71_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>The Jacobsen rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">A complementary rearrangement to the Friedel-Crafts related reactions just considered occurs when polyalkylated and polyhalogenated benzenes are heated with concentrated sulphuric acid to give the sulphonic acid derivatives in which rearrangement of the substituents has occurred. As the sulphonic acid group may be removed by heating with aqueous acid, the overall process results in reorganisation of the original substrate.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_72_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although Herzig was the first to record the rearrangement of polyhalogenated benzenesulphonic acids in 1881, the mechanism is named after Oscar Jacobsen who described the reaction for polyalkylated benzenesuphonic acids in 1886. The brutality of the reaction conditions confines the application of the rearrangement to substrates possessing simple alkyl and halogen substituents and at least tetrasubstitution is necessary.However, within this limited substrate range, the Jacobsen rearrangement provides useful complementarity to the regiochemistry observed with Lewis acid promoted rearrangements. Whereas Lewis acids favour isomerisation to form 1,3-disubstituted and 1,3,5-trisubstituted systems, use of sulphuric acid results selectively in the formation of products in which the substituents have moved closer together leading to <i>vicinal</i> substitution.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The term <i>vicinal</i> is derived from the Latin <i>vicinalis</i>: neighbour.</p></aside>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:7em">
<img src="../images/page_72_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The term <i>ipso</i> is derived from the Latin for <i>itself</i> and refers to the fact that substitution occurs at a carbon already possessing a substituent.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reason for this complementarity becomes clear from a consideration of the probable reaction mechanism which involves <i>ipso</i>-sulphonation followed by intramolecular migration. This is believed to occur by a series of 1,2- nucleophilic shifts of the migrating group to give a rearranged arenium ion in which the sulphonate group is not destabilising the positive charge by resonance interactions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_72_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<a id="page_73" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 73, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">A particularly ready rearrangement of octahydroanthracene-9-sulphonic acid occurs to give the isomeric octahydrophenanthrene-9-sulphonic acid.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_73_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The dienone-phenol rearrangement detailed on page 28 shows a good deal of mechanistic analogy with the Jacobsen rearrangement.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Polyhalobenzenes do not undergo useful reaction on treatment with sulphuric acid, but halogenated polyalkylbenzenes often lead to rearrangement products in which the halogen has migrated selectively. For instance, 5- chloro- and 6-chloro-l,2,4-trimethylbenzenes are both converted to the same sulphonic acid by selective movement of the chlorine in each case.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Acid catalysed rearrangements from side chains onto the aromatic ring</h2>
<h3 class="h3">The Fries rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">This reaction involves the Lewis acid catalysed conversion of aryl esters to acyl phenols. Rearrangement to either the 2- or the 4-position may occur and it is sometimes possible to select conditions to favour the formation of one isomer.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_73_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The ratio of products depends upon the temperature, solvent, and concentration of catalyst. It is usually the case that low reaction temperatures favour migration to the 4-position <i>(para-</i>Fries) and high temperatures favour migration to the 2-position <i>(ortho-</i>Fries).</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_73_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<a id="page_74" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 74, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">It should always be borne in mind that, despite the fact that the Lewis acid is a catalyst for the reaction, the acyl phenols produced by the rearrangement form complexes with the Lewis acid and so it is necessary to use more than one equivalent of reagent to ensure maximum conversion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The acyl residue may be aromatic or aliphatic and esters possessing chains up to eighteen carbons long have been successfully rearranged. The relative rates of rearrangement of RCO have been shown to be in the order R &#x003D; alkyl &#x003E; benzyl &#x003E; cinnamyl &#x003E; phenyl. As the mechanism can be considered to be like an intramolecular electrophilic substitution process, electron withdrawing substitutents on the aromatic nucleus disfavour or totally block the reaction. For instance, rearrangement does not occur if the aromatic ring possesses a nitro-group at C-2 or C-4, or an acetyl group at C-4; while an acetyl group at C-2 severely inhibits it.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The mechanism of the Fries rearrangment has been much disputed, with contradictory evidence being produced to indicate that it is intermolecular <i>or</i> a dissociative intramolecular process <i>or</i> a true intramolecular migration.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_74_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Certainly crossover experiments using two different ester substrates in the same reaction vessel have shown scrambling in some instances, but not in others. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the harshness of the reaction conditions, it is difficult to decide whether these results are meaningful or not. Other investigations have involved carrying out rearrangements in an aromatic solvent and looking for acylation of the solvent. However, once again it is not possible to interpret lack of solvent acylation as evidence for an intramolecular process as this result may simply be a consequence of the lower reactivity of the solvent. We are therefore left in the rather unsatisfactory situation of not knowing exactly how the actual rearrangement process occurs.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Some examples of a reverse Fries reaction have been found and this provides evidence to support the view that selective <i>ortho</i>-Fries rearrangement at high temperatures is a consequence of equilibration <i>via</i> the ester to form the thermodynamically most stable 4-acylphenol. Indeed, 4-acylphenols may <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>be converted to 2-acylphenols on heating with aluminium chloride, although the intermediate ester has never been detected under these conditions.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_75_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although falling outside the area being covered in this book, it should be mentioned that a photochemical variant of the Fries rearrangement is known which has been shown spectroscopically to proceed <i>via</i> radical intermediates, the majority of which recombine before escaping their solvent cage.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Aryl ether rearrangement</h3>
<p class="noindent">By analogy with the Fries rearrangement, this reaction can be considered to be an intramolecular variant of the Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and it therefore should come as no surprise to learn that this isomerisation is synthetically much less useful than the Fries rearrangement.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em">
<img src="../images/page_75_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Dialkylphenols are common by-products from the reaction and, where possible, structural reorganisation of the alkyl side chain <i>via</i> 1,2-hydride migration occurs. The observation of dialkylphenols has been interpreted as indicative of a certain degree of intermolecularity but, conversely, the retention of some absolute stereochemistry during the migration of optically active alkyl groups provides evidence for intramolecular processes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>Claisen rearrangement</i>of allyl aryl ethers is normally carried out at elevated temperatures and proceeds <i>via</i> a concerted 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement followed by tautomerisation of the resultant cyclohexadienone to regain the aromatic nucleus.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_75_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, Bro&#x00A8;nsted and Lewis acids are known to catalyse this reaction, and under these conditions the rearrangement occurs after protonation or complexation of the substrate. This may involve a dissociative process, although, of course, a concerted sigmatropic rearrangement is still possible. The absence of crossover products or diallylated materials indicates that any dissociative process must involve tight ion pairs which recombine before diffusing away from each other.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<a id="page_76" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 76, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>
<img src="../images/page_76_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Acceleration is dramatic under these conditions and Lewis acid catalysed rearrangements may occur at temperatures as low as -50&#x00B0;C.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_76_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">The Hofmann-Martius reaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">The corresponding rearrangement of alkylarylamines occurs on heating the hydrochloride salts to above 200&#x00B0;C.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_76_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">This rearrangement undoubtedly occurs by an intermolecular process, as polyalkylated products may be isolated from the reaction mixtures, and primary alkyl side chains are invariably isomerised, indicative of 1,2-hydride migration taking place in the initially formed primary carbocations (pp. 30- 31). With primary alkyl groups, there is evidence that the mechanism involves formation of the alkyl halide, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the aromatic amine, as the ratio of 2- and 4-substitution products is dependent upon the halide counterion. A variant in which the alkylarylamine is heated with metal halides such as ZnCl<sub>2</sub> is sometimes referred to as the <i>Reilly-Hickinbottom rearrangement</i>, but this is restricted to primary alkyl groups as secondary and tertiary groups readily undergo eliminative cleavage.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Migrations of heteroatoms from nitrogen</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rearrangement of <i>N</i>-nitroarylamines on treatment with acid gives rise to the corresponding 2- and 4-nitro-derivatives.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_76_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The migration is probably an intramolecular process, as rearrangements in the presence of K<sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> show no incorporation of labelled nitrogen into the products. However, rearrangement of <i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N</i>-nitroaminobenzene gives appreciable quantities of <i>N</i>-methylaminobenzene and nitrous acid in addition to the expected 2- and 4-nitro-(<i>N</i>-methyl) aminobenzene and this points to a<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>dissociative process leading to solvent caged species. This combined evidence indicates that homolytic cleavage of the protonated substrate occurs to form a radical and radical cation in tight association.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although at first sight very similar to the acid catalysed rearrangement of <i>N</i>-nitroarylamines, the corresponding reaction of <i>N</i>-nitrosoarylamines, known as the <i>Fischer-Hepp</i> rearrangement shows two important differences. Only HC1 gives efficient rearrangement and, intriguingly, the 4-nitrosamines tend to be the exclusive products.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_77_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_77_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The preference for formation of 4-nitrosoarylamines would seem to indicate a dissociative process, but attempts to trap reactive intermediates such as nitrosyl chloride have been unsuccessful and so the mechanism of this rearrangement remains shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, the reaction is synthetically useful as it provides one of the few means of access to 4- nitroso-(<i>N</i>-alkyl)aminobenzenes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Aryl triazines also undergo acid catalysed rearrangement to form the corresponding 4-arylazo derivatives regioselectively; this time the reaction is probably intermolecular involving formation of ArN2<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_77_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Treatment of arylhydroxylamines with acids leads to the formation of 4-aminophenols in an intermolecular process known as the <i>Bamberger</i> <i>rearrangement.</i></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_77_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Evidence for the intermolecular nature of the reaction comes from competitive attack by other nucleophiles such as ethanol.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Isomerisation of <i>N</i>-halogenated <i>N</i>-arylamides to (4-haloaryl)amides on treatment with the corresponding acid HX is called the <i>Orton rearrangement.</i>It is commonly carried out on chloro- and bromo-amides.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_77_5.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<a id="page_78" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 78, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The fact that free halogen may be detected in the reaction mixture together with the evidence from crossover reactions has led to the proposal that the mechanism proceeds by reaction of HX with the haloamide to liberate the halogen and ArNHCOR. This then undergoes electrophilic substitution, predominantly at C-4 of the aromatic nucleus, possibly as a consequence of steric hindrance by the <i>N</i>-acyl group.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Fischer indole synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Treatment of arylhydrazones with Lewis or Bro&#x00A8;nsted acids (commonly ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) results in formation of an indole with elimination of ammonia. It is not necessary to isolate the hydrazone and the reaction is very general as long as the starting carbonyl is of the form R<sup>1</sup>(CO)CH<sub>2</sub>R<sup>2</sup>&#x2019;.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_78_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Hidden in this very useful method for constructing indoles is a polar rearrangement akin to the acid catalysed Claisen rearrangement, although nothing is known about the degree of concertedness or otherwise of this step.</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The benzidine rearrangement</h2>
<p class="noindent">Heating N,N&#x00B4;-diarylhydrazines (commonly referred to as hydrazobenzenes) with acids causes them to rearrange to form mixtures of 4,4&#x00B4;- and 2,4&#x00B4;- diaminobiaryls (<b><i>benzidines</i></b>, from which the rearrangement takes its name). The 4,4&#x00B4;-isomer usually predominates unless one or both of the 4- and 4&#x00B4;- positions of the diarylhydrazine are already substituted, although if these substituents are SO<sub>3</sub>H, CO<sub>2</sub>H or halogen the substituent may be displaced.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_78_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<a id="page_79" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 79, Acid catalysed aromatic rearrangements</a>
<p class="indent3-ka">Other less commonly encountered side products of this reaction include the 2,2&#x00B4;-diaminobiaryl and 2&#x00B4;-and 4&#x00B4;-aminoarylanilines, the latter sometimes being referred to as <b><i>semidines.</i></b></p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_79_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Another side reaction is <i>oxido-reductive disproportionation</i> of the diarylhydrazine to form ArNH<sub>2 </sub>and ArN&#x003D;NAr.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction mechanism has been the subject of exhaustive investigation and several possibilities have been proposed, only to be discarded when new evidence came to light. The theory that a dissociative mechanism was operative could be ruled out by crossover experiments and the proposal that the semidines were intermediates in the reaction was conclusively discarded by the demonstration that the semidines cannot be converted into the diaminobiaryls under the reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A useful pointer to the mechanism came from kinetic studies. Whilst first order in hydrazine, the mechanism may be first or second order in H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Some substrates were found to be first order in H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> at low acidity and second order at high acidity and to show fractional order at intermediate acidity. These data implicate the involvement of monoprotonated and diprotonated species in the rearrangement step. Conclusive information was obtained using isotopically labelled substrates to demonstrate that the two major diaminobiaryl products were the result of different pathways. With di-<sup>15</sup>N-labelled substrate, the kinetic isotope effect for formation of the 4,4&#x00B4;-diaminobiaryl was 1.002; whereas for the 2,4&#x00B4;-diaminobiaryl it was 1.063. The observation of the kinetic isotope effects shows that cleavage of the N-N bond is involved in the rate determining step in each case, but the fact that they have different values proves that two different cleavage processes must be occurring. In addition, the use of 4,4&#x00B4;-di-<sup>14</sup>C-labelled diphenylhydrazine gave an observable kinetic isotope effect of 1.028 for the formation of 4,4&#x00B4;-diaminobiphenyl indicating that C-C bond formation was also occurring in the rate determining step. These results can all be encompassed by the proposal that reaction occurs by means of a concerted 5,5-sigmatropic rearrangement of either the monoprotonated or diprotonated species.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_79_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although the scheme above shows the diprotonated species being formed prior to rearrangement, the second protonation step may take place during the rearrangement.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">It is believed that C-C bond formation is not involved in the rate determining step for formation of the 2,4&#x2019;-diaminobiaryl product but little more is known of the mechanism at this stage.</p>
