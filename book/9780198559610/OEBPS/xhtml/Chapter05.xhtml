<h2 class="main"><b>5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Element halides</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The halides are the first class of compound we shall look at in detail and it will soon be clear that it is a large and diverse group particularly in terms of the variety of structural types encountered. Many of the ideas which we develop here will also be of use when looking at other classes of compound and we shall start with a broad overview of the basic structural types.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall look first at the fluorides of the s- and p-block elements in their highest, or group, oxidation states; these are shown in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a> together with a classification based on the type of structure they adopt under ambient conditions.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">The fluorides of nitrogen, oxygen, krypton and xenon such as NF<sub>3</sub>, OF<sub>2</sub>, KrF<sub>2</sub> and XeF<sub>6</sub> are not shown in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a> since the elements in these compounds are not in their highest or group oxidation state.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">We note first that the formulae are of the form EX<i><sub>n</sub></i> where n = 1&#x2013;7 according to the group and that there is a definite progression from ionic materials in the bottom left of the table to molecular covalent species in the top right, with polymeric or macromolecular solids forming an approximately diagonal band in between. We can account for this general arrangement in a straightforward manner by considering the electronegativity differences, &#x0394;&#x03C7;, between the elements and we shall look at each in turn.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-22em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">A word of caution is necessary concerning electronegativities. In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, we discussed electronegativity in some detail and quoted values derived from the work of Pauling and Allen. These values, especially from the latter, are neutral atom electronegativities and we can expect that the actual values will change according to the oxidation state of the element in a particular molecule. We will look at this matter again in more detail later, but it is reasonable to suppose that element electronegativity will increase with increasing oxidation state. Thus whilst tellurium and iodine have neutral atom electronegativities considerably less than fluorine, in the &#x002B;6 and &#x002B;7 oxidation states respectively, their electronegativities will be much more comparable. Indeed, this idea is embodied in the Pauling electroneutrality principle which states that in molecules, atomic charges are never more than &#x00B1;1.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table (with the exception of some of the noble gases which are rather special cases). Thus, in forming complexes with the electropositive elements on the left of the periodic table, particularly those near the bottom left, there will be a considerable degree of charge transfer resulting in the formation of the negatively-charged fluoride anion, F<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, and a positively-charged element cation, E<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (more generally E<i><sup>n</sup></i> <sup>&#x002B;</sup> where n is the number of valence electrons). The resulting materials formed are therefore ionic and adopt solid, three-dimensional <a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>structures, or lattices, in which cations are surrounded by anions and vice versa. The bonding is predominantly electrostatic in nature, the lattice being held together largely as a result of the opposite charges on the ions. In general, this type of bonding is fairly strong and ionic solids are characterized by having high melting and boiling points and by dissolving only in polar solvents such as water. Typical ionic structures are those of sodium fluoride and calcium difluoride shown in <a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>.</p>

<b>Fig. 5.1</b> Diagramatic representations of the structures of (a) sodium fluoride, NaF, and (b) calcium difluoride, CaF<sub>2</sub>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we look now at the molecular covalent species in the top right of <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>, it is clear that all are compounds formed by elements with a similar electronegativity to fluorine.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Note that although the electronegativity differences, &#x0394;&#x03C7;, between the elements is small, the absolute values, &#x03A3;&#x03C7;, are large and so we are dealing with covalent molecules rather than metallic species.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The result is that there is only a small degree of charge transfer on bond formation and the element&#x2013;fluorine bonds are relatively non-polar, covalent bonds. Thus, there is little or no aggregation between molecules and the compounds are typically gases, low boiling liquids or low melting solids which are soluble in non-polar solvents. Some examples are shown <a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The intermediate class of compound, labelled polymeric in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>, consists of those in which the atoms have a medium difference in electronegativity. The difference is not sufficient for the formation of ions and ionic bonding, but the covalent bonds formed are quite polar with large partial positive and negative charges, i.e. &#x03B4;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> E&#x2013;F &#x03B4;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. The effect of this in the solid state is that bridging interactions tend to occur between atoms of opposite charge leading to polymeric or macromolecular structures. Whilst aggregation or polymerization is a consequence of charge separation or polar bonds we should not assume that the resulting intermolecular interactions between the putative monomers are entirely electrostatic. All of the bonding is predominantly covalent and we can think of it as arising from the polymerization of monomers, a requirement for which is the presence of low-lying vacant orbitals. These may be vacant primary valence orbitals, as in group 13 chemistry, or other types of orbital the nature of which we will address in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. An example is the structure of SbF5 shown <a href="#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>, which exists in a linear polymeric form in the liquid state and as tetramers in the solid.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Electronegativity differences are not the only factor which determine the type of structure adopted. For example, aluminium trifluoride, AIF<sub>3</sub>, is polymeric whereas silicon tetrafluoride, SiF4, is a monomer, and yet aluminium and silicon have very similar electronegativities and therefore similar electronegativity differences with fluorine. The main reason why AIF<sub>3</sub> is polymeric is due to the presence of a vacant orbital on the aluminium centre (in the monomer; we shall encounter a rather similar situation with the boron hydrides) which results in the facile formation of extra bonds (in this case three extra bonds since in solid AIF<sub>3</sub> each aluminium is surrounded by an octahedron of fluorines; we may consider the bonding here to be multicentre covalent or approaching ionic).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">A word should be said here about polarization and polarizability. Simple definitions will suffice in that a small highly charged cation will be strongly polarizing such that it will tend to strongly attract electrons towards itself, whereas a large, singly charged cation will be weakly polarizing. Conversely, a large anion will be easily polarized, i.e. its electron density will be easily distorted, whereas a small anion will be less easily polarized (these ideas will be relevant later when we look at acids and bases). In the case of ionic compounds, the combination of a strongly polarizing cation and an easily polarized anion leads to increasing covalency as illustrated by the examples below.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">It should not be assumed that the above three classes of compound are completely distinct from each other since we cannot categorize bonds as simply ionic, polar covalent or covalent; all bonds lie on a continuum from highly ionic to purely covalent. There is certainly some overlap and occasional resulting ambiguity but the categories are useful nevertheless.</p>
<p class="indent">So far we have seen that the broad classification of the element fluorides, at least for elements in their highest oxidation states, can largely be rationalized on the basis of electronegativity differences, &#x0394;&#x03C7;. We shall now look at some of the lower oxidation state fluorides and see how these ideas can be developed to understand their structures as well.</p>
<p class="indent">There are no stable lower oxidation state fluorides in group 2, but in group 13 we encounter examples &#x201E;of boron(II) and thallium(I), B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> and TlF respectively. The former is molecular covalent and the latter ionic in accord with their electronegativity differences. Furthermore, it is interesting to compare the thallium halides TIF<sub>3</sub> and TIF. We should expect the former to be &#x2018;more covalent&#x2019; than the latter, i.e. TlF should be the most ionic, since the Tl(III) cation will be much more polarizing than the Tl(I) cation and in this sense, the Tl(III) cation is more electronegative than the Tl(I) cation (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.5">Section 2.5</a> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). Whilst this resulting difference in &#x0394;&#x03C7; for Tl(III)F3 and Tl(I)F (the latter being larger) is not obviously reflected in the structures and physical properties of the solids, it is noteworthy that TlF<sub>3</sub> hydrolyses readily in water to give Tl(OH)<sub>3</sub> and HF whereas TlF dissolves to give aquated ions, the latter being a feature typical of metals.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 14 the other common oxidation state is &#x002B;2, at least for the heavier elements, and the element difluorides and tetrafluorides are interesting classes of compounds which offer a useful illustration of the concepts we have developed so far to rationalize structure. Recall (<a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>) that GeF4 is molecular covalent whereas SnF<sub>4</sub> and PbF<sub>4</sub> are polymeric. We can partly rationalize this observation on the basis of electronegativity differences but we should also note that the larger tin and lead atoms are also better able to support larger coordination numbers (four for Ge in GeF<sub>4</sub> and six for Sn and Pb in SnF<sub>4</sub> and PbF<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">GeF<sub>2</sub>, in contrast to GeF<sub>4</sub>, is polymeric and we can also use the idea of electronegativity differences to account for this observation (in part) if we consider that Ge(II) is likely to be less electronegative than Ge(IV) since, as <a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>mentioned in general above, a Ge(IV) centre will be more polarizing, and hence more electronegative, than a Ge(II) centre. We commented on a similar situation for Tl(III) vs. Tl(I), but the consequences are more dramatic here since the polarity of the Ge&#x2013;F bond in GeF<sub>2</sub> is now sufficiently large to result in a polymeric structure, whereas in GeF<sub>4</sub>, the polarity is small enough for a covalent molecular structure to be favoured.</p>

<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Clearly polarizability and electronegativity are closely related terms.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We should therefore expect that for the fluorides of a given element (and, as we shall see, element halides and oxides in general), there will be a trend from covalent to polymeric to ionic as the central element oxidation state, and hence electronegativity, decreases. This is illustrated not so much with SnF<sub>2</sub> which is also polymeric, but with PbF<sub>2</sub> which adopts typically ionic structures; the a form is analogous to BaCl<sub>2</sub> and the &#x03B2; form has the fluorite structure, the coordination numbers around the lead atom being nine and eight respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, whilst electronegativity differences <i>are</i> a significant factor, we must not overstate their importance, or ignore other factors such as element size and the nature of any vacant orbitals which are present. Thus, GeF<sub>2</sub> is also more likely to be polymeric than GeF<sub>4</sub>, since the former is only two-coordinate (as a monomer, and clearly coordinatively unsaturated) whereas the latter is four-coordinate. This factor coupled with the larger size of Ge(II) vs. Ge(IV) would enable Ge(II) to expand its coordination number, i.e. polymerize, more readily than Ge(IV). Furthermore, the presence of a vacant p orbital in monomeric GeF<sub>2</sub> would make this species particularly acidic and therefore prone to polymerisation; the analogy between AlF3 and SiF<sub>4</sub> mentioned earlier is relevant here and we will return to this matter again in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. Another factor to note is that whilst monomeric GeF<sub>4</sub> is tetrahedral and has no dipole moment, monomeric GeF<sub>2</sub>, for which a bent structure is expected, would have a dipole moment which would facilitate aggregation.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Note that coordination numbers are generally lower for lower oxidation states. In polymeric GeF<sub>2</sub>, the germanium atom is only three-coordinate whilst in monomeric GeF<sub>4</sub> it is four-coordinate. This is a result of the presence of a lone pair of electrons in the former which occupies one of the valence orbitals leaving only three for bonding (formally two normal Ge&#x2013;F bonds and one dative F &#x2192; Ge bond in this case).</p></aside>
<p class="indent">In group 15 all elements have a stable trifluoride for which we see the expected progression in structural types. Thus NF<sub>3</sub>, PF<sub>3</sub> and AsF<sub>3</sub> are all molecular whereas SbF<sub>3</sub> is polymeric. BiF<sub>3</sub> is best described as ionic and contrasts with the polymeric BiF<sub>5</sub>, this observation again being consistent with the lower electronegativity and polarizing power of Bi(III) vs. Bi(V).</p>
<p class="indent">In group 16 there are three common oxidation states and in addition to <small>SF</small><sub>6</sub><small>, </small>the fluorides SF<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> (two isomers), S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, SF<sub>4</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub> are also known, all of which are molecular. The chemistry of selenium is more limited and, besides SeF<sub>6</sub>, only SeF<sub>4</sub> is stable. Selenium tetrafluoride is molecular and has the same structure as SF<sub>4</sub> but the analogous tellurium compound, TeF<sub>4</sub>, is polymeric with a structure shown in <a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>, the only fluoride of group 17 was IF<sub>7</sub> since this is the only known neutral interhalogen compound with a central element in the formal &#x002B;7 oxidation state; there are no group 18 halides in the &#x002B;8 oxidation state. We should note, however, that a number of neutral lower oxidation state group 17 and 18 fluorides are known. Examples are EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>5</sub> (E = Cl, Br, I) and XeF<i><sub>n</sub></i> (<i>n</i> = 2, 4, 6) all of which are molecular; ClF<sub>3</sub> is shown in <a href="#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>.<a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a></p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent">Before moving on to look at other halide compounds we should again stress the tendency of elements to form polymeric fluorides as groups are descended which results from increasing electronegativity differences and from the fact that element sizes are increasing.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">In line with the work of Gillespie discussed on pages 22 and 51 in terms of an ionic model for most element fluorides, to talk about top right element fluorides as containing non-polar E&#x2013;F bonds may be rather inaccurate. The molecular nature of these compounds would then be traced to the fact that the small element centres are essentially coordinatively saturated which prevents polymerisation.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Let us now consider compounds formed by the other halides. We should expect, since chlorine, bromine and iodine are less electronegative than fluorine, that there will be fewer ionic compounds formed and that there will also be a trend towards compounds with intermetallic or metallic alloy properties as we shall see with some of the iodides.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="tab5.2">

<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Only selected chlorides are shown in <a href="#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a>. Chlorides in the group oxidation state are indicated where these are known together with some common lower oxidation state species, but a number of other low oxidation state or sub-chlorides such as <small>B</small><sub>8</sub><small>C</small>l<sub>8</sub><small> </small>and related compounds are not shown.</p></aside>
<p class="indent"><a href="#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a> lists the common chlorides of the s- and p-block elements although in contrast to <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>, the lower oxidation state complexes are included as well, since the number of known chlorides of the elements in their group oxidation state is not large particularly for the right-hand side elements. This trend is even more marked for the bromides and iodides and is a result of the fact that the heavier halides become progressively easier to <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>oxidize and are therefore correspondingly less able to stabilize high formal oxidation states.</p>
<p class="indent">The chlorides of groups 1 and 2 are ionic as expected with the exception of BeCl2 which has a chloride-bridged, linear polymeric structure as shown in <a href="#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In group 13, TlCI<sub>3</sub> can be considered as ionic, but we should also include in this classification the monochlorides of thallium and indium. Both have typically ionic-type structures; TlCl has the CsCl structure and InCl has a distorted NaCl structure. Note that in the former structure the Tl(I) cation is eight-coordinate whereas in InCl the indium is six-coordinate. These differences undoubtedly reflect the larger size of Tl(I) vs. In(I).</p>

<p class="indent">The solid-state structures of AlCl<sub>3</sub>, GaCl<sub>3</sub> and InCl<sub>3</sub> are probably best described as polymeric. This is certainly the case for AlCl<sub>3</sub> which adopts a layer structure with six-coordinate aluminium centres, but for the trichlorides of gallium and indium the description is a little strained in that these compounds exist as dimers in the solid state (<a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>). In contrast to the heavier congeners, BCl<sub>3</sub> is monomeric probably as a result of appreciable B&#x2013;Cl &#x03C0;-bonding. We noted in the previous chapter that &#x03C0; bond energies are often substantial where first row elements are involved and this is the likely explanation for the monomeric character of all the boron trihalides. The polymeric nature of the halides of the heavier congeners reflects a tendency for single bond formation, achieved in this instance by halide bridge formation, and the larger size of the elements means they are more able to support a larger coordination number.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 14, the tetrachlorides of carbon, silicon, germanium and tin are all molecular whereas the dichlorides of tin and lead (PbCl<sub>4</sub> is not stable) are polymeric. A view of the polymeric structure of SnCl<sub>2</sub>, illustrating the three-coordination at tin and the presence of the lone pairs, is shown in <a href="#fig5.8">Fig. 5.8</a> and we note again the change from molecular to polymeric resulting from the change in oxidation state of the central element. Recall that a similar transition from one structural type to another was observed for GeF<sub>4</sub> vs. GeF<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">All of the chlorides of group 15 can be described as molecular but there is an interesting point to make regarding PCl<sub>5</sub> which is ionic in the solid state, not as a result of the formation of naked phosphorus cations and chloride anions, but due to chloride exchange which affords the salt &#x005B;PCl<sub>4</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x005B;PCl<sub>6</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. A similar situation is found for the phosphorus bromide PBr<sub>5</sub> which exists as &#x005B;PBr<sub>4</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Br<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. This ionization is not so much a result of particularly polar P&#x2013;Cl or P&#x2013;Br bonds but rather, is probably due to the significant lattice energy which results from the formation of an ionic solid, this being <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>considerably larger than any van der Waals interaction between neutral molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">In groups 16 and 17 the chlorides SCl<sub>2</sub> and BrCl are molecular whilst SeCl<sub>4</sub>, TeCl<sub>4</sub> and ICl<sub>3</sub> are polymeric. For the latter three compounds, oligomeric might be a better description since the former two are tetrameric and ICl<sub>3</sub> exists as the dimer I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> the structures of which are shown in <a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">We will not dwell on the structures of the element bromides and iodides since the same general rules which we have encountered for fluorides and chlorides apply equally well for the heavier congeners. There is a general trend towards less ionic structures, as we might expect, and the number of stable compounds in the group oxidation state becomes progressively less, due partly to the fact that bromide and iodide are more readily oxidized and for other reasons discussed in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The structural differences between CO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> are consistent with the respective electronegativity differences between C/O and Si/O, the greater difference being between silicon and oxygen, but this represents only part of the explanation. CO<sub>2</sub> is a linear molecule containing two-coordinate carbon in which strong C&#x2013;O &#x03C0;-bonding plays an important r&#x00F4;le. On the basis of the discussion in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3.3">Section 4.3.3</a> on multiple bonds, this is not surprising, but we would expect that whereas for carbon, a C=O double bond is stronger than two C&#x2013;O single bonds (2 &#x00D7; 335 vs. 715 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, Table 4.9), the opposite will be true for silicon oxygen bonds such that silicon will prefer to form two Si&#x2013;O single bonds rather than one Si=O double bond (2 &#x00D7; 420 vs. 590 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, Table 4.9). The putative SiO<sub>2</sub> molecule would therefore be expected to polymerize to give a macromolecular solid with four-coordinate silicon and two-coordinate oxygens in which all Si&#x2013;O bonds are single; this is exactly what is found in the majority of the polymorphs of SiO<sub>2</sub>. We should also consider the relative sizes of the elements as well; thus the larger <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>silicon atom is better able to accommodate the larger coordination number, i.e. four vs. two (six-coordinate silicon is also known).</p>
<p class="indent">Germanium dioxide has a structural chemistry that is very similar to that of silicon dioxide which is not surprising in view of the similar size and electronegativity of the two elements. In contrast, the structures of tin and lead (one polymorph) dioxide are of the rutile type in which the metal atoms are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms. Other polymorphs of PbO<sub>2</sub> also feature octahedrally coordinated lead and in all cases this increased coordination number of Sn and Pb vs. Ge and Si can be traced to the larger size of the atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of tin monoxide (<a href="#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>) consists of a planar sheet of oxygens with squares of oxygens alternately capped by tin atoms; the structure of lead monoxide is isomorphous. The lower coordination number of the tin atom (vs. that in SnO<sub>2</sub>) results from the presence of the lone pair of electrons associated with the tin(II) centre (cf. the halides) which presumably resides at the apex of the square pyramid defined by the tin and four oxygen atoms. This structure is sometimes classified as ionic, but the layer or two-dimensional aspect is better described as polymeric since ionic structures are generally more three-dimensional in nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The structures of the oxides of the group 15 elements follow a rather similar pattern. Thus all the oxides of nitrogen are molecular covalent, feature strong N&#x2013;O &#x03C0;-bonding and have coordination numbers around the nitrogen atoms which do not exceed three. The structures are shown in <a href="#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent">In contrast, none of the molecular nitrogen oxides have any counterpart in phosphorus chemistry (except as high temperature species). The combination of increased electronegativity difference, much weaker P=O &#x03C0;-bonding and the larger size of the phosphorus atom all favour polymeric forms exactly as seen in group 14. The common oxides of phosphorus are P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, the structures of which are shown in <a href="#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>. The term oligomeric might be more appropriate although only one phase of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> contains discrete molecules; two others are also known which comprise two- and three-dimensional macromolecular structures although still based on PO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra sharing three vertices.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxides E<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of arsenic and antimony both have phases containing molecular E<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> units analogous to P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> but also exist in polymeric forms consisting of edge-sharing EO<sub>3</sub> pyramids. Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in contrast, is exclusively polymeric in which the larger bismuth atom attains coordination numbers of <a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>five in a variety of polymorphs. The pentavalent oxides of arsenic, antimony and bismuth are less well characterized but are certainly polymeric and contain elements with octahedral coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxides of the group 16 elements provide another interesting series which illustrates the effects of element size, electronegativity differences and multiple bonding. The elemental forms of oxygen (i.e. the oxides&#x2019; of oxygen) are O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for both of which multiple bonding is important with concomitant low coordination numbers. With sulfur, the similar electronegativity to oxygen favours the formation of molecular covalent species but the relatively small size of the sulfur atom means that &#x03C0;-bonding is still fairly strong since orbital overlap is good. As a consequence, the most important oxide of sulfur, SO<sub>2</sub>, is not only molecular covalent but also contains S&#x2013;O &#x03C0;-bonding. The other main oxide is SO<sub>3</sub> which is molecular in the gas phase, but exists as a cyclotrimer in the solid &#x03B3;-phase or as a helical polymer in the &#x03B2;-phase; these structures are shown in <a href="#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent">It is worth commenting on why SO<sub>2</sub> is exclusively monomeric whereas SO<sub>3</sub>, in the solid state, is polymeric since this would appear to be at odds with what we observed for the germanium fluorides, GeF<sub>2</sub> and GeF<sub>4</sub>, i.e. that the lower oxidation states are the ones which tend to polymerize. For SO<sub>3</sub>, a possible explanation is that the presence of three electron-withdrawing oxygens around the sulfur in SO<sub>3</sub> induces a sufficiently large &#x03B4;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> charge at the sulfur centre to promote oligomerization and that the coordination number is readily increased from three to four. In effect, the sulfur in SO<sub>3</sub> is coordinatively unsaturated whereas the germanium centre in GeF<sub>4</sub> is not. In this regard, we may note that trigonal planar, three-coordination is unusual for sulfur. The reason why GeF<sub>2</sub> polymerizes whereas SO<sub>2</sub> does not is probably a consequence of the much more polar bonds in the former. We may note also that SiO3<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> and PO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>, which are isoelectronic (having the same number of electrons) with SO<sub>3</sub>, are exclusively polymeric in the solid state in contrast to their lighter congeners CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2013;</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> which are always monomeric; size effects are important here together with the stability of multiple bonding when first row elements are involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Selenium dioxide, SeO<sub>2</sub>, in contrast to SO<sub>2</sub> is polymeric with a linear zig-zag structure shown in <a href="#fig5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>. We should note that weaker &#x03C0;-bonding and the larger size of the selenium atom are the likely reasons for this difference; the electronegativity difference between the elements is very small.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We should note that GeF<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are isoelectronic, with respect to their valence electrons, and that the bond polarity argument is probably quite appropriate in this case. Germanium is also larger than sulfur but this is unlikely to be important here in view of the ease with which sulfur becomes four-coordinate (as with &#x03B2;- and &#x03B3;-SO<sub>3</sub>). Note that whilst conventional electron counting procedures would assign GeF<sub>2</sub> a vacant orbital, this would not be the case with SO<sub>2</sub>.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">Tellurium dioxide is also polymeric although the coordination number of the tellurium atoms in the various polymorphs which are known, is four, and all Te&#x2013;O bonds are single. Polonium dioxide has the fluorite structure in which the Po atoms are eight-coordinate and the structure can be described as <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a>ionic. Note that the dioxides of group 16 clearly illustrate the trend to larger coordination numbers as the group is descended; two for SO<sub>2</sub>, three for SeO<sub>2</sub>, four for TeO<sub>2</sub> and eight for PoO<sub>2</sub>, and the trend from covalent molecules through polymeric structures to an ionic compound.</p>
<p class="indent">The higher oxidation state oxides are SeO<sub>3</sub> and TeO<sub>3</sub> and both are polymeric; the former is a cyclotetramer (in contrast to cyclotrimeric SO<sub>3</sub>) whereas the latter consists of TeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing all vertices to give a three-dimensional lattice.</p>

<p class="noindent">A structural classification of the s- and p-block hydrides is shown in <a href="#tab5.4">Table 5.4</a> and the general patterns which we have seen for the halides and oxides are also apparent here. With the exception of BeH<sub>2</sub>, the hydrides of groups 1 and 2 all adopt typically ionic structures and also have lattice energies broadly consistent with predominantly ionic bonding. The exceptions to this are the hydrides of the lighter elements such as LiH and MgH<sub>2</sub> which have some degree of co valency, although this is to be expected in view of the high polarizing power of these small cations and the high polarizability of the hydride anion.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="tab5.4">

</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">The ionic radius of the hydride anion, H<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is rather variable depending on its environment but is usually placed between bromide and iodide. Thus it is quite large and this reflects the relative ineffectiveness of a single proton to hold onto two electrons and the resulting dominance of interelectron repulsions. It is therefore not surprising that the hydride anion is easily polarized.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Beryllium hydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>, is best described as polymeric and adopts a linear structure in the solid state with bridging hydrides (similar to BeCl<sub>2</sub>), the extreme polarizing ability of the hypothetical Be<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion would make the ionic model inappropriate here in contrast to the hydrides of the heavier group 2 metals.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 13, the hydrides are also polymeric although we must be a little careful here in the use of electronegativity arguments (cf. AlF<sub>3</sub> earlier). Boron forms a very large array of binary hydrides which can only be satisfactorily described in terms of delocalized, multicentre bonding; we shall just look at the simplest hydride, BH<sub>3</sub>. Borane is a gas under ambient conditions and exists as a dimer diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which has the hydride-bridged structure shown in <a href="#fig5.18">Fig. 5.18</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 5 Compounds of the s- and p-block elements</a></p>
<p class="indent">We can stretch our use of the word polymer to a dimer if we wish (we did for I<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>), but it is important to realize that the dimerization is mostly a consequence of the presence of a vacant orbital on the boron centre rather than any difference in electronegativity between the elements. In fact boron and hydrogen have very similar electronegativities (2.04 and 2.02 respectively on the Pauling scale) and therefore relatively non-polar B&#x2013;H bonds. A similar situation is found for gallane which is isostructural with diborane, and for similar reasons; the Pauling electronegativity of gallium is 1.81.</p>
<p class="indent">Binary, neutral hydrides of indium and thallium are not well characterized as a result of the extreme weakness of the covalent In&#x2013;H and Tl&#x2013;&#x0397; bonds; a factor in common with the hydrides of all the heavier p-block elements. Aluminium hydride is a volatile solid under ambient conditions which can certainly be described as polymeric since it exists as a three-dimensional, hydrogen-bridged lattice. This undoubtedly does reflect the electronegativity difference between the elements which is large enough for a polymeric structure to be expected, although the vacant aluminium 3p orbitals are also important.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">AlH<sub>3</sub> has some properties in common with some of the s-block hydrides such that an ionic description is sometimes prefered. Indeed, the a-form is isostructural with AlF<sub>3</sub>.</p></aside>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Downs and Pulham (<i>Chem.Soc.Rev</i>., (1994), 175) have argued that whilst the weakness of the E&#x2013;H bonds of the heavier p-block hydrides is an important factor regarding their stability, it is not the whole story since many of the s-block hydrides actually have weaker E&#x2013;H bonds than some of the heavier hydrides of groups 13 and 14. Also important is the strength of the bridging E&#x2013;H&#x2013;E interactions. These are strong for the s-block hydrides since they are essentially ionic in nature, but are much weaker in group 13, for example, where they are more covalent and decrease down the group.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The hydrides of group 14, and indeed of all subsequent groups, are all molecular covalent. Methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is the simplest hydride of carbon but there are an essentially limitless number of higher hydrocarbons in which catenation or carbon&#x2013;carbon bonds are present. Silane, SiH<sub>4</sub>, and germane, GeH<sub>4</sub>, are the prototypical hydrides of silicon and germanium although the higher catenated congeners are generally less stable than for carbon, this being particularly the case for germanium. The tin and lead hydrides, SnH<sub>4</sub>. and PbH<sub>4</sub>, are considerably less stable, which again reflects the weaker heavier-element-to-hydrogen bonds; catenated compounds are particularly unstable, being unknown for lead. It is also worth noting that tin(II) and lead(II) hydrides are unknown, particularly in view of the importance of this oxidation state in the chemistry of these elements, especially lead. This is analogous to the situation noted earlier for the lead alkyls. Part of the reason for the instability of the heavier p-block hydrides is the poor overlap between the orbitals of these elements and the 1s orbital of hydrogen. For tin(IV) and lead(IV), there is sufficient overlap for marginal stability but this is not the case for the larger tin(II) and lead(II) with bigger and more diffuse orbitals.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 15, the trihydride, EH<sub>3</sub>, is known for all elements with stability decreasing down the group for reasons already discussed; only for nitrogen and phosphorus are higher hydrides involving catenation known such as N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (hydrazine) and P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Conspicuous by their absence are any stable hydrides of the higher &#x002B;5 oxidation state which is probably partly due to the fact that hydride is fairly readily oxidized and is therefore not compatible with elements in high formal oxidation states. Another important additional factor, however, is that the weaker element&#x2013;hydrogen bonds which would be expected for a pentavalent hydride would probably result in the reaction shown in <a href="#eq5.1">Eqn 5.1</a> being quite exothermic being driven, in part, by the strong H&#x2013;H bond.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">As with the alkyls, the disproportionation reaction 2PbH<sub>2</sub> &#x2192; Pb &#x002B; PbH<sub>4</sub> is calculated to be exothermic.</p></aside>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Much of the instability of element hydrides discussed in this section may be traced, in part, to the strength of the H&#x2013;H bond and its influence on the thermodynamics of compound decomposition.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">The group 16 hydrides are EH<sub>2</sub> (now usually written as H<sub>2</sub>E) and again stability decreases down the group; H<sub>2</sub>Po is not stable under ambient conditions. The only stable catenated hydride in this group is hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and hydrides of the higher &#x002B;4 and &#x002B;6 oxidation states are unknown as in group 15.</p>
<p class="indent">Group 17 is characterized by the hydrogen halides, HE (usually HX), with no higher oxidation state hydrides, and there are no stable hydrides of the group 18 elements.</p>
<p class="indent">We will finish this section with a brief discussion of the physical nature of the element hydrides of groups 14 and 16. As shown in <a href="#tab5.4">Table 5.4</a>, they are all molecular covalent species but the trends in melting and boiling points are worth commenting upon. In group 14, we see a progression to higher melting and boiling points as the group is descended resulting from the increasing van der Waals forces between the molecules. This is also largely the case for the group 16 hydrides with the obvious exception of H<sub>2</sub>O. The explanation for this feature is the extensive hydrogen bonding between oxygen lones pairs and hydrogen, this being that much greater for the lighter element due to its high electronegativity. Values for all compounds are shown in <a href="#fig5.19">Fig. 5.19</a>. The values for the group 15 elements show a similar trend to those of group 16 as a result of the importance of hydrogen bonding in NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
