<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We should recognise at the outset that the modem form of the periodic table was originally deduced (by Mendeleev and others) from empirical chemical relationships between the elements and that a theoretical understanding came later.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent">An understanding of the structure or form of the periodic table is essential if we are ever to understand periodicity and for this it is necessary to know something about atomic structure or how electrons behave in atoms. In this chapter we shall examine this topic in some detail and show how these ideas are useful in explaining why the periodic table has the form it does. More detailed treatments of this subject can be found in many of the inorganic chemistry textbooks listed in the bibliography although it will be evident from many of these texts that this topic is often dealt with in quite a mathematical way. Wave-equations and the like are, of course, mathematical by their very nature and a <i>full</i> understanding and appreciation of this subject cannot be had in the absence of a mathematical treatment. However, the basic ideas can be presented and understood using a descriptive and pictorial approach and this is the one we shall adopt. This necessarily involves many <i>ad hoc</i> assumptions and statements but we will not suffer unduly because of this, perhaps quite the reverse&#x0021;</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A non-mathematical but more detailed treatment of this subject can be found in Winter (1993). A more empirical, introductory approach, which is also non-mathematical, has been discussed by Gillespie <i>et al J.Chem.Educ.</i>, (1996), <b>73</b>,617.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Original ideas on atomic structure, which were developed in the early part of this century (after it was deduced that atoms had any structure at all), consisted of a positively charged &#x2018;cloud&#x2019; with embedded, negatively charged, particle-like electrons. This was soon superceded, however, by the Rutherford model in which a central, positively charged nucleus, containing most of the mass of the atom, was surrounded or orbited by the much lighter electrons. The resulting picture of the atom was classical in nature in that the atom was viewed as a miniature solar system in which the nucleus was analogous to the sun and the electrons to the planets, but this simple model, as it stood, was inconsistent with classical physics which predicted that the electrons in such an atom should spiral into the nucleus with concomitant emission of radiation, i.e. atoms should decay&#x0021;</p>

<p class="indent">It was clear, however, from contemporaneous observations in atomic spectroscopy that, for whatever reason, only certain orbits or energies were possible for the electrons, and this formed the basis of the subsequent model of the atom proposed by Niels Bohr (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig 1.1</a>). Nevertheless, whilst this model was quite successful in explaining the observed spectroscopic properties of the hydrogen atom, the simplest of all atoms containing only a single electron, it soon ran into problems with heavier atoms containing more than one electron. Furthermore, from a theoretical standpoint, the fact <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>that only certain electron orbits or energies were possible had to be introduced on a purely <i>ad hoc</i> basis with no clear idea of why it should be so.</p>
<p class="indent">An elegant solution to the problem was provided by Schr&#x00F6;dinger in 1926 who, building on the earlier work of de Broglie, proposed that electrons in atoms should be considered not as particles but as waves and that they could therefore be described by a suitable wave equation. The important conceptual breakthrough here was that the presence of only certain allowed electron energies (or orbits if we continue to think in a classical sense) is a direct and natural consequence of a wave treatment and no <i>ad hoc</i> assumptions are necessary. We can see how this arises in a simple way by considering a one-dimensional model.</p>
<p class="indent">A suitable model for a one-dimensional wave-like system is a stringed musical instrument. When the string vibrates, a certain note is heard which has a fixed frequency (or energy; this term will be more appropriate later) and it is therefore apparent that as a result of the string being constrained in some way (the constraints here are the length of the string and its tension), only a certain particular frequency (energy) of vibration is possible.</p>
<p class="indent">However, it is important to realise that even without changing the length or the tension of the string it is possible to sound other notes of higher frequency (the so-called higher harmonics), two of which are illustrated in <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>, and, as with the frequency of the fundamental vibration, the frequencies of the higher harmonics are also determined by the constraints on the string. Thus, for a string with given constraints, only certain particular frequencies of vibration are possible. At this stage, we can introduce the terms <i>node</i> (a point of zero amplitude) and <i>lobe</i> (displacement between nodes) and we should then recognise that the higher harmonics have extra nodes symmetrically disposed along the string (in all cases, the two fixed ends of the string are also both nodes); the first harmonic has one extra node, the second harmonic has two and so on (see <a href="#fig1.2">Fig 1.2</a>).</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 1.2</b> Vibrations of a string fixed at both ends. The fundamental vibration and the first two harmonics are shown. The horizontal lines indicate the position of the string at rest. An example of a node and a lobe are also illustrated.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">These waves which result from the vibrating string may also be thought of as representations of solutions to a one-dimensional <i>wave equation</i> for which only certain solutions are possible. In other words we may say that only certain <i>wavefunctions</i> (i.e. solutions to the wave equation) are allowed. Furthermore, these various solutions to the wave equation are usually labelled with a number called a <i>quantum number</i> which can take only certain allowed values, each one of which corresponds to an allowed solution to the wave equation.</p>
<p class="indent">It should now be apparent that this property of only certain allowed frequencies or energies (<i>quantization</i> as it is usually called) is a direct and natural consequence of a wave-like system which is constrained in some way, and that for a one-dimensional system there is <i>one</i> quantum number, <i>n</i>, which can take various values (i.e. <i>n =</i> 1, 2, 3, etc.). Returning now to atoms which are three-dimensional, there will be three quantum numbers (we shall see later that a fourth quantum number associated with the electron itself will also be necessary) and it is these that we will use as labels for the wavefunctions or solutions to the <i>Schr&#x00F6;dinger wave equation</i> which is used to describe the wave-like properties of electrons in atoms.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a></p>
<p class="indent">Before we look at three-dimensional systems in detail, let us review the important points again. The Schr&#x00F6;dinger wave equation is used to describe the behaviour of electrons in atoms, i.e. we treat electrons as waves. Only certain solutions to the wave equation are possible, each corresponding to an allowed energy (orbit) for an electron, and this quantization results directly from the system being constrained in some way. The constraints (often refered to as boundary conditions) for an electron in an atom are not as obvious as those for the strings discussed above, but result from the attractive interaction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron. Moreover, we obtain not one solution to the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation but a series of many possible solutions each described by a certain set of three quantum numbers. Each one of these solutions or <i>wavefunctions</i> (given the symbol &#x03C8;) describes a possible state or energy of an electron in an atom and is refered to as an <i>orbital</i> (the part <i>orbit</i> is leftover from more classical thinking).</p>
<p class="indent">Let us now look at the solutions to the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation in more detail and see what they mean. In fact, the solutions or wavefunctions, &#x03C8;, refer to the <i>amplitude</i> of an electron wave but of more physical significance is the square of this function, &#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> which refers to the electron <i>intensity</i> (density) or, alternatively, a <i>probability</i> of finding an electron in a particular region of space. Thus &#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> at any particular point is the probability of finding the electron at that point.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Some confusion often arises with these definitions since whilst amplitude and intensity are readily associated with wavelike behaviour, the probability of finding an electron at some point in space is perhaps more easily interpreted in terms of a particle model. We should recognise that any problems in this regard reflect certain inadequacies in either model and learn to recognise and use both descriptions.</p></aside>

<h2 class="main">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Wavefunctions for the hydrogen atom</h2>
<p class="noindent">We will start by considering the hydrogen atom as it is the easiest system to look at since there is only one electron and the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation can be solved exactly; it can be used for other atoms with suitable modifications as we shall see later. However, in order to allow us to represent much of what is to follow pictorially, we will want to look at each wavefunction in two parts. An expression which shows how we can partition the wavefunction is shown below, the two parts being the so-called <i>radial</i> and <i>angular</i> parts.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We will not be concerned here with the details of how it is that these particular values for and relationships between the quantum numbers come about, why they are given these particular names or even precisely why it is that three quantum numbers are required. It is the results in which we are interested and the reader is refered to more advanced texts for a fuller discussion of this topic.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The radial part, <i>R<sub>n,l</sub></i> (<i>r</i>), depends only on the radial distance, <i>r</i>, between the nucleus and the electron and contains no information on direction or orientation. It depends on the quantum numbers <i>n</i> and <i>l</i> which will be defined shortly. The angular part, <i>Y<sub>l</sub></i><sub>,</sub><i><sub>ml</sub></i>(&#x03B8;,&#x03D5;), depends on the direction or orientation, but not on distance, and is dependent on the quantum numbers <i>l</i> and <i>m<sub>l</sub></i> with the angles &#x03B8; and &#x03D5; defining an orientation with respect to a suitable coordinate system.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have seen, boundary conditions and the spherical, three-dimensional nature of the atom give rise to three quantum numbers and these are given the symbols <i>n, l</i> and <i>m<sub>l</sub></i>. Each of the quantum numbers can take only certain allowed values and a solution exists to the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation for particular allowed sets of these three numbers, any one set of three defining a particular orbital. The names and symbols for these quantum numbers and the values which they can take are given overleaf.<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a></p>

The value of <i>l</i> influences both the radial and angular parts of the wavefunction and, in particular, determines the type or shape of the orbital which is usually given a letter designation.</p>

Thus for <i>l</i> = 0, <i>m<sub>l</sub></i> = 0 and so there is only one type of s orbital for any given value of n, i.e. one 1s, one 2s etc. For <i>l</i> = 1, <i>m<sub>l</sub></i> = &#x2013;1, 0, &#x002B;1, i.e. three types of p orbital for any given value of <i>n</i> except for <i>n =</i> 1, i.e. three 2p, three 3p etc. For <i>l</i> = 2, <i>m<sub>l</sub></i> = &#x2013;2, &#x2013;1, 0, &#x002B;1, &#x002B;2, which means five types of d orbital. This quantum number specifies the orientation of the orbital.</p>
<p class="indentt">When we look at these orbitals or wavefunctions in more detail we will see that they contain nodes (just like strings) and there are a few simple rules concerning nodes that are worth remembering. The total number of nodes in any given orbital is equal to <i>n</i>&#x2013;1. Some of these are in the radial part of the wavefunction and some are in the angular part. The number of angular nodes is simply equal to <i>l</i> and the number of radial nodes is therefore equal to <i>n&#x2013;l</i>&#x2013;1 as we shall see in the following sections.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The particular numerical values of <i>m<sub>l</sub> </i>are not important as far as this discussion is concerned, merely the total number of possible values allowed for any given value of <i>l</i>. Furthermore, we will also not be concerned with the details of the orientation of orbitals with respect to a given coordinate system although we should recognise that this information is very important when considering molecular orbitals. See Winter (1993).</p></aside>
<p class="indent">In the case of the hydrogen atom, the energy of an electron or orbital depends <i>only</i> on the value of <i>n</i> and so, for example, the 2s and 2p orbitals have the same energy and are said to be <i>degenerate</i>. The energy of the orbitals increases as <i>n</i> increases and this is shown graphically for the first few levels in an energy level diagram for the hydrogen atom in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>. Note that the separation in energy is not constant but that the levels become closer together as <i>n</i> increases. Moreover, the energies are given negative values with <i>n</i> = &#x221E; defined as zero energy.</p>
<p class="indent">Now we will look at orbitals in more detail and we will start with the angular part of the wavefunction.<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a></p>

<h3 class="main2">1.2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> The angular part of the wavefunction</h3>
<p class="noindent">The angular part of the wavefunction reveals how the wavefunction varies as a function of an angle from the origin of some suitably chosen coordinate system and thus determines the shape of the orbital. It is dependent on the quantum number <i>l</i> and, as we have seen above, we can label the types of orbitals according to the value of this quantum number or more usually with the letters s, p, d, f, etc. Remember that the number of nodes in the angular part of the wavefunction (so-called angular nodes) for a given orbital is equal to <i>l</i>. Thus s orbitals (1s, 2s, 3s etc.) where <i>l</i> = 0, have no angular nodes and, since there is therefore no angular dependence of the wave function, the orbital is spherical in shape.</p>
<p class="indent">For p orbitals, <i>l</i> = 1 and there is one angular node. This node is a planar surface and divides the orbital into two lobes of opposite sign. There are three possible orientations for orbitals of this type (three values of <i>m<sub>l</sub></i>) and these lie along the axes <i>x</i><small>, </small><i>y</i> and <i>z</i>, and are usually designated as p<i><sub>x</sub></i>, p<i><sub>y</sub></i> and p<sub>z</sub>. All p orbitals have this shape and there are always three for any given value of <i>n</i>, i.e. three 2p, three 3p etc.</p>
<p class="indent">For d orbitals, <i>l</i> = 2 and there are now two nodes associated with these orbitals so that each therefore has four lobes. For a given value of <i>n</i>, there are five d orbitals (five values of <i>m<sub>l</sub></i>) which are given the labels d<sub><i>xy</i></sub>, d<sub><i>xz</i></sub>, d<sub><i>yz</i></sub>,<m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>d</m:mi><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mi>x</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo>&#x2212;</m:mo><m:msup><m:mi>y</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>,</m:mo><m:msub><m:mi>d</m:mi><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mi>z</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>. Pictures of the angular part of the wavefunction for some of these orbitals are shown in <a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> but remember that these are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional orbitals; the s orbital should be thought of as spherical and the p orbitals as two tangential spheres.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="#sec1.1">section 1.1</a>, we will generally be more interested in the square of the wavefunction, &#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> and pictures of the square of the angular part of the wavefunction for the s, p<i><sub>x</sub></i> and p<i><sub>z</sub></i> orbitals shown in <a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>, are shown in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>. Note that the s orbital is still represented as a circle (sphere in three dimensions) whilst the p orbitals are now dumb-bell shaped. The d orbitals look much the same when squared and are not shown.<a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a></p>

<h3 class="main2">1.2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span> The radial part of the wavefunction</h3>
<p class="indent">The radial part of the wavefunction tells us how the wavefunction varies with distance, <i>r</i>, from the nucleus, i.e. the effective size of the orbital, and we shall see that a square of this function will be particularly useful in understanding many aspects of the structure of the periodic table. Atomic orbitals depend on an exponential function <i>e<sup>&#x2013;Br</sup></i> where <i>B</i> is some constant and <i>r</i> is the distance from the nucleus. This means that &#x03C8; falls away exponentially at large <i>r</i> values. For a 1s orbital, a standard expression is &#x03C8; = <i>At<sup>&#x2013;Br</sup></i> and if we plot this function as a graph we obtain a curve shown in <a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>. from which we can see that there is a maximum value of &#x03C8; at <i>r =</i> 0 or at the nucleus. If we now plot a graph of &#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> vs. <i>r</i> to get the probability of finding an electron at a particular point, we find that this looks rather similar as shown in <a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>.</p>

<p class="sidebar">All of the graphs in this chapter should be considered as approximate rather than faithful representations of the mathematical functions from which they are derived.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">However, we are not so much interested in the probability of finding an electron at a point along a line from the nucleus but rather with the probability of finding the electron on a particular three-dimensional surface. In the case of the 1s orbital being considered here, we can imagine a spherical surface (derived from the angular part) expanding from the nucleus and it will be useful to know the probability of finding an electron at some point on this surface as a function of distance from the nucleus. The greater the distance from the nucleus, the more points on a sphere and so the function we want will be proportional to the surface area of the sphere or 4&#x03C0;<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>. We can therefore plot a probability that an electron is on a surface at a certain <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>distance <i>r</i> according to the function 4&#x03C0;<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>.&#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> and a graph of this for the Is orbital is shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8 (a)</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">This function 4&#x03C0;<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>.&#x03C8;<sup>2</sup> is called the <i>radial probability function</i> (RPF). When <i>r =</i> 0, the RPF is also 0 and so for all orbitals, the function is zero at the centre of the nucleus. We see also that the graph has a maximum, i.e. there is a distance at which we are most likely to find the electron, <i>r</i><sub>0</sub>. For a 1s orbital for hydrogen this is called the Bohr radius and is equal to 0.529 &#x00C5;. This most probable distance is what is meant by the effective size of the orbital but note that there is a small but finite probability that the electron can be found at large distances from the nucleus as a result of the exponential decay mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">Graphs for the radial probability functions for other hydrogen orbitals are shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Figs. 1.8 (b)</a>, <a href="#fig1.8">1.8 (c)</a> and <a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a> (more accurate, quantitative diagrams are available in most textbooks, see for example, Huheey, Keiter and Keiter) to illustrate some of the more important points. Note, for example, that some graphs have secondary maxima closer to the nucleus and also that the major maximum in the graph of the 2s orbital is slightly further from the nucleus than is the maximum in the 2p orbital, a matter we shall remark upon later, although both are considerably further from the nucleus than that for the 1s orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">Some important points for all orbitals which derive from this treatment are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="nlist">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>All functions tend to zero at large values of <i>r</i>.</p>

Remember that the total number of nodes for any orbital is given by <i>n</i>&#x2013;1 and since <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>the number of angular nodes is equal to <i>l</i>, the number of radial nodes is equal to <i>n-l</i>-1.</p>

Similarly for 2p vs. 3p vs. 4p, i.e. the value of the principal quantum number <i>n</i> determines the size of the orbital. For a given value of <i>n</i>, the orbitals are of similar size as shown in <a href="#fig1.8">Figs. 1.8(b)</a> and <a href="#fig1.8">(c)</a> and in <a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>, the main maxima being slightly closer to the nucleus the larger the value of <i>l</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">For an electron in an orbital, the total energy, <i>E</i>, is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. Both vary depending on position but their sum is fixed. Lower <i>E</i> means more stable, and electrons will go into the lowest energy orbitals available. For hydrogen, <i>E</i> depends <i>only</i> on the principal quantum number <i>n</i> and so the 1s orbital is lowest in energy. Therefore in the <i>ground state</i> the electron in hydrogen is in a 1s orbital. Hydrogen can also exist in <i>excited states</i> where the electron can be in an orbital of higher energy.</p>

<h2 class="main">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Polyelectronic atoms</h2>
<p class="noindent">Having considered hydrogen with only a single electron, we are now ready to consider polyelectronic atoms, i.e. the rest of the periodic table. One immediate problem which we encounter is that the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation can only be solved exactly for the hydrogen atom which has one electron (or <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>other one-electron species such as He<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Li<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>). Solutions to the Schr&#x00F6;dinger equation which describe polyelectronic atoms can, in fact, only be solved approximately but calculations indicate that orbitals for other atoms are very similar to those found for hydrogen.</p>
<p class="indent">In particular, some important points are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="nlist">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The same quantum numbers are found as for hydrogen.</p>
<p class="nlist">2.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The same angular functions are found so that the orbitals have the same shapes and types, i.e. 1s, 2s, 2p, etc.</p>
<p class="nlist">3.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The radial functions are also similar but firstly they are contracted to smaller radii (i.e. orbitals shrink due to increasing nuclear charge), and secondly, the energies are lower. Most importantly of all, orbital energies now depend on the subsidiary quantum number <i>l</i> as well as upon <i>n</i> for reasons which we shall address shortly.</p>
<p class="indentt">Since we now have many electrons to deal with and in order to understand the structure of polyelectronic atoms, we must now look and see how orbitals are filled by electrons. There are three rules or principles which we must consider.</p>

<h3 class="main2">1.4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> The Pauli exclusion principle</h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to understand this, we must first introduce a fourth quantum number. This is labelled <i>m<sub>s</sub></i> and is associated with the electron itself and its <i>spin</i>.

Since each orbital is defined by three quantum numbers, <i>n, l</i>, and <i>m<sub>l</sub></i>, it follows that only two electrons can be associated with any particular orbital, one with <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:mi>s</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> and the other with <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:mi>s</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mo>&#x2212;</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math>.

<p class="indent">There are two reasons for this. Firstly, electrons go in different orbitals if possible since this places them further apart from each other and thus minimizes the coulombic repulsion resulting from the fact that they have the same charge. Secondly, when two or more orbitals are singly occupied, as for carbon and nitrogen, spin parallel is more stable (for quantum mechanical reasons) than spin paired.</p>

<h2 class="main">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Energies of electrons in polyelectronic atoms</h2>
<p class="noindent">The energies of the electrons in non-hydrogen atoms, i.e. atoms with more than one electron, depend on both the quantum numbers <i>n</i> <u>and</u> <i>l</i>. We will now consider why this is so and shall see that an understanding of this fact is vital to understanding the form of the periodic table.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us start by considering some first ionization energies, i.e. the energy required to remove the highest energy or least tightly held electron. For hydrogen, the first ionization energy (1st IE) is 1313 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. For the helium ion, He<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, the calculated 1st IE is 5252 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> because it is proportional to the square of the nuclear charge, Z<sup>2</sup>, and the observed 1st IE is found to be 5250 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, i.e. good agreement since the He<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion has one electron like the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p class="indent">However, for the helium atom, He, with two electrons, the observed 1st IE is found to be much less at 2372 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Clearly the two electrons in the 1s orbital of the He atom are at a higher energy than the single electron of He<sup>&#x002B;</sup> which arises, in part, because of electron-electron repulsion which partly offsets the electron-nucleus attraction. It is as if the electrons partly shield each other from the full attraction of the nucleus and for He, each electron feels only about 1 <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> of the &#x002B;2 charge of the nucleus and there is a therefore a shielding effect of about <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> of an electron; incomplete but effective shielding of the electrons, by each other, from the positive charge of the nucleus.</p>
<p class="indent">For lithium, Li, the observed 1st IE is 520 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, which is quite low. There is therefore a considerable shielding of the outermost electron in Li from the &#x002B;3 nuclear charge and the <i>effective nuclear charge</i> attracting this 2s electron of Li is only about &#x002B;1 <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> instead of &#x002B;3. The outer 2s electron is therefore very effectively shielded from the nucleus by the two 1s electrons and we can understand this in the following way.</p>
<p class="indent">If we look at the radial probability functions for the 1s and 2s orbitals superimposed on the same graph (see <a href="#fig1.11">Fig 1.11</a>), we can see that most of the 2s orbital lies well outside the main part of the 1s electron density, i.e. the maximum for 2s is at a considerably greater distance from the nucleus than the maximum for 1s. The effect of this is that, in the case of Li, the two 1s electrons shield the 2s electron very effectively from the nuclear charge <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>although they provide much less shielding for each other. Moreover, the electron in the 2s orbital does not really shield the 1s electrons at all.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 1.11</b> Graphs of RPFs for the 1s and 2s orbitals superimposed.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">This leads us to consider the electrons in an atom in two groups. The <i>valence electrons</i>, are those with the highest energies (normally those with the highest value of <i>n</i>) and are involved directly with chemistry and bonding, whilst the <i>core electrons</i>, with lower values of <i>n</i>, are in completely filled orbital groups and act merely as a less-than-complete shield of the nuclear charge. The latter are too tightly bound to the nucleus to be directly involved in chemistry, i.e. their energy is too low, but nevertheless play an important r&#x00F4;le as a result of their shielding influence on the valence electrons. In fact, the very existence of a periodic pattern in the properties of the elements implies that it is only the valence electrons which are responsible for their chemical behaviour. It is therefore appropriate to think of the nucleus and the core electrons as providing an effective charge or potential (pseudo potential as it is sometimes called) in which the valence electrons move. This concept is very useful in simplifying quantum chemical calculations.</p>
<p class="indent">Accurate wavefunctions are available from computer programs for all known atoms and so are all the orbital energies and these agree well with the observed ionization energies. What we as chemists like, however, is a simple model with as few numbers to remember as possible. Slater has suggested a set of simple rules to estimate shielding effects and hence to calculate effective nuclear charge values, which can then be used to calculate approximate orbital energies. We will look at these in some detail in the following chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In discussing the element lithium, we placed the outermost electron in the 2s rather than the 2p orbital and at this stage we need to consider why it is that for Li, and all polyelectronic atoms, 2s is lower in energy than 2p. In other words why do orbital energies now depend on <i>n</i> <u>and</u> <i>l</i> whereas for hydrogen they depend only upon <i>n</i>. The answer can be found by again considering the radial parts of the wavefunctions, and in the particular importance of the small inner lobes seen in some of the radial probability functions.</p>
<p class="indent">For Li there are two 1s electrons and a third electron to be acommodated in an orbital of higher energy. Why does this go into 2s rather than the 2p? As we have seen, when considering the low ionization energy of Li, the two 1s electrons partly shield the third electron by getting between it and the nucleus since the 1s electrons lie, on average, much closer to the nucleus <a href="#fig1.11">(Fig 1.11)</a>. However, a small but significant part of the 2s orbital lies even closer to the nucleus than the maximum in the 1s lobe. This is associated with the minor maximum in the graph for 2s which results from the presence of a radial node. It is this contribution which lowers the energy of 2s relative to 2p since the 2p orbital contains no radial nodes and hence no minor maximum close to the nucleus <a href="#fig1.12">(Fig 1.12)</a>. The electron in the 2s orbital can therefore be said to <i>penetrate</i> the core (i.e. 1s) better. The effect may seem to be small when looking at the graphs especially when it is noted that the major maximum for 2s is actually further from the nucleus, albeit only slightly, than the maximum for 2p. However, calculations of the potential energies of electrons indicate that this small penetration is all-important in determining <a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>the ordering of the orbital energies and thus 2s lies lower in energy than 2p and it is the 2s orbital which is occupied first.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar arguments can be offered to explain why 3s penetrates more than 3p which, in turn, penetrates more than 3d and therefore why the orbitals are filled in this order.</p>
<p class="indent">One point we should note at this stage is that we must be careful in using graphs of the radial probability functions for hydrogen atoms to explain properties of poly electronic atoms. As we shall see later, graphs for a particular orbital can change markedly, with respect to the distance of the maxima from the nucleus, depending on whether other orbitals are filled or not. In the case of lithium and the 2s and 2p orbitals described above, the discussion based around the graphs in <a href="#fig1.12">Fig. 1.12</a> is largely accurate because the radial extensions of the 2s and 2p orbitals are still similar (as they are in hydrogen) even though 1s is filled. For the heavier elements, this is no longer the case and it is found that s orbitals have increasingly smaller radial extensions relative to p orbitals with the same value of <i>n</i> as <i>n</i> increases. This has important consequences for bonding as we shall see later.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">We are now in a position to look at why it is that the periodic table has the form it does. After H and He, the 2s orbital is filled (Li and Be) and then the three 2p orbitals giving a total of six elements (B through Ne). This completes the filling of the orbitals of the second quantum shell. For the next element, sodium, the outermost electron goes into the 3s orbital and the pattern of the previous shell repeats itself with the filling of 3s and 3p taking us as far as argon. It is apparent from an inspection of the periodic table, however, that the outermost electron for the next element, potassium, resides not in one of the 3d orbitals, as might have been expected, but rather in the 4s orbital. So far we have observed that orbital energies are dependent primarily on <i>n</i> with a secondary dependence on <i>l</i>. Clearly this is an over-simplification as an orbital with <i>n =</i> 4 is being filled before all of the <i>n =</i> 3 orbitals have been filled.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A periodic table is shown on the inside of the back cover.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">We can go someway to understanding this observation by considering the graphs shown in <a href="#fig1.13">Fig. 1.13</a> which show the radial probability functions for the 4s and 3d orbitals and the extent to which they penetrate the 3s/3p core.</p>
<p class="indent">It is apparent that whilst 3d has its maximum closer to the nucleus than does 4s, the inner lobes of 4s penetrate the core very effectively. Calculations show (but see page 15) that, with 3s and 3p filled, an electron in 4s is less efficiently shielded than an electron in 3d and therefore feels a greater effective nuclear charge and so is lower in energy. The outermost electrons for potassium and calcium therefore reside in 4s. Note, however, that once 4s has been filled, it shields 3d very poorly since much of the electron density in 4s lies outside the maximum of 3d. The 3d orbitals therefore fall sharply in energy as soon as 4s is filled and these five orbitals are the next to be filled which gives rise to the ten elements of the first transition series, Sc through Zn. The next lowest energy orbitals available are the three 4p orbitals and these are filled next with the elements Ga through Kr. The rest of the periodic table can be built up and understood in much the same way. The situation gets a little complicated with the later transition elements and the lanthanides <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a> because there are many orbitals that are very close in energy but we will not be concerned here with this part of the periodic table.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We must exercise some care in using graphs like <a href="#fig1.13">Fig. 1.13</a>. For the hydrogen atom which contains only one electron, shielding and penetration effects are irrelevant. With polyelectronic atoms, however, the radial probability plots will change considerably as a result of these shielding effects. Thus, whilst for hydrogen, the 4s orbital has a maximum much further from the nucleus than that of 3d, for elements like potassium, these two orbitals are closer in size. Nevertheless, the difference in the radial extension of non-hydrogen <i>nd</i> and <i>n&#x002B;1s</i> orbitals may still be substantial as indicated by the following data for the elements Cr, Mo and W.</p>

<p class="sidebar">In <a href="#fig1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>, the 3d orbital is drawn at higher energy than the 4s for elements with an atomic number of around 20&#x2013;25. Whether or not the 3d orbital ever does rise above 4s in energy is, in fact, a matter of some debate (but see page 15), but the graph and associated discussion are adequate for our purposes. In any event, we must be careful to distinguish between statements about orbital energies and about the order in which orbitals are filled since, as stated in the main text, orbital energies vary depending on whether or not other orbitals are filled. This matter is addressed again in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="indent">An important point which derives from this discussion is that the energies of orbitals (or, to be more precise, the order in which they are filled) are very dependent, as a result of shielding and penetration effects, on whether or not other orbitals are filled or unfilled. A very useful graph of the variation in the orbital energies for the elements is shown in <a href="#fig1.14">Fig. 1.14</a> and we will refer to this again in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p class="indent">From <a href="#fig1.14">Fig. 1.14</a> we can see that for hydrogen we have the special simple case that <i>E</i> depends only on <i>n</i> and so 2s and 2p are degenerate as are 3s, 3p and 3d.</p>
<p class="indent">For all other atoms the s, p and d orbitals for any given <i>n</i> are <i>not</i> degenerate due to differences in penetration and shielding effects. All s orbitals penetrate the inner shells well so they feel a higher effective nuclear <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 1 Atomic structure and the form of the Periodic Table</a>charge than corresponding p and d orbitals; they all drop steadily as the nuclear charge increases (solid lines).</p>
<p class="indent">All p orbitals also penetrate the inner shells well except that they are well shielded from the nucleus by the 1s electrons so they drop steadily after staying nearly level for the first few elements. Thus p orbitals (dashed lines) are a little above s orbitals. 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p maintain the same order for all elements.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to 3d orbitals, note that once they are filled they drop quickly in energy (bold line) and approach 3s and 3p since they are very poorly shielded by the next orbitals being filled, i.e. 4p. Thus for Ga and beyond, 3d are now lower in energy than 4s and act as core rather than valence electrons. Therefore the electron configuration of Ga is &#x005B;Ar&#x005D; 3d<sup>10</sup> 4s<sup>2</sup> 4p<sup>1</sup> and it resembles Al, &#x005B;Ne&#x005D; 3s<sup>2</sup> 3p<sup>1</sup>, in its chemistry. The d orbitals do play a part in Ga chemistry but only a minor one; we will look at this in more detail in later chapters.</p>

<p class="nlist-s">1<span class="padding"></span>Note that for core orbitals, the individual s, p and d orbitals with the same value of <i>n</i> come close together in energy; i.e. they become more hydrogen-like.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">As a postscript to some of the discussion presented in this section about the relative energies of 3d and 4s orbitals, more recent calculations (see Frenking and Fr&#x00F6;hlich, <i>Chem.Rev.</i>, (2000), <b>100</b>,717) indicate that 3d is always lower in energy than 4s. The reason why 4s is populated before 3d is fully filled (in neutral atoms) is then traced to the fact that inter-electron repulsions are significantly less between electrons in the 4s orbital due to its greater size. In cations, however, the 3d orbitals are sufficiently stabilised relative to 4s that any advantage of reduced inter-electron repulsions in 4s is outweighed by the lower energy of 3d. Clearly this is not a straight-forward issue and any resolution is beyond the scope of this book.</p></aside>
<p class="indentt">The second point above regarding neutral atoms vs. ions requires a little more explanation. As we have seen, potassium has the valence electronic configuration 4s<sup>1</sup> and scandium, the first element of the transition series, is 4s<sup>2</sup> 3d<sup>1</sup>. This is generally true for the first row transition elements in that the neutral atoms have the electronic configuration 4s<sup>2</sup> 3d<i><sup>n</sup></i> (except for Cr which is 4s<sup>1</sup> 3d<sup>5</sup> and Cu which is 4s<sup>1</sup> 3d<sup>10</sup>). In discussing the cations of the transition elements, however, it is found that the 3d orbitals are lower in energy than the 4s orbital (i.e. are filled first) and the valence electron configuration of the metal &#x002B;2 and &#x002B;3 ions are given as 3d<i><sup>n</sup></i>. This is often confusing in that it seems that whilst electrons are added to 4s and then 3d for the atoms, they are removed in the reverse order to form the ions. To resolve this difficulty, we must recognize that the relative ordering of the orbital energies is also dependent on the charge of the atom or ion. Thus, whilst 4s is lower than 3d for the neutral atoms, the reverse is true for the &#x002B;2 and &#x002B;3 ions. The reason for this is that for the ions, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons is much larger with the result that all orbitals become contracted. Penetration effects therefore become less important and orbitals become more hydrogen-like such that energies become more dependent on <i>n</i> rather than <i>l</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In conclusion, we now have a fairly good rationalization for the structure or form of the periodic table and in the next chapter we will go on to look at the periodic trends in various atomic properties.</p>
