<h2 class="main"><b>7.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR)</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The molecules formed by elements of the p-block often appear to present a bewildering array of structures. For example, if we consider some of the trifluorides, BF<sub>3</sub> is trigonal planar, NF<sub>3</sub> is trigonal pyramidal and ClF<sub>3</sub> is T-shaped. Moreover, PF<sub>3</sub> is found to be &#x2018;more&#x2019; pyramidal than NF<sub>3</sub>, i.e. the F&#x2013;P&#x2013;F angles are smaller than the F&#x2013;N&#x2013;F angles. A successful theory of molecular structure must account for all of these observations in a simple and elegant manner, and a theory which certainly meets these two criteria is known as valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR) or sometimes by the names of its two most recent proponents and developers, Gillespie-Nyholm rules.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">VSEPR is only really appropriate for s- and p-block molecules since for compounds of the d-block elements, the assumption of unpolarizable, spherical cores is not justified. For example, the molecule &#x005B;PtCl<sub>4</sub>&#x005D;<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> has 16 valence electrons or eight pairs, and four pairs can be assumed to be used in four Pt&#x2013;Cl bonds. However, the molecule is square-planar rather than tetrahedral, as would be predicted for a p-block compound, since the remaining four non-bonding electron pairs do not form a spherical core or behave as normal, localized lone pairs. Where a spherical core is appropriate, as is the case for d<sup>0</sup>, d<sup>5</sup> and d<sup>10</sup> electron counts, VSEPR can be used.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">This is not the place to discuss VSEPR in detail; the rules and many examples can be found in any textbook of basic inorganic chemistry and, in most detail, in Gillespie and Hargittai (1991); see also Winter (1993). Nevertheless, there are some important trends in molecular structure which we shall want to address and for that purpose, it will be useful to present the basic rules of VSEPR and to note the reasons behind the common shapes which molecules adopt.</p>
<p class="indent">VSEPR as the name implies, is a set of rules with which to predict or rationalize the structures of molecules based on the repulsion between pairs of valence electrons; core electrons are completely ignored since their distribution around the nucleus is spherical and highly unpolarizable. We should bear in mind that the concept of 2-centre-2-electron bonds is used explicitly in this regard and hybridisation schemes can subsequently be employed once a structure is established, but we should recognise that VSEPR is a model for predicting the arrangement of atoms, not for describing details of electronic structure.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">More recent discussions of VSEPR focus more on electron pair domains (bond pair, lone pair etc) and the space they occupy rather than on electron pair repulsions. See, for example, Gillespie <i>et al. J.Chem.Educ</i>., (1996), <b>73</b>,622 and <i>Angew.Chem</i>., (1996), <b>35</b>,495.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The geometries adopted for two to six pairs of electrons are linear, trigonal-planar, tetrahedral, trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral respectively: illustrative examples where all of the electron pairs are bonding pairs are shown in <a href="#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 7 Structure</a></p>
<p class="indent">Non-bonding electron pairs also occupy a distinct region of space and influence the structure accordingly. Thus NH<sub>3</sub> is pyramidal with three bonding pairs and one lone pair and H<sub>2</sub>O is bent or V-shaped with two bond pairs and two lone pairs (<a href="#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). We should also note the general rule that non-bonding pairs occupy more space around a central atom than a bonding pair since they are associated only with that atom and are not &#x2018;stretched out&#x2019; between two atoms as is the case with a bonding pair. Thus whereas in CH<sub>4</sub>, the angles subtended at the central atom are 109.5&#x00B0;, i.e. those of the regular tetrahedron, the H&#x2013;N&#x2013;H angles in NH<sub>3</sub> are 107.5&#x00B0; and the H&#x2013;O&#x2013;H angle in H<sub>2</sub>O is 104.5&#x00B0;.

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">For a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, lone pairs always go into the equatorial sites as this minimizes the 90&#x00B0; contacts (each axial site has three 90&#x00B0; contacts to the equatorial positions whereas each equatorial site has only two 90&#x00B0; contacts to the axial positions). This is illustrated with the structures of SF<sub>4</sub> (equatorially vacant trigonal bipyramidal or disphenoidal), ClF<sub>3</sub> (T-shaped) and XeF<sub>2</sub> (linear) (<a href="#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">For an octahedral geometry derived from six electron pairs, a molecule with five bonding pairs and one lone pair adopts a square-based pyramidal geometry, whereas for four bond pairs and two lone pairs, the latter occupy <i>trans</i> sites and a molecule like XeF<sub>4</sub> is square planar. These rules and the shapes are summarized in <a href="#tab7.1">Table 7.1</a> where EX<i><sub>n</sub></i>Z<i><sub>m</sub></i> represents a central atom, E, surrounded by <i>n</i>X groups and <i>m</i> lone pairs, Z.</p>

<p class="indent">Molecules with double or triple bonds require an additonal rule which states that a multiple bond has the same gross stereochemical influence as a single bond. For example, in POCl<sub>3</sub> there are five bonding pairs, three P&#x2013;Cl pairs and two pairs associated with the P=O double bond. Since the latter two pairs act as one, the geometry of POCl<sub>3</sub> is determined by four pairs and the molecule is tetrahedral. In general, multiple bond pairs exert a greater repulsion at the central atom than lone pairs or single bond pairs, and the interbond angles deviate from idealized values accordingly. A list of general structural types involving double bonds is presented in <a href="#tab7.2">Table 7.2</a>.</p>

<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">A further application of Bent&#x2019;s rule is in rationalizing the precise structure of a compound like CF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and related species. CF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> is tetrahedral, but the F&#x2013;C&#x2013;F angle is found to be less than the ideal tetrahedral angle whereas the H&#x2013;C&#x2013;H angle is greater. Normally, all four tetrahedral hybrids are considered as sp<sup>3</sup> but there is no requirement that they must be identical; some may have more s character and some less. Specifically, we may have two hybrids of the form sp<sup>3-</sup><i><sup>x</sup></i>and two of the form sp<sup>3&#x002B;x</sup>, the only condition being that the sum of all four hybrids must equal one s plus three p. In CF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> the fluorines bond through hybrids with a greater degree of p character (the less electronegative ones) and therefore have an interbond angle of less than the tetrahedral angle: in the limit where bonding was through pure p orbitals, the expected interbond angle would be 90&#x00B0;. In effect, of course, this distortion of the structure and the non-equivalence of the hybrids is driven by the fact that F and H have different electronegativities.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">One final aspect of VSEPR which we will look at can be illustrated with the structure of PF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>. This molecule is a simple derivative of PF<sub>5</sub> and has the expected trigonal bipyramidal structure, but the question remains as to how the atoms are arranged since a number of isomers is possible depending on which atoms are in the equatorial sites and which are axial. The structure observed is the one with both fluorine atoms in axial sites, and this observation turns out be quite general in that electronegative atoms or substituents prefer axial positions in a trigonal bipyramid. The origin of this site preference can be traced to the smaller effective size of electronegative atoms at the central element due to the resultant polarization of the bonding electron density away from the central atom. This enables electronegative atoms to more readily tolerate the axial site with its three 90&#x00B0; contacts (the opposite of why a lone pair prefers an equatorial site).</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative explanation is embodied in Bent&#x2019;s rule which concentrates more on the electronic origins of this site preference. Recall that in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.3.2">Section 6.3.2</a>, <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Chapter 7 Structure</a>the hybrid orbitals appropriate for a trigonal bipyramid were discussed in terms of a dsp<sup>3</sup> set which could be broken down into equatorial sp<sup>2</sup> and axial dp subsets. These subsets are not equivalent and electrons will have different energies depending on which subset they are in. Specifically, electrons will be more tightly bound in the sp<sup>2</sup> subset rather than the dp set, since orbital energies are such that s is lower than p which is lower than d, as we saw in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. Alternatively, we can assign an effective electronegativity to an orbital or hybrid, and it is clear that in the present example, the sp<sup>2</sup> set can be considered as more electronegative than the dp set since the electrons are more tightly held. The result is that an electronegative atom such as fluorine tends to bond to the least electronegative hybrid (given a choice), which in this case is dp, since there is less &#x2018;competition&#x2019; for electrons thereby accounting for the observed axial site preference.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">In general, hybrids with more s character are more electronegative; e.g. sp &#x003E; sp<sup>2</sup> &#x003E; sp<sup>3</sup>.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">With the above overview of molecular structure according to VSEPR, it will now be useful to consider some of the periodic structural trends which are observed and to consider the various models which are used to account for them.</p>

<p class="noindent">Let us start by considering the trihydrides of the group 15 elements, EH<sub>3</sub>. VSEPR predicts a trigonal pyramidal structure for these molecules since there is one lone pair as well as three E&#x2013;H bond pairs. Moreover, as we saw above, the interbond angles in NH<sub>3</sub> are less than the ideal tetrahedral angle due to lone pair repulsions being stronger than bond pair repulsions. If we look at the trihydrides of the first four members of group 15 (BiH<sub>3</sub> is not stable), it is found that there is a steady decrease in the H&#x2013;E&#x2013;H angle as the group is descended as shown in <a href="#tab7.3">Table 7.3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, decreasing interbond angles on descending a group is a general phenomenon in p-block chemistry where lone pairs are present; it is also seen in the group 16 dihydrides and in other examples discussed below. The explanation within VSEPR theory is straightforward since it is assumed that as the central atom, E, gets larger, the E&#x2013;H bond pairs can be forced closer together by the lone pair before significant bond pair&#x2013;bond pair repulsions arise. Moreover, the decreasing electronegativity of the element centre, as the group is descended, results in a relatively greater polarization of the bonding electron density towards the hydrogen atom. Polarization away from the central atom results in more space around that atom which also allows the E&#x2013;H bond pairs to approach more closely. In actual fact, the group 15 elements are all more electronegative than hydrogen so the bonding electron density will tend to be polarized towards these atoms. Nevertheless, the extent to which this is so will decrease down the group.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Other important factors are apparent when we consider the trifluorides of group 15, interbond angles for which are shown in <a href="#tab7.4">Table 7.4</a>. The first point to note is that the F&#x2013;E&#x2013;F angles also decrease as the group is descended just as found for the hydrides and for much the same reasons. Note also that the interbond angle in SbF<sub>3</sub> is actually less than 90&#x00B0;, a point we will return to later, although some care must be exercised in these comparisons since SbF<sub>3</sub> <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Chapter 7 Structure</a>has significant intermolecular Sb&#x00B7;&#x22EF;&#x00B7;F interactions in the solid state unlike the lighter congeners. A second point is that the interbond angle in NF<sub>3</sub> is less than that in NH<sub>3</sub>. This may, at first, seem surprising since the fluorine atom is bigger than hydrogen but we must also consider that the N&#x2013;F bond length is greater than the N&#x2013;H distance and also that fluorine is much more electronegative than hydrogen. This latter aspect is important as the electron density will be substantially polarized towards the fluorine atoms and away from the nitrogen which will allow the N&#x2013;F bond pairs to approach each other more closely at the nitrogen centre before inter-electron pair repulsions become significant.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">The resolution to the problem of the bond angles in the series of compounds NH<sub>3</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub> and PF<sub>3</sub> is probably associated, at least in part, with changes in the direction of bond polarity. Thus, if we consider electronegativities, the N&#x2013;H bonds in NH<sub>3</sub> are polarized &#x03B4;<sup>&#x2013;</sup> N&#x2013;H &#x03B4;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> whereas for the other three compounds the polarization is such as to place the &#x03B4;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> charge on the central element. This would lead to the N&#x2013;H bond pairs taking up more space near the nitrogen centre and thus have the effect of widening the angles in NH<sub>3</sub> in relation to NF<sub>3</sub>.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The first problem we encounter is in considering PF<sub>3</sub> since, if the above arguments for NF<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> are correct, we might have expected the bond angles in PF<sub>3</sub> to be less than those in PH<sub>3</sub>. Clearly this is not the case here or with the arsenic analogues. A similar situation is found with H<sub>2</sub>O/F<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>S/F<sub>2</sub>S and there is no easy way around this difficulty based on the arguments we have employed so far. Thus, whilst VSEPR is useful for predicting the gross structural type and for rationalizing trends within a homologous series, we must exercise some care when comparing angles in structures with different substituents especially where hydrogen is concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us now further consider the trend to decreasing bond angles as group 15 is descended. We have seen illustrations of this trend with the element hydrides and fluorides but it is quite general for a range of substituents, and a similar effect is observed in group 16 for compounds of the general formula EX<sub>2</sub> and also with respect to the inter-equatorial bond angle in EX<sub>4</sub>Z compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">We have already seen that VSEPR provides us with an initial level of explanation but we need also to consider the nature of the bonding (VSEPR is not a theory of electronic structure). It is usually stated in textbooks of inorganic chemistry that the trend towards angles of 90&#x00B0; reflects a tendency for the heavier elements to bond only through p orbitals. In other words, that s-p hybridization for the heavier elements does not readily occur. This explanation, as it stands, is not easily reconciled with the fact that the energy separation between the valence s and p orbitals decreases as the groups are descended, but it is consistent with the high s&#x2013;p promotion energy and particularly with inefficient s-p hybridization resulting from the different sizes of the <i>n</i>s and <i>n</i>p orbitals for the heavier elements (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">An interesting example of how this trend to smaller bond angles on descending a group affects compound stability is found with compounds of group 14 of the general formula R<sub>8</sub>E<sub>8</sub> which have the cubane structure. Thus as the group is descended, the trend towards interbond angles of 90&#x00B0; results in the ring strain energy becoming progressively less.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">It would therefore seem that bonding through pure p orbitals is an appropriate description for the heavier elements and that in, for example, triphenyl bismuth, BiPh<sub>3</sub>, with C&#x2013;Bi&#x2013;C angles of 94&#x00B0;, the bismuth&#x2013;carbon bonds are formed by overlap involving bismuth p orbitals and that the bismuth lone pair resides in a pure s orbital. This latter point is also consistent with the observed decrease in basicity of group 15 EX<sub>3</sub> compounds as the group is descended. Thus whilst PPh<sub>3</sub> readily forms complexes by acting as a Lewis base, the analogous chemistry for BiPh<sub>3</sub> is much less extensive due to s orbitals with poor directional properties not forming strong bonds which, coupled with the radial contraction of the heavier element s orbitals, leads generally to weak bonds and reduced basicity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Chapter 7 Structure</a></p>
<p class="indent">The above argument is certainly one way of looking at things and is fairly satisfactory at explaining many features, although it does not readily account for why interbond angles of less than 90&#x00B0; should be observed as found, for example, in SbF<sub>3</sub>. An alternative approach to this problem is to consider the nature of the molecular orbitals and how these can be used to rationalize the shapes of molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us start by asking the question of why EX<sub>3</sub>Z molecules are pyramidal from a molecular orbital point of view. In so doing we can start by considering a more symmetrical trigonal planar reference structure and constructing the molecular orbitals for this geometry. <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a> shows a qualitative molecular orbital diagram for planar EH<sub>3</sub> and how the orbitals change in energy as the geometry is changed to trigonal pyramidal. This is known as a Walsh diagram; details of how it is constructed and the symmetry arguments involved are beyond the scope of this book but can be found in the books on molecular orbital theory listed in the bibliography.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig7.4">
<img src="../images/fig7.4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 7.4</b> An orbital interaction diagram for EH3.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The important points to note are as follows. For a planar, 8-electron species, i.e. EX<sub>3</sub>Z, the HOMO is the non-bonding a<sub>2</sub>&#x2033; orbital in <i>D</i><sub>3</sub>h symmetry and the LUMO is the 2a<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; &#x03C3; antibonding orbital. As the symmetry <a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Chapter 7 Structure</a>is lowered from planar to trigonal pyramidal, i.e. <i>D</i><sub>3h</sub> to <i>C</i><sub>3v</sub>, these two orbitals take on the same symmetry, ai in <i>C</i><sub>3v</sub> and are therefore able to mix which results in a lowering of the energy of the HOMO (now 2a<sub>1</sub>) since it becomes slightly bonding, and a raising in energy of the LUMO (now 3a<sub>1</sub>) as it becomes more antibonding. This type of distortion is known as a second-order Jahn&#x2013;Teller distortion and it is the lowering in energy of the HOMO which drives the distortion and results in 8-electron EX<sub>3</sub>Z species having a trigonal pyramidal geometry rather than being trigonal planar. Note that in a 6-electron species such as BF<sub>3</sub>, the doubly degenerate HOMO is lower in energy for the planar structure consistent with the observed geometry for this molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">We can take this argument a little further by considering the extent to which a distortion from planar to pyramidal will occur. In other words, what factors determine how pyramidal the molecule will become? In fact, this is governed largely by the energy separation between the HOMO and LUMO in the planar reference structure (the HOMO&#x2013;LUMO gap). In situations where the energy separation is small, the orbitals can mix more effectively and the corresponding distortion to pyramidal will be large, whereas for a large energy gap, only small distortions will be observed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Another point to note is that for a given element, E, the molecule will become more pyramidal as the electronegativity of X increases since this will lead to a greater separation in energy between the orbitals of E and X which will lower the energy of 2a<sub>1</sub>&#x2032;. These ideas based on <a href="#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a> can also be used to rationalise why the CH<sub>3</sub> radical is planar whereas CF<sub>3</sub> and related silicon radicals are pyramidal.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">If we now consider the energy levels for the group 15 EX<sub>3</sub>Z species, the energy gap will decrease as the group is descended for two reasons. Firstly, the a<sub>2</sub>&#x2033; HOMO will rise in energy as the element centre becomes less electronegative and secondly, the 2a<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; LUMO will fall in energy as the central atom becomes larger since the orbitals are getting bigger and more diffuse such that overlap is less efficient and the orbital is not so antibonding.</p>
<p class="indent">Not only does this model rationalize why pyramidality increases down the group but it also accounts for a related observation that pyramidal inversion energy barriers increase as the group is descended. In NH<sub>3</sub>, the barrier to inversion at the nitrogen centre is about 25 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> whereas for PH<sub>3</sub> it is much larger at around 140 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. This is directly related to the increasing pyramidality since, as a molecule becomes more pyramidal, the energy difference between 2a<sub>1</sub> in <i>C</i><sub>3v</sub>and 2a<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; in <i>D</i><sub>3h</sub> becomes larger. In fact, this energy difference can be taken as a measure of the activation energy for inversion through a planar transition state.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">We should note that whilst pyramidal inversion energy barriers through a trigonal planar geometry do increase down the group in group 15, for the heavier congeners, an alternative process involving a T-shaped transition state has recently been found to be lower in energy.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Note that in all of these arguments, s&#x2013;p mixing, if not explicit hybridization, is an important factor and also that there is nothing particularly special about an interbond angle of 90&#x00B0;. There is no reason why the distortion should not continue to angles less than 90&#x00B0; if this results in a further lowering of the energy of the HOMO.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:left;">Space does not permit a fuller discussion of the molecular orbital theory employed in the section. For this and a more in depth treatment of second order Jahn-Teller effects, the reader is refered to Albright, Burdett and Whangbo (1985) and Gimarc (1979).</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Another trend which can be rationalised along similar lines concerns the increasing pyramidality found for the higher homologues of alkenes, R<sub>2</sub>E=ER<sub>2</sub> (R = C to Sn). Thus whilst alkenes are generally planar, <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5(a)</a>, the so-called disilenes, digermenes and distannenes increasingly adopt a <i>trans</i> bent geometry where each E centre is trigonal pyramidal rather than trigonal planar, <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5(b)</a>. A molecular orbital scheme and associated second order Jahn-Teller effects can be employed to account for this trend, but also relevant are the energetics of the hypothetical fragments R<sub>2</sub>E. Thus if <a id="page_90" class="page">Page 90, Chapter 7 Structure</a>the so-called singlet-triplet energy difference is small, as it is for carbon, two triplet fragments can combine to give a planar structure, as shown in <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5(c)</a>, whereas for the larger singlet-triplet energy differences which occur as the group is descended (due to increasing s-p promotion energies, see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>), two singlet fragments combine to give the <i>trans</i> bent structure, <a href="#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5(d)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The molecular orbital arguments presented above are quite general and can be used to rationalize most, if not all, of the structural trends observed in p-block chemistry. As is so often the case in chemistry, two apparently different theories or approaches are complementary rather than contradictory. The molecular orbital method is useful for understanding electronic structure but VSEPR is preferable in view of its simplicity, for quickly predicting structure.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>7.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The Zintl principle</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As a final section on structure, we will consider a principle, which has been called the Zintl principle, that is helpful in identifying structural similarities between seemingly disparate compounds. Another name for this idea is the isoelectronic principle which is much more descriptive since it indicates that the key to structural similarity is to be found in the number of electrons (specifically valence electrons). Thus, if a set of compounds have the same overall number of valence electrons they are likely to have similar structures provided that the elements do not differ widely in electronegativity or polarizability.</p>
<p class="indent">As a first example, we can consider polymeric compounds which have the cubic diamond structure. These include the so-called III&#x2013;V (or 13&#x2013;15) compounds boron nitride (BN), aluminium phosphide (AlP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs), the II-VI (or 12&#x2013;16) compounds zinc selenide (ZnSe) and cadmiun telluride (CdTe) and the I&#x2013;VII (or 11&#x2013;17) compounds copper(I) bromide (CuBr) and silver iodide (AgI) all of which have four bond pairs per atom and no lone pairs.</p>
<p class="indent">For more ionic systems, an example is the structure of magnesium diboride, MgB<sub>2</sub>. In this material the magnesium is present as Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, the two electrons lost having been transferred to the boron atoms. Since there are two borons per magnesium, each boron is present as B<sup>&#x2013;</sup> which is isoelectronic with carbon and the structure comprises planar, hexagonal sheets of boron atoms isostructural with the sheets in graphite (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>). Similarly, in lithium arsenide, LiAs, the arsenic is present as As <sup>&#x2013;</sup> and is isostructural with grey selenium (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6(c)</a>) whilst in calcium disilicide, CaSi<sub>2</sub>, the silicons are present as Si<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and are isostructural with orthorhombic black phosphorus (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5(c)</a>). Note that in calcium carbide, CaC<sub>2</sub>, the C<sub>2</sub> unit is present as a discrete C<sub>2</sub><sup>2&#x2013;</sup> ion isostructural with N<sub>2</sub> which illustrates the prevalence of &#x03C0;-bonding amongst the 2p elements. As a final example, we may note that the thallium atoms in the structure of NaTl are present as Tl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and are arranged in a diamond-like, three-dimensional network. Many ternary compounds can also be rationalized according to these ideas.</p>
