<h1 class="ch-title">3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Periodicity in the properties of the elements</h1>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we will look at the properties of the elements themselves and attempt to understand the origin of the observed periodic trends. The first, and perhaps most important, point to note is that the p-block is the only part of the periodic table which contains non-metals; all of the s-, d- and f-block elements are metals. Moreover, a look at <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> reveals that within the p-block, the metals are found in the bottom left-hand corner whilst the so-called metalloids or semi-metals, shown in circles, lie along a diagonal from top left to bottom right with the non-metals, shown in bold type, occupying the top right of the Table. There is, therefore, a trend from metallic to non-metallic character as we move from bottom left to top right. This pattern correlates precisely with the trend seen for the element electronegativities discussed in the previous chapter and, as we shall see, it is electronegativity which we can use to rationalize the observations described above.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Hydrogen is something of a special case. It is certainly a non-metal under normal conditions, its electronegativity (2.20, Pauling; 2.300, Allen) being such as to place it in the non-metal class. It is therefore somewhat out of sorts with other s-block elements, but its unique chemistry is such that it is often placed in group on its own.</p>

<p class="sidebar">The categories illustrated in <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> are not without some ambiguity particularly with regard to which elements are classed as metalloids; borders are often open to interpretation. Thus, bismuth and polonium are sometimes described as metalloids.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Before we look for an explanation of why particular elements have the properties they do, it is as well to be clear about what is meant by the terms &#x2018;metal, metalloid and non-metal&#x2019;. For our purposes, it is probably sufficient to concentrate on the electrical properties whereby we can define metals as conductors, non-metals as insulators and the metalloids as semiconductors. These properties can be understood in terms of the so-called band theory of solids which we can illustrate with the aid of the simple diagrams shown in <a href="#fig3.1">Fig 3.1.</a><a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Band theory is essentially the molecular orbital theory of solids. For small molecules, we get a small number of discrete orbitals (bonding, antibonding etc.) equal to the number of atomic orbitals from which they are derived. For solids, the number of atomic orbitals is very large and so the resulting large number of molecular orbitals tend to be very closely spaced in energy and usually occur in groups which are called bands.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">For conductors, <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1(a)</a>, we have a partially filled band of orbitals (the bold lines indicate that part which is filled, the dashed lines the part which is unfilled) and electrons can readily be excited into unfilled levels in which they can move easily through the solid. An important characteristic is that the resulting high electrical conductivity decreases slightly with increasing temperature (due to increased scattering of electrons resulting from lattice vibrations). For semiconductors, <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1(b)</a>, a filled band is separated from an unfilled band by a small energy gap, the so-called band-gap. Electrons are easily promoted by thermal excitation from the filled levels (in which they cannot move) to the unfilled, delocalized, so-called conduction band resulting in a dramatic increase in conductivity with temperature (this outweighs the tendency for conductivity to decrease with temperature as found in metals). For insulators, <a href="#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1(c)</a>, the band-gap is too large to allow for easy promotion of electrons and so no conduction occurs.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Returning now to the elements, a comparison of <a href="#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a> and the Allen electronegativities shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#tab2.6">Table 2.6</a> in the previous chapter reveals that elements with an electronegativity smaller than about 1.9 are metals whereas those with electronegativities greater than about 2.2 are non-metals. Thus the metalloids all fall within the fairly narrow range of electronegativity of 1.9 to 2.2 and we can use this range of electronegativities to define the metalloid band which is shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig 2.6</a> Let us see why it is that electronegativity is important in this regard.</p>
<p class="indent">In the previous chapter we saw that the energy separation between the valence s and p orbitals is related to electronegativity such that those elements with the largest electronegativity also have the largest valence s&#x2013;p energy separation. Thus, if we consider the elements with low electronegativity, the s and p orbitals are close together in energy and are therefore able to easily mix or overlap with each other (this is true whether we are considering s&#x2013;p mixing on a particular atom, i.e. hybridization, or s&#x2013;p overlap between atoms in the formation of molecular orbitals). The result of this ease of mixing is that when a number of atoms are placed in close proximity to each other, there is extensive orbital overlap between atoms (s&#x2013;s, p&#x2013;p and s&#x2013;p) and closely spaced energy bands with a relatively large width are formed. This overlap is made easier by the fact that orbitals of the elements of low electronegativity tend to be fairly diffuse with correspondingly large radial extensions since the electrons are not tightly held. Wide and closely spaced bands tend to overlap with each other resulting in one large band which is only partly filled with electrons. This is a characteristic of metals wherein the bonding is highly delocalized, and the fact that they are only partly filled results, as we have seen above, in electrical conductivity.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">For the s- and p-block metals in particular, the number of valence electrons is generally less than the number of valence orbitals which necessarily results in the bands being only partially filled.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">For elements with a large electronegativity, the s&#x2013;p energy separation is correspondingly large. Extensive s&#x2013;p mixing and overlap between the orbitals of neighbouring atoms therefore tends to be reduced with the result that extensively delocalized bonding is disfavoured with respect to the formation of localized covalent bonds. For the elements nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine, this includes multiple bonding and covalently bonded diatomics result, whereas for elements such as phosphorus and sulfur, single bonds <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>predominate which result in larger molecular or polymeric structures. In these elements there are large energy separations between filled and unfilled orbitals or bands even for polymeric structures, and as a consequence, they are insulators. The fact that high electronegativity results in valence electrons being tightly bound is also a reason for delocalised bonding being unfavourable.</p>
<p class="indent">The situation for the metalloids is intermediate between these two extremes. The band structure of the polymeric or macromolecular structures which these materials adopt resembles that of the non-metals in that bands are either filled or unfilled, but the band gap is small and electrons are therefore easily promoted to the conduction band resulting in electrical conductivity.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A fuller discussion of Pelerls and Jahn-Teller distortions is given in Albright, Burdett and Whangbo (1985).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An alternative rationale for the observed metallic or non-metallic properties of the elements is associated with what is called a Peierls distortion. Briefly, a Peierls distortion (the solid-state analogue of a Jahn-Teller distortion) is expected to occur in any situation where there is a partially filled band resulting in the formation of a band-gap and an overall lowering of the energy of the filled orbitals at the expense of raising the energy of the unfilled ones. From a structural point of view, this results in a delocalised structure distorting to a structure of lower symmetry in which the bonding is more localised.</p>
<p class="indent">In principle, any structure with a partially filled band, i.e. a metal, should distort but the magnitude of the distortion is all important. This magnitude depends on the number of electrons present (the more you can stabilise, the better) but also, crucially, on the element electronegativity and its relation to valence orbital energies. Thus, if we start with a hypothetical delocalised structure, we can see what happens as we move from left to right in the periodic table. On the left hand side where electronegativity is small, all the orbitals are close in energy and there is little to be gained from lowering the energy of some of them and this factor, coupled with the small number of electrons present, means that there is little driving force for any distortion to a structure with more localised bonding and a metallic structure is prefered. Moreover, any smart distortion that might be favoured energetically is likely to be overcome by thermal vibrations in the lattice. For elements on the right, however, the fact that the valence orbital energies are widely separated means that a lot can be gained by distorting a hypothetical delocalised structure to a more localised one since it is possible to lower some orbitals in energy by a considerable amount. This factor, coupled with the larger number of valence electrons present results in a large driving force for distortion to a structure with localised rather than delocalised covalent bonding, i.e. a non-metallic form.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The term allotrope is used here to distinguish between different forms of the same element, for example white phosphorus, P4, and polymeric red phosphorus. Polymorphism is used to distinguish between different crystalline modifications of the same molecular form such as the orthorhombic and monoclinic forms of S<sub>8</sub>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">It will now be useful to look at the structures of the elements in a little more detail in order to better appreciate some of the points discussed above although we will not deal with this topic comprehensively, especially the extensive allotropy found for some elements like phosphorus and sulfur.<a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a></p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.1">
<h2 class="main">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Groups 1 and 2</h2>
<p class="noindent">With the exception of hydrogen, which exists under normal conditions as a gas containing diatomic molecules, all the elements of groups 1 and 2 are metals and have typical metallic structures; either body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic or hexagonal close-packed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A fuller discussion of the complex allotropy of elemental boron can be found in Greenwood and Eamshaw (1984).</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.2">
<h2 class="main">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Group 13</h2>
<p class="noindent">The only non-metallic element in this group is boron which is generally classed as a metalloid. Elemental boron exists as a number of different allotropes/polymorphs each of which is a polymeric or macromolecular solid. Most of these forms contain B<sub>12</sub> icosahedra, linked together in complicated three-dimensional arrangements. This structural complexity is a manifestation of the fact that boron is electron deficient in the sense that it has four valence orbitals but only three valence electrons. This type of electron deficiency, which inevitably occurs on the left-hand side of the periodic table, usually results in delocalized metallic bonding but, as noted above, boron is too electronegative to be a metal and instead forms more localized covalent bonds resulting in metalloid characteristics (note, however, that as a result of boron&#x2019;s electron deficiency, many of the B&#x2013;B bonds are multicentre bonds rather than the more usual 2-centre-2-electron bonds found further to the right in the table).</p>
<p class="indent">The remaining elements in this group are all metals, aluminium and thallium having typical close-packed metallic structures with twelve nearest neighbours. Indium has a slightly distorted close-packed structure with four atoms marginally closer than the other eight but gallium has a rather unusual structure in which each gallium atom has one neighbour (2.44 &#x00C5;) considerably nearer than the others which occur in pairs at 2.70, 2.73 and 2.79 &#x00C5;. In fact the structure of solid gallium is quite similar to that of solid iodine, which consists of discrete I<sub>2</sub> molecules (see later), and it has been suggested that weakly bonded Ga<sub>2</sub> molecules are present in the solid phase of this element.</p>
<p class="indent">Group 13 is often considered to be the worst group in the periodic table for trends since, in as much as any are apparent, they often seem to be rather irregular. Note, however, that we can use electronegativity to rationalize some of what is outlined above. Boron is too electronegative to be a metal but the least electronegative elements, aluminium, indium and thallium, adopt typical metallic structures albeit slightly distorted in the case of indium. Gallium, the second most electronegative element in the group, has a structure in which incipient bond localization (in the form of the Ga<sub>2</sub> units mentioned earlier) typical of the metalloids is present.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.3">
<h2 class="main">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Group 14</h2>
<p class="noindent">Group 14 is perhaps the group that best illustrates the trend from non-metallic to metallic properties as the group is descended reflecting the corresponding decrease in electronegativity. Carbon is a non-metal and is found in two common allotropic forms namely graphite and diamond, the <a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>structures of which are illustrated in <a href="#fig3.2">Figs. 3.2</a> and <a href="#fig3.3">3.3.</a> In diamond, each carbon atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbours at the vertices of a tetrahedron, the atoms being linked by strong, directional, 2-centre-2-electron covalent bonds. Graphite, in contrast, is a layered structure consisting of planar hexagonal sheets stacked on top of each other. Each carbon atom is surrounded by three nearest neighbours and extensive element&#x2013;element &#x03C0;-bonding is important resulting from the overlap of one p orbital per carbon atom aligned perpendicular to the hexagonal sheet. It is this feature which gives rise to graphite being a conductor and, in this regard, makes it something of an exception as a non-metal.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Both diamond and graphite occur as two polymorphs. Cubic diamond is the most common (<a href="#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>) in which all six-membered rings have a chair conformation whereas in hexagonal diamond, some rings adopt the slightly less stable boat form. The most stable form of graphite is the hexagonal form (<a href="#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>) but a rhombohedral modification is also known, the two types differing in the stacking arrangement of the hexagonal sheets. Note that the terms cubic and hexagonal etc. refer to the symmetry of the crystal lattice and not to the coordination geometry.</p>

<p class="indent">Extensive &#x03C0;-bonding is also a feature in the structures of the newly discovered molecular forms of carbon, the fullerenes, of which the archetype is Buckminsterfullerene or <small>C<sub>60</sub> </small>shown in <a href="#fig3.4">Fig 3.4</a></p>
<p class="indent">Silicon and germanium both have the cubic diamond structure and are classified as metalloids largely as a result of their semiconducting properties. These are elements of intermediate electronegativity in which localized covalent bonding occurs but for which the valence s&#x2013;p energy separations are small enough to result in fairly closely spaced bands. We might note that diamond, which has a similar band structure to Si and Ge, is an insulator due to its much larger band gap resulting from the greater s&#x2013;p energy separation although it is often referred to as a high band-gap semiconductor (rather than <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>a non-metal) in the field of solid state physics; it all depends on your point of view.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The much larger band-gap in diamond, as opposed to that in silicon or germanium, is also a result of the smaller size of carbon; the C&#x2013;C bonds are therefore significantly shorter than the corresponding Si&#x2013;Si and Ge&#x2013;Ge bonds which leads to correspondingly better orbital overl</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Another difference between diamond and silicon or germanium is that pure diamond is clear and colourless (colours in natural diamonds are due to impurities) whereas silicon and germanium are black. These properties also result from the differences in the band-gaps; visible light has sufficient energy to promote electrons from the lower to the higher band in silicon or germanium (but not in diamond) and hence is strongly absorbed.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Tin lies close to the metalloid&#x2013;metal border and exists as two allotropes, grey and white tin, the former having the cubic diamond structure. The latter has a much less regular structure, still with four nearest neighbours (slightly further away than in grey tin), but with additional tin atoms much closer than the second nearest neighbours in the grey tin structure making white tin more dense and more metallic in its properties. There is a suggestion that these two structures contain tin in two different oxidation states, &#x002B;4 and &#x002B;2 respectively, since grey tin dissolves in conc. HC1 to give tin(IV) chloride, SnCl4(aq), whereas white tin dissolves to give tin(II) chloride, SnCl2(aq). This may seem a curious statement since we normally regard elements as having a zero oxidation state, but what is implied is that whereas in grey tin all four valence electrons are used in bonding, in white tin, only two are used (the metal is thought of here as an ionic structure with metal cations and electrons as the anions). This is an example of the <i>inert pair effect</i>, which we will discuss in detail in the next chapter, in which the valence s pair is not used in bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of an inert s pair is also relevant to the structure of lead, which although that of a typical close-packed metal, has particularly long Pb&#x2013;Pb distances indicative of the presence of a non-bonding 6s pair of electrons. The interatomic separations in the structures of In and Tl are also long, indicating that a similar situation occurs here as well. In general, we expect longer distances when the s pair is not involved in bonding; for example, the ionic radius of Sn(II) is larger than that of Sn(IV), see later.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.4">
<h2 class="main">3.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Group 15</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nitrogen is a true non-metal and exists exclusively as a diatomic molecule, N2, in which the two nitrogen atoms are held together by an extremely strong triple bond. This strong, directional, localized covalent bonding is to be expected for such an electronegative element, and we can also note the presence and importance of N&#x2013;N &#x03C0;-bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast to nitrogen, phosphorus does not exist as P<sub>2</sub> molecules except under conditions of high temperature and low pressure in the gas phase. The <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>stable elemental forms are white (or yellow) phosphorus, which contains tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub> molecules, and a variety of polymeric allotropes such as red, black and violet phosphorus. All forms of phosphorus contain three-coordinate phosphorus atoms in which each phosphorus is linked to three others by single P&#x2013;P bonds. This feature typifies an important difference between the chemistry of phosphorus and nitrogen, and between the first and second row elements in general, in that there is a reluctance of the heavier elements to form stable element-element &#x03C0; bonds resulting in a prevalence of element&#x2013;element single bonding or <i>catenation</i>, a topic which we will discuss in more detail later. The structure of orthorhombic black phosphorus, the most thermodynamically stable form, is illustrated in <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5(c)</a> and consists of layers of linked six-membered rings in the chair conformation, whilst that of a closely related higher pressure rhombohedral form is shown in <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5(d)</a>. At even higher pressures, a cubic structure analogous to &#x03B1;-polonium is adopted (see later). Red phosphorus is amorphous and violet phosphorus, although crystalline, has a rather complicated structure.</p>

<p class="indent">The common &#x03B1; forms of arsenic, antimony and bismuth are isostructural and consist of hexagonal sheets similar to that shown for rhombohedral black phosphorus, see <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5(d)</a>. Other allotropic forms also exist, two of particular interest being high pressure metallic forms which for antimony is a hexagonal close-packed structure and for bismuth is &#x03B6;-Bi in which each bismuth is surrounded by eight nearest neighbours in a body-centred cubic lattice.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Isostructural means that the structures are the same.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Before leaving the group 15 elements we should note an interesting trend in the interatomic distances in the isostructural rhombohedral black phosphorus, &#x03B1;-As, &#x03B1;-Sb and &#x03B1;-Bi. As mentioned above and shown in <a href="#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>, each phosphorus atom in rhombohedral black phosphorus has three nearest neighbours arranged at the vertices of a trigonal pyramid. In addition, there are three other atoms at a greater distance <i>trans</i> to the three primary bonds (in the next sheet) such that the overall coordination is octahedral with three short and three long bonds. The observed trend is that as the group is descended, the ratio of the long to short bonds decreases such that the bonds <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>become more nearly equal in length. This is a definite trend from localized covalent bonding in a sheet structure towards a more delocalized, three-dimensional metallic bonding and is consistent with the decreasing electronegativity of the elements as the group is descended.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Polymorphism is also common in the elemental forms of sulfur. Thus S<sub>8</sub> exists in one orthorhombic and two monoclinic modifications.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In contrast, sulfur does not exist as S2 or S3, except at high temperatures, but rather as S-S singly bonded species, the number of allotropes of which is extremely large. We will not dwell on the details here except to say that besides the common form of sulfur which consists of Sg rings (<a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>), many other rings of different sizes have been characterized together with polymeric, fibrous forms which contain helical chains of sulfur atoms.

</aside>
<p class="indent">Selenium also has properties consistent with its classification as a non-metal and its allotropy, although much less extensive than that of sulfur, comprises modifications which contain Seg rings and a hexagonal form in which the selenium atoms form unbranched, helical chains (<a href="#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>). A structurally very complex vitreous form of selenium is also known in which rings of up to 1000 atoms are thought to be present. Tellurium, in contrast, exists as only a single allotrope which is isostructural with hexagonal selenium. A similar trend in bond distances to that noted for the heavier group 15 elements is also apparent for the hexagonal forms of selenium and tellurium. Thus the ratio of the short, covalent bond lengths to the longer interchain distances is smaller for tellurium than for selenium, again indicating a trend to metallic character.</p>
<p class="indent">The final element in this group is polonium which is the least electronegative and most metallic in character. It has a structure in which each atom is surrounded by six nearest neighbours with a simple cubic unit cell, the only element in the periodic table for which this is found.</p>

<p class="indent">This observation is consistent with a trend towards increasing metallic character as a result of decreasing element electronegativity and in this regard it is interesting to note that under high pressures, solid iodine does become metallic as evidenced by the onset of electrical conductivity. We can think of this as forcing the atoms together to such an extent that orbital overlap becomes sufficient for extensive delocalization to occur which results in metallic bonding. A similar situation is thought to occur for dihydrogen, H2, under very high pressures as well as for a number of metalloids.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We should also recognise that van der Waals or induced dipole-induced dipole interactions increase as the elements become more polarizable on descending the group which accounts for the trend in the physical states of the elements from gas to liquid to solid.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another point to note is that the I&#x2013;I bond distance in solid iodine (2.72 &#x00C5;) is considerably longer than that in gaseous iodine (2.67 &#x00C5;). The longer bond in the solid state is undoubtedly a result of the closeness of the intermolecular contacts, a feature we shall meet again when dealing with the compounds of iodine (and other elements) and discuss at that time.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also noteworthy that the halogens become more intensely coloured as the group is descended; F2 is essentially colourless, Cl<sub>2</sub> is pale green, Br<sub>2</sub> is deep red-brown and I<sub>2</sub> is dark purple which we shall see is also a feature of the compounds formed by these elements, and that an explanation has much in common with that for the trends in bond distances described in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p class="noindent">The group 18 elements are all monatomic gases under ambient conditions and are entirely non-metallic. Whilst this certainly reflects their high electronegativity, the general lack of reactivity resulting from a filled valence shell is also an important factor.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.8">
<h2 class="main">3.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>General features</h2>
<p class="noindent">An interesting insight into the relationships between many of the apparently very disparate structures of the elements in the p-block can be had by considering the numbers of valence electrons present. For example, <a href="#fig3.8">Figure 3.8(a)</a> shows a section of the structure of cubic diamond (which is also the structure found for silicon, germanium and grey tin). Each carbon atom forms four 2-centre-2-electron C&#x2013;C bonds and there are no lone pairs of electrons. If we now move one group to the right (i.e. to group 15) we have added one valence electron per atom or two electrons per pair of atoms. This leads to <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a>the breaking of one bond (out of four) for each atom such that this bond pair becomes two lone pairs, one on each atom. The resulting atomic coordination is trigonal pyramidal (three bond pairs and one lone pair). If the bonds broken are the vertical bonds in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8(a)</a> (of which there is one per atom), the resulting structure comprises parallel two-dimensional sheets of fused six-membered rings in the chair conformation as shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8(b)</a>. This is the structure of rhombohedral black phosphorus, &#x03B1;-As, &#x03B1;-Sb and &#x03B1;-Bi.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">It should be noted that the relationship of the layers in rhombohedral black phosphorus to each other is not exactly the same as the corresponding layers in cubic diamond. In rhombohedral black phosphorus the sheets have moved relative to each other to avoid close contacts between the lone pairs. Similar dislocations or translations occur in the tellurium and diiodine structures with respect to the positions shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8</a> in order to minimise lone pair-lone pair contacts.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">For the elemental structures described here the number of bonds formed by any particular element is given by the so-called 8&#x2013;N rule where N is the number of valence electrons.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If we move to group 16, there are now another two electrons per pair of atoms which again leads to the breaking of one bond per atom resulting in two-coordination (two bond pairs and two lone pairs). This can give rise to a helical structure as found in elemental tellurium (and one allotrope of sulfur and selenium) and is shown in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8(c)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the addition of a further electron per atom takes us to group 17 and we break another bond so that each atom is now one-coordinate with three lone pairs. This is the structure of dichlorine, dibromine and diiodine in the solid-state and is represented in <a href="#fig3.8">Fig. 3.8(d)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative approach to rationalising the relationships between the structures of the p-block elements is in terms of Peierls distortions mentioned earlier. Thus if we take a simple cubic lattice as shown in <a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9(a)</a> and which represents the structure of &#x03B1;-polonium, a metal, we can derive the structures of helical selenium and tellurium by removing four lines per lattice point (<a href="#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9(b)</a>) together with those of orthorhombic black phosphorus and rhombohedral black phosphorus plus &#x03B1;-As, Sb and Bi by removing three lines per lattice point in the ways shown in <a href="#fig3.9">Figs. 3.9(c)</a> and (<a href="#fig3.9">d</a>) respectively. A full treatment of this approach is beyond the scope of this book, but it is possible to derive the structures of most of the elemental forms of the p-block elements along these lines (boron is a bit of a problem). <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter 3 Periodicity in the properties of the elements</a><a href="#fig3.9">Figs. 3.9(c)</a> and <a href="#fig3.9">(d)</a>, in particular, illustrate how closely related are these two forms of phosphorus.</p>

<p class="noindent">A final point of interest whilst dealing with the elements themselves concerns the so-called binding energies (or atomization energy) which relate to the magnitude of the interatomic forces which bind the elements together.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, in a diatomic molecule, the binding energy is defined according to <a href="#eq3.1">Eqn 3.1</a> whereas for a macromolecular solid, <a href="#eq3.2">Eqn 3.2</a> is appropriate.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 3.10</b> The binding energies for the elements of the first two rows.</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A graphical representation of the binding energies for the elements of the first two rows is shown in <a href="#fig3.10">Fig. 3.10</a> from which it is apparent that the energies peak in group 14 and fall to zero for the group 18 elements. The nature of this graph simply reflects the number of valence electrons available for bonding. The trend from lithium to carbon in the first row is a consequence of the number of valence electrons increasing from one to four. For nitrogen, although there are five valence electrons, only three are used in bonding (the remaining two are a lone pair) and so the binding energy is similar to that of boron (note that this is true even though elemental boron and nitrogen have quite different structures and very different melting and boiling points). Similarly, sulfur with six valence electrons uses only two in element&#x2013;element bonding and therefore has a similar binding energy to beryllium. In general, the reactivity of an element will increase as its binding energy decreases although the noble gases in group 18 are an obvious exception.</p>
