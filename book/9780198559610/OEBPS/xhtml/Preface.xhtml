<h1 class="fmmain"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">This book is a revised version of the Chemistry Primer entitled <i>Periodicity and thep-Block Elements.</i> In addition to having updated and substantially rewritten parts of the first book, the most obvious change is that certain aspects of s-block element chemistry are now discussed explicitly and so this group of elements are therefore included in the title. As in the first book, I have sought to provide an overview of some of the important trends &#x0028;periodicity&#x0029; found in the properties of the s- and p-block elements and the compounds that they form, and to provide the reader with some simple &#x2018;rules of thumb&#x2019; whereby they might appreciate and better understand these trends. In a book of this length, I have had to be selective and cannot possibly cover all aspects of periodicity &#x0028;I have not included anything on solubility trends in s-block compounds for example&#x0029;, but I hope that those aspects which I have chosen will be both useful and informative. I make no apologies for the non-mathematical treatment adopted in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. If the student wants more, it is available in other texts listed in the bibliography, but I suspect that my qualitative and descriptive approach &#x0028;in common with a great many other texts&#x0029; will be perfectly adequate for most of the target audience.</p>
<p class="fmindent">As with the first book, I called upon many people to read the book in draft form and for this I thank my colleague Guy Orpen together with Craig Rice, Edward Robins, Yvonne Lawson, and Si&#x0203;n James who are all current members of my group.</p>
