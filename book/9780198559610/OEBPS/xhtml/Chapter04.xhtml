<h1 class="ch-title">4<span class="space">&#160;</span>General features of s- and p-block element compounds</h1>
<p class="noindent">Before considering the various classes of compounds, which we will do in the next chapter, it will be useful to look at some general aspects, such as trends in common oxidation states, and the effect of atomic size on coordination numbers (<a href="#sec4.1">Sections 4.1</a> and <a href="#sec4.2">4.2</a>) which, together with properties such as electronegativity described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, will form the basis of our understanding of s- and p-block element structure and reactivity. In addition we will look at trends in bond strengths (<a href="#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>) and finally at some general observations regarding compound types using the so-called van Arkel-Ketelaar diagram (<a href="#sec4.4">Section 4.4</a>).</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.1">
<h2 class="main"><b>4.1 Oxidation states, valence and the inert pair effect</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As a first step, we should briefly review the method by which numbers for the oxidation state of an element are derived.</p>
<p class="indent">If we consider CF<sub>4</sub>, then it is usual in assigning oxidation states to partition the elements according to their electronegativity such that we obtain C<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> and 4F<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. This is, therefore, a compound of carbon(IV) or carbon in the &#x002B;4 oxidation state, although it is important to stress that this is only a formalism and does not imply that CF<sub>4</sub> is in any way an ionic compound: fluorine is present as F(&#x2013;I) or fluoride. Similarly, NF<sub>3</sub> is a compound of nitrogen(III) since fluorine is more electronegative than nitrogen. In contrast, for NH3, nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen and so the atoms would be partitioned as N<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> and 3H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> thereby giving nitrogen(&#x2013;III).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-22em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">There is a sense, using the examples NF3, N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, in which the oxidation state formalism seems unwieldy and indeed some (notably Green, see <i>J.OrgamometChem.</i>, (1995), <b>500</b>,127) have argued that this is so. Alternative constructions which concentrate on the electron count around the atom in question have been developed, although they have so far mostly been used in the context of d-block chemistry. Nevertheless, while aware of any possible limitations of the oxidation state formalism, we will use it here to illustrate certain aspects of periodicity.</p>
<p class="sidebar">In solid-state chemistry, a slightly different concept of so-called bond-valence is often used since the assignment of valence and oxidation state is not always straight-forward. Thus, the valence <i>V</i><sub>A</sub> of an atom A in a compound AX<sub>n</sub> is distributed over all the A&#x2013;X bonds according to the valence sum rule &#x2211; <i>S<sub>ax</sub>= V<sub>a</sub></i> where <i>S<sub>ax</sub></i> is <i></i> the bond valence of a particular bond and is correlated with the length of that bond according to <i>s<sub>Ax</sub>=</i> exp&#x005B;(r<sub>0</sub> &#x2013; <i>D<sub>AX</sub>)/b&#x005D;</i> where <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>b</i> are empirically detemined parameters, and <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> is equal to the formal oxidation state of A.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If we now consider N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, then removing four fluorines as F<sup>&#x2013;</sup> leaves N2<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> or 2N<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and so dinitrogen tetrafluoride formally contains nitrogen(II). We should note, however, that in all of the above three nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen atoms are singly bonded to three other elements and may therefore be classed as <i>trivalent</i>. This distinction between formal oxidation state and valence is an important one which we will meet again later. Similarly, the compound N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> formally contains nitrogen(I) centres (N2<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) but the nitrogen atoms are still trivalent forming a single bond to fluorine and a double bond with each other.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us now turn to some general features regarding the common oxidation states which are found for the s- and p-block elements. Probably the most notable factor is that for elements with more than one available oxidation state, the formal values usually differ by two units as indicated in <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>. These values do not constitute an exhaustive list and there are some important exceptions such as NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, which are formally nitrogen(II) and (IV) respectively which we should consider at this point.<a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a></p>

<p class="indent">The key aspect to note is that elements in their common oxidation states listed in <a href="#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a> contain no unpaired electrons whereas the two compounds just mentioned are both radicals, i.e. they <i>do</i> contain unpaired electrons. The reason that radicals are not all that common in s- and p-block chemistry is that the unpaired electrons would generally reside in p or sp<sup>n</sup> type hybrid orbitals which have fairly good directional properties. Overlap between these orbitals therefore tends to be favorable and reasonably strong bonds are formed such that there is a strong tendency for radical species to dimerize unless the unpaired electrons are fairly extensively delocalized or the resulting bond is particularly weak for some reason.</p>
<p class="indent">Delocalization of the unpaired electron is the situation in NO, where the unpaired electron resides in a N&#x2013;O &#x03C0;* orbital, but in NF<sub>2</sub>, for example, the unpaired elecron is in a sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid and N&#x2013;N bond formation occurs. Thus, the resulting N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, although formally a compound of nitrogen(II), contains trivalent nitrogen, as described above, and is diamagnetic, whilst nitric oxide, which is also nitrogen(II), contains genuinely divalent nitrogen and is paramagnetic; in fact N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> dissociates fairly readily in the gas phase to give NF<sub>2</sub> radicals and is not such a good example to use, the two fluorines lead to effective derealization of the unpaired electron and shrinkage of the orbital containing that electron, but in general, R<sub>2</sub>E species where E is a group 15 element almost always exist as R<sub>4</sub>E<sub>2</sub>. In the case of NO<sub>2</sub>, the weak N&#x2013;N bond in the dimer N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is the reason why appreciable dissociation into NO<sub>2</sub> radicals occurs.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Part of the reason for the reluctance of NO to dimerize to give N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which does exist in the solid state, may also be attributed to the net change of zero in bond order occuring on dimerization. Thus the bond order in NO is 2.5 since the unpaired electron resides in a <i>*</i> orbital, i.e. exactly half that of N<sub>2</sub>02 which is five in total. There is, therefore, no net increase in bonding upon dimerization, at least to a first approximation, as would more usually be the case in the dimerization of radicals.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We should note that the rarity of radicals in s- and p-block chemistry is in stark contrast to the situation found in compounds of the d- and f-block elements. Here radicals are frequently encountered and common oxidation states often differ by only one unit, e.g. Fe(II) and Fe(III). This can be traced to the fact that the valence electrons in d- and f-block complexes are generally in d and f orbitals respectively, which are more diffuse and less directional than corresponding s&#x2013;p hybrids. The tendency for compounds with unpaired electrons to dimerize with the formation of element&#x2013;element bonds is therefore not so pronounced for this reason, although several other factors are also important such as the often relatively small radial extension of d and f orbitals.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us now turn to the reasons behind the occurence of the common oxidation state values for the s- and p-block elements. As we have just seen, part of the reason has to do with the formation of compounds without unpaired electrons. The most important factor, however, concerns the attainment of a closed-shell electronic configuration, by which is meant an electron configuration that resembles that of the nearest noble gas. This idea was first enunciated by Lewis as the octet rule and its importance in <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>rationalizing a large body of knowledge in s- and p-block chemistry should not be understated. Moreover, we shall see later that most apparent violations of the octet rule are, in reality, no such thing.</p>
<p class="indent">In groups 1 and 2, the oxidation states are 1 and 2 respectively resulting from loss of the valence s electrons and any higher oxidation states are precluded by the prohibitively large energies required to remove electrons from the next quantum shell down. The reason why compounds of the group 2 elements in the &#x002B;1 oxidation state are not observed is less obvious, but thermodynamic calculations indicate that disproportionation reactions (<a href="#eq4.1">Eqn. 4.1</a>) for simple salts EX (X = halide, for example) are strongly exothermic being driven by the large lattice energy of the resulting EX<sub>2</sub> salt.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">If we consider group 13, the common oxidation states are &#x002B;3 and &#x002B;1. The former arises by formal loss of the three valence electrons, <i>n</i>s<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>p<sup>l</sup>, which gives a &#x002B;3 centre with a noble gas core (remember that we are dealing with a formalism here; in TIF<sub>3</sub> it is reasonable to view this compound as predominantly ionic with an Tl<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> cation and three fluoride anions, but for the much more covalent M3 the charges are purely formal).</p>
<p class="indent">The &#x002B;3 state is observed for all elements in this group, but the &#x002B;1 state, which results from removal of the single valence p electron, is common only for the heavier elements, particularly so for thallium. In fact, the &#x002B;1 oxidation state is probably more important than the &#x002B;3 state in the chemistry of thallium, and we shall see that oxidation states of two less than the group maximum are commonly observed for the 6p elements. This is usually refered to as <i>the inert pair effect</i> and we should consider the origin of the effect at this point using thallium as an example.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">For the 6p elements thallium, lead and bismuth, the point about lower oxidation states is certainly true; for polonium, astatine and radon, experimental data are rather scarce due to their radioactivity and consequent handling problems.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A standard and often quoted explanation is that the relatively large effective nuclear charge of thallium, resulting from the presence of the 4f and 5d elements, coupled with relativistic effects, leads to a substantial stabilization of the 6s pair relative to the 6p electron, and it is this factor which gives rise to the term &#x2018;inert pair&#x2019; itself. However, this is only part of the explanation and, indeed, the term must be seen as something of a misnomer in this regard. Although the 6s pair is stabilized by these effects, it can hardly be considered to be too low in energy (i.e. core like) in view of the relevant ionization energies which are comparable with those of the lighter elements. This is illustrated in <a href="#tab4.2">Table 4.2</a> in which values for the sum of the first three ionization energies ( &#x2211; IE 1&#x2013;3) for the group 13 elements are presented.</p>

<p class="indent">All the values in <a href="#tab4.2">Table 4.2</a> are of a comparable magnitude and we therefore cannot argue that the 6s pair of thallium is unavailable for bonding because it is too low in energy. If this argument were appropriate at all, we would expect that, of all the group 13 elements, boron would exhibit an inert pair <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>effect, since the s pair ionization energies are significantly larger for this element, a factor which is also apparent from the graph of orbital energies shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>, and one which would be particularly important for the elements further to the right in the 2p row.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-25em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that the trend in ionization energies in <a href="#tab4.2">Table 4.2</a> mirrors that found for the electronegativities of these elements, although this is not surprising since the Mulliken electronegativity scale, for example, actually uses ionization energies to calculate electronegativities. Thus, the electronegativity of gallium is higher than aluminium and that of thallium is higher than indium.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A consideration of the experimental electron promotion energies required to achieve the trivalent state, shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>, is, perhaps, more appropriate, especially when dealing with covalent compounds, and here we should note that the value for thallium is the largest in the group. However, whilst this will clearly be important, it is not that much greater than the values for the other elements and cannot, therefore, constitute a complete explanation.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the real origin of the inert pair effect for thallium is probably a combination of two factors. The high promotion energy involved in achieving the valence state is one factor, but an equally important point is the weak bonds formed by this element as a result of its large size (see later). Thus for boron, the energy required to involve the 2s pair in bonding (the promotion energy) is more than offset by the formation of three strong covalent bonds and boron is therefore more likely to occur with an oxidation state of &#x002B;3 rather than &#x002B;1 or, more precisely, it will tend to be trivalent rather than monovalent. In the case of thallium, the opposite tends to be true and the formation of two extra, much weaker bonds commensurate with the &#x002B;3 oxidation state, or trivalency, is not enough to compensate for the considerable promotion energy.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The explanation for the high promotion energy of thallium is due to spin-orbit coupling effects rather than any difference in the orbital energies. We will not concentrate on the details here except to mention that spin-orbit coupling increases with <i>n</i> (the principal quantum number) and Z*, this latter factor accounting for the apparent irregularity of the values in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. See Dasent (1965).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We should also consider the significant difference in the radial extension or size of the 6s and the 6p orbitals as mentioned in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. The importance in this context is that sp hybridization will be less efficient leading to weaker covalent bonding in situations where s orbital participation is required (such as trivalent thallium). We shall meet this idea again in later sections.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 14, the common oxidation states are &#x002B;4 and &#x002B;2, (more generally, tetravalency and divalency) with the latter being most common for tin and lead. The inert pair effect is important for Pb(II), as it was for T1(I), for the same reasons, and this oxidation state is the dominant one in lead chemistry, although we must be a little careful of generalizations of this type. For example, it is found that whilst lead(II) chloride, PbCl<sub>2</sub>, is indeed more stable than lead(IV) chloride, PbCl<sub>4</sub>, in line with the trends described above (see also <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>), the opposite is true for the organometallic alkyl compounds; e.g. tetraethyl lead, PbEt4, is stable whereas diethyl lead, PbEt<sub>2</sub>, is not (a similar situation is found for the chlorides and alkyls of thallium(III) vs. thallium(I)). We will return to this matter in <a href="#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A discussion of hybrid orbitals is given in Winter (1993).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In group 15, the common oxidation states are &#x002B;5, &#x002B;3 and &#x2013;3 or more simply, compounds are generally pentavalent or trivalent. The inert pair effect can be (and often is) said to have some influence on the importance of bismuth(III) over bismuth(V), but with oxidation states as high as &#x002B;5, there are other factors which are important in determining the relative stability of possible oxidation states. Thus, high positive oxidation states tend to be good oxidising agents since the high formal charge centres are good at attracting electrons and thereby being reduced. As such, high oxidation state centres are generally only found in association with fluorine or oxygen since <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>these very electronegative elements are themselves difficult to oxidise (this feature of high element oxidation states being found in association with fluorine and oxygen is not just restricted to the p-block, it is common in the d- and f-blocks as well; the low oxidation states of the s-block elements require no special stabilising conditions). As an example, PF5 is a known compound whereas PI5 is not. While there is undoubtedly much truth in this view, it seems somewhat at odds with the discussion presented above for the stability of thallium(III) and lead(IV) alkyls vs. halides. A resolution of this matter involves a number of factors which will be addressed in <a href="#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-37em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We can note at this point that the inert pair effect should favour the zero oxidation state for mercury, the element one to the left of thallium in the periodic table. This accounts, at least in part, for why mercury metal is rather unreactive and why the element is a liquid at room temperature since it does not form strong element-element bonds.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In group 16 we find that the &#x002B;6 oxidation state is, not surprisingly, found most often in conjunction with fluorine and oxygen although, as in the case of lead(IV), this is a generalization which can be taken a little too far. For example, tellurium hexamethyl, TeMe<sub>6</sub>, has recently been synthesized and found to be relatively stable. The other stable states are the &#x002B;4 and the &#x002B;2, although in the case of oxygen, oxidation states greater than &#x002B;2 are not observed. This is a consequence of the high electronegativity of oxygen and, strictly speaking, it will only be found in a positive oxidation state with elements of greater electronegativity which means fluorine; OF2 is an example. In H<sub>2</sub>O, oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen and is therefore formally oxygen(&#x2013;II). In both OF2 and H<sub>2</sub>O the oxygen is, of course, divalent and this is characteristic of the element. Sulphur is also often found as sulfur(&#x2013;II) although in the presence of oxygen or fluorine, compounds of S(II), S(IV) and S(VI) are well established.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">We must be a little careful in considering the differences between PF<sub>5</sub> and PI<sub>5</sub>. Thus whilst it is probably correct to say that PI5 does not exist because P(V) would oxidize iodide, we must take size effects into consideration as well; iodide is large and it is probably not possible to place five iodines around a small P(V) centre.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In group 17, the elements exhibit the widest range of oxidation states in the p-block. Fluorine, being the most electronegative element in the periodic table, is never found in formal postive oxidation states and exists as F(&#x2013;I) in all of its compounds. The heavier halogens are found in oxidations states &#x2013;1, &#x002B;1, &#x002B;3, &#x002B;5 and &#x002B;7 although the higher oxidation states are usually powerful oxidizing agents and are only found in conjunction with very electronegative atoms or groups such as fluorine.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 18 the most common oxidation state is zero, i.e. the atomic elements themselves, and this is the only state found for the elements He, Ne and Ar. Krypton is known in the &#x002B;2 oxidation state as KrF2, but only for xenon is the chemistry extensive with oxidation states of &#x002B;2, &#x002B;4 and &#x002B;6 being observed (&#x002B;8 is also known) albeit only in the presence of electronegative elements or groups. The reason for positive oxidation states being more common for the heavier elements simply reflects their lower ionization energies. The potentially extensive chemistry of radon is limited by the handling problems associated with its radioactivity.</p>
<p class="indent">Having considered the various groups in the s- and p-block let us turn to some more general points. One of these is the reluctance of the 4p elements to exhibit their highest possible or group oxidation state (c.f. the 6p elements mentioned earlier). This can be considered as another example of an inert pair effect, although it is not usually referred to as such, and, while it is not so apparent for the respective &#x002B;3 and &#x002B;4 states of gallium and germanium, arsenic(V), selenium(VI) and bromine(VII) are much less common oxidation states than phosphorus and antimony(V), sulfur and tellurium(VI) and chlorine and iodine(VII) respectively. Moreover, <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>compounds of the 4p elements exhibiting the group maximum oxidation state are more powerful oxidizing agents than their lighter and heavier congeners.</p>
<p class="indent">The reasons for the high oxidation states of the 4p elements being uncommon are probably similar to those encountered for the related situation with the 6p elements. Thus, the increased effective nuclear charge associated with the presence of the preceding 3d row will make it more difficult to involve all the valence electrons in bonding and any extra bonds formed may not be sufficiently strong to compensate. With gallium and germanium, the effect is not so dramatic in that trivalent and tetravalent compounds respectively are not unusual since the bond energies are large enough to compensate for the increased promotion or ionization energies involved. For the later elements, however, the corresponding energies may well be too large to allow for sufficient compensation from the formation of extra bonds, but this is not a wholly satisfactory explanation for a number of reasons. From the point of view of orbital energies, the s&#x2013;p separation is not excessively large (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>) nor are the ionization energies for the s pair of electrons as shown in <a href="#tab4.3">Table 4.3</a> (indeed, any irregularity is much more noticeable for the group 13 and 14 elements). With regard to promotion energies, these will involve s to d or p to d excitations and the energies are considerable, but it is not clear to what extent such excited states are chemically reasonable; in other words, the extent to which d orbitals are really involved.

<p class="sidebar">It has been calculated that once an electron has been promoted into a d orbital, the electronegativity of the valence s and p orbitals increases dramatically since the d orbitals shield the s and p orbitals only poorly. Thus if d orbitals are involved, any such promotion would make it that much harder to involve all the s and p orbitals particularly in cases, such as the 4p row, where electronegativities are already high.</p>

<p class="indent">Another point to consider is the difference between the trends in oxidation states found in the p-block and those observed in the d- and f-blocks (there are no real trends to worry about in the s-block). As we have seen, there is a general trend to lower oxidation states as the groups in the p-block are descended (most notable in groups 13&#x2013;15) which can be traced to the inert pair effect, a prominent aspect of which is the weaker bonds formed by the larger elements. In the d- and f-blocks, the reverse tends to be true, at least for the elements on the left-hand side of these blocks. Thus, third row transition metals and actinides often exhibit higher oxidation states than first row transition metals and the lanthanides respectively (e.g. Os(VIII) and U(VI) <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>have no counterpart in the chemistry of iron and neodymium respectively). This can be traced to the difference in d and f compared to s and p orbitals and relativistic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">We can consider the situation in the p-block to be &#x2018;normal&#x2019;, explanations for which having been offered above. For the heavier elements of the d and f blocks, however, relativistic effects cause a contraction of the valence (and core) s orbitals, and, to some extent, the p orbitals which leaves the d and f orbitals exposed with the electrons in these orbitals feeling a reduced effective nuclear charge or smaller effective core potential. They are therefore easier to remove or ionize and so higher oxidation states are found in the chemistry of these elements. It is also the reason why covalent bond strengths tend to increase down a group in the d-block whereas the reverse is true in the p-block; we will return to this point later. The fact that higher oxidation states are less common as the d- and f-blocks are traversed from left to right simply reflects the increasing effective nuclear charge which means the electrons are, in general, harder to remove.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">As mentioned previously, the trend to lower oxidation states in the p-block is not obvious in the later groups (i.e. groups 16&#x2013;18) for two reasons. Firstly, for the elements in the top right of the p-block, electrons are too strongly held for high oxidation states to be readily formed, and secondly, the paucity of available chemical data for the radioactive 6p elements means that any tendency to form lower oxidation states is not apparent.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>4.2 Element size and coordination numbers</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The effect of atomic size is often underestimated or understated when considering the structures of inorganic molecules, but we should bear in mind that larger atoms can and do support larger coordination numbers. We shall see many examples of this as we look at the various classes of compound, but in addition to any structural effects, we should remember that, for a given coordination number, larger central atoms are also likely to be more reactive since there is easier access to the element centre.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>4.3.1 Homonuclear bonds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Approximate bond energies, which are a measure of bond strength, for homonuclear single bonds for some of the s- and p-block elements are given in <a href="#tab4.4">Table 4.4</a>. We must exercise some care in using bond energy data since values can vary considerably depending on the compound involved (for example, the bond dissociation energy measured for the N&#x2013;N bond in N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is 167, 88 and 57 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> respectively). In making detailed comparisons, therefore, it is necessary to compare similar compounds, but we are not concerned here so much with precise energies, but rather with reasonable values from which we can discern any trends which are apparent.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Some definition of bond energy is appropriate here. In H<sub>2</sub> for example, the bond dissociation energy <i>&#x2206;U<sub>e</sub>|</i> is greater than the true bond dissociation energy <i>&#x2206;U</i><sub>0</sub><i></i> by an amount corresponding to the zero point energy even at 0 K(26 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> for H<sub>2</sub>). The value at room temperature, <i>&#x2206;U</i><sub>298</sub>,is slightly different again since translational, rotational and vibrational energy must taken into account and the dissociation enthalpy, <i>&#x2206;H</i><sub>298</sub> includes a term relating to the work done to maintain constant pressure.<i>&#x2206;U</i><sub>0</sub><i></i>, &#x2206;U<sub>298</sub> and <i>&#x2206;H</i><sub>298</sub> are usually quite similar in magnitude and the latter is available to direct experimental measurement. We will mostly use <i>&#x2206;U</i><sub>0</sub>values.</p>

<p class="indent">Firstly, it is clear that, in general, bonds become weaker as the groups are descended. This is generally attributed to the fact that the atoms are becoming larger and therefore the orbitals are also becoming larger and more diffuse to the point where overlap is poor and bonds are correspondingly weak.</p>
<p class="indent">An obvious exception to this generalization occurs for the first row elements of groups 15, 16 and 17. Note that whilst B&#x2013;B and C&#x2013;C bonds are the strongest of the group, the energies of the N&#x2013;N, O&#x2013;O and F&#x2013;F single <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>bonds are unusually weak. The simplest explanation for this &#x2018;anomaly&#x2019;, as it is often called, has to do with the presence of lone pairs and the small size of the atoms concerned. Thus, each nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine atom has one, two and three non-bonded or lone pairs of electrons respectively which are held relatively close to the nucleus (bond pairs are shared between two atoms) and this factor, coupled with the particularly small size of these atoms, leads to appreciable inter-electron repulsions between neighbouring atoms thereby destabilizing the bond. In other words, for sufficient orbital overlap to occur to form a strong element&#x2013;element bond, the atoms would have to get so close together that substantial repulsions between their non-bonded electron pairs would result. In the cases of boron and carbon, all the electron pairs are bond pairs, so that inter-electron repulsions around the central atom are much less and the atoms are also larger, both factors accounting for the presence of much stronger bonds. For the second and subsequent row elements, the larger size of the atoms means that inter-lone pair repulsions are less important (although see later) with the result that second row element-element bonds are the strongest in the group for groups 15&#x2013;17 with subsequent rows becoming weaker as expected.</p>

<p class="indent">Trends in bond energy across a period are somewhat less marked but it is clear that, in general, there is a significant increase in bond strength as we move from group 1 to group 14 with a slight decrease at group 15 followed by a roughly constant or modest increase in bond energy as we go from group 15 to group 17; for the 2p elements, the drop at group 15 (i.e. nitrogen) is considerable and the O&#x2013;O and F&#x2013;F bond strengths quoted are slightly lower than that for the N&#x2013;N bond.

On moving from group <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>14 to group 15, the elements now have lone pairs (at least for the trivalent state), and the mutually repulsive interaction between these electron pairs across a bond, as discussed above for N&#x2013;N, O&#x2013;O and F&#x2013;F bonds where it is most pronounced, is the main reason for the observed drop in bond energy.</p>

<p class="indent">A general explanation as to the disparity between heteronuclear and homonuclear bond energies was offered by Pauling who ascribed it to the difference in electronegativity of the elements involved; indeed the concept of electronegativity largely evolved from a consideration of the differences between the strengths of homonuclear vs. heteronuclear bonds. Thus, any difference in electronegativity of the elements forming a bond will give rise to a certain degree of ionicity or charge separation (&#x03B4;<sup>&#x002B;</sup>&#x2013;&#x03B4;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) which will lead to an additional electrostatic attraction over and above that resulting from the covalent bond itself. Pauling proposed an equation to calculate the bond dissociation energy (D, in kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) of a heteronuclear bond based on the values of the respective homonuclear bonds and the square of the electronegativity difference between the atoms (<a href="#eq4.2">Eqn 4.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Whilst <a href="#eq4.2">Eqn 4.2</a> is only approximate, it is a useful guide to the strength of heteronuclear bonds and provides a simple rationale for the high bond energies to fluorine in particular, although other factors such as &#x03C0;-bonding effects are also important as we shall see.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Although a lattice energy and a covalent bond energy seem rather different, they are both a measure of the binding energy between atoms so there is no problem in discussing them together.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If we look first at the s-block elements, it is clear that the bond energies, or, to be more precise, lattice energies since we are dealing here with ionic compounds (see later), are all round about 500 - 600 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> which are very <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>considerable values. As we descend groups 1 and 2 no particular trends are apparent, and the precise values will in any case depend on the details of the ionic crystal structure and are themselves subject to error, but it is clear that the bond energies for the group 2 fluorides are higher than those for the corresponding group 1 fluorides which results from the presence of 2&#x002B; cations in the case of the former; lattice energies are proportional to the charge of the ions.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 13, the values quoted in <a href="#tab4.5">Table 4.5</a> are for compounds in the trivalent state, with the exception of Tl-F the value for which is derived from thallium monofluoride (bond energies vary with oxidation state, sometimes by a considerable amount, as we shall see), and show a general decrease as we descend the group. This does not mirror the trends in electronegativity whereby we might expect, for example, that the Al-F bond energy would be greater than that for a B-F bond, but we must recognise that size will also be important here and since aluminium is bigger than boron, this will work to weaken the Al-F bond relative to the B-F bond. Furthermore, since trivalent boron and aluminium compounds often have a vacant orbital, the possibility of B-F and Al-F <i>n</i>-bonding exists with the former expected to be considerably stronger for reasons discussed in the following section. Remember that <a href="#eq4.2">Eqn. 4.2</a> tells us how much stronger an A-B bond will be in relation to the mean of A-A and B-B bond energies; it does not imply that bond energies are determined simply by element electronegativity differences.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">These large bond energies for the ionic s-block fluorides coupled with the three-dimensional bonding present in ionic solids accounts in large part for the characteristic features of ionic materials such as hardness and high melting points. Note that the lattice energy &#x2206;<i>H</i><sub>|att</sub> is proportional to <i>z<sup>&#x002B;</sup>z <sup>&#x2013;</sup> lr<sup>&#x002B;</sup>r<sup>&#x2013;</sup></i> where z is the ionic charge and <i>r</i> is the ionic radius.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In group 14, the general trend is the same as for group 13 for much the same reasons and for the heavier elements, it would appear that size considerations are probably more important than electronegativity differences such that bond strengths decrease down a group. However, the important difference in this group compared to group 13 is that the C-F bond is considerably weaker than the Si-F bond (c.f. B&#x2013;F &#x003E; Al&#x2013;F). This is clearly not to be expected on the basis of element size and undoubtedly reflects the greater electronegativity difference between Si and F vs. C and F. Moreover, with silicon there is also the possibility of F&#x2192;Si &#x03C0;-bonding due to the availability of low energy vacant orbitals on silicon, analogues of which are not present for carbon; the nature of these orbitals will be addressed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The comments here on rc-bonding, i.e. B&#x2013;F &#x003E; Al&#x2013;F but Si&#x2013;F &#x003E; C&#x2013;F may appear confusing at this stage. Where a primary valence orbital is available (as with B and Al), &#x03C0;-bonding is expected to be strongest for the 2p element but where orbitals of a different type (generally vacant d orbitals or &#x03C3;*-orbitals; see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) are present, &#x03C0;-bonding is generally greater for the 3p element. The whole issue of rc-bonding in explaining bond strengths (and lengths) to fluorine has been questioned by Gillespie, however, (see page 22) who has proposed that most element-fluorine bonding should be treated (and can be satisfactorily explained) as ionic in view of the invariably large element to fluorine electronegativity difference.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A situation where size and electronegativity difference work together can be seen by considering the carbon to halide vs. the silicon to halide bond energies shown in <a href="#tab4.6">Table 4.6</a>. Thus, there is a progression to weaker bonds as the halogen group is descended since the size of the halogen is increasing (resulting in poorer overlap) and the electronegativity difference is decreasing. Note, however, that in all cases, the Si&#x2013;X (X = halogen) bonds are stronger than the C&#x2013;X bonds for a given X as discussed above for the specific case of the fluorides.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar situation is found for the oxides where Si&#x2013;O (452) and P&#x2013;O (335) single bonds are found to be much stronger than C&#x2013;O (358) and N&#x2013;O (201) single bonds respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 15, the situation with the element fluorides is the same as that for group 14 but we should note that the N&#x2013;F bond is much weaker than the P&#x2013;F bond. This is a consequence of both N and F being small elements and having lone pairs, the effect of which was discussed in the case of homonuclear bonds, but we should note that the N&#x2013;F bond is a lot stronger than either the N&#x2013;N bond (167) or the F-F bond (155) which clearly demonstrates the effect of electronegativity difference. This feature is reflected in the chemistry of the nitrogen halides wherein NF<sub>3</sub> is a thermodynamically stable and unreactive molecule in complete contrast to the heavier congener, NCl<sub>3</sub>, which is extremely unstable and reactive due largely to the small N&#x2013;Cl bond energy (190 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) which stems from the similar electronegativities of nitrogen and chlorine; P&#x2013;H, C&#x2013;I and S&#x2013;I bonds tend to be rather weak for similar reasons. Bromides and iodides of nitrogen are even more unstable which also reflects the general trend to weaker bonds as a group is descended.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Weak bonds are not the sole reason for the instability of certain bond types. The S&#x2013;I bond for example, although fairly weak (&#x007E;210 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) is certainly respectable and the instability of compounds containing S&#x2013;I bonds can be largely traced to the exothermicity of the following reaction resulting from a large S-S bond energy; the high sublimation energy of iodine is also important.</p>
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:center;">2 RSI &#x2192; RSSR &#x002B; l<sub>2</sub></p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In groups 16 and 17, the O&#x2013;F and F&#x2013;F bonds are very weak (small atoms, lone pairs and small or zero electronegativity difference) but there is now a tendency for the element to fluorine bond energies to increase as we descend the group. This observation would indicate that it is now probably electronegativity differences which are dominant rather than size differences which is perhaps not unexpected since the elements of these groups are themselves generally smaller than those of the preceding groups such that the size mismatch between them and fluorine is less marked. Alternatively, it may be that with sulfur and chlorine, these atoms are sufficiently small for lone pair-lone pair repulsions across the S&#x2013;F and Cl&#x2013;F bonds to be important whereas with tellurium and iodine, for example, such a factor is much less dominant.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The value quoted in <a href="#tab4.5">table 4.5</a> for the Cl&#x2013;F bond (142) is actually lower than that for F<sub>2</sub> (155) but the value for chlorine in this case is derived from the molecule CIF<sub>5</sub>. A better &#x2022; comparison with <i>F<sub>2</sub></i> is the Cl&#x2013;F molecule for which the Cl-F bond energy is 249 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, i.e. considerably greater.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As a final point regarding <a href="#tab4.5">Table 4.5</a>, we should note that, in considering trends across a period, there is, in all cases, a marked decrease in the E&#x2013;F bond energy as we go from left to right as would be expected from electronegativity considerations.</p>
<p class="indent">Before we leave a discussion of the strengths of heteronuclear bonds, we should consider the case of the lead(IV) chlorides and alkyls, described in <a href="#sec4.1">section 4.1</a>, since there are a number of important general points which emerge.</p>
<p class="indent">Recall that for lead chlorides, PbCl<sub>2</sub> is more stable than PbCl<sub>4</sub>. whereas for the alkyls, PbEt<sub>4</sub> is more stable than PbEt2. If we consider first the former observation, part of the reason is due to the relative weakness of the Pb(IV)&#x2013;Cl bond and this highlights a general point concerning the bond strengths of lead(II) vs. lead(IV) halides, since it is found that Pb&#x2013;X bonds in lead(II) halides are generally about 50&#x2013;60 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> stronger than Pb&#x2013;X bonds in lead(IV) halides. Moreover, the same is true for the respective &#x002B;2 and &#x002B;4 states of tin and germanium and also for indium where the In-X bond strengths for indium(I) halides may be as much as 100 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> greater than <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>those for indium(III) halides (the situation is similar for gallium and thallium).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Rather surprisingly, perhaps, Pb(IV)&#x2013;X bonds, although weaker than Pb(ll)&#x2013;X bonds, are significantly shorter which is due to the smaller size of the Pb(IV) centre and reflects the large size difference between the 6s and 6p orbitals.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Clearly, the involvement of the s<sup>2</sup> electron pair in the higher valent state leads to a considerable weakening of the bonds and this can be traced to the difference in the radial extension of the s and p orbitals of the heavier elements mentioned briefly in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. The result of the markedly different sizes of the s and p orbitals for the heavier elements is that s&#x2013;p hybridization is less efficient and covalent bonding involving an s&#x2013;p hybridized state is correspondingly weaker; in the &#x002B;2 state, bonding can occur using only p-orbitals. This is, of course, the same argument (slightly restated) as was presented above in our discussion of the inert pair effect.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The increasingly disparate size of the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended is illustrated with the following values for the group 14 elements.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">With the above points in mind, we should anticipate that electronegative substituents will result in particularly weak covalent bonding in situations where s-p hybridization is important, since the high partial positive charge induced at the central element centre will tend to increase the difference in radial extension between the s and p orbitals making s&#x2013;p hybridization even less efficient. This is undoubtedly an important part of the reason for the instability of the halides of lead(IV) described above and should be most marked in the case of the fluoride, although we should expect that any weakening of the covalent part is likely to be offset by a strong ionic contribution to the bond energy which would account for the stabilty of PbF4 vs. the heavier halides. This is, in fact, a general observation for the heavier p-block elements; high oxidation states involving removal of the s<sup>2</sup> pair are observed for fluorides but are much less common for the heavier halides.</p>
<p class="indent">In considering the case of the lead alkyls, the much lower electronegativity of carbon will not result in differentially much weaker bonds for the &#x002B;4 oxidation state and there is likely to be much less of a difference in the Pb&#x2013;C bond energies for the lead(II) and lead(IV) alkyls. As a consequence, lead will tend to form four bonds rather than two which is evident from the calculated exothermicity of the disproportionation reaction shown in <a href="#eq4.3">Eqn 4.3</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">There are other reasons for the instability of the heavier halides as we have previously mentioned, notably the increasing size of the haiide and the progressive ease of oxidation by a high oxidation state element centre.</p>

<p class="indent">Several points are important. Firstly, note that the N=N triple bond is extremely strong (only the C=0 bond in carbon monoxide is stronger) and almost twice as strong as the P&#x005E;P triple bond. Secondly, although the N=N double bond is stronger than the P=P double bond, the more important point is that the former is considerably more than twice the strength of the N&#x2013;N single bond whereas the reverse is true for the latter vs. the P&#x2013;P single bond. This second observation can be seen as a result of the particular weakness of the N&#x2013;N single bond, for reasons already discussed, with the important consequence that in the chemistry of these elements, phosphorus prefers to form two single bonds rather than one double bond, whilst the opposite is true for nitrogen.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Clearly the &#x03C3; bond in ethane is not the same as the &#x03C3; bond in ethene but the differences are likely to be small; moreover, it is broad comparisons between different types of bonds that are important rather than a means of quantitatively predicting particular bond energies.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In seeking an explanation for the varying stability of p&#x03C0;&#x2013;p&#x03C0; multiple bonds between the p-block elements, we must look further at the strengths of the various bonds involved and an illuminating way in which this can be done (specifically for double bonds in this case) is to examine the &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; bond increments for particular pairs of atoms. <a href="#tab4.8">Table 4.8</a> lists such increments for several pairs of elements (nitrogen and phosphorus included) and the values are defined such that the first value for each particular bond is that for a typical element-element single or &#x03C3; bond; for example the value of 335 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> for carbon is that of the C&#x2013;C bond in ethane. The second value is the difference in energy between a double, or &#x03C3; &#x002B; &#x03C0; bond and that of the single bond given by the first value and this can be taken as a measure of the strength of the <i>n</i> bond.

<p class="sidebar">More sophisticated studies indicate that p&#x03C0;<i>&#x2013;</i>p&#x03C0; overlap for the heavier p-block elements is just as good as for the lighter congeners. Reduced &#x03C0;-bond energies for the heavier elements in fact result from higher energy p orbitals resulting, in part, from Pauli repulsion between valence and core levels. The special stability of 2p&#x03C0;<i>&#x2013;</i>2p&#x03C0; bonding is then traced to reduced Pauli repulsion in the absence of any 1 p orbitals. This is closely related to the relative sizes of <i>ns</i> vs. <i>np</i> orbitals discussed on page 53.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If we first consider homonuclear bonds, an important point to emerge from <a href="#tab4.8">Table 4.8</a> is that the &#x03C0; bond increment for the first row or 2p elements is considerably greater than that for the elements of the second and subsequent rows. In other words, &#x03C0; bond strengths are much larger for the first row elements and by a factor of between two and three. The standard explanation for this feature is that the second and subsequent row elements, being larger, have correspondingly larger and therefore more diffuse orbitals. Overlap between these bigger orbitals is poorer which results in weaker bonds, particularly in the case of &#x03C0; bonds in which the atomic orbital overlap is side-on rather than the head-on overlap of a orbitals. When considering the disparity in the prevalence of &#x03C0; bonding between the 2p elements and those of subsequent rows however, another aspect which we must consider is the weakness of the N&#x2013;N and O&#x2013;O single bonds (like the F&#x2013;F bond). As a result, <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>P&#x2013;P and S&#x2013;S single bonds are considerably stronger than N&#x2013;N and O&#x2013;O bonds respectively. In considering both of these factors, it is therefore apparent that for groups 15 and 16, as the values in <a href="#tab4.8">Table 4.8</a> clearly indicate, the combination of a &#x03C3; &#x002B; &#x03C0; bond is more stable than two <b>&#x03C3;</b> bonds for the first row elements whereas the opposite is true for the elements of the second and subsequent rows.</p>
<p class="indent">In group 14 the comparison is a little different in that the strength of the C&#x2013;C single bond is greater than that of the Si&#x2013;Si bond since there are no non-bonded electron pairs associated with the carbon atoms. The absence of an extensive chemistry of multiply bonded silicon compounds is due, as before, to the weakness of &#x03C0;-bonding for this element (two &#x03C3; bonds are stronger than one &#x03C3; and one &#x03C0; bond) and it is noteworthy that Si&#x2013;Si &#x03C0;-bonding is the weakest of the 3p elements consistent with the larger size of the silicon atom (vs. P or S). The occurance of &#x03C0;-bonding in carbon chemistry, however, is not associated with any weakness of the C&#x2013;C a bond but we may note that much of the extensive and rather special organic chemistry of carbon is the result of the similarity in the strengths of the C&#x2013;C a and &#x03C3; bonds. With this final point in mind, it is also clear from the values for group 14 in <a href="#tab4.8">Table 4.8</a> that, in absence of factors which weaken the first row &#x03C3; bonds, the ratio of the &#x03C3;<i>/</i>&#x03C0; bond strengths drops markedly between the first and second row (0.88 vs. 0.61) but then remains nearly constant for the second and third row (0.61 vs. 0.66).</p>
<p class="indent">An examination of &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; increments for heteronuclear bonds is also instructive. For example, <a href="#tab4.8">Table 4.8</a> reveals that the &#x03C0; bond increment is large where both elements are from the first row although the &#x03C3; bond strengths are also large where one of the elements is carbon. Heteronuclear bonds where a second row element is involved, for example Si&#x2013;O and P&#x2013;O, are similar to the homonuclear second row element cases in having a small &#x03C0; increment but we should note the rather special case of sulfur wherein the &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; increments for both C&#x2013;S and S&#x2013;0 bonds are about equal. This is mainly the result of a large &#x03C0; increment (as opposed to weak &#x03C3;-bonding, c.f. C&#x2013;C) and in this sense, sulfur is acting (as far as &#x03C0;-bonding is concerned) more like a first row element. This may be traced to the relatively small size of the sulfur atom and the consequent better <i>n</i> overlap, and it is therefore not surprising that p&#x03C0;&#x2013;p&#x03C0; multiple bonding is important in the chemistry of this element. We might therefore imagine that the diatomic molecule S<sub>2</sub> would be a stable form of sulfur and indeed, the strength of the S=S double bond in S<sub>2</sub> (425 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) is only slightly less than that of the O=O double bond in O<sub>2</sub> (495 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). Note, however, that the large &#x03C0; increment for oxygen favours a doubly bonded structure over one with single bonds, whereas the reverse in true in the case of sulfur. This latter point is reflected in the exothermicity of the reaction shown in <a href="#eq4.3a">Eqn 4.3</a>.</p>

<h3 class="main2">4.3.4 Bonds to p-block elements vs. d- and f-block elements</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we leave this section, it is worth noting a further difference between p-block chemistry and that of the d-block elements. As we have seen, bond energies generally decrease as groups in the p-block are descended, but the opposite is often true for the d-block elements with bonds to third row <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>elements tending to be the strongest. An explanation for this derives from that given in <a href="#sec4.1">Section 4.1</a> concerning trends in oxidation number. Thus the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the s and p orbitals for the third row or 5d elements leaves the d orbitals more exposed and so overlap is better and bonds are stronger. A similar situation is found for the f-block elements where covalent bonding is much more prevalent in the chemistry of the actinides.</p>
<p class="indent">This is well illustrated in the case of the tetrafluorides of titanium, zirconium and hafnium. Recall that in group 14, the promotion energies are increasing down the group and the bond strengths are decreasing which leads to the appearance of an inert pair effect. For the group 4 elements, the promotion energies (s<sup>2</sup>d<sup>2</sup> to s<sup>1</sup>d<sup>3</sup> in this case) are also largest for the heaviest element (Ti, 79; Zr, 58; Hf, 169 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) but the M&#x2013;F bond energies increase down the group (Ti&#x2013;F, 588; Zr&#x2013;F, 647; Hf&#x2013;F, 676 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>).</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>4.4 The van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Before looking at the compounds of the s- and p-block elements in detail, it will be useful to consider the general types of compound we will expect and this, as we shall see, can often be rationalized on the basis of electronegativities, &#x03C7;, and electronegativity differences, &#x2206;&#x03C7;. Thus compounds with a large &#x2206;&#x03C7; will tend to be ionic and those with medium &#x2206;&#x03C7; are likely to form polar covalent bonds and therefore have polymeric or macromolecular structures. For compounds with a small &#x2206;&#x03C7;, the type of compound will depend on whether the elements have a low or high electronegativity. In the former case, the compounds are likely to be metallic for much the same reason that elements with low electronegativity are metals. In the latter case, we shall expect relatively non-polar molecular species.</p>
<p class="indent">A useful way to visualize these ideas is with the so-called van Arkel-Ketelaar or element triangle, shown in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>, in which the vertices are labelled metallic, covalent and ionic in such a way that the vertical and horizontal axes represent electronegativity difference, &#x2206;&#x03C7;, and absolute electronegativity, &#x2211;&#x03C7;, respectively and are defined such that, for a molecule AB, &#x2206;&#x03C7;= &#x03C7;B &#x2013; &#x03C7;A and &#x2211;&#x03C7; = (&#x03C7;A &#x002B;&#x03C7;B)/2.</p>
<p class="indent">The metallic&#x2013;covalent edge of the van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle comprises the elements themselves, since &#x2206;&#x03C7; is zero, and ranges from metals on the left to covalent species such as F2 on the right for reasons addressed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.5">Section 2.5</a> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. An important sub-category in this section is the metalloids such as boron and graphitic carbon, but also including silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony. In all cases, covalent bonding resulting from overlap of orbitals is a characteristic feature and it has been suggested by Allen and Burdett that the specific term &#x2018;metallic bond&#x2019; actually be dropped from inorganic texts since whilst there is certainly a metallic state with definingproperties such as electrical conductivity, the bonding in metals is covalent in nature and does not differ in any fundamental way from other types of covalent bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">The ionic&#x2013;covalent edge is characterized by decreasing &#x2206;&#x03C7; which is well illustrated with the fluorides of the elements. Thus, CsF and LiF are ionic <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>with large &#x2206;&#x03C7; whereas NF<sub>3</sub> and CF<sub>4</sub> both have small &#x2206;&#x03C7; and are covalent; compounds with intermediate &#x2206;&#x03C7; such as BeF<sub>2</sub> are polymeric or macromolecular solids. A similar trend is seen with the element oxides and both classes are described in detail in the next chapter.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">All discussion is for compounds at atmospheric pressure; metallicity increases with pressure as noted previously for diiodine.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The metallic&#x2013;ionic edge is also characterized by increasing &#x2206;&#x03C7; and is illustrated in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> with compounds of caesium ranging from caesium itself through the metallic CsSn to the ionic compounds CS<sub>2</sub>O and CsF.</p>
<p class="indent">The examples looked at so far were chosen to lie along the edge of the triangle in order to illustrate the extremes of metallic, covalent and ionic bonding, but many (in fact, most) compounds will have values of &#x2206;&#x03C7; and &#x2211;&#x03C7; which place them within the area of the triangle and they will therefore have chatacteristics of all three types of bonding. This is illustrated for a selection of compounds in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> where any compound can be plotted as a function of &#x2206;&#x03C7; and &#x2211;&#x03C7;. Notice, for example, that as for the fluorides which lie along the ionic to covalent edge, the oxides and bromides lie along straight lines which are parallel to this edge but within the triangle since &#x2206;&#x03C7; values are less in the latter two cases. Similarly, just as caesium compounds lie along the ionic to metallic edge, compounds of less electropositive lithium, beryllium and boron lie within the triangle on lines parallel to this ionic-metallic edge. Note that because of the way the diagram has been constructed, compounds AB are written with B more electronegative than A so that for any given class of compound where B remains the same and A is varied, such compounds will lie along a line parallel to the ionic-covalent edge. Likewise, <a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Chapter 4 General features of s- and p-block element compounds</a>for AB where we look at a range of B for a given A, the compounds will lie on a line parallel to the ionic-metallic edge.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A much fuller account of bonding in terms of the element triangle can be found in Alcock (1990).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As we saw in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>), the metalloid region for the elements is defined by a quite narrow region of electronegativity. With regard to compounds, a particularly important class is the binaries of elements in or near the metalloid region such as GaAs, InSb and SiC together with the binaries for which the element electronegativities are themselves outside the metalloid range, but where the average value, &#x2211;&#x03C7;, lies within this range and where &#x2206;&#x03C7; is sufficiently small for covalent rather than ionic bonding to be present; examples are A1P, GaP and InP. We can therefore define a metalloid region in the element triangle which is shown in <a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. Similarly, we could define a metallic region, the usefulness of these regions being that for any given compound, we can plot its position in the triangle and have an immediate feel for its likely properties.</p>
<p class="indent">The treatment outlined above can be taken a step further if we recognise that in addition to metallic, covalent and ionic bonding, we should also consider van der Waals interactions between discrete covalent molecules in the solid state. Such consideration leads us to the so-called element tetrahedron shown in <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a> in which each of the four vertices represents the four bonding types. We can take solid di-iodine as an example of a material close to the van der Waals vertex wherein the iodine atoms are linked by a covalent I&#x2013;I bond whereas the I<sub>2</sub> molecules are held together by much weaker van der Waals interactions. We will not look at this element tetrahedron in any great detail (the ionic-covalent-metallic face is the same as the van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle, of course), but it is informative to comment on compounds which lie along the three edges which join at the van der Waals vertex.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">A material mid-way along the van der Waals-covalent edge might be selenium wherein the intermolecular Se&#x2013;Se interactions between the helical Se<i><sub>n</sub></i> chains are sufficiently short to suggest the onset of some degree of covalency in addition to any van der Waals bonding (Se&#x2013;Se = 2.37 &#x00C5;, Se&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;Se = 3.44 &#x00C5;). Gallium is a good example for a material part way along the van der Waals-metallic edge since gallium has definite metallic properties but the presence of discrete Ga2 units (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>) is suggestive of diatomic units linked by weaker bonding. Finally, as an example along the van der Waals-ionic edge, we might consider AlBr<sub>3</sub> which is a low-melting solid of close packed bromines with aluminium atoms in one sixth of the tetrahedral holes, and which readily sublimes to give Al<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>6</sub> molecules.</p>
