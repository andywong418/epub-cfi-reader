<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Overview</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> gave an introductory account of enzymes, those proteins which catalyse chemical transformations within cells. The particular enzyme highlighted in that chapter, triose phosphate isomerase, catalyses the interconversion of two sugar phosphates. Sugars and their derivatives are important molecules in biochemistry. They are manipulated to provide building blocks for the synthesis of other organic compounds. They are also used as fuel for the generation of cellular energy (and hence act as energy stores), as structural materials, and as components of the molecules of genetic information. An appreciation of the properties of these mole- cules is therefore essential in understanding the chemistry of cells.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important derivatives of sugars in cells are phosphate esters, such as the triose phosphates that were encountered in the last chapter. All the remaining chapters of the book will discuss aspects of the chemistry of such molecules. This chapter will focus on the structural and chemical properties of sugars and their phosphate esters. Succeeding chapters will discuss their biological importance. <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> outlines the way in which chemical reactions of sugar phosphates are used within cells. <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> describes derivatives of sugar phosphates that are key constituents of the membranes which surround cells. Finally in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, polymeric sugar phosphate derivatives, used to store the genetic information of cells, are described.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Derivatives of sugars include compounds with a wide range of chemical functional groups. As noted in the main text, oxidation of sugars can generate carboxylic acids. Amine groups are present in amino sugars. Hence, the key functional groups of &#x03B1;-amino acids can be found in some sugar derivatives. Polymers and glycoproteins, in which sugars are attached to proteins, are also important in biology, particularly at cellular membranes and surfaces.</p></aside>

<h2 class="h2">6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>What are sugars?</h2>
<p class="noindent">A simple sugar or &#x2018;monosaccharide&#x2019; can be represented as a straight-chain aldehyde or ketone that bears hydroxyl groups on each of the non-car- bonyl carbons. The overall molecular formula of such a compound is (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub> <i>n</i></sub>; hence these molecules are also known as carbohydrates. Sugars and their derivatives are ubiquitous in nature. Common derivatives include esters, and oxidized and reduced forms such as carboxylic acids and polyols, respectively. <a href="#fig_6.1">Figure 6.1</a> shows the structure of a very simple sugar, glyceraldehyde, and two simple derivatives. As with amino acids, the presence of multiple functional groups in a single molecule allows the possibility of polymerization. Polymers formed by linking individual sugars together are known as polysaccharides and have a wide variety of roles in biology, as will be mentioned in <a href="#sec_6.4">Section 6.4</a>. <a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Sugars and phosphates: an introduction</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Understanding the structures of sugars</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most sugars and their derivatives are complex molecules. The plethora of functional groups in a typical sugar often strikes terror into the heart of a student who glances at them, especially if the aim is to memorize the precise structures. It is important for any fully fledged chemical biologist to have an exact knowledge of the structure of biochemically important sugars. In the first instance, however, it is more important to acquire a familiarity with their general nature. As with amino acids and proteins, an appreciation of the biological chemistry of sugars rests on a combination of structural and chemical concepts.</p>
<p class="indent">The structural features of sugars will be illustrated by looking firstly at some small, relatively simple examples, e.g. glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone (three-carbon chain, <i>n</i>&#x003D; 3). An analysis of their properties will be extended to discuss ribose ( <i>n</i>&#x003D; 5) and glucose ( <i>n</i>&#x003D; 6), more complex sugars. Finally, the properties of polymers and phosphate esters of sugars will be considered.</p>

<h3 class="h3">6.3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Trioses: sugars with a three-carbon chain</h3>
<p class="noindent">Glyceraldehyde (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>) comprises a three-carbon chain and hence is described as a <i>tri</i>ose. Since the carbonyl group is in the form of an aldehyde, glycer <i>aldehyde</i> is an <i>ald</i>ose. The central carbon is a chiral centre; two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde are therefore possible. Sugars in biology are usually found predominantly in only one absolute configuration. As with amino acids, the enantiomers are traditionally labelled l and d; the two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde were arbitrarily assigned as l and d by Fischer and used as the reference compounds for the naming of other metabolites (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dihydroxyacetone (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>) is the only other possible triose. It is an isomer of glyceraldehyde in which the carbonyl group resides at the central carbon instead of the terminus. Since it is a ketone, dihydroxyacetone is described as a <i>ke</i>tose.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-55em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">The alcohol groups of sugars can form esters with a variety of acids. An ester is simply the product of combining an acid and an alcohol with the loss of water. Esters formed from carboxylic acids and, especially, phosphoric acid predominate in biochemistry.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Glycerol is a component of common lipids and is discussed further in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:22em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">There is a huge variety of molecules which fit the simplest description of a carbohydrate (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub> <i>n</i></sub>. These result from varying three parameters: the length of the carbon chain, <i>n</i>, (up to six carbons is common, although longer sugars are known); the position of the carbonyl group along the chain; and the configuration of the chiral centres associated with each of the internal carbons (other than the carbonyl group).</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:5em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Dihydroxyacetone, in which the only internal carbon is present as a carbonyl group, is the only sugar with a chain length of 3 or greater which does not contain a chiral centre.</p></aside>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Since there are two configurations of a chiral centre, when an additional chiral centre is present in a molecule the number of possible stereoisomers doubles. Sometimes, duplications arise and the total number of isomers is less than expected. In general, if a molecule possesses <i>x</i> chiral centres there are up to 2<sup> <i>X</i></sup>possible stereoisomers.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Given the possibility of varying both chain length and stereochemistry, at internal chiral centres, there is a vast array of sugar molecules potentially available to a biological system. Some forms (e.g. D-glucose) are utilized much more than others.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In addition to l- and d- erythrose, there is another pair of enantiomericaldotetroses: l- and D-threose. The D-form is shown below.</p>

<h3 class="h3">6.3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Extending the chain: tetroses, pentoses and hexoses</h3>
<p class="noindent">The trioses glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>) illustrate the principles of how isomeric sugars arise by variation in the position of a carbonyl group along the chain, and in the configuration of chiral centres. Another variable parameter is the length of the carbon chain; it is therefore appropriate to consider some possible tetroses which arise by extending the chain by one carbon. The resulting aldoses are similar to glyceraldehyde, but have two chiral centres. Four stereoisomers are possible, corresponding to two pairs of enantiomers; one of these pairs, D- and L-erythrose, is shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;">
 <img src="../images/page53-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>


<p class="indent">The number of possible isomers increases dramatically as the size of a sugar increases. Biochemistry textbooks generally provide exhaustive information about the names and structures of all the sugars found in nature. At this point it is sufficient to realize that these variations on a simple theme give rise to a wealth of molecular complexity. Most of the important sugars in biochemistry have six or fewer carbons in the chain.</p>

The D-enantiomers of these sugars are very important in biochemistry and they are discussed further in later chapters. The names ribose and glucose each refer to enantiomeric pairs of stereoisomers with the relative stereochemistries shown in <a href="#fig_6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>. As will be discussed further in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, D-glucose and its derivatives are important in the metabolism of all cells. D-Ribose is a component of nucleic acids, molecules associated with the genetic information of cells, and these will be the focus of <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>The structures of sugars in aqueous solution</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">When D-glyceraldehyde is dissolved in water, it does not all remain as a free aldehyde. Carbonyl groups are polarized and the carbonyl carbon is relatively electron deficient. Water is a good nucleophile and can add to the carbonyl group to form a hydrate (<a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>). In aqueous solution an equilibrium is established between D-glyceraldehyde and its hydrate.</p>
<p class="indent">This addition reaction is not restricted to water, and other nucleophiles, such as the hydroxyl group of an alcohol, can react in an analogous fashion. Sugars contain many such hydroxyl groups and so most are prone to undergo internal addition reactions of this type to give cyclic structures. For example, unlike D-glyceraldehyde, only a trace of D-ribose is present as an acyclic molecule under equilibrium conditions. <a href="#fig_6.5">Figure 6.5</a> shows how the linear structure of ribose can be redrawn to emphasize the ease with which it cyclizes to form a five-membered ring.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">The formation of a hydrate, as with related reactions described later, is freely reversible and is catalysed by both acids and bases. <a href="#fig_6.4">Figure 6.4</a> illustrates the mechanism of this reaction when catalysed by acid.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Because of the preferred bond angles of carbon and oxygen, small rings, i.e. those with fewer than five atoms in the ring, are strained. By contrast, five- and six-membered rings are the least strained ring structures. Sugars of chain length 4 or greater, which are capable of forming such rings, tend to cyclize.</p>
<p class="noindent2">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the cyclization reaction, the carbonyl group is converted into a &#x2018;hemi-acetal&#x2019; group. The carbon of this group is sometimes called an &#x2018;anomericcentre&#x2019;. The anomeric carbon is actually a chiral centre and so two stereoisomers are possible; these are termed anomers. Since hemi-acetal formation is freely reversible in the cell, the two anomers are readily interconverted. The isomer in which the new hydroxyl group lies below the plane of the ring, as drawn, is called the <i>&#x03B1;</i>anomer; the other isomer is known as the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent2a-1">Glucose can adopt a &#x2018;chair&#x2019; conformation, as shown in <a href="#fig_6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>, in which all the substituents (other than at the anomericcentre) are in an &#x2018;equatorial&#x2019; position. It may be that the thermodynamic stability of this arrangement, where steric clashes are minimized, is one of the reasons why glucose is the most common hexose in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a" style="margin-top:6em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Short biological polymers are often named oligomers. Oligomer is a term derived from the Greek &#x2018;oligo&#x2019;, meaning few. As an example, relatively short polymers derived from sugars are called oligosaccharides, whereas longer polymers are called polysaccharides. This distinction parallels the difference between the names peptide and protein.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The formation of maltose from glucose is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. It is formally the displacement of hydroxide from the C-1 position of one glucose by a nucleophilic hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of the other glucose.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">This is an acid-catalysed reaction taking place via an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. Protonation of the hydroxyl of C-1 (to produce a good leaving group) and loss of water generates a relatively stabilized carbocation. Nucleophilic attack on this ion, by the C-4-hydroxyl group of a second glucose molecule, generates the &#x2018;acetal&#x2019; linkage between the two glucose monomers. It is a useful exercise to draw out this mechanism in full.</p>
<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer the oxygen substituent is above the plane of the ring. The structure of cellulose in <a href="#fig_6.8">Fig. 6.8</a> provides an example.</p></aside>

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Polymeric derivatives of sugars</h2>
<p class="noindent">As with amino acids, sugars are elaborated into polymers by dehydration chemistry. Since these polymers are of great biochemical significance, their properties will be outlined briefly here. After initial analysis of a dimer, maltose, discussion will be extended to the macromolecules starch and cellulose. Maltose is a common disaccharide produced, for example, in the malting process during beer production. It is derived from glucose (<a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>). It corresponds to reaction of one of the alcohol groups of glucose (that on C-4) with the carbonyl carbon (C-1) of a second glucose. The formation of maltose from glucose is a dehydration reaction, so the reverse reaction, liberating glucose from maltose, is a hydrolytic process. In an aqueous environment, the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides to the component monomeric sugars is thermodynamically favourable (maltose can therefore act as a store of glucose). Nonetheless, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are kinetically stable in the absence of specific enzymes that speed up the hydrolysis reaction, and they serve important functions in cells.</p>

<p class="indent">As with amino acids, the formation of polymers from sugars can generate a vast array of macromolecules. Different monomers can be <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Sugars and phosphates: an introduction</a>incorporated into the growing chain; the stereochemistry of the linking anomericcentre can be in either of two configurations; and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups within sugars allows a variety of linkages to be made and facilitates branching (in cases where more than one of the hydroxyl groups of a sugar monomer is used to form an acetal linkage). With this structural diversity available, it is not surprising that polysaccharides are involved in a wide variety of biochemical roles.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">Despite their possible complexity, many polysaccharides involve simple repeating patterns. So, for example, two of the most common polysaccharides, starch and cellulose, are primarily polymers of glucose which are linked by acetal groups between the C-l and C-4 substituents of glucose monomers (<a href="#fig_6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cellulose has an extended rod-like structure and it is used as a structural material, notably as a fibrous constituent of plant tissue. Amylose, a polysaccharide component of starch, is used as a store of chemical energy, e.g. plant tubers, such as potatoes, are rich in this polymer. This is a helical polymer (see <a href="#fig_6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>) which is broken down into glucose which, in turn, is oxidized to liberate chemical energy when the plant grows (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Phosphoric acid has three acidic protons. Hence phosphoric acids can form three different types of ester: monoesters, diesters and triesters (the latter type is not important in biological systems). The ability to form diesters allows sugar phosphates to form polymeric chains.</p>

<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The electrostatic repulsion between the oxygen atom of water and the negative charge of a phosphate group raises the energy of the transition state required for nucleophilic substitution; this provides a rationalization for the relative slowness of the hydrolysis of phosphate derivatives. Divalent cations, e.g. Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, are frequently used to speed up biochemical phosphate chemistry by diminishing electrostatic repulsion.</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3"><i>Simple phosphates are anionic in cells</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Phosphoric acid and simple derivatives of it that retain at least a single hydroxyl group (e.g. monoesters and diesters) are all strong acids. They are found as anions under physiological conditions. The ionic nature of phosphates has several ramifications. Incorporation of a phosphate group into an organic compound usually increases its solubility in water. Since every cell is separated from the outside world by a non-polar membrane, which cannot easily be crossed by ions, simple phosphates are usually retained within cells.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:3em;">
 <img src="../images/page57-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<h3 class="h3"> <i>Phosphate derivatives hydrolyse slowly</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of esters from acids and alcohols is a reversible process. In fact the reverse reaction, hydrolysis, is thermodynamically favoured in water. However, in the absence of catalysis, most phosphate esters and related compounds hydrolyse only slowly, and once made are essentially stable under physiological conditions. They can, therefore, be used by cells and broken down when appropriate.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>Phosphates are good leaving groups</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many of the important reactions of biological chemistry are nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions. For these reactions to be facile, a &#x2018;good leaving group&#x2019; is required. Phosphates are widely employed in <a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Sugars and phosphates: an introduction</a>biochemistry when good leaving groups are required (e.g. in protein synthesis, see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.2">Section 7.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>The importance of sugars and derivatives</h2>
<p class="noindent">Why does biology make so much use of sugars? Sugars are available in the biosphere through the reduction of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful inorganic carbon source. Importantly, sugars can be readily inter- converted into other sugars when appropriate catalysts are available. Enzymes are well equipped for this role, as was described for one such example, triose phosphate isomerase, in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. In short, access to appropriate enzymes makes it possible for cells to convert virtually any sugar, or simple derivative, into any other sugar or related derivative. Sugars are molecules with a rich variety of chemistry which are capable of acting as a universal currency in the biochemical economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Most monomeric sugars are handled within cells as phosphate ester derivatives (<a href="#fig_6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>). The anionic phosphate group ensures substantial water solubility, prevents loss of the sugar phosphate through the cell membrane, provides a &#x2018;handle&#x2019; for recognition by proteins, and is a reactive chemical functional group which can be exploited when necessary.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">At one level, sugars are simple molecules: linear chains of carbon atoms including a carbonyl group, having hydroxyl groups on the other carbons. This simple description quickly becomes complex as the chain increases in length, due to variations in the position of the carbonyl group and the stereochemistry of chiral centres. The complexity is increased by the wide range of simple derivatives of sugars that is possible. The combination of functional groups in sugars and their derivatives allows a rich range of organic transformations to be carried out under mild conditions. The challenge of sugar chemistry is to perform the desired transformations in a selective fashion, when so many alternatives exist. Simple acid- and base- catalysis can interconvert sugars, but not in a controlled way. Cells produce enzymes which increase the rate of specific reactions relative to others; they can therefore readily convert a particular sugar to a single product at will by employing an appropriate enzyme. Sugars are a universal biochemical currency. Selective reactions of sugars and their derivatives can provide cells with a variety of organic building blocks and can be used to generate chemical energy. These principles will be illustrated with reference to some aspects of glucose biochemistry in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">A good leaving group is typically the conjugate base of a strong acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and the chloride ion is a good leaving group; see the discussion in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">A combination of acid and base catalysis can bring about the migration of the carbonyl group along the carbon chain (discussed in detail in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>), the interconversion of configurations of chiral centres, and changes in the length of the carbon chain of a sugar (chains can be cleaved to form smaller sugars and, conversely, smaller chains can be assembled into larger sugars). Although some of the details of this chemistry are discussed in other chapters, a thorough analysis is beyond the scope of this book. An excellent account is given in Organic Chemistry by Kemp and Vellacio (see Further reading).</p>
