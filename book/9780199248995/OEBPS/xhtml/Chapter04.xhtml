<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Overview</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> the basic principles of protein structure were outlined. In <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> these principles were used to analyse the structures of proteins, including some which serve a purely mechanical function. In this chapter, the role of proteins in metabolism is introduced, using the globins as an example.</p>
<p class="indent">Globins are responsible for oxygen transport in many multicellular organisms: oxygen is collected from the atmosphere and delivered to the cells. The molecular mechanism by which this process takes place is one of the best understood examples of the relationship between a structure of a protein and its function, and is examined in detail here.</p>
<p class="indent">After a brief introduction, the structures of two such proteins, myoglobin and haemoglobin, will be explored. These provide specific examples of how the basic principles of protein structure can be used to understand the complex functions of large macromolecules. The molecular properties of myoglobin and haemoglobin are then examined in relation to their physiological roles. This is followed by an analysis of the relationship between the structure of the proteins and their function, in atomic detail. Finally, a brief look will be taken at how changes in protein structures affect their function, with sickle-cell anaemia given as an example of a so-called &#x2018;molecular disease&#x2019;.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many organisms oxidize organic compounds as a means of generating energy (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>). Aerobic organisms use oxygen to mediate this chemistry. In unicellular organisms, sufficient oxygen for respiration is available through simple diffusion into cells. In large multicellular organisms the diffusion rate is too slow to fuel the metabolic rate, and a need arises for an oxygen transport and storage system. The globin molecules, a family of proteins, have evolved to fill this need in vertebrates. These proteins bind and release oxygen in response to the needs of the organism; they provide a simple introduction to the interactions between proteins and small metabolites.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Oxidation is defined as the loss of electrons. Oxygen is an oxidizing agent because it readily accepts electrons. When an oxygen molecule receives electrons it is reduced, ultimately to water.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The function of haemoglobin is to take up oxygen from the atmosphere and transport it to the various tissues of the body. The function of myoglobin is to collect oxygen from the haemoglobin in the tissues, and store it for later use, freeing the haemoglobin molecules to collect more oxygen. These different, but related, functions are performed by different, but related, proteins.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Note that myoglobin and haemoglobin are NOT enzymes. Unlike enzymes, the globins do not catalyse chemical transformations of the molecules which they bind. Enzymes are the subject of <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

Haemoglobin is a tetramer in which each of its four component subunits resembles myoglobin. The subunits of haemoglobin, however, have somewhat different properties from myoglobin both because of small differences in primary structure and by virtue of the interaction of the four subunits. The differing behaviour of myoglobin and haemoglobin provides a useful lesson in how subtle changes to protein structure are used to fine-tune important aspects of their function.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The various globin molecules are similar in sequence and structure; they are &#x2018;homologous&#x2019; proteins. They have evolved from a common ancestor by gradual changes in sequence, to generate a family of proteins with properties tailored to their current biochemical roles. Comparisons of one protein of the family with another provides useful information about structure and function, as well as insights into the evolutionary history of the organisms in which they are found.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The physiological role of the globins</h2>
<p class="noindent">Myoglobin is an oxygen storage protein and is particularly abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscle; it binds oxygen at all but the very lowest concentrations encountered in active muscle. Oxygen is only released when the concentration of oxygen has fallen to very low levels. Haemoglobin is the oxygen transport protein and is abundant in the blood; it binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it in the capillaries where oxygen is required by respiring tissues.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A particularly rich source of myoglobin are the muscles of deep-sea diving mammals, such as whales. Why?</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In order for the globins to fulfil their respective roles, haemoglobin must have a lower affinity for oxygen than myoglobin at all oxygen concentrations. This feature is clearly illustrated in <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. It is also apparent from the graph that the oxygen affinities of myoglobin and haemoglobin vary with oxygen concentration in a different fashion. It is important to recognize the physiological significance of this difference in oxygen binding patterns, as is also shown in <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>, and to explain how this difference is achieved at a molecular level.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The behaviour of myoglobin (Mb) can be understood in terms of the equilibrium between oxygenated and deoxygenated forms:</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:3em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">MbO<sub>2</sub> &#8652; Mb &#x002B; O<sub>2</sub></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of oxymyoglobin, <i>K</i><sub>Mb</sub>, can be written as</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:3em;"><i>K</i><sub>Mb</sub>&#x003D; [Mb] [O<sub>2</sub>]/[MbO<sub>2</sub>]</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The behaviour of myoglobin can be readily explained by assuming that each molecule has a constant binding affinity for oxygen irrespective of the oxygen concentration. At very low concentrations of oxygen, most myoglobin molecules do not contain a bound oxygen molecule. As the concentration of oxygen increases, an increasing proportion of myoglobin</p>

<p class="noindent"> <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>molecules have oxygen bound; they are now referred to as <i>oxymyoglobin.</i> At higher oxygen concentrations, the solution of myoglobin becomes saturated as all the myoglobin is in this oxy form.</p>
<p class="indent">The behaviour of haemoglobin, however, is clearly more complicated than that of myoglobin and cannot be explained in terms of the simple arguments above. As the oxygen concentration increases, the affinity of the remaining haemoglobin molecules for oxygen appears to increase. This phenomenon, known as <i>cooperativity</i>, puzzled biochemists for many years.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The cooperative behaviour of haemoglobin provides a classic example of <i>allosteric</i>behaviour in proteins. Allostery, the phenomenon whereby the binding of a molecule at one site on a protein surface alters the functional properties of the protein at a distant site, is an important mechanism for regulating biological phenomena. Cells control a wide variety of processes by regulating the activity of key proteins. This regulation is brought about by controlling the amount of these proteins (see the discussion of the regulation of gene expression in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.11">Section 9.11</a>) and their activity within the cell. Allostery plays a key role in the latter type of regulation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The cooperative binding of oxygen to haemoglobin allows it to carry out its biological role very efficiently. At low oxygen concentrations, most of the oxygen is released to the tissues, whereas at high oxygen concentrations (e.g. in the lungs) virtually all molecules of haemoglobin become saturated with oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent">The structures of myoglobin and haemoglobin, with and without bound oxygen, have been elucidated and are examined in the next section. The differences between the structures are then used to account for their different behaviour in <a href="#sec_4.5">Section 4.5</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The structure of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin</h3>
<p class="noindent">Myoglobin was the first globular protein to have its structure determined in atomic detail. Many of its features are now well understood, and have proved common to a large number of protein structures that have since been elucidated. For example, the residues in myoglobin are found to be very efficiently packed together (see <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>); also, the hydrophobic amino acid residues are found to be buried in the core of the protein, whilst the more hydrophilic residues are exposed at the surface, as discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The protein chain of myoglobin (<a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) contains 153 amino acid residues and is made up of 8 secondary structural units, all <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helices. In contrast to the extended <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helical structure found in <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>), the &#x03B1;- helices in myoglobin are connected by short loop regions that allow the chain to fold back on itself to make a compact overall structure. The lengths of the helices range from 7 to 28 amino acid residues. Careful inspection of the tertiary structure reveals that helices adjacent to one another in the protein sequence are not always close to one another in space.</p>
<p class="indent">Detailed examination of the full structure of myoglobin allows us to rationalize the arrangement of helices using some of the principles of secondary structure which were outlined in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">3</a>. For instance, the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helices often pack against one another at an angle of approximately 50&#x00B0;; this angle allows a favourable interaction between a ribbon of side chains protruding from the surface of one helix and the groove bordered by two such ribbons in the other helix. This is one arrangement of <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helices that occurs commonly in protein structures.</p>
<p class="indent">The eight helices (A-H) enclose a hydrophobic pocket in which resides a haem group. This pocket is the active site of a globin molecule and it binds a single oxygen molecule; it will be examined in more detail in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.5">Section 4.5</a>. <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a></p>

<p class="noindent">From a structural viewpoint it is important to note that both the hydro- phobic nature and the precise geometry of the haem pocket, so critical to its function, are preserved in all known globins.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxymyoglobin has almost the same structure as myoglobin: the oxygen molecule is bound to the haem group causing a slight change in tertiary structure, specifically at the F-helix.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In this discussion of the globins, the amino acid residues are identified by their position relative to the N-terminal end of each individual helix, e.g. His F8 refers to a histidine residue which occurs as the eighth residue within the F-helix.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The structure of haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin</h3>
<p class="noindent">All vertebrate haemoglobins have been found to have similar structures: they comprise a tetramer of globin molecules, each molecule containing a haem group in a hydrophobic pocket. Each haem group can bind one oxygen molecule, which means that each haemoglobin molecule may carry a maximum of four molecules of oxygen. The protein chains are generally of two types, termed the <i>&#x003B1;</i> and <i>&#x003B2;</i> chains, which have <i>slightly</i> different sequences and tertiary structures. Most haemoglobins are made up of two copies of each type of monomer and can be represented as (<i>&#x03B1;&#x03B2;</i>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The haem group is an organic molecule, not a protein (see <a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>). Such a molecule that is permanently associated with a protein, in its functional state, is termed a prosthetic group. These species are closely related in function to coenzymes (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) and are used when the intrinsic chemistry of the normal amino acid side chains is insufficient to perform the chemical function required of the protein.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Each protein chain has a structure closely resembling that of myoglobin, as can be seen in <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. The four chains are arranged symmetrically in a tetrahedral array. This arrangement creates a roughly spherical molecule, with the haem groups separated from one another in space. The arrangement of the four protein chains within the tetrameric assembly is termed the quaternary structure of haemoglobin. The interactions between the four chains are responsible for the allosteric properties of haemoglobin and will therefore be examined in some detail. Most of these interactions are between <i>&#x03B1;</i> and <i>&#x03B2;</i> chains, as will be explained below.</p>
<p class="indent">It turns out that the origin of the allosteric behaviour of haemoglobin results from the fact that this protein can exist in two slightly different forms, <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>known as <i>R</i> and <i>T</i> states. At high oxygen concentrations, haemoglobin is predominantly oxygenated and in the <i>R</i> form, which has an affinity for oxygen comparable to the free myoglobin-like subunits; at low oxygen concentrations, haemoglobin is substantially deoxygenated and most molecules are in the <i>T</i> form, which has a considerably lower affinity for oxygen than free subunits. The differences in structure between the two forms must account for the difference in oxygen affinities. The challenge for the chemical biologist is to rationalize this relationship at an atomic level.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The problem of predicting the full structure of the globins from their amino acid sequence alone should be apparent from <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. The importance and difficulty of predicting protein structures from their sequences was discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">In <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a> one of the monomers, <i>&#x03B2;</i>1, is drawn in a similar orientation to that of myoglobin in <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> and the helices are labelled A&#x02013;H to allow a structural comparison to be made.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">By comparison with the analysis of oxygen binding by myoglobin in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.3">Section 4.3</a>, the behaviour of haemoglobin, Hb (<a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>), can be described by an equation of the form</p>

<p class="noindent2">where <i>y</i><sub>Hb</sub> is the fraction of haemoglobin molecules with oxygen bound and <i>K</i><sub>Hb</sub> is an effective equilibrium dissociation constant of oxyhaemoglobin. This equation reflects the fact that haemoglobin can bind up to four molecules of O<sub>2</sub>. If the binding of oxygen molecules by each chain were completely independent, then haemoglobin would have similar oxygen binding properties to myoglobin, i.e. <i>n</i>&#x003D; 1. On the other hand if the binding of oxygen were an &#x2018;all-or-nothing&#x2019; process, the equilibrium would depend on [O<sub>2</sub>]<sup>4</sup>, i.e. <i>n</i> &#x003D; 4. In practice, the behaviour of haemoglobin is in between these two extremes and can be described by the above equation where <i>n</i> &#x003D; 2.8.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Detailed studies have shown that the structures of haemoglobin in its <i>R</i> and <i>T</i> forms differ primarily in the relative orientation of the individual protein subunits. A close inspection of the structures of the two forms of haemoglobin shows that, in addition to minor changes in tertiary structure, specific <i>&#x03B1;&#x03B2;-</i>subunit interactions (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>) differ; there are more salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in the <i>T</i> form of haemoglobin than in the <i>R</i> form. This extra stabilization of the <i>T</i> form encourages the adoption of this low oxygen affinity structure in the absence of oxygen. The binding of oxygen offsets this stabilization, favouring the <i>R</i> form, as will be described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.5">section 4.5</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">&#x2018;Salt bridge&#x2019; is a general term for the electrostatic attraction between adjacent side chains bearing complementary charges. This is an important stabilizing interaction for charged residues of proteins that are not fully exposed to solvent.</p>

<p class="indent">On transition from the <i>R</i> to the <i>T</i> form, interactions between subunits <i>&#x03B1;</i>1 and <i>&#x03B2;</i>1 and between <i>&#x03B1;</i>2 and <i>&#x03B2;</i>2 tend to remain constant; indeed haemoglobin can be regarded as a dimer of <i>&#x03B1;&#x03B2;</i> dimers. However, the interactions between subunits <i>&#x03B1;</i>l and <i>&#x03B2;</i>2 and <i>&#x03B1;</i>2 and <i>&#x03B2;</i>1 change; as such they are known as sliding contacts. Interconversion of the <i>R</i> and <i>T</i> forms can <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>be described in global terms as a 15&#x00B0; rotation of one <i>&#x003B1;&#x03B2;</i> dimer relative to the other (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>); this change in structure is the basis of the mechanism of cooperativity of haemoglobin which is discussed in the next section.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">During oxygen binding to haemoglobin, the change from the <i>T</i> to the <i>R</i> form involves a net reduction in the number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, and hence involves an expenditure of energy. This explains why the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen is always lower than that of myoglobin-an extra energy price has to be paid when O<sub>2</sub> is bound.</p>

<p class="indent">Synthetic porphyrins (<a href="#fig_4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>) have been prepared which have a hydrophobic &#x2018;cap&#x2019; over the oxygen-binding site of the iron. Oxygen bound at this site cannot interact directly with solvent, or with other porphyrins. Such molecules do indeed bind oxygen reversibly. These studies are important for two reasons: they help identify exactly the features required for an oxygen-carrying protein, and they may provide the basis for the development of artificial blood.</p>

<p class="noindent">The geometry of the haem group in myoglobin is depicted in <a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>. When oxygen binds to the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, it causes a change to its electronic <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>structure which results in a slight reduction in its atomic radius. This allows the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to move into the plane of the porphyrin ring, which in turn pulls His F8 towards the haem group. This process explains the small difference in tertiary structure observed between myoglobin and oxy- myoglobin (<a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2">The synthetic porphyrins, which reversibly bind oxygen, provide a good example of biomimetic chemistry. In this field of research, chemistry is used to provide insights into biological systems. In turn, such research provides new compounds with interesting properties that can sometimes be exploited in technological applications. For example, compounds that reversibly bind oxygen have potential as components of artificial blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the change in the electronic configuration of the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> on oxygen binding causes only a small change in tertiary structure, this transition has been exploited as the crucial trigger associated with the transition from the <i>R</i> form to the <i>T</i> form in haemoglobin. The movement of His F8 necessarily results in a movement of the F-helix of which it is a part. Since this helix is a rigid entity, it acts as a lever and magnifies the small movement, transmitting a larger change to the subunit interface. Thus, movement of the F-helix favours the rotation of the <i>&#x03B1;&#x03B2;</i> dimers relative to one another and, in so doing, forces the salt bridges (which stabilize the <i>T</i> form) to break.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The electronic structure of an Fe<sup>2 &#x002B;</sup> ion is 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup> 3s<sup>2</sup> 3p<sup>6</sup> 3d<sup>6</sup>; there are six electrons in the outer d shell. These electrons are organized in one of two distinct ways. In one configuration the d electrons are present as three electron pairs. Since there is no residual electron spin, this is known as the low-spin configuration. Such ions have a relatively small ionic radius. The alternative is the high-spin arrangement in which the maximum number of electrons are unpaired. In this form the Fe<sup>2 &#x002B;</sup> ion adopts an electronic configuration with two of the d electrons paired and the other four unpaired. Such ions are larger than the low-spin variant. Different ligand environments around the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion favour different configurations. In the absence of oxygen, the Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion adopts the high-spin configuration. The binding of oxygen favours a change to the smaller, low-spin, form as shown in <a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Progressive binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, therefore, increases the stability of the <i>R</i> state, relative to the <i>T</i> state, hence increasing the relative population of the high-affinity form of the haemoglobin molecules in solution. In other words, the binding of oxygen to one subunit of haemoglobin has facilitated a change in the structure of the tetramer, which increases the affinity of the remaining haem groups in the molecule for oxygen. In this way, communication between subunits is achieved, and the phenomenon of cooperativity of oxygen binding to haemoglobin is <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>explained. This phenomenon is now understood in great detail. Indeed, it has proved possible to set up a detailed mathematical model and simulate the oxygen-binding curves shown in <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a> very closely.</p>
</section>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Chemicals that bind to the <i>T</i> structure, and stabilize it, disfavour the <i>T</i> to <i>R</i> transition. This will, therefore, diminish the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. This effect is exploited as a means of regulating the oxygen binding of haemoglobin. As an example, the pH of muscle is lower than that of the lungs. Protons bind to, and selectively stabilize, the <i>T</i> state. This property, known as the &#x2018;Bohr effect&#x2019;, enhances the efficiency of release of oxygen by haemoglobin in the tissues. Molecules which affect the allosteric equilibrium are known as &#x2018;allosteric effectors&#x2019;. Other examples of species which act as allosteric effectors for haemoglobin are Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub> and a metabolite 2,3-bispho- sphoglycerate. The latter is involved in the adaptation of humans to high altitude: changes in its concentration act to enhance the efficiency with which oxygen is offloaded to the tissues.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>How changing protein structure alters protein function: sickle-cell anaemia and molecular disease</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sickle-cell anaemia provides the classic example of a disease which can be explained in terms of an unwelcome change in protein structure; as such, it has been termed a &#x2018;molecular disease&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of sickle-cell anaemia include headache, weakness and dizziness, all of which are attributable to a lack of oxygen. These symptoms are particularly acute in situations where the body&#x2019;s oxygen supply is restricted, e.g. at high altitudes or during vigorous exercise. An examination of the patient&#x2019;s red blood cells reveals that many are sickle shaped, rupture easily and cause capillary blockage.</p>
<p class="indent">More detailed investigation reveals that this sickling is a consequence of a change in the haemoglobin itself, which has an abnormally low solubility in its <i>T</i> state. At low oxygen concentrations, where the <i>T</i> state predominates, the defective haemoglobin tends to form a fibrous precipitate which deforms the cells and gives them their distinctive sickle shape.</p>
<p class="indent">The cause of this low solubility turns out to be a single amino acid substitution in a key position on the surface of the defective haemoglobin: a valine has been substituted for a glutamate at position 6 in the <i>&#x03B2;</i> chain. This apparently small change in structure has a profound effect on the properties of the haemoglobin molecule. This is because valine is a hydrophobic residue and, unlike the polar glutamate, prefers to be buried in the interior of the protein. A single haemoglobin molecule is unable to bury the valine residue within its hydrophobic core. Aggregation of the defective deoxyhaemoglobin molecules, however, happens to be a favourable process, due to the presence of a complementary hydrophobic area in the EF corner of each <i>&#x03B2;</i> chain in neighbouring molecules. This area is not exposed to the surface in oxyhaemoglobin, which explains why the problem is exacerbated at low oxygen concentrations.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Sickle-cell anaemia is more prevalent amongst certain ethnic groups, e.g. people of central African descent. The chronic effects of sickling are only manifest when an individual has inherited mutant haemoglobin genes from both parents; humans who have inherited a mutant gene from one parent, and a normal version from the other are relatively unaffected by anaemia. This group, however, is more resistant to the effects of malaria. In countries where malaria is endemic, there is therefore a genetic benefit in having a single copy of the sickle-cell gene. This explains why sickle-cell anaemia has not disappeared in the course of evolution.</p>
<p class="noindent2"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> outlined some diseases related to protein misfolding. Sickle-cell anaemia provides another example of a disease caused by the aggregation of proteins into an insoluble fibrous precipitate.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Aggregation of defective deoxyhaemoglobin molecules results in long helical fibres of protein molecules which can be readily observed in an electron micrograph. The single amino acid substitution results in a small local change in structure, but changes the overall protein structure from a soluble, globular tetramer, to an extended fibre, and disables the oxygen transport function. An understanding of the principles of protein structure and function has allowed us to explain this clinical phenomenon in molecular terms.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">Myoglobin is an oxygen storage molecule prevalent in muscle tissue. Haemoglobin is an oxygen transport molecule found in red blood cells. <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, From structure to metabolic function: the globins</a>The two molecules have very different oxygen affinities over a range of oxygen concentrations and this allows them to fulfil their respective biological roles. In particular, haemoglobin is found to bind oxygen cooperatively: the binding of one molecule of oxygen enhances the binding of the next.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Drawing the precise molecular structures of glutamate and valine is a useful way of understanding the change in chemical functionality that is involved in the sickle-cell mutation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Myoglobin has a monomeric structure with eight <i>&#x03B1;</i>-helices that pack to form a hydrophobic pocket. This pocket binds a haem group containing Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> in a specific geometry; the haem group is the active site of the molecule and binds the oxygen. Haemoglobin is a tetrameric molecule comprised of four myoglobin-like subunits; it exists in two forms, <i>R</i> and <i>T</i>, which differ in oxygen affinity. The existence of two forms with different affinities explains the cooperative behaviour of haemoglobin, and can be rationalized after examining the difference in the quaternary structure of the two forms, and the tertiary structures of the individual subunits.</p>
<p class="indent">Detailed experiments suggest that the molecular mechanism of oxygen transport depends on reversible binding of oxygen to the iron atom in the haem group; the reversibility of this process is facilitated by the specific binding environment. A change in electronic configuration of the iron, on binding oxygen, provides an atomic trigger that accompanies a change in structure from the <i>R</i> to <i>T</i> form.</p>
<p class="indent">Small changes in the structure of the protein can have profound effects on its function. Sickle-cell anaemia provides a classic example of this phenomenon: a single amino acid substitution results in defective haemoglobin and clinically detectable symptoms.</p>
