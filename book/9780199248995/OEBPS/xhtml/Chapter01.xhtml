<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">This book is concerned with the chemistry taking place in the cells of living organisms. Cells consist of a semipermeable membrane enclosing an aqueous solution rich in a diverse range of chemicals (<a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). To the chemist, cells are, in essence, sophisticated machines that undertake a wide range of chemistry in an organized fashion. Cells have the potential to grow, replicate and produce closely related daughter cells, thereby handing down their controlled chemistry to the next generation. These remarkable characteristics all emerge from the chemical properties of the constituent molecules of cells.</p>
<p class="indent">The chemicals present in cells appear to have been selected by the processes of evolution for their chemical utility. The aim of this text is to show that many cellular processes can be understood in simple molecular terms. Although many biochemical molecules have complex structures, their biological properties can often be rationalized in terms of rather simple chemistry. A comprehensive account of the chemistry of biological systems is not the objective of this book; instead, a series of examples will be used to exemplify many of the principles that are important for understanding the chemistry of cells.</p>

Eukaryotic cells are rather more complex in structure and function; for mechanical strength they may utilize an internal skeleton in addition to, or instead of, an external cell wall; and they contain a range of discrete internal compartments. Although the detailed workings of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are different, the types of chemicals present, and the factors affecting their location, are similar: lipids, and other molecules with nonpolar surfaces, are found in membranes; and polar entities such as sugars and amino acids are retained in aqueous solution.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The elemental composition of cells</h2>
<p class="noindent">The contents of cells are related to, although different from, the chemical composition of their external environment. It is possible to rationalize the similarities and differences between cells and their environment in molecular terms. The use of particular chemicals by biology is related to their availability (now and in the past) and their chemical utility. The chemistry of cells is dominated by compounds made up of a small number of elements. For example, 99 per cent of the <i>atoms</i> are of four elements: hydrogen (62.8 per cent); oxygen (25.4 per cent); carbon (9.4 per cent) and nitrogen (1.4 per cent). This fact reflects the predominant role of water in cells. Indeed, as can be seen from <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>, the composition of cells is related to the composition of sea water: in general, elements abundant in sea water are abundant in cells and vice versa. This is presumably because chemicals present in sea water were available during evolution. For example, as in sea water, many inorganic ions such as sodium, potassium and chloride are present at high levels in cells. The composition of sea water, in turn, reflects the chemicals available at the surface of the earth, modified by their water solubility.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.9em;">After C, H, N and O, the other elements important, or essential, to life are B, Ca, Cl, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, S, Se, Si and Zn.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.9em;">The composition of sea water has also been modified during the course of life on earth. The co-evolution of life and the earth form the basis of the &#x2018;Gaia&#x2019; hypothesis that has been put forward and discussed by James Lovelock.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Elements which are abundant in the earth&#x2019;s crust, e.g. Al (8.2 per cent of the atoms) and Si (28 per cent of the atoms), but which are not readily soluble, are present at only low levels in sea water and often only present at low levels in cells (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The way in which the composition of cells differs from that of sea water sheds light on the chemistry of life. All cells must concentrate and retain foodstuffs and other essential chemicals. Cells must also discard unwanted chemicals into the environment. Some chemicals plentiful within cells are absent, or present at lower levels, in the sea. These chemicals are enriched in cells because of their chemical utility. In <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> the elements which are enriched in cells appear above the diagonal line, e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus and iron.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">For elements lying close to the diagonal line in <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>, the average concentration found in the human body is comparable with that found in sea water.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Iron is an example of an element more plentiful within cells than in the oceans. Iron carries out a diverse range of chemistry that is indispensable to cells. For over half of the 4.5 billion years of the earth&#x2019;s existence, its surface environment is believed to have been more highly reducing than at present. In particular, oxygen is thought to have accumulated to significant levels only about 2 billion years ago. Before the accumulation of oxygen, much of the iron on the surface of the earth was present as moderately soluble iron (II) salts. Once oxygen accumulated, however, more iron became trapped as iron (III) hydroxide that is very insoluble. As the availability of iron decreased, organisms evolved the ability to concentrate this element from their environment.</p>

<p class="noindent">Many different organic compounds are found in cells. The interconversion of organic compounds is critical to the functioning of a cell&#x2014;it provides both the chemical energy required to fuel the cell&#x2019;s activities and the materials needed by the cell to construct other molecular species. The reactions of chemicals within cells are collectively known as <i>metabolism</i> and so these organic compounds are known as <i>metabolites</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the small organic metabolites are used as building blocks of polymers synthesized and used by cells. These polymers include proteins, constructed from amino acids, and nucleic acids, which are derived from sugars and phosphate ions in combination with another class of organic compound, the heterocyclic bases. The properties of these polymers are one of the most distinctive chemical features of living cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Life is inextricably linked with water. The interior of a cell is an aqueous solution, rich in a variety of chemicals including simple inorganic species such as salts, small organic molecules, and a range of polymers derived from these molecules. This solution of water-soluble chemicals is enclosed by membranes comprised of molecules not freely soluble in water. The interaction of cellular molecules with water is crucial in determining their biological properties and provides a focus for much of this book.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Hydrogen bonding results from an electrostatic attraction between an electron-deficient hydrogen atom and an electron-rich centre. When hydrogen is attached to an electronegative element, it becomes relatively positive and can interact favourably with relatively negative centres.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The importance of water</h2>
<p class="noindent">Because of their non-polar nature, most organic compounds cannot form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and so do not dissolve in aqueous solutions. Alkanes, for example, are immiscible with water and float on top of it. This arrangement minimizes the surface area of the organic compound in contact with water, leaving the water molecules free to hydrogen bond with each other. Molecules that have a very highly non-polar surface are relatively rare in biochemistry. Fats, e.g. triglycerides, are of this type (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>); they are immiscible with water and segregate themselves from the aqueous environment. Molecules, and portions of molecules, which prefer to avoid contact with water are termed <i>hydrophobic.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">The only organic compounds freely soluble in water bear polar groups on the carbon framework which <i>can</i> hydrogen bond with water. Hydroxyl groups fall into this category. Sugars, such as glucose, dissolve in water by virtue of the hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon framework (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>). Functional groups that interact favourably with water are termed <i>hydrophilic</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Many inorganic salts are soluble in water. Likewise, the introduction of charge into organic molecules enhances hydrophilicity. Charge arises in organic molecules primarily via acid-base chemistry, e.g. the protonation of amines to form ammonium salts. As examples (<a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>), ethanolamine, a biochemically important amine, is protonated at neutral pH, while acetic (ethanoic) acid is deprotonated. Both are charged at normal physiological pH. By analogy, amino acids, such as glycine, contain two opposite charges under the conditions found in cells.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The interaction of compounds with water is an equilibrium phenomenon. It can be related to Gibbs free energy changes (&#x00394;<i>G</i>); these, in turn, have enthalpy (&#x00394;<i>H</i>) and entropy (&#x00394;<i>S</i>) components:</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:5em;margin-bottom:0.8em;">&#x0394;<i>G</i> &#x003D; &#x0394;<i>H</i> &#8211; <i>T</i>&#x0394;<i>S</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">where <i>T</i> is the temperature. &#x0394;<i>H</i> is a measure of changes in heat associated with a process, whereas &#x00394;<i>S</i> is a measure of changes of the degree of disorder of a system. Favourable processes involve an overall decrease in free energy (&#x00394;<i>G</i> &#x003C; 0) because of either the liberation of heat (&#x00394;<i>H</i> &#x003C; 0) or an increase in disorder, (&#x0394;<i>S</i> &#x003E; 0) or both.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The interactions of molecules with water are crucial in determining their biological functions. These interactions, in turn, are determined by the type, number and distribution of polar functional groups over the nonpolar hydrocarbon backbone of a molecule.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Dispersing a non-polar organic compound in water would force the water to adopt a more ordered structure in an effort to retain as much hydrogen bonding as possible. Segregation of the organic compounds from water minimizes this unfavourable entropy effect.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ordered molecular structures in biology</h2>
<p class="noindent">A key feature of many important biochemical molecules is that they adopt ordered structures. This ordering is the basis of their biological function. Two classes of ordering are highlighted in this text: the organized linking of monomers to form polymers, and the formation of ordered three- dimensional structures by some classes of biological molecule when they come into contact with water.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Phosphates are another important class of ionic functional group found in many metabolites. These deprotonated forms of phosphoric acids also hydrogen bond readily with water. They are discussed extensively in the latter half of the book.</p>

<p class="indent">In biological polymers derived from a family of monomer units (notably proteins and nucleic acids) the monomers are covalently linked in a specific order in the final polymer chain, as illustrated schematically in <a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>.</p>

There are a total of 24 possible tetramers derived from combining a set of four different monomers (4 &#215; 3 &#215; 2 &#215; 1 &#x003D; 24). Up to 256 tetramers (i.e. 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 4 &#x003D; 256) are possible if any combination of such a family of monomers may be employed, corresponding to choosing any of the four monomers at each position, e.g. ABAD.</p>

<p class="indent">Organic molecules, whether small or large, which contain both hydro- phobic and hydrophilic portions, have the potential to adopt ordered structures in water. There is a driving force for such molecules to <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, The chemicals of biological systems</a>maximize the interaction of hydrophilic portions with water, whilst minimizing the exposure of hydrophobic regions. Proteins, nucleic acids and lipids all owe their biological function to the emergence of well-defined structures on interaction with water.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two different ways by which ordered structures emerge when biological molecules are in contact with water. A polymer chain can fold into a three-dimensional structure in which hydrophobic regions are buried away from the solvent, water (<a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>). This type of structure is found for most proteins and some nucleic acids (e.g. see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Sections 3.6</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">4.4</a> and <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.6">9.6</a>).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent"  style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Alternatively, molecules can associate non-covalently to form organized assemblies. This ordering is observed for both large and small molecules. Some biological polymers come together to form multimeric structures (<a href="#fig_1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>). This association is important for the biological functioning of many proteins (e.g. see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Sections 3.4</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">4.4</a>). The DNA double helix (Section 9.9) also involves this type of molecular interaction. Lipids are small molecules rather than polymers. Their spontaneous association to form bilayer assemblies (<a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>) is the basis of biological membrane formation (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2">Individual lipid molecules are not covalently linked together in membranes; the bilayer structure involves non-covalent assemblies of molecules. The same chemical principles are responsible for the adoption of these non-covalent assemblies as in the adoption of well-defined structures by proteins and nucleic acids. Individual lipid molecules contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The bilayer structure allows the hydrophobic regions of lipid molecules to be buried away from water, leaving only the hydrophilic portions exposed.</p>

To this end, the small molecules, and their derivatives, are considered in two groups.
