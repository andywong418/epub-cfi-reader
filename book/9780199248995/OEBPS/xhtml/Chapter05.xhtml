<p class="noindent">As we have seen, proteins adopt well-defined three-dimensional structures and are capable of binding small molecules reversibly at one or more specific sites on their surfaces. This property is exploited by some types of proteins, <i>enzymes</i>, to catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes generally catalyse specific reactions of particular molecules and the enhancements of reaction rate are often remarkably high; indeed some enzymes are so efficient that the rate-limiting factor in the catalysed reaction is the diffusion of the reactants to the enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">An appreciation of the chemistry of enzyme catalysis provides insights into the biochemical details of cells, as well as into chemical catalysis itself. Enzyme chemistry is also the basis for much important applied science, e.g. the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds. Many features of enzyme catalysis will be illustrated by considering one important enzyme, triose phosphate isomerase, which is understood in great detail. The principles that emerge in considering this enzyme can then be extended to provide a general appreciation of our understanding of enzymes and the methodology by which these fascinating catalysts are studied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cells carry out a vast range of chemical reactions in an organised fashion. The chemical transformations essential to cells are catalysed by enzymes, as required by the organism. One of these reactions, that catalysed by triose phosphate isomerase (TIM), is considered here as an illustrative example. The reaction catalysed by TIM is a key step in the chemistry used by cells to derive chemical energy from the oxidation of sugars (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">TIM catalyses the interconversion of two phosphorylated sugars: D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (<small>D</small>-GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Here, the details of this reaction are analysed, and some experiments that have led to our current knowledge of the mechanism of the catalytic process are outlined. The chemical transformation of the aldehyde <small>D</small>-GAP to the ketone DHAP is relatively simple: a carbonyl group and alcohol group are interconverted.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The rate of the reaction catalysed by TIM</h2>
<p class="noindent">When a sample of <small>D</small>-GAP is dissolved in water, in the absence of a catalyst, it slowly isomerises (<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>). Eventually, a stable mixture results at a point where 96 per cent of the aldehyde has been converted to DHAP. This final composition reflects the equilibrium position of this reaction in aqueous solution.</p>
<p class="indent">If the experiment is repeated in the presence of even a small amount of TIM, a more rapid reaction takes place, but the final equilibrium position is the same. TIM acts as a <i>catalyst</i> accelerating the rate of attainment, but not the position, of the equilibrium. Detailed inspection of the TIM- catalysed reaction shows that the initial rate of conversion of <small>D</small>-GAP to DHAP (represented by the slope of the curve at time zero (<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>)) can be very rapid. This rate gradually slows until, at the equilibrium point, no overall change takes place. Only at the very start of the reaction does the measured reaction rate correspond simply to the conversion of aldehyde to ketone. As ketone accumulates, the reverse reaction (ketone to aldehyde) becomes significant, decreasing the <i>overall</i> (net) rate (but <i>not</i> the <i>intrinsic</i> rate) of conversion of aldehyde to ketone. The measured rate of reaction near equilibrium is therefore difficult to analyse in a simple manner. Hence, most meaningful studies of enzyme catalysis use initial rate data.</p>
<p class="indent">Information about the nature of catalysis can be obtained by measuring the effect on the reaction rate of changing the reaction conditions. Firstly, a procedure is required to measure the rate of reaction precisely. Then, keeping all other factors constant, the initial rate of reaction is measured as different variables are altered in turn.</p>
<p class="indent">Varying the concentration of TIM changes the rate of the enzyme- catalysed reaction, as shown in <a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>. The initial rate varies in direct proportion to the concentration of TIM present: if the enzyme concentration is doubled, the rate doubles; trebling the enzyme concentration trebles the rate, and so on. In the terminology of physical chemistry, the reaction is <i>first order</i> in enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of changing the concentration of <small>D</small>-GAP, whilst keeping the amount of enzyme fixed, is illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. At low concentrations of substrate, the initial rate changes in direct proportion to the amount of</p>

At this stage, <small>D</small>-GAP and DHAP are being interconverted at equal rates, and no overall change in their relative concentrations results. The ratio of the concentrations at this point is the equilibrium constant, <i>K</i>:</p>

<p class="noindent">substrate. Under these conditions, the reaction is first order in substrate. As the substrate concentration is increased to higher levels, the initial rate gradually approaches a maximum value. The way in which the rate varies as the concentration of <small>D</small>-GAP is changed provides information about the nature of the enzyme-catalysed process.</p>
<p class="indent">This type of behaviour can be understood by analogy to the binding of O<sub>2</sub> by myoglobin described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>. As we have seen, myoglobin stores oxygen in the muscle by binding the oxygen at a specific site on the surface of the protein. The amount of oxygen molecule bound by myoglobin increases as the concentration of oxygen increases. Eventually, at high concentrations of oxygen, effectively all the binding sites are occupied and the myoglobin is saturated with O<sub>2</sub>. This saturation behaviour is analogous to that of an enzyme such as TIM in the presence of its substrate. A simple scheme for catalysis by TIM, drawn by analogy with myoglobin, and annotated for the conversion of <small>D</small>-GAP to DHAP, is shown in <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>. <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Proteins as catalysts</a></p>







<p class="indent">In the first stage of catalysis, the substrate binds reversibly at the active site of TIM; the substrate then undergoes a chemical reaction. At low concentrations of substrate, the active sites of relatively few TIM molecules are occupied; molecules of <small>D</small>-GAP can therefore bind and react each time one meets an enzyme molecule. Hence the rate is proportional to the concentration of <small>D</small>-GAP as well as that of TIM. At high concentrations of <small>D</small>-GAP, however, most of the enzyme molecules are already involved in catalysis; some <small>D</small>-GAP molecules therefore encounter TIM molecules with occupied active-sites. Since the substrate cannot bind, these encounters cannot lead to an enzyme-catalysed reaction. The rate is therefore no longer simply proportional to the concentration of <small>D</small>-GAP. This simple scheme explains why the reaction rate reaches a maximum when the active site is saturated at high concentrations of <small>D</small>-GAP.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The chemical nature of the TIM-catalysed reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The catalytic behaviour of TIM has so far been rationalised in terms of a process whereby <small>D</small>-GAP is bound at the active site of the enzyme and, when bound, undergoes a chemical reaction to produce DHAP. To explain the dramatic rate enhancement brought about by TIM, we need to develop an understanding of the molecular details of the chemistry that takes place on the enzyme surface.</p>
<p class="indent">Various mechanisms can be postulated for the isomerisation of <small>D</small>-GAP to DHAP, catalysed by TIM. Two chemically reasonable possibilities are shown in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>. In (a), a hydrogen atom migrates within the molecule from C-2 to C-l, whereas in (b), a proton (hydrogen ion) is removed from C-2 and then, in a subsequent step, a proton is added to C-l.</p>
<p class="indent">These possibilities have been investigated using a radioactive labelling experiment (<a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>). An isotopically labelled form of <small>D</small>-GAP was made with radioactive hydrogen (tritium) attached to C-2. When TIM catalysed the conversion of tritium-labelled <small>D</small>-GAP to DHAP, some of the radio- activity appeared in the solvent, rather than DHAP. This is incompatible with mechanism (a), proving that the hydrogen does not exclusively migrate within the molecule.</p>

<p class="indent">When TIM was incubated with iodohydroxyacetone phosphate, the enzyme was irreversibly inhibited (converted into a form incapable of catalysing the isomerization of triose phosphates) as shown in <a href="#fig_5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>. The degree of inhibition increased as more inhibitor was added, until no enzyme activity remained. At this point, one molecule of inhibitor had become covalently attached to each protein chain. The inhibitor was attached to a particular glutamate residue, Glu-165 (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent">The simplest explanation of these results (see <a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>) is that Glu-165 is present at the active site of TIM in the correct position to act as a base for the removal of a proton required for isomerisation. When iodohydroxyacetone phosphate is incubated with TIM, it binds to the active site, in the same way as does a normal substrate. In this case, however, the glutamate acts as a nucleophile and forms a covalent bond to this substrate analogue. Once securely attached to the active site of the enzyme, there is <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Proteins as catalysts</a>no possibility that this molecule can diffuse away to free the active site for catalysis. Since it is no longer possible for a substrate to bind at the active site, the enzyme is inhibited.</p>

<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The sequence of TIM has been determined for enzymes produced by a wide variety of organisms. The sequences are similar and, in each case, the monomeric protein has a molecular weight of approximately 26,000. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme has been determined by X-ray crystallography (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>) and was discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of TIM is complex, but insights into its catalytic role can be obtained without studying all of it in detail. The majority of the protein can be regarded as a support for the active site which has the right shape, chemical functionality and flexibility to carry out the catalytic process. Glu-165, the residue implicated as the catalytic base, lies in a pocket close to one end of the barrel (see p27). Close examination of this region of the surface of the protein reveals other amino acid residues with side chains close to that of Glu-165 and which, therefore, may play a role in the catalytic events. Of the other amino acid residues, lysine at position 13 (Lys-13) and histidine at position 95 (His-95) are best positioned to assist in catalysis. Notice that these amino acid residues are close together in space, but come from very different parts of the protein chain.</p>
<p class="indent">In this particular case, confirmatory evidence that this region is the active site has been obtained by determining the X-ray structure of TIM in the presence of DHAP. The DHAP molecule was found to bind in the pocket adjacent to Glu-165 and very close to Lys-13 and His-95. Such detailed information allows firm conclusions to be drawn about the exact nature of catalysis by TIM.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>A possible mechanism for TIM catalysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">A mechanism for the TIM-catalysedinterconversion of triose phosphates that accommodates all the experimental information described above is shown in <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>. Firstly, <small>D</small>-GAP binds at the active site, with the hydrogen atom on C-2 close to Glu-165. The glutamate removes a proton to form an intermediate anion which can subsequently accept a proton at C-l, to produce the product DHAP. The product can then diffuse out of the active site.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-40em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">therefore, tentatively identified as the active-site base.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Labelling experiments, of the type used to identify Glu-165 as an active-site residue, must be interpreted carefully. Checks must be made that the inhibitor has actually reacted at the active site, rather than elsewhere on the enzyme. Furthermore, the presence of an amino acid capable of acting as a base does not <i>prove</i> that that residue acts as a base in the enzyme-catalysed reaction.</p>
<p class="noindent2s">During evolution the sequences of proteins alter. Changes of amino acids that are involved in catalysis are more likely to reduce the effectiveness of the enzyme and so are less likely to persist. When the sequences of enzymes from various organisms are compared, a disproportionate number of the conserved amino acids (those which occur at the equivalent place in each linear sequence) are often associated with active sites. A comparison of 13 sequences of TIM, isolated from different sources, reveals that 44 of approximately 250 residues are completely conserved (identical in all sequences) including Glu-165. Two-thirds of these conserved residues are within 12A of the pocket containing Glu-165, identified as the active site.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent2a-1">Proton transfer between oxygen atoms, such as that shown for the intermediate in <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>, occurs readily in water.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the intermediate, the proton removed from <small>D</small>-GAP becomes attached to Glu-165.This proton can then be exchanged with protons in the solvent. This exchange is the basis for the observed washout of radioactivity from tritiated<small>D</small>-GAP, described in <a href="#sec_5.4">Section 5.4</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the interaction of substrate with the enzyme, the same range of forces that are available to stabilize protein structures (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) can be employed to facilitate chemical transformations: electrostatic attraction and repulsion (of charged and dipolar entities), along with hydrogen bonding and weaker interactions such as van der Waals forces (although individual interactions of this type are small, the great number possible when an enzyme envelopes a substrate can produce a significant cumulative effect&#x2014;a good analogy is with a Velcro fastener, where the cumulative effects of many individual hooks lead to a strong grip).</p></aside>

<p class="indent">The overall reaction in the presence of TIM proceeds a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) times faster than the same process in solution catalysed by a simple carboxylate ion, such as acetate. Indeed, the limiting factor in the reaction rate is the speed at which substrates and products can diffuse to and from the enzyme. How can this dramatic rate acceleration be explained in molecular terms?</p>
<p class="indent">Several factors can be identified which contribute to the remarkable rate enhancement brought about by TIM. Because of the range of functional groups available on amino acid side chains, enzymes are able to use acid- <i>and</i> base-catalysis. In contrast to conventional chemistry, where one might employ either acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid) <i>or</i> bases (e.g. sodium hydroxide) to speed up reactions, enzymes can use both types of catalysis simultaneously, and all at pH 7. This is possible because the enzyme surrounds the substrate, and different functional groups interact specifically with different parts of the substrate.</p>
<p class="indent">The enzyme binds the substrate in a precise fashion at the active site, prior to any chemistry taking place. The subsequent chemistry is more efficient than non-enzymatic reactions occurring between pairs of molecules in free solution: at the active site there are no solvent molecules to interfere with the chemistry, and everything is preorganized and optimally aligned for reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The nature of the binding of substrates, products and intermediates to enzymes is a distinguishing feature of the observed catalysis. Energy profiles of the acetate-catalysed and TIM-catalysedinterconversion of <small>D</small>-GAP and DHAP are illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>. These diagrams show the relative free energies of the different species that occur as the reaction proceeds. They depict information about the rate of the reaction (the lower the energy barrier, the faster the reaction) and equilibrium position (the relative energies of the starting material and product).</p>
<p class="indent">Isomerisation of <small>D</small>-GAP involves passing through a high-energy transition state and producing a deprotonated intermediate. The formation of DHAP from this intermediate occurs in a similar fashion. The acetate- catalysed reaction (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10a</a>) is relatively slow because there is a large energy difference between <small>D</small>-GAP (and DHAP) and the transition states. This energy barrier must be overcome for isomerization to occur. The formation of the intermediate is unfavourable because it is higher in <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Proteins as catalysts</a>energy than either <small>D</small>-GAP or DHAP. The overall process is, however, favourable since DHAP is lower in energy than <small>D</small>-GAP.</p>

<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The energy profile of the reaction catalysed by TIM involves two additional steps: the reversible binding of <small>D</small>-GAP and DHAP to TIM (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10b</a>). These binding steps do not greatly affect the energies of <small>D</small>-GAP and DHAP. In the TIM-catalysed reaction, however, the intermediate and the adjacent transition states are greatly stabilized; this can be seen by comparing the two energy profiles (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10a</a> and b). The net effect of lowering the energies of the transition states and the reaction intermediate is roughly to halve the energy barrier to isomerisation. This corresponds to the enormous rate enhancement that is observed in the TIM-catalysed reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">In conclusion, detailed experiments have revealed that TIM binds substrates and products relatively weakly, and intermediates and transition states tightly. This selective binding of high-energy species is often termed &#x02018;transition state stabilization&#x02019;. The high-energy species &#x02018;fit better&#x02019; at the active site than do the substrates and products. The net effect is that the energy barriers to reaction have all been reduced to the point where the isomerization proceeds as fast as is physically possible, i.e. as fast as diffusion to, and from, the active site of the enzyme allows.</p>

The energy of <small>D</small>-GAP is little affected on binding to TIM, but DHAP is actually slightly destabilized. Raising the energy of a reactant complements the lowering of the energy of the high- energy species: both factors narrow the energy gap which has to be surmounted.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">An important feature of enzyme catalysis is that the rate of one reaction is enhanced, whilst side reactions are minimised. The geometry of <small>D</small>-GAP, bound at the active site, is ideal for deprotona- tion; it also suppresses the loss of phosphate by &#x03B2;elimination, which is a major competing reaction in the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; chemical isomerization.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dealing firstly with the enzyme, the mechanistic and structural studies suggest that the functional groups of Glu-165 and His-95 are essential for efficient catalysis. If the nature or position of these groups (carboxylate and imidazole, respectively) is changed, catalytic efficiency should drop. Developments in genetic engineering make it possible to change amino acids of interest within a protein sequence. Changing Glu-165 to an aspartate <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Proteins as catalysts</a>residue decreases the rate of reaction by a factor of 1000; even a small change in the orientation of the carboxylate group of this crucial amino acid, relative to the substrate, is sufficient to disrupt catalysis. When His-95 is changed to a glutamine, the catalytic effectiveness drops more than 200- fold. This result indicates the importance of the imidazole functional group of histidine.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">The primary sequence of a protein is determined by genetic information carried in the form of DNA. DNA, and the proteins it encodes, can be manipulated by &#x2018;genetic engineering&#x2019;.

<p class="indent">Turning now to the substrate, the proposed mechanism for catalysis by TIM involves the generation of a high-energy intermediate during the reaction.

It binds at the active site and the structure of the enzyme with this inhibitor bound has been determined by X-ray crystallography (<a href="#fig_5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>).

<p class="indent">Enzymes, for the most part, catalyse reactions that have direct counterparts in organic chemistry. Moreover, the mechanisms of enzyme-catalysed reactions are usually directly related to those of organic chemistry. The principal differences lie in the speed and, especially, the specificity of enzyme-catalysed processes. The origin of the latter difference (the fact that only certain molecules react and these do so only in particular ways) lies in the fact that enzyme catalysis involves the binding of reactants at an active site on the protein. This binding process is specific to <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Proteins as catalysts</a>molecules that have the right shape and functional groups to interact with the enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">Once bound at the active site, the substrate is in contact with several of the amino acid residues of the protein chain. Since these residues may contain acidic, basic and nucleophilic groups, reactions which can be catalysed by these types of functionalities can be brought about by proteins without the need for additional reagents. Reactions that require other types of chemistry, such as oxidative or reductive processes, can also be catalysed by enzymes; in order to do so, however, enzymes conscript other molecules or ions (termed coenzymes) which have the requisite properties (see e.g. <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.4">Section 7.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Enzymes catalysing readily reversible reactions generally bind substrates and products only weakly. They do, however, decrease the barrier to reaction by binding high-energy species tightly. This selective use of binding and the benefits of proximity, controlled reaction geometry and exclusion of interfering solvent molecules leads to many enzymes being extremely efficient catalysts. They can speed the reaction of interest and suppress possible side reactions. Enzymes which are such good catalysts that the rate-limiting factor in the reaction is diffusion of reactants to and from the active site of the enzyme are sometimes called &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; catalysts.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>The methods of enzyme chemistry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Since a primary function of enzymes is to enhance reaction rates, measuring the rates of these reactions gives information about enzyme action. A detailed analysis of how the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction is altered by changing the reaction conditions provides great insights into enzyme catalysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining the structure of the enzyme by X-ray crystallography, once we know the location of the active site, can be used to identify the amino acids involved in catalysis. The roles of these amino acids can be evaluated by changing them, in a controlled fashion, using site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p class="indent">Isotopically labelled substrates and inhibitors are useful in probing the details of enzyme chemistry and inhibition. Enzyme inhibitors, in general, play a major role in enzyme chemistry. Two important kinds of enzyme inhibitor have been mentioned in this chapter. Firstly, molecules which resemble substrates for an enzyme, but which are electrophilic, can react with nucleophiles at the active site of an enzyme. Once they are covalently tethered at the active site, the enzyme is prevented from carrying out further chemistry. Such inhibitors provide information about the identity of the active site. Secondly, molecules which resemble high- energy intermediates (or transition states) involved in the reaction can bind non-covalently, but tightly, to the enzyme active site. These inhibitors can provide information about the mechanism of catalysis.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-57em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">The use of coenzymes for catalysis is analogous to the use of iron and a porphyrin group by myoglobin and haemoglobin to bind oxygen, as described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>; this process could not be effected by a protein chain alone.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">A variety of methods is available to obtain values of the rate parameters ( <i>k</i> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) from measured rate data. One simple method (although not the most accurate) is the double reciprocal or &#x2018;Lineweaver-Burk&#x2019; plot, where the reciprocal of the rate is plotted against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration (1/rate vs 1/[S]). The values of the maximum rate and the Michaelis constant can be obtained from the intercepts.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:0.5em;">
 <img src="../images/page48-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="noindent2a-1">The Michaelis constant, <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, is the value of [S] at which the initial rate is half its maximum value. It is a measure of the affinity of an enzyme for a substrate: small <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values indicate that the enzyme has a high affinity for substrate and vice versa.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">In addition to their utility in unravelling the details of enzyme action, enzyme inhibitors have important technological applications. Since <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Proteins as catalysts</a>enzyme-catalysed reactions are essential to the correct functioning of a cell, disruption of an enzyme-catalysed process is usually debilitating. A molecule that inhibits an enzyme catalysing a reaction essential to all cells is likely to damage any cell it enters, and so will probably be very toxic. Knowledge of such toxins is important for human health.</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Measuring the precise way in which an enzyme-catalysed reaction rate is affected by an inhibitor provides detailed insights into the nature of inhibition.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The use of antibiotics has contributed greatly to human health, especially during the latter half of the twentieth century. Bacteria, however, counter this challenge. They evolve means of becoming resistant to antibiotics. A bacterium that resists the effects of an antibiotic can grow where others cannot; they are at an advantage in environments where antibiotics are present. Resistant strains of bacteria can, therefore, be selected by an inappropriate use of antibiotics. There is an ongoing battle between microbes and antibiotic use by humans. This fosters the need for new antibiotics, and for antibiotics to be used more wisely in order to maintain their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">An important structural feature of bacterial cell walls is the presence of peptides derived from D-amino acids (a discussion about the l and d stereochemistries of amino acids was presented in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.4">Sections 2.4</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.5">2.5</a>). The use of d- rather than L-amino acids presumably provides a defence against enzymes that rapidly degrade proteins derived from l-amino acids. Penicillins inhibit bacterial enzymes which catalyse reactions of acyl-o-Ala-o-Ala. They are analogues of these D-alanine-derived peptides, but are unusually reactive. Once bound at the target enzymes, they become covalently attached and inhibit further chemistry. The integrity of the bacterial cell wall is undermined and the bacteria die.</p></aside>


<p class="indent">Enzyme inhibitors are not all bad, however. In fact they form a major part of a very important business: the pharmaceutical industry. An analysis of the role of enzyme inhibitors as therapeutic drugs will conclude this discussion.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.10<span class="space">&#160;</span>Enzyme inhibitors as drugs</h2>
<p class="noindent">The range of reactions carried out by different organisms varies. For instance, it is essential for bacteria to carry out some reactions that have no human counterpart. We can exploit these biochemical differences for therapeutic ends. A compound which inhibits an enzyme which is essential to an organism that humans would like to kill (such as some bacteria or fungi) can be used to destroy the organism. If humans have no equivalent enzyme, then they may remain unaffected by this compound. For example, penicillins (<a href="#fig_5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>), probably the most famous of all antibiotics, inhibit a family of bacterial enzymes which catalyse the production of strong outer cell walls. Since human cells lack walls of this type, we do not have equivalent enzymes. Penicillin therefore kills bacteria, but is generally innocuous to humans. The careful use of penicillin is of great benefit to human society. Since the discovery of penicillin, many other therapeutically useful enzyme inhibitors have been found. The success of antibacterial and antifungal drugs testifies to the importance of enzyme inhibitors, and they will continue to be exploited for many years to come in fighting disease.</p>

<p class="noindent">Triose phosphate isomerase is a well-studied protein whose properties illustrate many of the general features of the way enzymes work. An enzyme is a protein that acts as a catalyst, often dramatically increasing the rate of a specific chemical change by binding a substrate molecule at an active site on its surface. This site provides appropriate functional groups to bring about the reaction. Like many other enzymes, triose phosphate isomerase binds especially tightly to the transition state(s) and high-energy enzyme intermediate(s) involved in the chemical transformation, thereby greatly decreasing the activation energy for reaction. A large number of techniques have been developed to probe the molecular details of enzyme catalysis. Enzyme inhibitors provide information about catalysis and also have important applications, e.g. as pharmaceuticals.</p>
