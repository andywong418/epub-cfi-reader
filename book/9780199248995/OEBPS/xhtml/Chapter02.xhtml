<p class="noindent">Proteins are biological polymers play important roles in virtually all the chemical processes of life. As such, they are abundant in all cells, representing approximately 15 per cent of the total cell mass. There are thousands of different types of proteins in even simple cells, but all proteins are derived from the same basic building blocks: a set of amino acids. An understanding of the chemistry of these amino acids, and how their properties change when they are polymerized in a protein, is therefore of key importance in the analysis of the <i>molecular</i> basis of the biological properties of proteins.</p>

<p class="indent">Proteins are linear polymers derived from <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acid monomers (see <a href="#fig_2.1">Figs 2.1</a> and <a href="#fig_2.2">2.2</a>). These <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acids are carboxylic acids with an amino group, a hydrogen atom, and a further substituent (R) attached to the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-carbon (i.e. the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). In proteins, the substituent R is limited to one of 20 possible groups (or occasionally a derivative of one of these groups) and the individual amino acids are joined via amide linkages to form a polypeptide chain. An amide linkage is the result of the condensation of the amine and carboxylic acid functional groups of adjacent monomers; the remaining portion of one monomer is termed an amino acid <i>residue</i>. A protein is typically a polypeptide chain of several hundred such residues. Shorter polymers are frequently called <i>peptides</i>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The term &#x2018;peptide bond&#x2019; is often used to signify the amide bond between <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acids in peptides and proteins.</p>

A distinguishing feature of proteins is that they are composed of a variety of monomer units linked together in a defined sequence, i.e. not just a repeated pattern of one or two simple monomers as found in a synthetic polymer such as nylon. The huge variety of possible proteins underpins the diverse roles for which they are suited: as examples, some proteins act in a structural capacity, e.g. collagen and keratin (found in tendons and hair, respectively) function in biology as fibres; others, such as haemoglobin, are involved in transport of molecules within organisms; and yet more, <i>enzymes,</i> act as catalysts for the essential chemical reactions of cells.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the presence of a range of different functional groups (R<sup>I</sup>, R<sup>II</sup>, R<sup>III</sup>, etc. in <a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>) attached to the a-carbon of each amino acid residue that provides the structural and chemical versatility essential to protein function. These functional groups branch off the polymer backbone, the <i>main chain</i>, and are termed <i>side chains</i>. Proteins are generated in biological systems by controlled, sequential addition of monomer units. The specific amino acids present in a protein, and their order within the chain, give rise to the distinctive shape and chemical functionality of each final polymer.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to understand the structures and functions of proteins, the chemistry of the functional groups present in the protein will be examined. Proteins usually adopt highly ordered structures in the cellular environment, based on the nature of the substituents on the polymer chain (polar and non- polar) and on the stereochemical features of both the amino acids and the peptide bonds that link them. An appreciation of these structural principles will be used in analysing case studies of well-studied proteins in later chapters.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The acid-base chemistry of <i>&#x003B1;-</i>amino acids and proteins</h2>
<p class="noindent">An understanding of the structures and simple chemical features of &#x003B1;-amino acids is important for appreciating the properties of proteins. Acidity and basicity of amino acids, and hence of proteins, is the chemistry which will be discussed in most detail. These are important chemical properties in biological systems. Simple acid-base chemistry will be illustrated using glycine, the simplest amino acid. Initially, the properties of free glycine will be described, followed by a discussion of the way in which these properties are modified when glycine is incorporated into proteins.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Acidity reflects the tendency for a bond to break and generate a proton. Basicity reflects the reverse process: the tendency to form a bond between a proton and an atom with an available pair of electrons. The ease with which these processes occur for particular chemical functional groups is quantified in terms of the equilibrium constant, <i>K</i><sub>a</sub>, for the reactions. A general reaction of this type in which a functional group HA, the conjugate acid, dissociates to give a proton and A &#x201C;, the conjugate base, is</p>

<p class="noindent"  style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The simplest amino acid is glycine, in which two hydrogens are attached to the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-carbon, i.e. the substituent, R in <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>, is hydrogen. The overall chemical properties of such a molecule reflect the combination of the properties of the various <i>functional groups</i> of the molecule, each of which has a distinctive chemistry.</p>

Each of these groups can exist in different protonated forms, depending on the pH.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">The acidity of carboxylic acids is due to the stability of the carboxylate anion relative to the acid. The charge of the carboxylate resides, primarily, on two equivalent electronegativeoxygens; each oxygen has to accommodate only half a negative charge.</p>
<p class="noindent2">The equivalence of the two oxygens in the carboxylate anion is not clear in a single structure comprised of simple bonds and charges. This problem can be addressed by imagining the over-all structure as a weighted average of simple structures (<i>canonical or resonance forms</i>). Here two structures are drawn, corresponding to the charge residing on either of the two oxygens. These structures are equivalent and have identical energies. The &#x2018;real&#x2019; structure is envisaged as the &#x2018;average&#x2019; of these extreme representations (<i>not</i> a rapidly interconverting mixture of two discrete structures).</p>
<figure class="figure-bh">
<img src="../images/page9-4.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:2em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent2">The relationship between these two canonical forms can be shown using &#x2018;curly arrows&#x2019; which are used in organic chemistry to denote the movement of pairs of electrons.</p>
<figure class="figure-bh">
<img src="../images/page9-5.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:0em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent2">Acidity is quantified in terms of p <i>K</i><sub>a</sub>values. At the mid-point of a titration, an acid, HA, is half deprotonated, the concentrations of HA and A<sup>&#8211;</sup> are equal, and the equilibrium constant <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x003D; [H<sup>+</sup>].The equilibrium constants for different acid-base reactions have widely differing values. By analogy to pH, logarithms are used to compress the scale. Since most acids of interest are only partly dissociated, the sign of the logarithm is changed so that most values are positive</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In strong acid solution the carboxyl group will be present in the free acid form (i.e. as a CO<sub>2</sub>H group). This group is acidic as it can lose a proton, in response to the addition of base, to form a carboxylate ion.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/page9-1.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:0em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The change of pH as base is added to an aqueous solution of a typical carboxylic acid is shown in <a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. At pH values above ca 5 (the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the acid), the carboxylate form predominates. In this case, the conjugate base is a charged species, and the acidity of the carboxylic acid group reflects the stability of this anionic species relative to the uncharged molecule in aqueous solution.</p>
<p class="indent"  style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The characteristic features of a base are the presence of a non-bonded electron pair and a relatively high stability of the corresponding protonated form. The other functional group of glycine is an amine which contains a nitrogen atom with a non-bonded pair of electrons.</p>

<p class="noindent2">A zwitterion is a neutral molecule that carries equal numbers of oppositely charged functional groups. Zwitterions have many of the properties of salts.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The conjugate acid of an amine, a substituted ammonium ion, is rela- tively stable in aqueous solution. Such an ion in aqueous solution can be deprotonated, but less readily than a carboxylic acid; the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> is correspondingly higher. The acid-base equilibrium and titration curve is shown in <a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. Only at a pH above ca 10 (the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the substituted ammonium ion) does the amine exist predominantly in the uncharged form.</p>
<p class="indent">Since glycine contains both an amine and a carboxylic acid moiety, its titration behaviour incorporates both features, as can be seen in <a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>. The p<i>K</i>a values of the carboxylic acid and ammonium groups of glycine are 2.35 and 9.78, respectively. In neutral aqueous solution (pH 7) both the functional groups of glycine are charged (<a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). Therefore, glycine and other amino acids are really ammonium carboxylate &#x2018;zwitterions&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;amino acids&#x2019;; subsequent structures will reflect this.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values vary somewhat, depending on the precise molecular structure and the environment in which the acid-base chemistry is taking place.</p>
<p class="noindent2">For example, the carboxylic acid group of glycine is more acidic than a simple carboxylic acid (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x003D; 2.35 rather than ca 4-5) since the corresponding carbox- ylate anion is more stable in the presence of the adjacent, positively charged, ammonium ion. The effect of the environment on p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> is particularly important in non-polar conditions, such as in the interior of proteins.</p>

<h3 class="h3">2.2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The chemistry of amides: polymers of glycine</h3>
<p class="noindent">What are the acid-base properties of glycine when incorporated into a polypeptide? When the simple dimer, glycyl-glycine, is compared with its constituent monomers, the ammonium group of one glycine and the car- boxylate group of the other are still present in the dimer, and their acid- base chemistry is little affected. The other ammonium and carboxylate groups are no longer present, since they are linked to form an amide bond.</p>
<figure class="figure-bh">
<img src="../images/page10-3.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:3em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">By contrast with the nitrogen atom of the amine, the amide nitrogen is essentially non-basic. There is an additional interaction between the nitrogen and the unsaturated carbon atom, resulting in partial double- bond character. This can be depicted using canonical structures (<a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>), in an analogous fashion to those drawn to explain the special stability of the carboxylate anion.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">When a nitrogen is positioned adjacent to an unsaturated carbon in a molecule, it is generally found to adopt a trigonal planar, rather than pyramidal, shape. By adopting this shape, the C-N bond is more stable: the electrons are delocalized in a partial double bond.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent"> <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Introduction to amino acids and proteins</a><span class="space">&#160;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>As well as being weak bases, amides are also only weak acids. Depro- tonation of an amide produces an anionic conjugate base. This is similar in structure to a carboxylate ion, but with one of the oxygens replaced by a nitrogen atom. Since nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, this species is less stable than a carboxylate ion, and hence harder to form.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The low basicity of amides can be attributed to the fact that the extra electrons on nitrogen are not a non-bonded lone pair, but involved in a favourable bonding interaction (see <a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>); protonation of the nitrogen atom destroys this interaction. Under strongly acidic conditions (e.g. conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) amides actually protonate on oxygen rather than nitrogen, since the <i>oxygen</i>of an amide does possess non-bonded electrons. Protonation of the amide oxygen catalyses the reaction of nucleophiles with amides. Hence, when polypeptides are heated in the presence of strong aqueous acid, they hydrolyse. (The hydrolysis of amides is discussed further in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.2">Section 7.2</a>.) The breakdown of proteins during digestion is helped by the low pH environment found in the stomach. &#x2018;Indigestion&#x2019; can result from an excess of acid, and most treatments for this condition aim to neutralize this excess.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The fact that amides are neither strong acids nor bases is important for the chemistry of proteins. The overall acid-base properties of the main chain of a typical protein are essentially the same as those of glycine: there is an ammonium group at one end and a carboxylate group at the other; the intervening main chain, comprised of amide linkages, plays essentially no part in the acid-base chemistry of the final molecules. The chemical potential of proteins is not focused in the main chain; instead it is the range of chemical groups found in the side chains of the other amino acids which gives rise to the varied properties of proteins.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>A survey of the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acids of proteins</h2>
<p class="noindent">The proteins found in all living organisms are derived from a repertoire of 20 <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acids: glycine and 19 others. Not all proteins contain all 20 amino acids, although most do, and in certain cases modifications to some of these amino acids can occur. However, with a few exceptions, the 20 <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino acids provide the building blocks for proteins from whatever source. This reflects the universal nature of the genetic code (see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.11">Section 9.11</a>). It is important to have a thorough appreciation of the side chains of the amino acids found in proteins. These side chains are not special to biology, but include many of the simple functional groups familiar from organic chemistry.</p>

<h3 class="h3">2.3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Amino add residues with hydrocarbon side chains</h3>
<p class="noindent">The side chains of several of the amino acids in proteins are simple hydrocarbons. Thus, when they are incorporated into a protein chain, no additional functional groups are introduced into the molecule. The nonpolar nature of these residues, which precludes hydrogen bonding, plays a critical role in the structure of proteins, as will become apparent later: these residues are hydrophobic.</p>

<p class="noindent">The side chains of three amino acids contain hydroxyl groups. Serine and threonine are simple alcohols. For each of these residues, the hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon adjacent to the <i>&#x003B1;</i>--carbon. Threonine is distinguished from serine by an extra methyl group that makes it a secondary, rather than a primary, alcohol. An isolated hydroxyl group can act as an acid or a base, but neither process is especially favourable (the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the hydroxyl of serine is approximately 16).</p>

<p class="indent">In tyrosine, the hydroxyl function is attached to an aromatic ring. Here the functional group is a phenol. The aromatic ring stabilizes the charge on the deprotonated form. This enhances the stability of the conjugate base and lowers the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (to ca 10) facilitating acid-base chemistry. Tyrosine is usually found in the hydroxyl form, but it is occasionally found to act as an acid under physiological conditions.</p>

Cysteine is the sulphur analogue of serine, containing a thiol functional group rather than a hydroxyl function. In aqueous solution such groups are moderately acidic (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> ca 8). However, the properties of sulphur differ from those of oxygen and thiols do not form strong hydrogen bonds. In general, sulphur-containing side chains behave as relatively non-polar groups. In addition, the thiol group has unique chemical properties: it is the most readily oxidized of all the functional groups under consideration (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>). When two thiols are oxidized, a disulphide bond results. Disulphide bonds are important features of some protein structures and are considered in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Tryptophan has a nitrogen embedded in a large aromatic framework (an indole) which behaves as a non-basic nitrogen, although it can form hydrogen bonds.

<p class="indent">Histidine also has a side chain with an aromatic ring. In this case the ring (an imidazole) has two nitrogen atoms, and can be protonated. The charge on the cation of the protonated form is dispersed over the two nitrogen atoms. Histidine is moderately basic with the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the conjugate acid being ca 7. Such a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> allows both conjugate acid and base forms to be readily accessible at neutral pH. Histidine is ideally placed to act as an acid-base catalyst in proteins operating at around pH 7.</p>

<p class="noindent2">If both protonated and non-protonated forms are present, then the side chain can act as both an acid and a base. This is the situation for histidine. For this reason, histidine residues are often important in catalysing biochemical acid-base processes. The special chemistry of histidine is important in the functioning of many proteins. Two of the succeeding chapters describe proteins which have essential histidine residues: the globins in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, and triose phosphate isomerase in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, proline is fundamentally different from the other protein amino acids. The side chain comprises a three-carbon chain and, as with other hydrocarbon side chains, contributes no unusual chemical features to the amino acid or derivatives. In this case, however, a ring structure is formed by the side chain linking back to the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-amino nitrogen. This cyclic structure constrains the shapes which this amino acid can adopt. As a result, the presence of proline in a protein has significant effects on its three-dimensional structure (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.3">Section 3.3</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">It was known that all amino acids found in proteins have the same chirality, long before it was possible to tell which of the two absolute configurations was present in this class of molecules. In early stereochemical studies, the configuration of amino acids was related to known materials by a process of chemical correlation. One of the important reference compounds for stereochemical studies was glyceraldehyde. Glyceralde- hyde has a single chiral centre; two enantiomers are possible, both of which were known at that time; Emil Fischer introduced the terms <small>L</small> and <small>D</small> to describe the two forms. The groups about the chiral centres of serine and glyceraldehyde are closely related&#x2014;both have hydroxymethyl and hydrogen substituents. If the amino and carboxyl functional groups of serine are considered to be analogous to the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, respectively, of glyceraldehyde, then serine (derived from a protein) has the same absolute configuration as L-glyceraldehyde. Since the structures of the other chiral amino acids from proteins are analogous to serine, all these amino acids are said to have the L-conflguration.</p>

However, it becomes difficult and subjective to use in other molecules when the analogies that have to be invoked are more tenuous than those so far described. In addition, some important molecules, such as the amino acid threonine, have more than one chiral centre. A wide variety of chiral compounds is now known, and the absolute configuration of chiral centres within these molecules can be determined using X-ray crystallographic methods. To deal with this situation, chemists have devised a notation, known as the <i>Cahn-Ingold-Prelog</i> (C-I-P) rules, to describe unambiguously the absolute configuration about any chiral centre.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">An abbreviated version of the C-I-P rules is given below</p>
<p class="noindent2"  style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">(i) <i>Priorities</i></p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Decreasing priorities, numbered 1-4, are assigned to the atoms attached to the chiral centre. Higher priority is given to atoms of higher atomic number. In the case of all chiral amino acids found in natural proteins, this leads to the priorities N &#x003E; C (carboxyl), C (side chain) &#x003E; H.The amino group is numbered 1 and the hydrogen atom 4. When, as here, consideration of these atoms leaves an ambiguity, it is resolved by extending the rules to the next attached atoms. The priority of these atoms is assigned, as before.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">(ii) <i>Translating priorities into descriptions</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">The chiral centre is viewed from the side opposite the lowest-priority ligand. If the direction of decreasing priority (1, 2,3) of the other three groups is clockwise, the configuration is designated R, whereas an anticlockwise ordering is designated <i>S</i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The C-I-P rules involve assigning &#x2018;priorities&#x2019; to the groups attached to the chiral centre and then relating these priorities to a description of the chiral centre. The two possibilities are known as <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> configurations. As an example, these rules are illustrated for alanine in <a href="#fig_2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of alanine, the priorities of the atoms attached to the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-carbon are N &#x003E; C &#x003E; H. Hence the amino group is numbered 1 and the hydrogen 4. Of the two carbon substituents, the side chain carbon is bonded to hydrogen, whereas the carboxyl carbon is bonded to oxygen; hence the latter has the higher priority. The overall priority order is, therefore, N &#x003E; C (carboxyl) &#x003E; C (side chain) &#x003E; H. When the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-carbon is viewed from the side opposite the hydrogen (priority 4), the decreasing priority of the other groups follows an anticlockwise pattern, and the configuration is designated <i>S</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">All chiral amino acids found in natural proteins have the <i>S</i> configuration, except cysteine where the presence of a sulphur atom only one carbon removed from the chiral centre changes the priority rules about the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-carbon. Thus although cysteine has essentially the same shape as serine, it ends up with the opposite stereochemical descriptor&#x0021; This kind of anomaly does not deter organic chemists who can see the benefits of the C-I-P rules in a wider context, but is sufficient to make many biochemists prefer the original Fischer terminology. Hence the biological chemistry literature includes both notations and students should be familiar with both.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is a useful exercise to draw out the structure of cysteine; assign priorities to the substituents around the &#x003B1;-carbon according to the C-I-P rules; and use these priorities to assign the configuration of <small>L</small>-cysteine as <i>R</i>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Significance of the configurations of a-amino acids</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear whether L-rather than D-amino acids are found in proteins for any reason other than a historical accident propagated by evolution. However, it is intrinsically simpler for nature to use just one form as a building block for proteins. Indeed, for a protein with a defined sequence of 100 amino acid residues in which amino acids are incorporated with either <small>D</small> or <small>l</small> stereochemistry randomly at each position, there are 2<sup>100</sup> (ca 10<sup>30</sup>) different stereoisomeric structures. If the stereochemistry is fixed, however, there is only a single stereoisomer for a given sequence. Maintaining the similarity in the configurations of the monomer amino acids therefore leads to well defined structures of the corresponding polymers, i.e. proteins. Since biological chemistry involves the interactions of chiral molecules, the chemistry carried out by cells is greatly simplified by using a single chirality. The vast majority of cells have the facility to construct (<i>biosynthesize</i>) <small>L</small>-amino acids and polymers derived from them, and also to break them down (in digestion).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The <small>D</small>-enantiomers of some amino acids are found in rare instances in nature, often in an effort to avoid the normal metabolism of their <small>L</small>-configured counterparts. An example is <small>D</small>-alanine which is a constituent of the cell walls of bacteria. Peptides formed from this amino acid are fundamentally different in shape from polymers made of <small>L</small>-amino acids. They cannot be degraded by the usual enzymes which digest proteins. This use of <small>D</small>-amino acids can be seen as a protective measure for bacteria to allow them to resist destruction by other organisms. The metabolism of different organisms varies, and this variation can be exploited in the preparation of pharmaceutical agents, as will be noted later. In the case of D-alanine, since its metabolism is essential to bacteria but not humans, molecules which interfere selectively with these metabolic processes are antibacterial agents. The most successful group of antibiotics, the <i>&#x00392;</i>-lactams (which include penicillins and cephalosporins), owe their activity to the inhibition of enzymes, acting on D-amino acid derivatives, essential to bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.10">Section 5.10</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>The stereochemistry of peptide bonds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Proteins are, therefore, linear polymers of <small>L</small>-&#x003B1;-amino acids linked via peptide (amide) bonds. The nitrogen of an amide bond adopts a planar trigonal shape because a partial double bond is formed with the adjacent carbonyl carbon (see <a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). This extra bonding is worth about 80 kJ mol<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. The overall stereochemical requirements of a peptide bond are that the carbonyl carbon, the nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen atoms and the two neighbouring&#x003B1;- carbons are all constrained to lie in a plane. Disruption of this coplanarity by rotation about the carbon-nitrogen bond would lead to loss of some double-bond character. Under biological conditions, this effectively restricts the peptide bond to one of two possible structures: <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Preference for one of these two forms, the <i>trans</i> form, arises from a tendency to minimize unfavourable interactions due to too close a proximity of bulky groups (minimization of &#x2018;steric crowding&#x2019; between the substituents on the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen). Of the two substituents on the carbonyl carbon, it is the a-carbon, rather than the oxygen, that is bulkier. Likewise, the &#x003B1;-carbon is the bigger of the two substituents attached to the nitrogen. For 19 of the 20 protein amino acids, the other substituent on nitrogen is hydrogen; the other amino acid, proline, is discussed below.</p>

<img src="../images/page17-1.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:0em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The steric preferences of proline are rather different from all the other amino acids since it has an alkyl chain rather than a hydrogen atom as the second substituent on nitrogen. For all amide bonds, except those which involve the nitrogen of proline, there is a significant thermodynamic preference (ca 8 kJ mol<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) for the &#x003B1;-carbon substituents to be as far apart as possible, i.e. for the peptide to exist in a <i>trans</i> form.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">Proteins are linear polymers of a-amino acids linked via peptide bonds. Each of the 20 monomers bears a characteristic side chain that introduces chemical diversity into the polymer. Side chain substituents include a range of non-polar and polar groups. An appreciation of the acid-base properties of the functional groups found in these side chains is essential to a proper understanding of protein chemistry. The absolute orientation in space of the amino, carboxyl, hydrogen and side chain is the same for all protein amino acids and is usually referred to as the L-configuration, although the R, S nomenclature of organic chemistry is also widely used. The peptide bonds that link monomeric amino acids are planar and generally exist in a <i>trans</i> rather than a <i>cis</i> form. Proline, with its cyclic structure, and glycine, with two hydrogens on the &#x003B1;-carbon, have unusual structural features that set them apart from the remainder of the amino acids.</p>
