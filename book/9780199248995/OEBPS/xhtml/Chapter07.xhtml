<p class="noindent">Cells continually degrade organic compounds and synthesize new ones. The breakdown of complex compounds provides simple organic building blocks for the synthesis of other biological compounds as they are required. Chemical transformations of simple organic compounds are also used by cells to generate energy in a usable form. These chemical inter- conversions of &#x2018;metabolites&#x2019; are the basis of metabolism. Of all the metabolites involved in these transformations, sugars and their simple derivatives play a central role.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter describes the nature of chemical energy within cells and how this energy is harnessed from enzyme-catalysed reactions. Cellular energy is related to the ability to facilitate dehydration chemistry in aqueous solution and the primary source of dehydrating power in cells, a phosphate derivative (ATP), is introduced.</p>
<p class="indent">Having established the nature of biochemical energy, the biochemistry of glucose is used as an example of the manipulation of chemicals in cells: degradation to common building blocks; use of these building blocks to prepare other chemicals; and the generation of biochemical energy. Some features of coenzyme chemistry are also introduced in this discussion.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The chemical energy of cells</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cells use many forms of energy, including mechanical energy (e.g. in muscle contraction) and electrical energy (e.g. in nerve signals), as well as chemical energy. However, all the energy-requiring processes of cells are related to chemical energy and this will provide the focus of our discus- sion. The nature of chemical energy within cells relates to the ability to turn processes that would normally be unfavourable into favourable ones; it is easiest to understand this concept by the use of examples.</p>
<p class="indent">Precisely constructed polymers are characteristic of life. The polymers common to all living systems correspond to the joining of monomer units with concomitant loss of water. They are known as <i>condensation polymers</i>, and include proteins derived from amino acids (shown schematically in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.1">Section 2.1</a>), polysaccharides derived from sugars (introduced in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.4">Section 6.4</a>) and nucleic acids, the molecules associated with genetic information, which will be described in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">To a considerable extent, we can identify the capacity to carry out controlled dehydration reactions as a key chemical feature of cells. Since cells are approximately 70 per cent water, dehydration chemistry is <a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, Metabolism and the biochemistry of glucose</a>generallyunfavourable. In dilute aqueous solution the <i>hydrolysis</i> of condensation polymers is the more thermodynamically favourable process. When we digest meat (mainly protein) and potatoes (mainly poly- saccharides), we catalyse the favourable hydrolysis of polymers into the corresponding monomers in an aqueous environment. It is the construction of polymers from these monomers that requires energy.</p>
<p class="indent">In order for a dehydration reaction to occur in a cell, the overall process must be made <i>thermodynamically</i>favourable; and the rate of reaction must be appropriate at the temperature found within cells. Enzymes can be used to address the latter ( <i>kinetic</i>) issue but not the former, as they alter the rate of attainment, but not the position, of equilibrium. A molecule that can be used by cells to make a dehydration process thermodynamically favourable in an aqueous environment has, however, the potential to act as a source of chemical energy.</p>

<h3 class="h3">7.2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>An important biochemical dehydrating agent: ATP</h3>
<p class="noindent">The molecule most commonly identified as a source of chemical energy within cells is an acid anhydride, adenosine triphosphate, commonly abbreviated to ATP. ATP is a complex molecule but only a certain portion of the molecule is associated with its role as a store of chemical energy. It is the triphosphate portion, a phosphate anhydride group (<a href="#fig_7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>), which is a dehydrating agent; the remainder of the molecule, adenosine, can be thought of as a &#x2018;handle&#x2019; to carry this functional group, facilitating effective binding by enzymes.</p>
<p class="indent">ATP can react with nucleophiles at any of the phosphate centres. <a href="#fig_7.2">Figure 7.2</a> shows a nucleophilic substitution at the <i>&#x003B3;</i>-phosphate. Such reactions, e.g. hydrolysis, result in the displacement of a good leaving group&#x2014;a phosphate derivative, in this case <i>a</i>denosine di <i>p</i>hosphate (ADP). A key feature of phosphoric anhydrides is that nucleophilic substitution reactions are energetically <i>favourable</i>; however they generally occur <i>slowly</i> (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.5">Section 6.5</a>) in the absence of a catalyst.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that phosphoric anhydrides are thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable allows them to be maintained in relatively high concentrations in cells. Consequently their reactions with a variety of nucleophiles are controlled by specific enzymes.</p>

<h3 class="h3">7.2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Protein biosynthesis: an example of controlled dehydration in cells</h3>
<p class="noindent">The production of a wide array of proteins is essential to cellular function. The synthesis of proteins involves controlled addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain, corresponding to the elimination of one molecule of water for each amide bond formed (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). Faced with the challenge of making amide bonds from amines and acids, chemists manipulate the position of the equilibrium by one of two strategies: changing the concentration of one of the species involved, notably removing water as it is formed; or making a derivative of the acid, e.g. an anhydride or an ester, such that subsequent formation of the amide is favourable (illustrated schematically in <a href="#fig_7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>). The first option is not possible in the aqueous environment of the cell. The second approach, which circumvents the production of free water, <i>is</i> viable in cells and is the one adopted by nature: a carboxylic acid is converted into a derivative which has a better leaving group.</p>
<p class="indent">The first stage in the biosynthesis of proteins is the reaction of an amino acid with ATP. Nucleophilic attack by the carboxylate group at the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-phosphate centre generates an acyl phosphate (<a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). This acid derivative, a mixed acid anhydride, is activated with respect to nucleophilic substitution: the carbonyl centre now bears a good leaving group. The acyl phosphate produced is rapidly converted to an ester, an intermediate which is relatively stable (<a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). The ester is formed with an alcohol of complex structure, a polymer known as a 'transfer RNA', or tRNA. This class of molecule will be discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The esters formed between the tRNA and the amino acid are then transformed into proteins by a favourable series of nucleophilic sub- stitution reactions (<a href="#fig_7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Overall, the formation of each amide bond is associated with the hydrolysis of a molecule of ATP. This process removes the water that would otherwise have to be displaced. Hence, ATP fulfils the role of a water-compatible dehydrating agent. When cells undertake processes to generate energy, this typically corresponds to the production of ATP. This process, and other aspects of metabolism, will now be illustrated by considering some of the biochemistry of glucose.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Overview of the catabolism of glucose</h2>
<p class="noindent">Chemical reactions of sugars, and their derivatives, are a central feature of metabolism. As an example, glucose is converted to other sugars and derivatives in cells as a means of generating chemical energy. The oxidation of glucose by oxygen, to generate carbon dioxide and water, is strongly exothermic (<a href="#fig_7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>). Many cells in oxidizing environments derive energy by &#x2018;burning&#x2019; sugars; the energy is harvested in a controlled fashion, yielding reactive chemicals rather than heat.</p>
<p class="indent">Controlled oxidation is accomplished by carrying out the breakdown of glucose via a series of discrete chemical reactions, each of which is mediated by a particular enzyme. These reactions lead to the progressive shortening of the carbon chain. Reactive chemicals, ATP in particular, are generated by this oxidative chemistry and can be used when required to bring about chemical reactions in the cell which would otherwise be unfavourable. The small molecules that result from the breakdown of the sugar can also be used as building blocks for the construction of other chemical compounds.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">Amino acid activation involves attack at the <i>&#x03B1;</i>, rather than the <i>&#x003B3;</i>-phosphate, of ATP. The overall reaction is more favourable because of the ready subsequent hydrolysis of the other reaction product: pyrophosphate. Formation of acyl phosphates from ATP and carboxylates is energetically unfavourable; under normal conditions, the back reaction would predominate. The hydrolysis of 1 mol of pyrophosphate to 2 mol of phosphate is catalysed efficiently by cells. This reaction is strongly favourable; pyrophosphate is destroyed as it is formed and is, therefore, not available for the back reaction.</p>

The free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is approximately -36 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> Hence the chemical energy harvested, in the form of the dehydrating agent ATP, is approximately -1350 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> of glucose. This is more than 45 per cent of the maximum theoretical amount. Judged against the standards of most man-made devices, humans utilize energy very efficiently; the average adult dietary &#x2018;calorific&#x2019; intake is about 10 000 kJ (2400 kcal) per day.

<h2 class="h2">7.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The oxidative metabolism of glucose: glycolysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">The breakdown of glucose to a three-carbon acid, pyruvate, is known as glycolysis. It is useful to consider the strategy underlying the overall process before turning to the specific details. Firstly, the cell takes up glucose from its surroundings and retains it by phosphorylating it; secondly, the six-carbon chain of the sugar is cleaved to generate two equivalent three-carbon units; finally the three-carbon fragments are manipulated to generate useful building blocks and chemical energy in the form of ATP. These three stages are described in the following three subsections.</p>

<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">7.4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Glucose uptake by cells</h3>
<p class="noindent">Glucose is readily taken up by many cells. In the absence of any other process, glucose would flow into a cell until the concentrations inside and outside the cell are the same. It is obviously of benefit to cells to draw in as much glucose as possible (ideally all of the available glucose) and retain it. Cells achieve both aims by making a phosphate ester of glucose, glucose-6- phosphate, inside the cell.</p>
<p class="noindent">Glucose is phosphorylated by ATP in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme hexokinase. This process, the formation of an ester with displacement of a phosphate leaving group (ADP), is favourable and essentially all the glucose within the cell is phosphorylated (<a href="#fig_7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>). This means that the concentration of free glucose within the cell is kept close to zero and a concentration gradient favouring entry of more glucose into the cell is maintained.</p>

This illustrates how the chemical energy of ATP can be used to manipulate concentration gradients in a fashion useful to cells.</p>

<h3 class="h3">7.4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fragmentation of the carbon skeleton</h3>
<p class="noindent">After glucose has entered a cell and been phosphorylated to glucose-6- phosphate, it is broken down into smaller organic molecules. In overall terms, this six-carbon sugar is converted into two molecules of a three- carbon sugar, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is subsequently oxidized; the net result of the oxidation process is the production of ATP. All the intermediates in this pathway are anionic and so are retained by cells.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the first stage, the carbonyl group of glucose-6-phosphate is moved along the chain. This isomerization generates the compound fructose-6- phosphate. A phosphate group is then added to the other end of the chain, producing fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (<a href="#fig_7.8">Fig. 7.8</a>). With phosphate groups on each end of the chain, fragmentation can generate two smaller molecules, each of which is anionic.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is in fact split into two phosphorylated trioses: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (<a href="#fig_7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">Phosphorylation of fructose-6- phosphate to fructose-1,6- bisphosphate is the point at which the cell expends energy (ATP) to commit these molecules to glycolysis. The activity of the enzyme that catalyses this step, phos- phofructokinase, is regulated in many cells so that it is only highly active when the cell requires more glycolysis to take place. In the presence of high levels of PEP, a product of glycolysis (see <a href="#fig_7.13">Fig. 7.13</a>), the activity of this enzyme drops. This control is mediated by allosteric effects (see margin notes pp 31 and 37). PEP binds to the surface of phosphofructokinase, stabilizing a structure with decreased catalytic activity.</p>

<p class="indent">The side chain functional groups of proteins provide a variety of acid- base and hydrogen bonding potential, but only limited redox chemistry (notably cysteine/cystineinterconversion, see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>). The latter is not sufficient for all the redox needs of cells. For more complex redox reactions, an organic molecule, a coenzyme, can be conscripted to carry out the oxidation chemistry. In the case of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, this coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or NAD <sup>&#x002B;</sup> , is a complex pyridine derivative (<a href="#fig_7.10">Fig. 7.10</a>). It is the chemistry of this pyridine group that is utilized by the enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate does not lead to the corresponding acid directly; instead, the reaction product is an activated acid derivative, an acyl phosphate (<a href="#fig_7.11">Fig. 7.11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A further enzyme catalyses the reaction of the resulting acyl phosphate with ADP to generate ATP (<a href="#fig_7.12">Fig. 7.12</a>). In the overall process, chemical energy has been harnessed in the form of a new phosphate anhydride bond. Thus chemical energy, in the form of ATP, has been produced from the overall conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to glycerate-3- phosphate.</p>
<p class="indent">The product of glycolysis so far is glycerate-3-phosphate. The ATP that was expended in order to accumulate glucose within the cell has been exactly offset by that gained from the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate (two molecules for each glucose metabolized). An overall gain of ATP is obtained by further metabolism of the product. The first two chemical reactions of this sequence produce a molecule capable of producing ATP. The phosphate group is moved along the chain to form glycerate-2-phosphate which then undergoes elimination of water to form phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP (<a href="#fig_7.13">Fig. 7.13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The phosphate group of PEP is then transferred to ADP to form ATP (<a href="#fig_7.14">Fig. 7.14</a>). In this way two further molecules of ATP are produced from the overall metabolism of each glucose molecule.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">In contrast to most simple organic species, NADH absorbs light strongly at 340 nm; NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> does not absorb appreciably at this wavelength. Hence the rate of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction can be monitored in a laboratory experiment by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm as a function of time. This provides a useful assay for the activity of this enzyme, that can also be adapted to measure catalysis by TIM. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (<small>D</small>-GAP) is produced byTIM- catalysed isomerization of dihy- droxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). By adding excess glycer- aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and appropriate additives, to a mixture of TIM and DHAP, the <small>D</small>-GAP is oxidized as soon as it is formed. Under these conditions, the rate of increase of absorbance at 340 nm is determined by the rate of production of <small>D</small>-GAP, i.e. it is a direct measure of catalysis by TIM. This is an example of a coupled enzyme assay.</p>

<p class="noindent">Glycolysis produces two molecules of pyruvate from each molecule of glucose. Pyruvate is a ubiquitous metabolite and undergoes a variety of chemical transformations within cells. As an example, pyruvate has the same carbon skeleton as the amino acid alanine (<a href="#fig_7.15">Fig. 7.15</a>) and cells can interconvert pyruvate and alanine. Many organisms convert pyruvate into alanine, thereby providing one of the amino acids required for protein biosynthesis. This example illustrates the way in which metabolites produced by one set of biochemical transformations can then be used to produce other organic compounds that cells require.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">Acid favourable in anhydrides can act as dehydrating agents, thereby promoting reactions that would normally be unwater. For this reason, polyphosphates (anhydrides of phosphoric acids) are exploited in biochemistry to store chemical energy. The oxidative metabolism of glucose exemplifies several features of the sugar phosphate chemistry introduced in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, including the facile interconversion of sugar derivatives, and the role of anionic phosphate groups in retaining metabolites within cells. It illustrates the way in which complex molecules can be converted into simpler ones with the energy liberated ultimately harnessed in the form of a triphosphate, ATP. These simpler common metabolites can, in turn, be used as building blocks for the biosynthesis of other compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxidation reactions of sugar metabolism require chemical reactivity not available in simple proteins. Coenzymes are conscripted to provide the needed reactivity. A range of coenzymes are exploited in biochemistry for specific catalytic tasks. Coenzymes typically consist of a functional group, with the distinctive chemistry required, attached to a &#x2018;handle&#x2019;, that facilitates effective binding by enzymes. They are discussed further in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. <a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Metabolism and the biochemistry of glucose</a></p>
