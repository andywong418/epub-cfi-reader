<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Overview</h2>
<p class="noindent">The properties of a protein are determined by its shape and its chemical functionality. Proteins form well-defined three-dimensional structures which are the basis of their biological function. The role of some proteins as structural materials can be understood in terms of their molecular architecture; specific examples, including keratins and silk, will be used to illustrate this. Most proteins, however, adopt compact globular structures and this type of structure will be illustrated by that of an enzyme, triose phosphate isomerase.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Keratins form the protective covering of all land vertebrates, including materials such as hair, wool, fur, hooves, horns, scales, beaks and feathers.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The overall structure of a protein is related to the order of the monomer units in the chain (<i>primary structure</i>) and the conformation that each monomer residue adopts. Where successive monomers adopt the same conformation, regular structural units result. Two classes of structural motif predominate: the &#945;-helix and the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-sheet; these motifs satisfy local steric preferences and optimize longer range interactions, especially hydrogen bonding. These local structural components (<i>secondary structure</i>) can be arranged in different ways relative to one another in the overall organization of a protein chain (the <i>tertiary</i> structure). Finally, protein chains sometimes associate with each other, and the way they are arranged together is described as the <i>quaternary</i> structure. The factors which lead to the formation of specific tertiary and quaternary structures are not fully understood, but a major influence is the nature of the interactions between a protein and the surrounding solvent.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="noindent2">Sequence information can be determined by chemical degradation. Sanger developed a method of reacting the N-terminal residue of a protein selectively and won his first Nobel prize for using this methodology to sequence insulin. This method has been extended by Edman and others and it can readily be automated. This chemistry can, however, only provide information about approximately 20 residues in a single experiment. Sanger won a second Nobel prize for devising a method of sequencing DNA. This methodology can provide huge amounts of sequence information and is the basis of the &#x2018;human genome project&#x2019; which has succeeded in defining the entire sequence of human DNA. Nowadays most protein sequence information is generated by sequencing DNA and inferring the sequence of a protein from the DNA sequence (see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Proteins fulfil a wide variety of roles within organisms. For example, there are thought to be ca 30,000 different proteins in a human body. In any individual protein, the order of individual residues is fixed, imparting specific properties to the final polymer. In recognition of this, a protein is described by its <i>sequence</i> (known as the <i>primary structure</i>) indicating the order of the amino acid residues in the chain.</p>

<h3 class="h3">3.3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conformational preferences for amino acid residues within a protein chain</h3>
<p class="noindent">An appreciation of the three-dimensional structures of proteins can best be achieved by considering first the stereochemical preferences of a short stretch of a polypeptide chain (secondary structure); structures of complete proteins (tertiary and quaternary structure) are examined in <a href="#sec_3.4">Sections 3.4</a>-<a href="#sec_3.6">3.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, the <i>&#x03B1;</i>- of each chiral amino acid has the L-configuration and, in a protein, is flanked by two amide linkages both fixed in a planar (generally <i>trans</i>) arrangement. This arrangement represents the main chain of a protein. Rotation is only possible around two bonds per residue: the N&#x2013;C<sup><i>&#x003B1;</i></sup> and C<sup><i>&#x003B1;</i></sup>&#x2013;C bonds; these are described by two dihedral angles <i>&#x003D5;</i> and <i>&#x003C8;</i> ,respectively (<a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>). A dihedral angle of 0&#x00B0; corresponds to the situation where the backbone substituents are eclipsed (lie over one another). Positive dihedral angles (up to 180&#x00B0;) correspond to rotating the bond such that the rear substituents move in a clockwise fashion. Conversely, rotation of the rear substituent counterclockwise corresponds to a negative dihedral angle.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="figure-bh">
<img src="../images/page20-1.jpg" alt="img" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;margin-left:1em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">Rotation is only possible about two bonds of the main chain, corresponding to relative rotation of adjacent amide units. The two relevant dihedral angles, <i>&#x003D5;</i> and <i>&#x03C8;</i>, are labelled in the diagram.</p>
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">It is useful to make molecular models of a simple dipeptide and examine, for yourself, the effect of changing the two dihedral angles <i>&#x003D5;</i> and <i>&#x03C8;</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent2">Viewing from either end of the bond yields the same value for the dihedral angle&#x2014;check this for yourself. In the diagram here, the dihedral angles are assessed by viewing from the direction nearest the amino end of the chain, i.e. N to C<sup><i>&#x03B1;</i></sup> for <i>&#x003D5;</i> and C<sup><i>&#x03B1;</i></sup> to C for <i>&#x03C8;</i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The steric effects associated with rotation about these bonds are illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.3">Figs 3.3</a> and <a href="#fig_3.4">3.4</a> for a typical <small>L</small>-amino acid. The conformation of the N&#x2013;C<sup><i>&#x03B1;</i></sup> bond where the carbonyl groups lie over one another (<i>&#x03D5;</i> &#x003D; 0) involves an unfavourable interaction between these groups. Rotation of the rear substituents of the N&#x2013;C<sup><i>&#x03B1;</i></sup> bond in an anticlockwise direction relieves this steric clash. By contrast, an analogous rotation in a clockwise direction relieves this interaction, but only at the expense of introducing a new unfavourable interaction between the side chain and the carbonyl of the preceding residue. Therefore, <small>L</small>-amino acids are expected to prefer conformations where <i>&#x003D5;</i> lies between <i>approximately</i> &#8211;60&#x00B0; and &#8211;180&#x00B0;.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar analysis of the effects of rotation about the C<sup><i>&#x03B1;</i></sup>&#x2013;C bond indicates that <small>L</small>-amino acids will prefer conformations in which <i>&#x03C8;</i> is either in the region of &#x2013; 60&#x00B0; or in the region of &#x002B;120 to &#x002B;180&#x00B0;.</p>

<p class="noindent">Given that individual amino acid residues in a protein chain have relatively well-defined conformational preferences, it is reasonable to ask what happens when successive residues adopt the same conformation. Repetition of a specific pair of dihedral angles always gives rise to some form of a helix. <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, The structures of proteins</a>Of the various possible helices, two fit well with the simple steric preferences outlined in <a href="#sec_3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>. These give rise to the most important regular structures, the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix and the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet, which are common components of the structures of proteins (the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet consists of individual <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strands stacked up side by side; each strand is actually a type of helix, see below).</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>&#x003B1;-</i> helix ( <i>&#x003D5;</i> &#x003D; &#x02212;60&#x00B0; <i>&#x03C8;</i> &#x003D; &#x2013;50&#x00B0;, <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>) is a rather compact helix where, as the chain turns back on itself, linear hydrogen bonds are formed between a carbonyl oxygen and the hydrogen atom of an amide group four residues further down the chain. The overall structure of this unit is a right-handed helix with 3.6 amino acid residues per turn. For every turn of the helix, the chain extends by 0.54 nm (this is termed the <i>pitch</i> of the helix). The side chains of the amino acid residues involved in an <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix point out from the helix and interact with either solvent or neighbouring portions of the protein. All amino acid residues except proline can be readily accommodated within an <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix (although some have a greater tendency than others to adopt this structure).</p>
<p class="indent">The second major class of regular repeated secondary structure found in proteins is the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet, comprised of <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strands <i>(&#x003D5;</i> &#x003D; &#8211;120&#x00B0;; <i>&#x03C8;</i> &#x003D; &#x002B;120&#x00B0;, <a href="#fig_3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>). A <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strand is an almost completely extended helix; the main chain amide groups, therefore, cannot hydrogen bond with neighbouring residues.

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The presence of an extra alkyl group rather than a hydrogen atom on the amide nitrogen of proline not only precludes formation of a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the usual carbonyl group but also introduces a steric repulsion with that group.

<p class="noindent">arrangements are possible in which neighbouring strands are oriented in the same or opposite directions (<i>parallel</i> and <i>antiparallel &#x003B2;</i>-sheets, respectively).

<p class="indent">Connection of the individual strands making up a <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet takes the form of a loop.

<h2 class="h2">3.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Tertiary and quaternary structure: <i>&#x003B1;-</i>Keratin</h2>
<p class="noindent">With a knowledge of the secondary structures found in short stretches of protein, the overall structures adopted by proteins can now be analysed. <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, The structures of proteins</a>For proteins that reside in an aqueous environment, the burial of nonpolar regions is a major driving force favouring the adoption of well-defined overall structures (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.5">Section 1.5</a>). This burial can be achieved by interaction with another non-polar region of the same protein chain to produce an ordered <i>tertiary structure.</i> A similar effect can be achieved by the association of separate protein chains to form a cohesive multimeric structure, known as a <i>quaternary structure</i>. Specific examples of both types of structure are described below.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratins, which are key structural proteins in animals, provide the basis for such materials as hair, wool and fingernails. Early X-ray diffraction experiments on proteins included measurements on <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratins and revealed that these proteins incorporate some regular structural features. These were recognized, after a series of model-building experiments by Linus Pauling, as being due to the presence of <i>&#x003B1;-</i>helices.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">The reason that the heptad repeat sequence of <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin (<a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>) adopts an <i>&#x003B1;-</i>helical structure is partly because the residues involved have a high propensity for the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-region of conformational space, and partly because of the favourable overall structure which results from packing the helices together.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">When the order of amino acids in <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin was determined, regularities were found in the sequence of the main body of the protein. In almost all of this region, chemically similar but not identical residues occur in a repeating cycle of seven residues. It turns out that this sequence, which can be abbreviated as (a-b-c-d-e-f-g)<sub><i>n</i></sub>, predisposes the protein to adopt an <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helical structure; large non-polar amino acids appear at positions a and d and the remaining sites are mostly occupied by polar residues (<a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because there are approximately 3.6 residues in each turn of an <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix, the hydrophobic amino acids are oriented as a ribbon along the edge of the helix (<a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>). Whilst the remainder of the helix is well solvated by water, this ribbon is not, and there is a thermodynamic driving force to bury this region away from solvent. The extended rod-like structure of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-keratin does not allow this burial to take place within a single protein chain; instead, two chains associate and form a coiled coil. The resulting rope-like structure equips this protein for its role as a constituent of biological fibres.</p>
<p class="indent">This discussion has identified several forces that impact on the overall structure of proteins: steric interactions; hydrogen bonding in secondary structural units; and the burial of non-polar residues to avoid unfavourable solvation effects. In addition, the interactions between side chains in tertiary and quaternary structures can be consolidated by covalent cross- linking. As we have seen before, the side chain of cysteine includes a thiol group. If two cysteine residues are sufficiently close in space, a covalent disulphide link can be formed by oxidation. This stabilizes the structure in the form in which the cross-link is made (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>; although the two cysteine residues must be close in space for disulphide bond formation to occur, they need not be near one another in the protein sequence).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is a useful exercise to draw out the precise structure of each side chain to confirm the polar and non-polar character of the residues in the above sequence.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As an example, <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin contains some cysteine residues. In hair, these are generally in the form of disulphide links with neighbouring protein chains. These hold adjacent fibres in fixed orientations with respect to one another. Reduction of these links, followed by reorientation of the fibres and reoxidation, changes the overall shape of the hair. This is exploited commercially by hairdressers&#x2014;it is called a &#x2018;permanent wave&#x2019; or &#x2018;perm&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="noindent2">In the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin structure (<a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>) the helices are oriented at an angle of about 20&#x00B0; to one another. This type of coiled-coil structure had been predicted by Francis Crick in 1953, before the detailed structure of any proteins were known.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">As was noted in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>, entropy effects are important in determining the interaction of non-polar residues with water. Burial of non-polar residues, away from water, decreases the unfavourable ordering of the solvent (overall decrease in entropy) that would occur if the non-polar residues were exposed.</p>
<p class="noindent2">When proteins adopt compact folded structures in water, the increased ordering (unfavourable entropy) of the protein chain is more than offset by the increased disorder of water when the non-polar side chains are buried.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is a large family of proteins that adopt the coiled-coil type of structure found in <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin. For example, tropomyosin is an important fibrous protein in muscle. This protein, which contains nearly 300 amino acid residues, also displays a characteristic heptad repeat. Although the structure of this protein is not known in detail, it is closely related (homologous) to that of <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin. When proteins have evolved from a common ancestor, they share similar structural features (residues with similar or identical side chains appear in the same order in the related proteins), and they are said to be homologous. This will be illustrated in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>. The identification of homologies to proteins of known structure is an important aid in the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, The structures of proteins</a></p>

<p class="noindent2">Although it is possible to rationalize why a protein adopts a particular structure, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is extremely difficult. This is because of the complexity of proteins and the folding process by which a particular structure emerges. It is, however, a very important area of research because of the vastly increased knowledge of protein sequences generated by the human genome project and related research. We do not know the structures adopted by the vast majority of these sequences. &#x2018;Structural genomics&#x2019; is a term coined to describe research aimed at generating structural information about proteins which have been identified by genome sequencing.</p>

<p class="indent">Stacked antiparallel <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheets are found as key structural features of fibroin proteins, which are found in silk fibres, and of <i>&#x003B2;</i>-keratins, which are components of bird feathers. In a <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet structure, the side chains of amino acids point alternately above and below the plane of the sheet. It is not surprising, therefore, that these proteins which form stable repeating <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet structures show a repeated diad pattern (a&#8211;b)<sub><i>n</i></sub> (<a href="#fig_3.12">Fig. 3.12</a>), corresponding to the alternation of two types of amino acid residue, over much of their length.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The crystalline <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet region of cocoon silk of the silkworm <i>Bombyx mori</i> is responsible for its mechanical strength. This region comprises repeats of the sequence: (Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ser)<sub><i>n</i></sub>. This forms a rigid stacked structure as shown in <a href="#fig_3.12">Fig. 3.12</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As discussed above, proline cannot be accommodated within a regular <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix, but proline-rich proteins can form an alternative (extended) helix. Interwound helices of this type are found in collagen, a high tensile strength material which is the principal constituent of connective tissue in animals, including tendons, cartilage and blood vessels.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Other regions of this silk protein (fibroin) are glycine rich and adopt an amorphous structure that provides the flexibility of this material.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In conclusion, three basic structures are found in fibrous proteins: the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix, the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet and the collagen triple helix. Diverse materials are made by adapting and varying these basic forms. Flexible and elastic materials are often made from <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helical structures with hydrogen bonding within, rather than between, chains. Materials based on <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheets can be strong and flexible; these structures are exploited particularly by insects as fibres, resistant to stretching. Collagen, a triple-helical structure, is used by animals to make strong, rigid materials, capable of efficiently transmitting mechanical force.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Collagen is a rigid, triple helix, rich in glycine and proline. The three individual chains intertwine in a coiled coil structure, in a somewhat analogous fashion to that described for the double helix of <i>&#x003B1;</i>-keratin in <a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Most proteins adopt &#x2018;globular&#x2019; structures in which <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix and/or <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strand units are linked by turns, allowing the protein chain to fold into a <a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, The structures of proteins</a>compact overall structure. In these structures, large non-polar residues are buried in the core of the protein away from solvent water, whereas polar residues are predominantly on the surface of the protein.

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-bottom:0.6em;">The globin family of proteins provides another example of tertiary and quaternary globular protein structures. The oxygen storage protein myoglobin consists of a series of &#x03B1;-helices folded into a compact tertiary structure. In the oxygen transport protein haemoglobin four protein chains, similar to myoglobin, associate to form a well-defined quaternary structure. This is discussed in detail in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">Section 4.4</a>. In <a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>, amino acid residues are numbered according to their order in the linear sequence of TIM. In addition, the polarity of the individual residues is indicated by the way the residues are labelled. Large, non-polar, hydrophobic residues are labelled in <b>boldface</b> and charged highly polar residues are labelled in <i>italics</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent2">The residues in the middle of the <i>&#x003B2;</i>- strands are non-polar. There are occasional residues in the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet which are polar, but these are at the ends of strands and point into solution, rather than into the core of the protein. As an example, Glu-165, bearing a carboxylate side chain, is at the end of a <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strand. As discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, this residue is at the active site of the enzyme; it is on the surface of the protein and interacts with the enzyme substrate. Another key residue at the active site is His-95; this is two residues beyond the end of one of the other <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strands shown. This illustrates how the folded nature of globular proteins brings residues, which are far apart in the primary sequence, close together in space in the final structure.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">The three-dimensional structure of TIM has been determined in detail by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme is a symmetrical dimer. The tertiary structure of each TIM monomer (see <a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>) comprises alternate <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strands and <i>&#x003B1;</i>helices linked by turns. The overall shape is like a barrel. The eight <i>&#x003B2;</i>-strands at the centre are arranged in a parallel <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet, resembling a cylinder. Since this forms the core of the protein, all the amino acid residues in the middle of the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet are hydrophobic. Surrounding the <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet are a series of amphiphilic helices, which have a non- polar face pointing towards the protein core and a polar face pointing into solution. The overall structure has a close-packed non-polar core and a predominantly polar surface that interacts with solution. Residual non- polar regions of the surface of individual TIM molecules are buried when they associate to form a dimer, the native quaternary structure of the enzyme. As will be discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, the interaction of a particular part of the surface of each protein chain, the &#x2018;active site&#x2019;, with substrate molecules is responsible for the catalytic activity of this enzyme.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">&#x2018;Amphiphilic&#x2019; is derived from Greek, meaning &#x2018;lover of both&#x2019;. An amphiphilic helix is one that likes both polar and non-polar environments, by virtue of having polar and non-polar faces. The close-packed nature of globular proteins maximizes van der Waals interactions that help to stabilize the structure and provide the rigidity essential for their function.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In order to achieve its functional state after synthesis on the ribosome (see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.11">Section 9.11</a>), a protein must fold to the specific structure unique to its particular sequence. The manner in which this occurs is the subject of intense investigation by experimentalists and theoreticians. It is a key link between sequence and structure, and hence to our ability to predict structures, understand protein functions, and design new proteins for specific tasks.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Steric interactions limit the conformational opportunities open to most amino acid residues in a protein chain. Two regular structural units, the <i>&#x003B1;</i>-helix and <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet, which conform with these requirements, and which exploit favourable hydrogen bonding arrangements, are common in proteins. These secondary structural units, when extended along a sequence, can form fibres. In most proteins, they are connected by loops which allow the protein chain to fold into a compact &#x2018;globular&#x2019; structure. Individual protein chains often fold into regular structures, and sometimes aggregate, in order to bury non-polar regions of the protein that would otherwise be exposed to solvent. The resulting well-defined structures can be consolidated by covalent cross-linking, e.g. by disulphide formation. We now know a great deal about the structures of some proteins and this knowledge provides a solid basis for understanding their properties; however, whilst it is possible to rationalize why a particular structure is preferred, it is difficult to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. The generation of three-dimensional structural information for proteins whose sequences are known continues to be a major research challenge, particularly in attempts to define structures and functions for the large number of proteins identified in the sequencing of the human genome. It forms the core of a contemporary field of research known as structural genomics.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In conditions such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and &#x2018;mad cow disease&#x2019;, proteins that are normally globular and soluble misfold and adopt a largely <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet structure (related to the fibroin structure described in <a href="#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>). In this form the proteins aggregate to form an extended <i>&#x003B2;</i>-sheet structure. The resulting insoluble material that is deposited in the diseased tissue is thought to be at least partly responsible for the characteristic degeneration of the brain associated with these diseases. It is believed that incorrectly folded proteins can promote the misfolding of other molecules, and hence that such proteins,&#x2018;prions&#x2019;, can cause some diseases of this type to be transmissible or &#x2018;infectious&#x2019;.</p>
