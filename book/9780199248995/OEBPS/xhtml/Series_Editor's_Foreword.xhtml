<p class="fmnoindent" style="width:65%;">Huge progress towards the understanding of biological systems and processes continues to be made through the application of the principles and techniques of organic chemistry. As a result, chemical biology now forms part of organic chemistry and biochemistry courses at University. This Oxford Chemistry Primer provides a concise introduction to chemical biology for chemistry and biochemistry students at the start of their University apprenticeships, and will serve to stimulate and excite their interest in this important area of science where chemistry overlaps with biology. As with other &#x2018;Foundation&#x2019; Chemistry Primers this primer will also be of interest to young people studying chemistry or biology in their final year at school or college and their teachers.</p>
