<p class="noindent">Compartmentalisation is an essential part of life as we know it; the contents of cells are different from their surroundings. Cells maintain a distinct repertoire of chemical processes and in order to do so they minimise the uptake of undesirable chemicals and the loss of desirable ones. The compartments of living organisms are bounded by semipermeable membranes. So far, attention has been focused on the internal contents of cells, a collection of water-soluble chemicals. This chapter examines the molecular components of the membranes enclosing these compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Most organic compounds are immiscible with water and tend to associate in aqueous solution. This association is exploited by cells, which use a class of compounds, the lipids, to form the basic structures of cell membranes.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter develops an awareness of the intrinsic chemistry of the most common lipids, phospholipids; the basis of their association to form membranes; and some of the implications of compartmentalisation.</p>

<p class="noindent">The membranes found in biological systems are formed by the sponta- neousassociation of relatively small organic molecules, lipids (<a href="#fig_8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>). The membrane structures arise because of the amphiphilic nature of lipid molecules; one end (the 'polar head group&#x2019;) is hydrophilic, the remainder is a hydrophobic tail.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common lipids, phospholipids, are sugar phosphate derivatives. Glycerol-3-phosphate (<a href="#fig_8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>), the core of phospholipids, is ideally suited to act as a molecular scaffold. Both the acid group of the phosphate</p>

The ability of both sugar and phosphate portions to form esters allows sugar phosphates to act as linking groups.

<p class="noindent2a-1">In mammals, the chains of fatty acids incorporated into lipids are typically between 12 and 20 carbons in length. They comprise an even number of carbons because they are biosynthesized by successive additions of a two-carbon unit&#x2014;a derivative of acetic acid, acetyl CoA (the generation of acetyl CoA is mentioned in an aside to <a href="#sec_8.6">Section 8.6</a>). Common unsaturated fatty acids contain up to six double bonds; the double-bond geometry is usually <i>cis</i> and, where more than one double bond is found, there is usually a single methylene group separating the double bonds.</p>
<p class="noindent2a">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Some cells generate esters of glycerol with three links to fatty acids. These triglycerides, found for example in animal fat, are insoluble in water.

<p class="noindent">When phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine, are introduced into water, the charged hydrophilic &#x2018;head group&#x2019; interacts favourably with water. By contrast, the large non-polar surfaces of the fatty acid chains disrupt the hydrogen bonding properties of water. To avoid this unfa- vourable interaction with water, lipid molecules associate to form large assemblies that prevent the fatty acids from coming into contact with water (<a href="#fig_8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>).</p>

The corresponding non-polar chains associate with the non-polar surface of a second layer of lipids. In associating to form a bilayer, the hydrophobic portions of lipids become buried away from water. The core of the bilayer is a sheet of non-polar material that prevents the free passage of polar species from one side to the other.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Cells as compartments</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cells are surrounded by a membrane. This allows them to maintain a controlled environment appropriate for their chemical processes. Cells are, however, in dynamic interaction with the world, since the membrane is semipermeable and allows cells to concentrate useful chemicals, such as foodstuffs. There is also a selective advantage for cells to deplete the levels of some chemicals relative to their environment, e.g. it is important to excrete undesirable materials. The movement of chemicals into and out of cells is mediated, primarily, by proteins embedded within the membrane. The membranes surrounding cells are thus rather more complex than simple lipid bilayers (<a href="#fig_8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Proteins are more highly functionalised than lipids and add chemical variety to the membrane. In particular, many membrane-bound proteins allow the migration of selected species through the membrane. Some of these channels simply allow free migration of a particular ion or molecule through the membrane, thereby equilibrating internal and external concentrations. Others act as pumps, or as gates&#x2014;opening selectively in response to specific needs of the cell.</p>
<p class="indent">The concentration of nutrients is of obvious benefit to cells. Cells use energy to concentrate some chemicals internally, thereby creating concentration gradients with the environment. Cells also actively pump out some chemicals. This is not just true of unwanted waste products; it is also true of some simple ions, such as protons and metal ions. Once the concentration of ions is higher outside the cell than inside, there is a thermodynamic driving force for the ion to return and equalise the concentrations. This pumping mechanism is actually exploited as a store of chemical energy.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">The proteins found in membranes are specifically inserted there for functional purposes. They expose largely non-polar surfaces to the non-polar core of the membrane. This situation contrasts with water-soluble proteins, where such residues are found buried away from the surface. Membrane-bound proteins can often be identified from their amino acid composition: the regions of the molecule embedded in a membrane are rich in non-polar residues.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Proteins and oligosaccharides provide a wide variety of molecular structures. When membrane bound, they play an important role in molecular recognition processes. For example, antibodies are glycoproteins (proteins with oligosaccharides attached) found on the surface of some blood cells. They recognise possible infective agents by interacting specifically with foreign molecules; these molecular recognition processes mediate the immune response.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Proteins spanning the cell membrane allow communication with the outside world. Some play a role in &#x2018;signal transduction&#x2019; where specific interactions with a molecule outside the cell trigger changes inside the cell. Hormones, e.g. insulin, present in the bloodstream exert their influence on the activity of cells in this way.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">Glucose metabolism provides an example of the concentration of chemicals from the environment.

<p class="noindent">Favourable chemical reactions are used to establish a concentration gradient. When ions are allowed to re-enter the cell, to redress the imbalance, the flow of ions is coupled to the regeneration of chemical energy (<a href="#fig_8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sea water is rich in sodium chloride, together with other ions such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. These ions are essential for all life. Cells manipulate the relative concentrations of these ions inside and outside cells, and exploit the resulting concentration gradients in a variety of ways. As an example, it is common for multicellular organisms to maintain comparatively low concentrations of sodium ions within cells relative to the extracellular environment (Table 8.1). In animals this is achieved by the action of a membrane-bound protein, sodium-potassium ATPase. This protein is a pump that exploits the energetically favourable hydrolysis of ATP to move sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell. For each ATP molecule that is hydrolysed, three sodium ions are pumped out of the cell and two potassium ions are pumped in. The action of this pump generates concentration gradients of these ions and leads to an electrical potential across the cell membrane. Such phenomena are exploited by cells for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">With a much higher concentration outside the cell than in, the re-entry of sodium ions is favourable. As an example, some cells in the intestine use this driving force to facilitate the uptake of nutrients (<a href="#fig_8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>). Special <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Lipids: cells as compartments</a>proteins act as channels in the membrane allowing sodium ions to enter the cell, but only if this process is accompanied by the entry of an amino acid, e.g. alanine, or a monosaccharide, e.g. glucose. In this way the favourable entry of sodium ions drives the uptake of another nutrient.</p>




<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Metal ions, other than sodium, are also used in biological signalling. For example, the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells is kept low (Table 8.1). The selective uptake of calcium ions provides a signalling mechanism for a wide range of processes, such as the activation of enzymes involved in blood clotting and digestion.</p>

<p class="indent">The propagation of electrical signals along nerve cells is a related phenomenon. In response to a chemical signal from a neighbouring nerve cell, sodium ions (Table 8.1) are allowed to flow into a nerve cell through sodium ion-selective pores. This inflow of cations increases the positive charge within the cell and hence results in a change in the electrical potential across the membrane. The result is that an electrical signal propagates along the nerve cell to transmit the nerve signal.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oxidative phosphorylation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen is a central element for life, being a key component of water and organic compounds. In addition, concentration gradients of hydrogen ions, protons, are a critical feature of cellular activity; they are used to generate ATP as part of a two-stage process termed &#x2018;oxidative phosphorylation&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>). Favourable redox reactions are carried out at a membrane and used to drive the export of protons, thereby producing a proton concentration gradient. In a second stage, the re-entry of protons is coupled to the production of ATP. This coupling is discussed in a little more detail below.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxidative conversion of glucose to pyruvate (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) produces two molecules of ATP directly for each molecule of glucose that has been metabolised. The other product of the redox chemistry is the reduced nicotinamide compound, NADH. In the presence of an appropriate oxidising agent, this species can be reoxidised. The oxygen in an aerobic atmosphere is a powerful electron acceptor. Electrons liberated from NADH are transferred indirectly to oxygen, reducing it to water (<a href="#fig_8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>). This series of favourable electron transfer steps take place at the cell membrane and is coupled to the export of protons (<a href="#fig_8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>). The favourable return of protons, which redresses the concentration imbalance, is used to generate ATP.</p>

A series of electron transfer steps is catalysed by protein complexes embedded in the inner membrane. This electron transfer chemistry results in the export of pro-tons from the interior of the mitochondria to an intermembrane space. A further protein complex in the inner membrane acts as a channel to allow the re-entry of protons but only when coupled to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sugars and phosphates can both form esters with more than one partner, and so are useful as linking units in the construction of complex molecules. A phosphate group retains its polar ionic character when linked, in this fashion, to two alcohols. By appending a combination of non-polar fatty acid groups and a polar alcohol to a glycerol phosphate core, molecules containing both non-polar and polar regions are produced. These lipid molecules spontaneously associate in water to bury the non- polar regions, whilst leaving the polar groups exposed. As a result they form membranes which are exploited by cells as a means of compart- mentalisation. Proteins embedded within the membrane add chemical diversity and render the membrane semipermeable; they interact with the outside world, and can be used to manipulate the flow of chemicals into and out of cells. Compartmentalisation allows the generation and exploitation of concentration gradients of ions. These gradients play an important role in many aspects of biochemistry, such as signalling and energy generation.</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-55em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Mitochondria are small bodies (&#x2018;organelles&#x2019;) capable of carrying out oxidative phosphorylation; they are found within eukaryotic (but not prokaryotic) cells. By comparison, aerobic bacteria undertake oxidative phosphorylation at the bacterial membrane. The mitochondrial and bacterial systems are very similar. It is thought that they are ancestrally related. On this view, mitochondria are descendents of bacteria that established an interdependent (&#x2018;symbiotic&#x2019;) relationship with early eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The protein complex that mediates proton re-entry and ATP production, F<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;F<sub>0</sub> ATPase, mediates a similar type of process to the Na&#x2014;K ATPase (Sec- tion 8.4). In this case the process is run in the reverse direction to produce ATP from a concentration gradient. F<sub>1</sub>&#x2014; F<sub>0</sub> ATPase is a complex assembly of proteins which acts like a molecular motor. It is a good example of a molecular device (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.6">Section 1.6</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">As well as oxidising the reduced cofactors produced by glycolysis, mitochondria also mediate the further oxidative metabolism of pyruvate. Firstly pyruvate is oxidised to produce carbon dioxide and a thioester derivative of acetate, acetyl CoA. The latter is then oxidised by a series of reactions known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle). The overall effect of this cycle is to convert the two carbons of acetyl CoA into carbon dioxide and generate more nucleoside triphosphate, both directly and via further oxidative phosphorylation of the reduced cofactors that are produced. A combination of all these processes produces 38 molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose oxidized completely to carbon dioxide.</p></aside>
