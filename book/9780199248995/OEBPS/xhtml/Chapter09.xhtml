<h2 class="h2">9.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cells are complex entities, localized capsules of chemicals that can reproduce to generate new cells of a near-identical nature. The nature of a particular cell depends on the array of chemicals within the cell and the nature of their interconversion. Proteins play a key role in establishing this identity; they are intimately involved in all the activities of the cell, e.g. the uptake and transport of small molecules, and the catalysis of chemical reactions. The information used by a cell is, therefore, related to the repertoire of proteins present.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, a cell contains a &#x2018;permanent&#x2019; information store that contains the blueprint needed to carry out all the processes of which the cell is capable. This is the genetic information that is inherited when a cell divides and produces more cells. Not all of this information will be in use at any one time and place. Cells of all kinds make and use particular proteins at different times, in response to particular demands; this flexibility derives from the use of a &#x2018;transient&#x2019; form of information.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x2018;Permanent&#x2019; and &#x2018;transient&#x2019; information storage in cells is associated with nucleic acids: the polymers <i>d</i>eoxyribo <i>n</i>ucleic <i>a</i>cid (DNA) and <i>r</i>ibo <i>n</i>ucleic <i>a</i>cid (RNA), respectively. These polymers are built from nucleotide monomer units. The information carried by nucleic acids is contained in the nature of the monomer units and their order along the polymeric chain. Amongst other things, this ordering provides the information for the construction of the proteins produced by cells.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter will discuss the nature of nucleotides and of the polymers that derive from them&#x2014;nucleic acids. These polymers fold into ordered structures for similar reasons to those that result in protein folding and give rise to the spontaneous assembly of lipids into membranes. The structural features of nucleic acids, which are exploited in their role as information stores, are described first. This is followed by an outline of the way in which this information is accessed and transmitted from generation to generation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nucleotides are formed from three components: a sugar, ribose or 2-deoxyribose; a phosphate group; and a heterocyclic base (<a href="#fig_9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>), one of a set of related, nitrogen-containing compounds. <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">9.2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The sugar phosphates of nucleotides</h3>
<p class="noindent">The sugar found in most nucleotide derivatives, including RNA, is a five- carbon sugar, ribose. DNA is based on a closely related sugar, 2-deoxy- ribose, a ribose derivative in which the hydroxyl group on C-2 is replaced by hydrogen. As explained in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, these sugars adopt cyclic structures.</p>
<p class="indent">Like a lipid, a nucleotide is a phosphate ester of a sugar. Ribose and 2-deoxyribose both have more than one free alcohol group and so can form more than one ester link. The most common unit for nucleotides, including that forming the building blocks of DNA and RNA, involves a phosphate ester linkage to the primary alcohol function at C-5 (<a href="#fig_9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2" style="width:58%;">9.2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Heterocyclic bases: the third component of nucleic acids</h2>
<p class="noindent">The component that distinguishes a nucleotide from the other classes of molecule discussed so far is the heterocyclic base. The bases found in nucleotides are planar, cyclic, aromatic molecules containing an array of nitrogen-based functional groups; oxygen-derived functional groups are also present in three of the bases, and, like the nitrogen-based ones, are capable of hydrogen bonding.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two classes of heterocyclic bases (<a href="#fig_9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>); both contain a six- mem bered ring with two nitrogens in a 1,3 arrangement. In one class, only</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-64em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">Nucleotides based on ribose are used for a wide variety of tasks in biochemistry&#x2014;both as small molecules, e.g. ATP, and incorporated into the polymer, RNA. By contrast, the biochemistry of nucleotides derived from 2-deoxyribose is far more specialized; it is dominated by their use as monomers for the construction of DNA. The choice of 2-deoxyribose is closely related to the specific role of DNA as a long-term information store (see <a href="#sec_9.10">Section 9.10</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Three of the heterocyclic bases, adenine, guanine and cytosine, are common to both RNA and DNA. RNA and DNA differ, however, in the fourth base employed: uracil is found in RNA and thymine is found in DNA. The difference in structure is only subtle: a methyl group replaces one of the hydrogen atoms attached to the ring. This has no significant effect on the chemical properties, and the two bases behave in very similar ways.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:5em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the acyclic form of ribose, the carbonyl group is an aldehyde; ribose is, therefore, an aldo-pentose. The relationship between the acyclic and five-membered ring forms of ribose is shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig_6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>. In the cyclic structures of ribose and 2-deoxyribose, the former carbonyl carbon, C-1, is still distinct and recognizable by the fact that it forms two bonds to oxygen.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:5em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Although RNA is built from four basic monomers, modification of some bases is observed in certain circumstances. This parallels the situation in proteins where a basic repertoire of 20 building blocks is sometimes augmented by modification of a side chain after biosynthesis of a protein molecule.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The links between the components of nucleotides correspond to the products of dehydration reactions. The latter are all ultimately driven by the chemical reactivity of polyphosphates, e.g. ATP. The bond- forming processes involve nucleophilic substitution reactions with phosphates utilized as good leaving groups.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In the structure of nucleotides the heterocyclic base is found in a particular orientation relative to the sugar ring. It is above the plane of the ring, as nucleotides are conventionally drawn. This is the so-called <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.3">Section 6.3</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:2em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The full names of the nucleotide building blocks of DNA are 2 <i>&#x02032;</i>--deoxyadenosine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monophosphate (dAMP), 2 <i>&#x02032;</i>--deoxy- guanosine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>-monophosphate (dGMP), 2 <i>&#x02032;</i>--deoxycytidine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>-- monophosphate (dCMP), and 2 <i>&#x02032;</i>--deoxythymidine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>- monophosphate (dTMP).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">Care must be taken to avoid confusion with the names of heterocyclic bases and nucleosides. For example, aden<span class="uline">ine</span> is a base and aden<span class="uline">osin</span>e a nucleoside, but cyt<span class="uline">osine</span> is a base and cy<span class="uline">tidine</span> a nucleoside.</p></aside>


<p class="noindent">a single ring is present; these heterocycles are known as pyrimidines. In the other class, a second (five-membered) ring, an imidazole, is fused onto the six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic structure known as a purine. The biologically important purines and pyrimidines are each of two types, depending on whether they have oxygen or nitrogen substituents at key positions on the ring (see <a href="#fig_9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The bases as a whole are not, however, very polar molecules, and they are not readily solvated by water: the faces of the rings provide a large surface area of low polarity (see <a href="#fig_9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>); the edges provide hydrogen bonding capability.</p>

<h3 class="h3">9.2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The structures of nucleotides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nucleotides are generated by forming a link between a particular nitrogen atom of a heterocyclic base (N-l of pyrimidines and N-9 of purines) and the C-l atom of the sugar phosphate unit (<a href="#fig_9.4">Fig. 9.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are four types of nucleotide in RNA and DNA. They are distinguished by the identity of the particular base incorporated (<a href="#fig_9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>). In the case of ribonucleotides, the four bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil. The combination of a heterocyclic base and ribose, without a phosphate group present, is known as a nucleoside: adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and uridine, respectively. Nucleotides are generally named as phosphate esters of nucleosides. Hence the corresponding nucleotides are adenosine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monophosphate (AMP), guanosine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monophosphate (GMP), cytidine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monophosphate (CMP) and uridine-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monopho- sphate (UMP). The presence of the deoxyribose sugar is sometimes denoted by the prefix d. Hence, the abbreviated names for the four deoxyribonucleoside-5 <i>&#x02032;</i>--monophosphates are dAMP, dGMP, dCMP and dTMP (<a href="#fig_9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">RNA carries out a range of biochemical tasks. There are three major classes of RNA molecules in cells, categorized according to their different <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a>biochemical function: messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the information for the sequence of a protein from DNA; transfer RNA (tRNA), which decodes this information during the biosynthesis of pro- teins; and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is associated with ribosomes, the protein-synthesizing machinery. By contrast, DNA has a single biochemical role, as the molecule associated with storage of genetic information. In the following discussion the structural properties of RNA, which make it such a versatile polymer, will initially be elaborated. The structural features of DNA, which equip it for its specialized biochemical niche, will be described subsequently.</p>
<p class="indent">Like proteins and lipids, nucleic acids are amphiphilic molecules. These molecules adopt ordered structures in water which present polar regions to solvent and bury non-polar regions. As with proteins, nucleic acids fold into structures containing helical regions. In these structures the sugar phosphate backbone of nucleic acids interacts effectively with water while the low-polarity heterocyclic bases (<a href="#fig_9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>) are buried. The structure of several members one class of RNA, tRNA, have been determined in detail by X-ray crystallography, and one example is shown in <a href="#fig_9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of a tRNA molecule (<a href="#fig_9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>) reveals several interesting structural features. As with globular proteins, local helical regions are linked by turns to allow this molecule to fold into a compact structure. The sugar phosphate backbone runs like a ribbon over the surface of the molecule with most of the bases encapsulated within. Almost all of the bases (71 of 76) are stacked on top of one another (<a href="#fig_9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>). This arrangement allows the non-polar faces of the bases to make intimate contact with each other and avoid contact with water.</p>

<p class="noindent">The tRNA structure (<a href="#fig_9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>) resembles an &#x2018;L&#x2019; shape, being made up of two short helical regions connected by a hinge. Each helical segment consists of two portions of the RNA chain running in opposite directions, <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a>with each step of the helix consisting of a purine and a pyrimidine. These purine-pyrimidine pairs interact in a particular way, known as Watson- Crick base pairing (<a href="#fig_9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>). The overall geometries of these two pairs are very similar and allow the formation of regular secondary structure. Purine-purine and pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairs cannot be accommodated within this regular structure. Hydrogen bonding takes place between the edges of the six-membered ring of each partner and allows only two discrete combinations in which the hydrogen bonding properties of the bases are complementary: adenosine pairs with uridine (A-U pair) and gua- nosine pairs with cytidine (G-C pair).</p>

Another analogy is with the coiled-coil structure of &#x03B1;-keratin (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>) where two helical strands, each with a hydrophobic face, intertwine to form a double- helical rope structure.

<p class="noindent2a-1">A comparison has been drawn between lipids and nucleotides. One contrast between the fatty acids of lipids and the bases of nucleotides is the range of functional groups present in the latter. A key feature of RNA is that both the heterocyclic bases and the 2 <i>&#x02032;</i>- OH group are capable of hydrogen bonding. This chemical potential is exploited in cells. It is now known that some RNA molecules fold into well-defined three-dimensional shapes capable of catalysing reactions. This behaviour, analogous to that of enzymes, has led to these RNA molecules being dubbed ribozymes. Catalysis by RNA is important in a range of biochemical processes involving RNA, including the operation of the ribosome, the molecular fac- tory which produces proteins (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.2.2">Sections 7.2.2</a> and <a href="#sec_9.11">9.11</a>).</p></aside>

<p class="noindent">It is necessary to consider the hydrogen bonding properties of the heterocyclic bases in order to understand the specific way in which genetic information is stored and transmitted. The pairs of purines and of pyrimidines present in nucleotides differ in the pattern of nitrogen and oxygen substituents around the ring.</p>
<p class="indent">The information content of nucleic acids ultimately resides in a small and subtle molecular distinction: the different chemistry, including hydrogen bonding properties, of an oxygen compared with a nitrogen substituent on the heterocyclic rings. <a href="#fig_9.12">Figure 9.12</a> illustrates the complementary hydrogen bonding patterns of the two Watson-Crick base pairs, and relates these to the location of nitrogen and oxygen substituents.</p>
<p class="indent">The location of oxygen and nitrogen in the six-membered rings affects the chemical properties of the heterocyclic structure. In all cases, the oxygen or nitrogen substituent is attached to a carbon which is also attached to a nitrogen in the ring. When the substituent is oxygen, there are two possible structures ( <i>tautomers</i>) depending on whether the proton associated with the chemical functional group lies on oxygen or on nitrogen (<a href="#fig_9.13">Fig. 9.13</a>). In one tautomer, the proton is associated with the nitrogen, whereas in the other it is bonded to the exocyclic oxygen. The former structure is lower in energy under normal conditions and the &#x2018;keto&#x2019; form predominates. <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a></p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">In guanosine there is an extra exocyclic amino group on the six-membered ring. This allows it to form an extra hydrogen bond with the pyrimidine base (see <a href="#fig_9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>). This stabilizes the G-C base pair, but is not responsible for the selectivity of base pairing, since both pyrimidines have a keto group at the complementary position.</p>

<p class="indent">When the substituent is nitrogen, there is a total of two protons bonded to the relevant nitrogen atoms; again there are two possible ways of arranging these protons (<a href="#fig_9.14">Fig. 9.14</a>). In one tautomer, the &#x2018; imino&#x2019; form (analogous to the &#x2018; keto&#x2019; tautomer described above), each nitrogen has a proton attached, whereas in the other, the &#x2018; enamino&#x2019; form, the exocyclic nitrogen has both protons and the ring nitrogen has none. The latter structure is lower in energy under normal conditions; the &#x2018; enamino&#x2019; form predominates. <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a>Thus the change of nitrogen to oxygen (and vice versa) changes the nature of the preferred tautomer. This, in turn, changes a hydrogen bond donor-acceptor combination to an acceptor-donor arrangement.

<p class="noindent">The structure of tRNA demonstrates that appropriate nucleic acid sequences running in opposite directions can form stable helical structures with complementary hydrogen bonding patterns. In this case a tightly packed structure can be generated by folding the chain in a manner analogous to that of the polypeptide chains in globular proteins. The same structural preference can stabilize dimer formation between a pair of nucleic acid chains. If two discrete nucleic acid chains running in opposite directions (antiparallel) bear complementary sequences of bases, then a stable helical structure results&#x2014;a double helix. In such a structure, both chains independently carry information. It is this complementarity which lies at the heart of the transfer of genetic information. These duplexes can be formed by RNA, by DNA, and by a 1 : 1 mixture of RNA and DNA. Representative duplexes are shown in <a href="#fig_9.15">Fig. 9.15</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.10<span class="space">&#160;</span>DNA: the genetic information of cells</h2>
<p class="noindent">As has been mentioned previously, RNA is used in a variety of roles in biology. By contrast, DNA is the polymer associated with genetic inheritance. Why is DNA so suitable for this particular role? The two polymers are distinguished by the nature of the sugar utilized in the backbone. In DNA the sugar is 2-deoxyribose rather than ribose itself. This apparently minor modification in structure has a dramatic effect on the chemical stability of the polymer and underpins the adoption of DNA as the molecule of genetic inheritance of cells.</p>

<h3 class="h3">9.10.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The relative stability of RNA and DNA</h3>
<p class="noindent">RNA is hydrolysed rather readily in water as a result of acid or, particularly, base catalysis. Phosphate esters in general are relatively slow to hydrolyse because of electrostatic repulsion between the anionic phosphate group and the incoming nucleophile. In RNA, the hydroxyl group at C-2 <i>&#x02032;</i> of the ring is held in close proximity to the phosphate linkage, providing a specific mechanism for nucleophilic attack (<a href="#fig_9.16">Fig. 9.16</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">By removing the hydroxyl group on C-2 <i>&#x02032;</i>, this facile mechanism for cleavage of the phosphate backbone of the polymer is eliminated (<a href="#fig_9.17">Fig. 9.17</a>). DNA is, therefore, less prone to hydrolysis in aqueous solution. This increased stability is of benefit in maintaining intact the substantial nucleic acid chains that carry genetic information for whole organisms.</p>
<p class="indent">Hydrolytic instability is not as great a problem for a molecule acting as a &#x02018;transient&#x02019; form of information as it is for a molecule acting as the &#x02018;permanent&#x02019; genetic information of a complex organism. RNA is well suited to this type of role, and it can readily be recycled once its job is done.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">2-Deoxyribonucleotides are generated from ribonucleotides by enzyme-mediated reduction. Some people view this as evidence that 2-deoxy- ribonucleotides are specialized adaptations of ribonucleotides. Internal attack by the hydroxyl group at C-2 <i>&#x02032;</i> leads to the generation of a cyclic phosphate diester (<a href="#fig_9.16">Fig. 9.16</a>). This, in turn, hydrolyses further to generate an acyclic phosphate monoester.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:3em;">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">The other difference between DNA and RNA is in the identity of one of the pyrimidine bases: T vs U. This also reflects the need for accuracy in maintaining substantial stores of genetic information. C derivatives undergo slow hydrolysis to U analogues (see below). This process damages the reliability of genetic information: U has the opposite hydrogen bonding pattern to C, and so A rather than G would be introduced into a complementary strand. By adding a methyl group to U, this problem can be minimized. T has the same hydrogen bonding properties as U, but the two can be distinguished. &#x2018;Editing&#x2019; enzymes patrol DNA and any nucleotides containing U, rather than T, can be identified as errors and then repaired.</p>

The information carried as the nucleic acids RNA and DNA is in a common &#x2018;language&#x2019;, but requires &#x2018;translation&#x2019; into the language of proteins.The translating molecule which carries information in both languages, and which transfers amino acids to the growing protein chain, is known as transfer RNA, or tRNA (<a href="#fig_9.21">Fig. 9.21</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">This section outlines the three main processes of information transfer in cells. DNA <i>replication</i>, the production of an identical copy of DNA during cell division, occurs in order to pass genetic information to future generations of cells. <i>Transcription</i> is the process whereby the specific information contained within DNA is read by making an RNA comple- ment of a selected segment of DNA. Some of this RNA, mRNA, carries the information required for protein synthesis. This information is decoded to allow the production of proteins of defined sequence, a process known as <i>translation</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the double-helical structures of nucleic acids (<a href="#fig_9.15">Fig. 9.15</a>), each individual strand carries all the information required for the generation of another copy of the other strand. Given one strand, a complementary strand can be produced by placing G opposite C and A opposite U or T. Likewise, a strand of one nucleic acid can be used as a template to generate a complementary strand of a different type.</p>
<p class="indent">The chemistries of DNA and RNA polymerization are closely related (<a href="#fig_9.18">Fig. 9.18</a>). In each case, a growing chain is hydrogen bonded to a template strand. A nucleoside triphosphate, complementary to that on the template chain, binds at the next vacant site. An enzyme catalyses the nucleophilic attack by the 3 <i>&#x02032;</i>hydroxyl group of the growing chain at the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-phosphate of the monomer to generate the phosphate ester linkage.</p>

<p class="noindent">Individual portions of the DNA molecule provide the information for the construction of various RNA molecules and proteins. RNA corresponding to a region of interest is produced by transcription&#x2014;the process whereby an RNA strand is synthesized from a DNA template (see <a href="#fig_9.18">Fig. 9.18</a>). The information for protein synthesis is not accessed directly. Instead it resides in one of the classes of RNA, &#x2018;messenger&#x2019; RNA (&#x2018;m-RNA&#x2019;), produced by transcription.</p>
<p class="indent">Messenger RNA is used to direct the production of protein. It carries the information required for the production of a particular protein to the ribosomes where protein biosynthesis occurs. The relationship between the linear sequence of an mRNA molecule and the linear sequence of the corresponding protein is known as the &#x2018;genetic code&#x2019;. There are four types of nucleotide, but 20 amino acid building blocks in proteins. There cannot, therefore, be a 1: 1 correspondence between the nucleotide order and the amino acid order. Instead, the RNA is read in triplets: three contiguous nucleotides specify a single amino acid. There are 64 (4<sup>3</sup>) such &#x2018;codons&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_9.20">Fig. 9.20</a>).</p>

Viruses have much less genetic information than other organisms and so they do not require this information to be as stable&#x2014;in fact, they benefit from errors to the extent that these increase the rate of evolution.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">The amount of a protein produced (the level of &#x2018;gene expression&#x2019;) is regulated by controlling the activity of the relevant polymerase enzymes. Some proteins, e.g., bind at the promoter region and prevent RNA polymerase binding, there by decreasing the amount of mRNA and, consequently, protein generated. Conversely, proteins that bind to DNA and stimulate RNA polymerase binding can increase the amount of mRNA, and hence protein, synthesized.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1" style="margin-top:3em;">The first residue of a growing protein chain is <i>N</i>-formyl methionine (f) Met in which the amino group is masked:</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1">AUG codons have a dual role: specifying incorporation of <i>N-</i> formyl methionine at the start point and &#x2018;normal&#x2019; methionine within the coding region itself.</p>

<p class="noindent2a-1" style="margin-top:3em;">A few important genetic engineering techniques are listed below, to provide a glimpse of the methodologies that have been developed. DNA can be cut at specific sites with enzymes called restriction enzymes. DNA fragments from different sources, cut by a particular enzyme, can be stuck together (&#x2018;ligated&#x2019;) by the use of enzymes called ligases. DNA is a charged molecule and will not enter cells without assistance; methods have been developed which allow DNA to be introduced into cells, e.g. &#x2018;transformation&#x2019; of E. <i>coli</i> is usually facilitated by bathing the cells in aqueous CaCl<sub>2</sub> DNA sequencing has now become so efficient that the ordering of nucleotides in complete genomes (billions of bases in a unique sequence) can be determined. Finally, preparation of synthetic DNA is now so sophisticated that it can be accomplished efficiently by machine.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">Introduction of DNA that encodes a protein can lead to a new organism that produces this extra protein. The new organism may be of interest in its own right (e.g. the protein might correct a genetic defect in <a id="page_91" class="page">Page 91, Genetic information: nucleotides and nucleic acids</a>the original host, the basis of &#x2018;gene therapy&#x2019;) or may simply be a useful source of the new protein. Genetic engineering experiments depend on the ability to isolate and characterize DNA of interest and combine it with DNA that allows the new sequence to be replicated in the chosen host organism. It is necessary to be able to hydrolyse DNA at specific sites, join pieces of DNA from different sources, introduce DNA into cells, and identify and grow cells that contain the extra DNA. The ability to sequence and synthesize DNA chemically is also a very valuable tool. Extensive research during the latter stages of the twentieth century established this methodology, and genetic engineering has become a routine scientific technique.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2a-1">A DNA molecule that can be used to replicate an attached piece of DNA is called a vector. The vector DNA shown in <a href="#fig_9.23">Fig. 9.23</a> is a &#x2018;plasmid&#x2019;: circular DNA, which can replicate in a host organism by virtue of having an &#x2018;origin of replication&#x2019; (a site recognized by host DNA replication enzymes). Vector DNA also includes one or more &#x2018;markers&#x2019; which allow identification of cells that have taken up plasmid DNA. Bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, are common host organisms and resistance to antibiotics is an important type of marker. For example, <i>E. coli</i> cannot grow in the presence of significant amounts of penicillin (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.10">Section 5.10</a>). Enzymes, known as <i>&#x03B2;</i>- lactamases, which catalyse the destruction of penicillins, allow E. coli to grow in penicillin-containing media. DNA which encodes &#x03B2;-lactamase can be used as a marker: if cells produced by a genetic engineering experiment are grown in penicillin-containing media, only cells which have taken up plasmid DNA (containing the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-lactamase gene and the gene of interest) will grow.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1">In an analogous fashion, genes encoding resistance to herbicides can be introduced into plants. This technology has been used to produce genetically modified food-producing plants. When harvested these plants give rise to &#x2018;GM&#x2019; foods whose production and availability has caused considerable debate.</p>
<p class="noindent2a-1" style="margin-top:13em;"><i>Scientific American</i> is a useful starting point for finding out about the science behind some contemporary issues in genetic engineering. Some recent topics include: research on transgenic animals, <i>Sci</i>. <i>Am</i>., Dec. 1998, pp 30-35; and human genome research, <i>Sci</i>. Am., Jul. 2000, pp. 38-57.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">Genetically engineered microorganisms can be used to produce large amounts of proteins for many purposes, e.g. human insulin is now produced for the treatment of diabetes using this methodology. Proteins can also be manipulated in a systematic way. By changing the DNA that encodes a given protein, the protein sequence can be altered. As an example, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.7">Section 5.7</a> described how changing specific amino acids in an enzyme (TIM) has been used to provide detailed information about catalysis.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.13<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nucleotides are heterocyclic bases linked to a sugar phosphate residue, derived from either ribose or 2-deoxyribose. These units can polymerize to give nucleic acids by ester formation between an alcohol of one nucleotide and a phosphate of another. The sugar phosphate backbone of a nucleic acid is polar, whilst the bases are less polar. In aqueous solution, nucleic acids adopt ordered structures in which the sugar phosphate groups are in contact with water and the bases are buried. An important feature is that helices can form between nucleic acid strands running in opposite directions. These strands interact through complementary hydrogen bonding patterns between bases, determined by the substitution patterns on the heterocyclic bases. This complementary hydrogen bonding is the basis of the storage and transmission of genetic information. It is used in duplicating DNA, the permanent information store of the organism, and in transcription to form RNA, which is used to generate proteins via translation. Genetic engineering exploits biological replication to produce and manipulate proteins of interest.</p>
