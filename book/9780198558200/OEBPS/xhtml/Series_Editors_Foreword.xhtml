<p class="fmnoindent">The foundations of our mechanistic understanding of organic chemistry are based on interpretation of how molecular structure affects chemical reactivity. The kinetics and thermodynamics from which mechanistic information is gleaned include experimental data from studies of equilibria, reaction rates, correlation analysis, catalysis and isotope effects. Howard Maskill covers all these topics in this Primer which is the companion to his Mecha-nisms of Organic Reactions (Primer No 45).</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be included in an 8-10 lecture course. The excellent pedagogical description of physical organic chemistry in this Primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemists alike.</p>
