<p class="noindent">Catalysis is the enhancement of the rate of a reaction by a compound (the catalyst) not generally present in the chemical equation which describes the reaction. Normally, a catalyst remains unchanged by the chemical reaction it catalyses. It brings about the rate enhancement by providing a reaction pathway additional to the one which occurs in its absence. This additional pathway will have its own rate law, and the total rate of reaction in the presence of the catalyst is the sum of the catalysed and uncatalysed pathways as illustrated for a generic second-order reaction in <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1.</a></p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The catalyst provides an additional pathway for the reaction, i.e. the products are not changed and neither is the equilibrium constant if the reaction is reversible.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.2 Electrophile catalysis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The hydrolysis of methyl esters of sterically congested carboxylic acids is very slow even under either acidic or basic conditions. This is because nucleophilic addition of water or hydroxide to the carbonyl group of such esters is sterically hindered. However, the compounds may be cleaved in a different type of reaction using lithium iodide in pyridine. In this reaction, iodide acts as a nucleophile and the carboxylate is the nucleofuge, i.e. it is an 
S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement at the methyl group, but sodium and potassium iodide are not effective.</p>

<b>Fig. 4.2</b> Mechanism for the cleavage of methyl esters of sterically hindered carboxylicacids by lithium iodide in pyridine
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="noindent">A hard Lewis acid cation such as Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is required which is complexed by an oxygen of the ester in a pre-equilibrium and, thereby, converts the carboxylate into a better nucleofuge, as indicated in  <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> where R is a bulky alkyl residue. Catalysis by Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> does not occur if the reaction is carried out in <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Catalysis of organic reactions in solution by small molecules and ions</a>hydroxylic solvents which (unlike pyridine) complex the lithium cation, i.e. they compete too effectively with the ester for the lithium cation.</p>

<p class="indent">The electrophile catalysis mechanism of  <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> may be generalised as shown in  <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3.</a> The substrate in the uncatalysed reaction (A-B) is made more electrophilic, i.e. more reactive towards attack by the nucleophilic reagent (Nu<sup>-</sup>), in the catalytic mechanism by complexation with the catalyst (E<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) in a pre-equilibrium.  <a href="#fig_4.3">Figure 4.3</a> illustrates another feature of catalysis in general, not just electrophile catalysis: although an uncatalysed reaction may be concerted, i.e. single step, catalytic mechanisms are necessarily multi-step proceeding through intermediates whose lifetimes vary widely according to the particular reaction.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3	Specific acid catalysis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">When electrophile catalysis involves proton transfer, i.e. the catalyst is a Br&#x00F8;nsted rather than a Lewis acid, it is called <i>acid catalysis</i> and is very common for a wide range of reactions especially in aqueous solution. The phenomenon is further subdivided into <i>specific</i> and <i>general</i> acid catalysis according to an experimental criterion but, as we shall see, there is a fundamental mechanistic basis to this distinction. First, specific acid catalysis will be introduced through a familiar reaction, then this will be used to demonstrate how the phenomenon is investigated and how it is distinguished experimentally from general acid catalysis.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Hydrolysis of simple carboxylic esters</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The hydrolysis of a simple ester such as ethyl ethanoate is reversible, and the equilibrium constant at normal temperatures is such that the reaction may be driven in either direction by an appropriate choice of experimental conditions. A low concentration of ester in water will give a very high conversion to ethanol and ethanoic acid at equilibrium, and a low concentration of ethanoic acid in ethanol will give a good conversion to ester at equilibrium. However,<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Catalysis of organic reactions in solution by small molecules and ions</a> the reaction in either direction is very slow at normal temperatures in the absence of a catalyst.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">For the catalysed hydrolysis of a simple ester, the source of the hydronium ions does not matter. It could be from the complete dissociation of a dilute strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid of known concentration, or it could be from an acidic buffer solution of uncertain composition but of known p<i>H</i> (e.g., by measurement using a p<i>H</i> meter) from which the concentration of hydronium ions may be calculated.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">We know from the above that the low concentration of hydronium ions from the incomplete dissociation of a weak acid will catalyse the reaction according to <a href="#eq_4.3">eqn 4.3,</a> but what about the effect of the undissociated acid?

<h3 class="h3"><b>General base catalysis and reaction mechanisms</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">The experimental observation of a general base catalysis rate law is often mechanistically ambiguous because several mechanisms, besides rate-limiting proton abstraction (as in the Aldol reaction at high concentration), may lead to the same rate law. The hydrolysis of reactive esters such as ethyl dichloroethanoate and 4-nitrophenyl ethanoate, for example, are reactions which have general base catalysis rate laws, but cannot involve rate-limiting proton abstraction from the substrate. Typical bases in such reactions are amines like pyridine or imidazole (buffered with pyridinium or imidazolium perchlorate, for example) or sodium ethanoate (buffered with ethanoic acid).</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Nucleophile catalysis.</i> We have already encountered nucleophile catalysis, one of the two main hydrolytic mechanisms which lead to the general base catalysis rate law. We shall illustrate the mechanism in the present context with the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl ethanoate catalysed by ethanoate.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">This reaction was investigated in solutions buffered just on the acid side of neutrality in order to suppress the rapid hydrolysis induced by hydroxide (but it was necessary to establish that ethanoic acid itself is not catalytically active). This illustrates there is no paradox about having general base catalysis under acidic conditions.</p>
<p class="aside">Since the solution is acidic, the intercept in Fig. 4.17 will include some reaction catalysed by the small concentration of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, i.e., <i>k<sub>o</sub></i> &#x003D; <i>k<sub>o</sub>&#x0027;</i> &#x002B; <i>k<sub>H</sub></i> [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] where <i>k<sub>o</sub>&#x0027;</i> is the rate constant for the reaction genuinely induced by just water, and <i>k<sub>H</sub></i> the catalytic constant for reaction catalysed by hydronium ion.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The catalytic mechanism of <a href="#fig_4.18">Fig. 4.18</a> involves rate-limiting formation of the reactive intermediate, and the rate law derived from it has the same form as the catalytic term in the experimental rate law.

<p class="indent3-ka">Demonstrating that the proposed mechanism leads to the observed rate law, however, does not prove that the mechanism is correct. Corroborative evidence is required-preferably direct evidence of ethanoic anhydride as a reactive intermediate. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of a low concentration of aniline (PhNH<sub>2</sub>), acetanilide (PhNHAc) was formed. The most economical explanation of this product analysis evidence is that aniline, a much better nucleophile than water, traps some of the low concentration of ethanoic anhydride formed as an intermediate in the mechanism of<a href="#fig_4.18"> Fig. 4.18.</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">It was already known that aniline reacts with acetic anhydride in dilute aqueous solution to give acetanilde. In principle, however, the acetanilide could also have been formed through a direct reaction between aniline and the ester. In that event, the aniline would have led to a rate enhancement, i.e. there would have been a term in the rate law first order in [aniline]. No such rate effect was detected.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Mechanistic general base catalysis.</i> Ethanoic anhydride, the compound which was formed as a reactive intermediate in the ethanoate-catalysed hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl ethanoate discussed above, is a stable compound under non- hydrolytic conditions.

Exactly how ethanoate exerted its catalytic effect was something of a conundrum. Ethanoate is now thought to catalyse the reaction by enhancing the nucleophilicity of water. In other words, water alone hydrolyses ethanoic anhydride by acting as a nucleophile, but ethanoate ions (like some other general bases) also provide<a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Catalysis of organic reactions in solution by small molecules and ions.</a>an additional route by enhancing the nucleophilicity of other water molecules through hydrogen bonding.

<h3 class="h3">Distinguishing between nucleophile catalysis and mechanistic general base catalysis for solvolytic reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that kinetic general base catalysis is mechanistically ambiguous. The most obvious mechanism leading to this rate law is when deprotonation of the substrate is rate limiting, e.g. the Aldol reaction in concentrated solution. Generally, rate-limiting proton transfer is easy to characterise by substrate deuterium kinetic isotope effect measurements. If proton transfer is rate limiting, the deuterium analogue reacts appreciably slower than the protium one as we shall see in the next chapter. However, when the reaction does not involve rate-limiting deprotonation of the substrate but is solvolytic, the two commonest mechanisms leading to kinetic general base catalysis are nucleophile catalysis and mechanistic general base catalysis. It is not always easy to distinguish between them, but there are three general strategies, the first two being more widely applicable.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">A solvolytic reaction is one in which the solvent is both the reaction medium and a reactant.For example, in water, it is hydrolysis, in methanol, it is methanolysis, in ethanoic acid (acetic acid) it is called acetolysis.Solvolytic reactions are invariably <i>pseudo</i> first order in the substrate.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Catalysis of organic reactions in solution by small molecules and ions.</a>1. <i>Identification of an intermediate to confirm nucleophile catalysis.</i> We saw above in the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl ethanoate that the intermediate, ethanoic anhydride, could be intercepted by aniline. This is an example of a general technique and, if the outcome is positive, i.e. an intermediate is trapped, provides incontrovertible evidence that the mechanism is nucleophile catalysis.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Alternatively, an intermediate may be confirmed spectroscopically as in the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl ethanoate catalysed by imidazole (buffered with imidazolium perchlorate), <a href="#eq_4.21">eqn 4.21.</a> In this reaction, the ester suffers nucleophilic attack by imidazole to give <i>N</i>-acetylimidazolium as a reactive intermediate in rapid equilibrium with its deprotonated form, <i>N</i>-acetylimidazole, which can be detected by UV spectroscopy.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Failure to intercept a reactive electrophilic intermediate with a nucleophilic reagent, or to detect it spectroscopically, does not prove there is no intermediate.

<p class="noindent">2.	<i>Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect measurements.</i> If the reaction of <a href="#eq_4.21">eqn 4.21</a> above is carried out in D2O instead of H<sub>2</sub>0, the rate is unchanged,</p>

<p class="aside">When the proton transfer to the base is concerted with the nucleophilic attack of the water molecule, the rate law is kinetic general base catalysis.

A reaction in which the proton is about half transferred will lead to an <i>&#x03B1;</i> value of about 0.5.

<p class="aside">An &#x03B1; value close to zero corresponds to an acid catalysed reaction for which weak acids are all comparably effective. The reaction, therefore, will be dominated by the proton donor present in highest concentration, i.e. water when the reaction is in aqueous solution. Catalysis is difficult to detect for such a reaction-it will appear uncatalysed.<br/>An &#x03B1; value close to unity corresponds to an acid catalysed reaction dominated by the strongest acid present. In water, the strongest acid possible is hydronium ion, so such reactions appear to be specific acid catalysed.</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3">The Br&#x00F8;nsted relationship for nucleophile catalysed and mechanistic general base catalysed hydrolytic reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that the kinetic general base catalysis rate law for the hydrolysis of, for example, a reactive ester may be a consequence of either nucleophile catalysis or mechanistic general base catalysis. In the latter, the base catalyst accepts a proton from a water molecule as the water acts as nucleophile. Since proton transfer is involved in this reaction (though not from the substrate), the gradient of a plot of log<i>k</i><sub>B</sub> against p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>(BH<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) is constrained (at least by simple theory) to range between zero and unity, and the plot may be regarded as a conventional Br&#x00F8;nsted correlation.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the nucleophile catalysis mechanism, however, proton transfer is not involved at all; a plot of log<i>k</i><sub>B</sub> against p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>(BH<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) now simply expresses an empirical relationship between catalytic effectiveness and base strength for the family of nucleophile catalysts. In such a correlation, there is no reason in principle why the gradient, i.e. the Br&#x00F8;nsted coefficient, should not be greater than unity. Indeed, observation of a Br&#x00F8;nsted coefficient greater than unity for a hydrolysis reaction catalysed by a family of compounds which may act as nucleophiles or bases is evidence that the mechanism is nucleophile catalysis rather than mechanistic general base catalysis.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the reactions of <a href="#eq_4.27">eqn 4.27</a> have concerted mechanisms via transition structures (<a href="#eq_4.1">4.1</a>), then their reverse, <a href="#eq_4.29">eqn 4.29</a>, must also be concerted via the same transition structures, and will again lead to a simple linear Br&#x00F8;nsted-type correlation. For the reactions of <a href="#eq_4.29">eqn 4.29</a>, however, the gradient will be negative (leading to a positive &#x03B2;<sub>ig</sub>) as sketched in <a href="#fig_4.26">Fig. 4.26(a).</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Profiles for the step-wise possibilities for <a href="#eq_4.29">eqn 4.29</a> are shown in <a href="#fig_4.27">Fig. 4.27.</a> The initial nucleophilic attack by X&#x203E; gives a tetrahedral intermediate which then leads on to product by expulsion of the nucleofuge ArO&#x203E;.

<p class="indent3-ka">Profile (a) in <a href="#fig_4.27">Fig. 4.27</a> describes the reaction when X<sup>-</sup> and ArO&#x203E; are comparably good nucleofuges, so the tetrahedral intermediate partitions equally between return to starting materials and forward reaction to products. Profile (b) describes the reaction when ArO&#x203E; is made a better nucleofuge than X&#x203E;, e.g. by introduction of a nitro group into Ar, and the pof its conjugate acid is smaller. The forward reaction from the intermediate is now faster than the reverse of the first step, so the first step is rate limiting in the overall reaction. Thirdly, profile (c) describes the reaction when ArO&#x203E; has been made a worse nucleofuge than X&#x203E;; return to starting materials is faster than the second forward step which is now rate limiting in the overall reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Consequently, the complete &#x03B2;<sub>ig</sub> Br&#x00F8;nsted-type correlation for step-wise mechanisms has a discontinuity as sketched in <a href="#fig_4.26">Fig. 4.26(b)</a>. There is a small &#x03B2;<sub>ig</sub> for those faster reactions described by profile (b) in<a href="#fig_4.27"> Fig. 4.27</a>, i.e. with rate-limiting initial addition, and a larger value for the slower reactions when the second step, the departure of the nucleofuge, is rate limiting.</p>
