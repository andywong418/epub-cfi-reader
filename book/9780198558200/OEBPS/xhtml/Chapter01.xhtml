<p class="noindent">Collisions between molecules provide the energy for bimolecular and unimolecular thermal reactions to occur. For two molecules in the gas phase, there are six translational degrees of freedom and up to six rotational ones (depending upon the symmetries of the molecules). The number of vibrational degrees of freedom is then determined by the number of atoms in the two molecules such that the total number of degrees of freedom (translational plus rotational plus vibrational) is equal to 3<i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is the total number of atoms in the two molecules.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">In photochemical reactions, molecules are energised by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, and electronically excited states are involved.</p>


<p class="aside">The <i>total</i> number of degrees of freedom of a system of atoms depends only upon the number of atoms, <i>n.</i> How the 3<i>n</i> degrees of freedom are distributed amongst translation, vibration, and rotation depends upon how the atoms are combined into molecules.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">In a bimolecular reaction, three translational and (normally) up to three rotational degrees of freedom are lost in the formation of the activated complex; since the total has to remain the same, a corresponding number of new vibrational degrees of freedom are formed. In other words, translational and possibly rotational energy of the two molecules immediately before the collision is converted into vibrational energy in the rebonding which takes place as the original molecules become the activated complex. If insufficient energy of the colliding molecules is converted, the molecules simply distort then separate without reacting. Even if sufficient translational and rotational energy is converted into vibrational energy, the activated complex may still fall apart to reactant molecules rather than proceed to product(s).</p>

</aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">In a unimolecular reaction, a molecular collision leaves one of the molecules in a vibrationally excited state which either reacts or simply loses its excess energy in a subsequent collision. In such a reaction, the molecular collision which produces the vibrationally excited reactant molecule may be between two molecules of the reactant, or between one of the reactant and a molecule of a different compound which does not (or cannot) react. Clearly, therefore, both unimolecular and bimolecular mechanisms involve the conversion of translational (and possibly rotational) energy into vibrational energy. Consequently, an understanding of intermolecular interactions and vibrational properties of molecules is essential for an understanding of organic reaction mechanisms.</p>

They are alternative descriptions of the relationship between the potential energy of the diatomic molecule and a single structural variable which can be identified precisely-the internuclear distance, <i>r</i>.

<p class="indent3-ka">The symmetrical simple harmonic curve is characterised by just two parameters, the force constant, <i>k,</i> which is a measure of the strength of the bond and is reflected by the narrowness of the curve, i.e. the curvature, and the equilibrium bond length, <i>r</i><sub>e</sub>. Whilst this is a helpful starting point, it is inadequate as a model for the behaviour of real molecules. It gives increasingly poor descriptions of molecular vibrations as the vibrational amplitude increases, and cannot account for the dissociation of the molecule.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The unsymmetrical curve in <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows that both compression and stretching of the bond lead to anharmonicity, and the force constant (curvature) now depends upon the bond length. A third parameter has to be added to the mathematical relationship between structure and energy to account for the anharmonicity. At ever smaller displacements from the equilibrium bond-length, however, the difference between the harmonic and anharmonic curves becomes vanishingly small.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_1.1">Figure 1.1</a> describes the homolysis of a diatomic molecule A-B in the gas phase (or, equivalently, the bonding of the two atoms A and B as they approach and form the diatomic molecule), and an analogous curve may be constructed to describe heterolysis and its reverse. <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>The qualitative use of such diagrams may also be extended to describe the stretching (and possible cleavage) of bonds in polyatomic molecules. However, the structural variable is now a complex function which is usually approximated by its main component. <a href="#fig_1.2">Figure 1.2</a> comprises sketches describing the homolysis and heterolysis of chloromethane. In both, the methyl is treated as a single group. However, it has internal structure and the internal equilibrium configuration will change as the C-Cl bond stretches and ultimately cleaves. Consequently, we refer to a composite <i>reaction</i> <i>coordinate</i>, <i>q</i>, rather than simply the C&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;Cl internuclear distance. And the internal changes of the methyl group which necessarily accompany the stretching of the carbon-chlorine bond will be different according to whether the cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic.</p>

<p class="aside">The enthalpy of a hydrogen bond between an OH and a lone pair on another oxygen is between about 10 and 30 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. This compares with 381 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for the C-O bond in methanol and 427 for the O-H bond.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent">The potential energy curves of <a href="#fig_1.1">Figs 1.1</a> and <a href="#fig_1.2">1.2</a> represent the formation of covalent bonds between atoms or groups as well as the dissociation of stable molecules into fragments, and the energies involved are large; covalent bond energies are typically hundreds of kilojoules per mole. However, there are interactions between atoms, ions, and molecules which do not lead to the formation of covalent bonds and which individually are relatively weak. The most familiar is the hydrogen bond which forms between a weakly acidic hydrogen, e.g. of an alcohol or water, and the lone pair of a Lewis base such as an amine, or another water or alcohol molecule. There are other types of weak interactions such as between an ion and a dipolar molecule, and between <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>two dipolar molecules. These ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions are, like hydrogen bonds, essentially electrostatic in origin. There are also even weaker interactions between nonpolar molecules which arise from the polarisability of the valence electrons of the molecules rather than permanent charges or dipoles. All these weak intermolecular interactions are zero at large intermolecular separations, attractive (cohesive) at distances comparable with typical bond lengths, then increasingly strongly repulsive at increasingly close intermolecular distances. A representative intermolecular interaction energy curve is sketched in <a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> for two molecules Y and Z.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The interaction between Y and Z at large intermolecular separations is zero, then favourable interactions lead to the formation of a bimolecular encounter complex, Y-Z. Forcing Y and Z closer together leads to increasingly strong repulsion. The strength of the bonding at the minimum in the profile depends upon the nature of the interaction, and the particular example. The minimum could be very shallow representing a weakly bonded complex of very short lifetime.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Whilst all such interactions singly are very weak compared with typical covalent bonds, they are additive so two large molecules could bind strongly through the cooperative effects of many noncovalent interactions. This is often the mechanism by which biomolecules bind, e.g. the two strands of DNA or, less strongly, an enzyme with its substrate prior to reaction, and chemical messengers with their receptor sites in physiological processes.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In the present context, noncovalent interactions are important as they are involved in the early stages of bimolecular reactions, i.e. in the initial translational stage before the redistribution of valence electrons occurs.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">First, we have the association of AX and M to give an encounter complex, then the transfer of X from A to M within the encounter complex to give an isomeric complex, then finally this complex dissociates. The first and final <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>steps correspond to translations whereas the transfer of X from A to M within a bimolecular encounter complex may be seen as a vibration, and a potential energy profile for it can be constructed from the separate anharmonic potential energy curves for A-X and M-X. The individual profiles will be similar to that in <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1.</a> However, the proximity of M to AX in the encounter complex will perturb the vibration of AX and, correspondingly, the proximity of A to MX following the transfer of X will perturb the vibration of MX. In <a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>, the two potential energy curves, each modified to account for these intermolecular interactions, are combined to describe the transfer of X from A to M within the encounter complex.</p>

<p class="aside"><a href="#fig_1.4">Figure 1.4</a> and the associated text refer to a transfer of X between A and M with the three groups collinear. This ensures that only a single structural variable (the reaction coordinate) is required to define the location of X between A and M. Thus, the reaction coordinate of <a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> is the location of X between A and M.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">We see in <a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> that the point at which the two curves cross corresponds to a configuration A&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;X&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;M in which X is partly and equally bonded to A and to M. From this point, X moves towards A or M and the potential energy of the system decreases; the upwardly-continuing curves to the left and right from the intersection have no significance in the combined diagram which is redrawn in <a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5.</a> In this, we have included three more parabolas in an additional dimension (in and out of the plane of the page) to acknowledge that A, X, and M may not all be single atoms, but groups with internal structure.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent3-ka">The parabola superimposed upon the curve for the vibration of AX is the molecular potential energy curve for a representative vibration which is not a significant component of the reaction coordinate, i.e. an internal vibration of A, X, or M. This vibration is transformed as the group transfer takes place, and is represented by the shallower parabola for the transition structure. It is transformed further as the group transfer becomes complete, and represented by the parabola superimposed upon the potential energy curve for the vibration of XM. The continuous curve which begins by describing a stretching vibration for AX, then passes over a maximum corresponding to<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>the transition structure, and ends up describing the stretching vibration of XM, is the reaction coordinate for the group transfer.</p>

Dimensional restrictions prevent more than just one internal vibration being represented in diagrams such as <a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5.</a> Depending upon the molecular complexity of A, X, and M, however, there may be many more. We can now only imagine the multi-dimensional potential energy hypersurface for this group transfer within the encounter complex. It is characterised by multi-dimensional mimima corresponding to reactant and product. The hypersurface also includes a single saddle point corresponding to the transition structure for which all internal degrees of freedom except one have positive force constants, and one (corresponding to the unique degree of freedom which is the reaction coordinate) has a negative force constant.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">So far, we have considered qualitatively, but in detail, the changes which occur within the encounter complex leading to a group transfer; the reaction coordinate is vibrational. We also saw in the previous section that the formation of an encounter complex may be described by a different type of profile in which the reaction coordinate is translational.

<p class="noindent"><i>Parallel effects.</i> The contours in <a href="#fig_1.15">Fig. 1.15(b)</a> indicate that the reaction is mildly exothermic and the transition structure is just less than half way along
the reaction path. Making the reaction more exothermic, e.g. by some structural modification to one of the reactants, corresponds to a relative lowering of the energy of the top right of <a href="#fig_1.15">Fig. 1.15(b)</a>. <a href="#fig_1.16">Figure 1.16</a> includes a section through the energy surface along the reaction coordinate. We see that
lowering the energy of the products with respect to reactants (e.g. by modifying M to give M') moves the position of the transition structure within
the reaction coordinate towards the reactants. Thus, widening the energy gap moves the transition structure towards the higher energy end. Conversely,
reducing the energy gap between reactants and products moves the transition structure towards the lower energy end. These effects of changing the
exothermicity of the reaction upon the position of the transition structure <i>within the reaction coordinate</i> are known as <i>parallel</i> (or Hammond) effects.</p>

transition structure, to the bottom right is U-shaped, <a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17.</a> The contours
indicate that the energy of the bottom right is about the same as that of the top
left. The section passes through the transition structure (which is about mid <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>way between the top left and the bottom right) perpendicular to the reaction coordinate. If a structural change is made to one of the reactants (M becomes M') which relatively raises the bottom right, we see that the saddle point moves towards the lower energy end (top left). Any further change which reduces the gap between top left and bottom right would move the saddle point back towards the higher end. In both cases, the movement of the transition structure is <i>perpendicular to the reaction coordinate</i> at the saddle point hence these are called <i>perpendicular</i> (or Thornton) effects.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.10 Conversion from the molecular to the molar scale</b></h2>


<p class="noindent">So far, our considerations have been of molecules, molecular potential energy, and molecular potential energy profiles and maps. The potential energy profile or hypersurface relates to individual isolated molecules at zero kelvin. However, when we investigate reaction mechanisms, we measure rate <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Organic reaction mechanisms and reaction maps</a>constants, equilibrium constants, and other parameters of reactions on macroscopic amounts. There are several stages involved in relating our theoretical considerations of individual molecules to the molar scale of real experiments. First, we need to scale up by the Avogadro number. Secondly, we have to acknowledge that, depending upon the temperature, higher vibrational and rotational levels will be populated, and molecules will have translational energy. Thirdly, we need to decide which standard state is most convenient for our macroscopic scale, e.g. if the reaction is in the gas phase, is it to be at 1 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> or 1 atm? Fourthly, we need to take account of entropy aspects which become dominant at higher temperatures. Finally, and most difficult at the present time, solvation effects have to be included for reactions in solution. It is beyond the scope of this book to deal with these matters, but excellent progress is being made currently in computational chemistry by combining statistical thermodynamics and quantum chemistry in tackling what just a few years ago seemed intractable difficulties.</p>
