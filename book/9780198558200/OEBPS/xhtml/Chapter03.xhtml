<h2 class="h2"><b>3.1 Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">An appreciation of the relationship between structure and reactivity is central to modern organic chemistry, and qualitative notions are introduced from the earliest stages. Consequently, organic chemists can usually predict whether replacement of a hydrogen by a methyl, for example, or a chlorine by a fluorine in a compound will be rate-increasing or rate-decreasing in a particular reaction. Correlation analysis is a technique to facilitate quantification of such predictions.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Correlation analysis deals with quantitative effects of structural changes upon equilibrium constants as well as rate constants.</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">The commonest procedure is for reactants which include an aromatic ring, <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, since they allow the introduction of a wide range of substituents, X, remote from the reaction site, Z. Here, we have a chemical reaction of a compound X-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-Z in which the group Z is transformed into group W, and we may expect that substituents X will have an effect upon this reaction.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Substituents X are generally meta or para to Z and not, as we shall discuss later, ortho.</p></aside>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The reaction site in Z may be bonded directly to the benzene ring, e.g. Z &#x003D; -CO<sub>2</sub>R, or it may be attached to the benzene ring by another group, e.g. Z &#x003D; -CH<sub>2</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub>R.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">But how do we correlate the effect upon either the rate or the equilibrium for the reaction at Z with the nature of the substituent X? We know that <i>k</i> and <i>K</i> quantify the rate and the equilibrium of the reaction, but what about the substituents? How do we put a number on whether X is F, CH<sub>3</sub>, or any other substituent? We cannot, so we need a parameter which provides a numerical value for a <i>property</i> of the substituent. The property that was introduced for<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Molecular mechanisms and reaction rates</a>
this purpose is the effect of the substituent upon the dissociation of benzoic acid in water at 25&#x00B0;C.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">Correlation analysis, therefore, involves comparison of the effect (relative to hydrogen) of a substituent in a compound in the reaction under scrutiny with the effect of that same substituent (relative to hydrogen) upon a standard reaction. In other words, structural changes to a reactant are described in terms of replacement of hydrogen by a substituent X, and a parameter is ascribed to each substituent which quantifies its effect relative to hydrogen upon a standard reaction-the dissociation of benzoic acid. Consideration first of the standard reaction, then of real applications, should clarify what is not at all easy to apprehend in general.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.5  Uses of &#x03C3;-values and the Hammett equation for equilibria</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The &#x03C3; -value for a substituent is defined empirically by <a href="#eq_3.3">eqn 3.3 </a>and expresses the ability of the substituent to modify the acidity of benzoic acid. This effect of the substituent reflects not only the intrinsic electronic structure and properties of the substituent, but also the mechanism by which the substituent interacts with the carboxyl group. For example, fluorine is the most electronegative element and in many molecular contexts exerts a very powerful electron-attracting effect. However,<b> &#x03C3;</b><sub>(3-F)</sub> &#x003D; 0.34 and  <b>&#x03C3;</b><sub>(4-F)</sub> &#x003D; 0.06. The former reflects only a modest effect (similar to that of iodine) and the latter is surprisingly small. Whilst these parameters do not provide a molecular explanation, by quantifying an effect, they identify an issue which simplistic notions of qualitative organic chemistry cannot easily accommodate. In another case, especially with a substituent containing a less common element, its &#x03C3; -value may be the most accessible experimental evidence providing an insight into the substituent&#x2019;s internal electronic structure and how its properties are transmitted to other parts of a molecule.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">The determination of the &#x03C1;-value for a reaction series requires the measurement of equilibrium constants for, perhaps, four or five reactions under the same experimental conditions. Even this can be quite a substantial amount of laboratory work. However, from the &#x03C1;-value which is obtained and a compilation of &#x03C3; -values, equilibrium constants can be easily calculated for hundreds of further members of the family, some of which may be difficult to measure experimentally (for example, if they are very large or very small).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The mechanistic importance of &#x03C1;  for equilibrium constants of a reaction series springs mainly from a comparison between it and the &#x03C1;-value for the rate constants for, say, the forward direction. The former is a function of the change between initial state and final state (i.e. between reactant and product molecules), and the latter is a measure of the change between initial state and transition state (i.e. between reactant molecule(s) and activated complex). But first we need to consider the Hammett equation related to kinetics.</p>

At temperatures at which the least reactive compounds proceed at a convenient rate, the rates of the most reactive analogues may be far too fast for reliable rate constant determinations.

This requires that the free energy of activation (the free energy difference between initial state and transition state) is reduced by the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (or increased by electron-donating groups). Either way, there must be an increase in electron density at the reaction site of the reactant bearing the substituents in the formation of the activated complex. This increase in negative charge will be dispersed by electron-withdrawing groups (but inhibited by electron- donating substituents) to an extent dependent upon the distance and relationship between the substituent and the reaction site.</p>

<p class="noindent">It follows from the definition of &#x03C3;  in <a href="#eq_3.3">eqn 3.3</a> that a simple Hammett plot is in effect a correlation between <i>logK<sup>X</sup></i> or <i>logk<sup>X</sup></i> for the family of reactions under consideration against log<i>k<sub>a</sub></i><sup>X</sup> for the family of substituted benzoic acids. Consequently, the quality of the correlation depends upon how the relationship between substituent and reaction site in the family of reactions under consideration compares with the relationship between the substituent and the carboxyl group in the family of substituted benzoic acids. If the mechanisms by which substituents interact with the reaction site in a family of reactions are just the same as those by which substituents in the benzoic acid affect its acidity, then a good correlation may be expected. On the other hand, some substituents may be able to influence reactivity in a family of reactions by a mechanism not available to the same substituents in the dissociation of substituted benzoic acids. In such reactions, the ordinary &#x03C3; -values may not lead to a good correlation.</p>

A generic reaction and its mechanism are illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.14">Fig. 3.14</a>, and a significant difference between this and nucleophilic aromatic substitution shown in<a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a> is immediately evident.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;width:70%"><b>Fig. 3.14</b> Mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent"> Nucleophilic substitution only takes place if there is an effective nucleofuge such as halide in the arene ring; consequently, there is no question of where the substitution will occur, and a single product is obtained. In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the proton is an effective electrofuge; consequently, in a monosubstituted reactant Ph-X, substitution may occur ortho, meta, or para to the original substituent as indicated in the upper part of <a href="#fig_3.14">Fig. 3.14</a>. Note, however, that the three isomeric products X-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-E are formed in parallel independent reactions and do not involve a common intermediate.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The rate of the bimolecular elementary reaction between the aromatic compound and the electrophile will be second order so, if the electrophile is a stable species such as a halogen molecule, the overall reaction will be second order. However, in some reactions such as nitration in organic solvents, the generation of the electrophile itself (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) may be the rate-determining step. Consequently, kinetic analysis of electrophilic substitution is not always straightforward. It is often investigated by product analytical competition methods and is usually discussed in terms of partial rate factors for substitution at particular positions in the aromatic ring. Thus, in the reaction with an electrophile of a mixture of known concentrations of, say, toluene or</p>

From the &#x03C1;- value, rate constants may then be easily calculated for hundreds of other members of the family of compounds in the same reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The &#x03C1;-value for a reaction series relates to differences between initial states and transition states, and of course we know the structures of reactants.

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.9  Restrictions to the Hammett equation</b></h2>


<p class="noindent">The use of the simple Hammett equation is restricted to reactions of aromatic compounds, and it is observed experimentally that results for ortho- substituted members of the family of reactants (i.e. using &#x03C3;<sub>ortho</sub> values simply based upon the dissociation of 2-substituted benzoic acids) seldom fit onto the Hammett plot defined by results for meta and para compounds.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The effect upon the rate or equilibrium constant of a reaction of a compound of introducing a substituent will invariably be the resultant of a number of electronic and steric effects, as well as solvation effects. The very
<a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Correlation analysis: quantitative relationships between molecular structure and chemical reactivity </a>
close proximity of an ortho substituent to the reaction site, especially in reactions directly at the aromatic ring, is probably why effects here, and their transmission to the reaction site, are different from effects at meta and para positions. There has been considerable progress in recent years in dissecting overall effects of substituents into constituent steric, inductive, and resonance contributions and, by such an approach, effects of ortho substituents are beginning to be understood. However, such matters are beyond the scope of the present book.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Even using only meta and para substituents, some reactions stih do not give linear correlations of lo<i>gk</i> or logK against &#x03C3;, &#x03C3;<sup>-</sup>, or &#x03C3;<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Occasionally, the graph indicates a trend in reactivity, but hardly qualifies as a linear plot; in some cases, no interpretable trend at all is discernible. The distinction between families of reactions which do give good Hammett plots and those which do not, however, is not a sharp one. Consequently, the quality of the Hammett correlation has to be taken into account when making mechanistic deductions.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.10  Non-linear Hammett correlations </b></h2>




<p class="noindent">Occasionally, a Hammett correlation for a family of reactions appears to be a smooth curve, or shows a discontinuity at a particular value of &#x03C3;, &#x03C3;<sup>-</sup>, or &#x03C3;<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The sketches in <a href="#fig_3.15">Fig. 3.15</a> are generic illustrations (and could have been drawn with negative gradients). The first plot shows that &#x03C1; continuously changes as &#x03C3; increases, i.e. the structure of the activated complex changes along the reaction series so the mechanism is changing gradually as &#x03C3; increases. The latter indicates two &#x03C1;-values according to the range of &#x03C3;-values, and indicates an abrupt change in mechanism at a particular point along the series. For example, such a plot would be observed if there is a change in rate-determining step in a two-step mechanism. Addition-elimination reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds are examples, and some are considered in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="noindent">We saw above that modified &#x03C3;-parameters &#x03C3;<sup>&#x002B;</sup>or &#x03C3;<sup>-</sup> were introduced to accommodate resonance interactions between para substituents and the reaction site. Regardless of which substituent parameter is used, the Hammett equation remains a two-parameter correlation, and the value of the substituent constant is independent of the reaction in which it is used. However, there are reactions in which neither the ordinary parameter nor the modified one leads to a satisfactory linear correlation. It appears that something between the two is required to acknowledge that resonance is not an all-or-nothing effect. However, to ascribe to each substituent a range of parameter values according to the nature of the reaction would be to remove the independence of the substituent parameter from the reaction in which it is used. A much better alternative is to extend the Hammett equation, and introduce a third parameter, r<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or r<sup>-</sup> according to whether the substituent is &#x03C0;-electron- supplying or -accepting. This new reaction parameter is a measure of the extent of resonance between para substituents and reaction site, i.e. the resonance demand of the reaction site. It is incorporated in the Yukawa- Tsuno equation for rate constants given in <a href="#eq_3.25">eqn 3.25</a>; there is also a version with r<sup>-</sup>, and two corresponding equations for equilibrium constants.</p>

<p class="noindent">Correspondingly, if r<sup>-</sup> &#x003D; 1, the Yukawa-Tsuno equation gives <a href="#eq_3.29">eqn 3.29</a> which is the Hammett equation using the modified <i>&#x03C3;<sup>-</sup></i> parameter. So here we see that the dissociation of phenols in water at 25&#x00B0;C is the standard reaction with r<sup>-</sup> &#x003D; 1 as well as the reaction which defines the &#x03C3;<sup>-</sup> parameter. The acid dissociation in <a href="#eq_3.30">eqn 3.30</a> has r<sup>-</sup> &#x003D; 0.54, i.e. the resonance demand in this equilibrium is only about half that in the acid dissociation of phenols. In this reaction, the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonyl group stabilises the anion and thereby facilitates the dissociation. This effect is not present in the dissociation of phenols (<a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>) which makes a greater demand, therefore, on the resonance effect of substituents X.</p>
