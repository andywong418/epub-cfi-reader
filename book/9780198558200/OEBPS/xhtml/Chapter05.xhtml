<h2 class="h2">5.1	Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In earlier chapters, we saw that mechanistic information may be gained by intensive study of a single particular reaction, e.g. by kinetics. We then saw that investigation of the effects of substituents in the substrate, or of changes to the structure or nature of a co-reactant such as a catalyst, leads to mechanistic information but about a family of reactions rather than a single one. Between these extremes of ever more detailed scrutiny of one reaction and investigating a widening family of related reactions lies the study
of the effect of isotopic substitution upon reactants in a single reaction. On the one hand,replacement of one isotope by another, e.g. protium by deuterium, does not alter the chemical identity of the element and, consequently, the natures of the reactions of compounds remain unchanged. In other words, the potential energy hypersurface of the chemical system is independent of the pattern of isotopic substitution. On the other hand, isotopic substitution does alter the masses of groups within molecules and hence vibrational frequencies. As we 
saw in chapter one, chemical reactions have their origins in molecular vibrations; consequently,whilst isotopic substitution does not alter the nature of a chemical reaction, it may alter
the rate at which the reaction occurs.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:-0.5em">The second-order rate law of a generic bimolecular reaction,</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center">A &#x002B; B <i>&#x2192;</i> Product,</p>
<p class="noindent">has the form<span style="margin-left:10em">rate &#x003D; k[A][B].</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Clearly, if substitution of one isotope for another within either A or B alters what we above loosely called the rate of the reaction, it must do so by changing the value of the rate constant, <i>k.</i> This is true regardless of the order or nature of the reaction. In complex reactions under specified experimental conditions, isotopic substitution can change the magnitudes of elementary rate constants and, depending upon the mechanism of the overall transformation, thereby affect the overall experimental rate constant.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-30em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Compounds which differ only in their isotopic composition, e.g. CH<sub>4,</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2,</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> are sometimes called isotopologues. Compounds of the same isotopic composition but with different isotopic distributions within the molecules, e.g. 1,1-dideuterioethene, and <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-1,2-dideuterioethene, are sometimes called isotopomers.</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">On the basis that an equilibrium is a balance between forward and reverse kinetic processes, we may also expect that isotopic substitution will alter the value of an equilibrium constant, but not the nature of the equilibrium. This indeed is observed. Before proceeding further, however, we need to define and explain a few terms. </p>


<a id="page_82" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 82, Isotope effects upon organic chemical reactions</a>

<h3 class="h3">Definitions</h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Equilibrium isotope effect</i>. The equilibrium constant for the hydron transfer reaction shown in <a href="#eq_5.1">eqn 5.1</a> has a particular value at 25&#x00B0;C in chlorobenzene as solvent when L = <sup>1</sup>H and a slightly smaller value when L = <sup>2</sup>H (or D).</p>


<figure  id="eq_5.1" style="text-align:right;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_81_1.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">L is used for any isotope of hydrogen - protium, deuterium, or tritium. Hydron is the generic term for <sup>1</sup>H<sup>&#x002B;<sub>,</sub></sup> <sup>2</sup>H<sup>
&#x002B;</sup>, and <sup>3</sup>H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, i.e. L<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p></aside>



<p class="noindent">The modern convention is to express an isotope effect as the ratio of the value of the parameter (an equilibrium constant here) for the compound with the lighter isotope (protium in this case) over that for the compound with the heavier isotope (deuterium), i.e. K<sup>H</sup>/K<sup>D</sup>. When this ratio is greater than unity, i.e. when   K<sup>H</sup>   &#x003E;  K<sup>D</sup>, it is called a <i>normal </i>isotope effect.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Kinetic isotope effect.</i> The second-order rate constant for the cycloaddition reaction of <a href="#eq_5.2">eqn 5.2</a> in toluene at 100&#x00B0;C is smaller when L = H than when L = D. Even though  k<sup>H</sup> &#x003C; k<sup>D</sup>, this kinetic isotope effect (i.e. a ratio of rate constants) is still written as k<sup>H</sup>/k<sup>D</sup> but now, because its value is less than unity, it is referred to as an inverse effect.</p>


<figure  id="eq_5.2" style="text-align:right;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_81_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<p class="noindent"><i>Primary isotope effect</i>. When the chemical reaction involves cleavage of a bond to the isotopically labelled atom, the effect of the isotopic substitution is called a <i>primary</i> isotope effect. An equilibrium example is shown in
 <a href="#eq_5.1">eqn 5.1,</a> and <a href="#eq_5.3">eqn 5.3</a> is a kinetic example in which hydroxide abstracts one of the weakly acidic methylene hydrogens of the ethyl nitroethanoate.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Usually, a deuterium isotope effect investigation involves first synthesis of the compound with natural abundance isotopic composition. The compound with a particular hydrogen completely replaced by a deuterium atom then has to be synthesised. The deuterium has to be introduced exactly and exclusively where it is required, and with as high a degree of incorporation as possible. Measurements are then normally made on the protiated and deuteriated samples at the same time and under identical experimental conditions by normal methods.</p></aside>


<figure id="eq_5.3" style="text-align:right;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_81_3.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<p class="noindent"><i>Secondary isotope effect.</i> When the bond to the isotopically labelled atom is not broken in the chemical reaction, we have a <i>secondary</i> isotope effect. The reaction of <a href="#eq_5.2">eqn 5.2</a> is a kinetic secondary isotope effect, and 
<a href="#eq_5.4">eqn 5.4</a> is an equilibrium example. Secondary isotope effects are almost invariably smaller than primary ones and, generally, the further the labelled atom is from the reaction site, the smaller the effect.</p>

</figure>



<p class="noindent"><i>Solvent deuterium isotope effect.</i> Although, in principle, any atom in any solvent could be replaced by an isotope, and the effect of that substitution upon a reaction taking place in the solvent could be investigated, in practice, the effect is invariably the replacement of protium by deuterium. And because deuterium oxide is a relatively inexpensive chemical, the overwhelming majority of solvent isotope effect measurements have been in water, i.e. the effect of replacing H<sub>2</sub>O by D<sub>2</sub>O, as exemplified by <a href="#eq_5.5">eqn 5.5.</a></p>


<figure  id="eq_5.5" style="text-align:right;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_83_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<p class="noindent"><i>Caveat&#x0021;</i> In spite of the implications of the preceding sections, it is not always a simple matter in practice to identify an experimental isotope effect as being of just one sort or another. Frequently, the overall effect of isotopic substitution is the result of various contributions as the following illustrates:</p>


<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_83_3.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Notice that the equilibrium isotope effects here are large (and hence must be principally primary effects), but they alone tell us nothing about the sizes of the individual equilibrium constants which, in these cases, are very small.</p></aside>


<p class="noindent">i.e., both <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O
 (T<sub>2</sub>O) are much less dissociated than <sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O. There will be primary, secondary, and solvent kinetic isotope effect contributions to forward and reverse reactions, the overall equilibrium effect being what is measured experimentally.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Similarly, weak acids are less dissociated in D<sub>2</sub>O than in H<sub>2</sub>O, and this is also a composite effect:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">By considering the reverse, we see that D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in D<sub>2</sub>O is a stronger acid (hydron donor) than H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3">The origin of primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">An over-simplistic model for hydrogen transfer between two groups, <a href="#eq_5.7">eqn 5.7,</a> involves A-H bond cleavage, then rebonding of the free hydrogen to B.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A more realistic model (now replacing H by L, <a href="#eq_5.8">eqn 5.8</a>) involves molecules AL and B coming together to form an encounter complex of the appropriate configuration; the hydrogen transfer then takes place to give an isomeric complex, and the new molecules A and LB separate.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">To plot the energetics of this overall process, we need an energy coordinate and two types of configurational coordinates. The intermolecular distances initially between AL and B, and later between A and LB, are translational degrees of freedom. The position of the hydrogen between A and B in the encounter complex, however, is within a vibrational degree of freedom.</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_86" class="page" >Page 86,Isotope effects upon organic chemical reactions</a>
Because the intermolecular motion between molecules is much slower than vibrational motion within a molecule, we may separate the two. First, AL and B come together, then the hydrogen transfer from A to B takes place within the encounter complex with A and B at virtually a fixed distance apart. Just this second aspect, i.e. the transfer of L from A to B at afixed A - B internuclear distance is shown in<a href="#fig_5.3"> Fig. 5.3</a>. As we saw in the first chapter, this comprises the intersecting anharmonic potential energy profiles for the A-L and L-B stretching vibrations.</p>

This is the transition structure for the hydrogen transfer and the reaction coordinate at this point is again a translational degree of freedom rather than a vibration. Consequently, the structures with different hydrogen isotopes have the same energy as indicated by the single horizontal line. We see, therefore, that the kinetic isotope effect (k<sup>H</sup>/k<sup>D</sup>) is determined by the different barrier heights from the H and D levels in A-L, i.e. the difference in the zero-point energies of AH and AD,{(&#x025B;<sub>0</sub>(AH)- &#x025B;<sub>0</sub>(AD)} &#x003D; &#x03B4;&#x025B;<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p class="aside">At the maximum in the reactioncoordinate, the transition structure has real vibrations in all normal modes except the reaction coordinate. In that particular degree of freedom, there is an imaginary frequency corresponding to a negative force constant.</p></aside>



<p class="noindent">In this process, the reaction coordinate is initially a normal molecular vibration of the reactant represented by the larger minimum to the left in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>. There is then a maximum in the reaction coordinate at A<sup>&#x2021;</sup>; consequently, the reaction coordinate cannot be a normal molecular vibration at this point.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Superimposed upon the reaction coordinate are two other potential energy curves which should be seen as in and out of the plane of the paper; one is for the reactant, the other for the transition structure. The former represents a molecular vibration involving the isotopically labelled atom (stretching or bending), and the separate deuterium and protium zero-point energy levels are included. The latter represents the corresponding vibration in the transition structure, and again protium and deuterium zero-point energy levels are included. Thus, as reactant molecule becomes transition structure, a vibration, which is not a component of the reaction coordinate but which involves the labelled atom, undergoes a transformation. The extent to which this vibration is different between reactant and transition structure will depend upon the nature of the vibration, its remoteness from the reaction site, and the nature of the actual reaction. In <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>, the potential energy curve for this vibration is narrower (larger force constant and more widely spaced vibrational levels) in the reactant than in the transition structure, but it could be otherwise.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">If a vibration does not change as reactant molecule becomes transition structure, e.g. because it is very remote from the reaction site, then differences between protium and deuterium levels will be the same in reactant and transition structure, and this vibration will not contribute to a secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">The rate constant at a particular temperature depends upon the potential energy difference between reactant and activated complex (amongst other factors), and this is usually represented as the barrier in the potential energy reaction profile. More precisely, it is the zero-point energy difference between reactant molecule and transition structure summed over all internal degrees of freedom, i.e. including the ones involving the isotopic atom. Consequently, if the energy differences between zero-point deuterium levels of reactant and those of transition structure <i>(&#x0394;E<sup>D</sup></i> in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a> for just one such vibration) are not the same as the corresponding differences between protium levels <i>(&#x0394;E<sup>H</sup></i> in</p>

<a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a> for just one), the activation energies will not be the same and the rate constants for protium and deuterium analogues will be different. Hence, we can have isotope effects upon unimolecular chemical reactions even when the bonds to the isotopically labelled atoms remain intact, but the effects are much smaller than primary isotope effects.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects and reaction mechanisms</b></h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>Unimolecular mechanisms.</i> For a reaction described by <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5 </a>in which there is a reduction in the force constant of the vibration as reactant becomes transition structure, there will be a normal kinetic isotope effect, i.e. <i>k<sup>H</sup>/k<sup>D</sup></i> &#x003E; 1. This is observed when a carbon bearing the isotopic hydrogen changes from sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> as for the &#x03B1;-carbon in the rate-limiting step of an S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 mechanism, e.g.<a href="#eq_5.11"> eqn 5.11.</a> Indeed, in substitution/elimination reactions with oxygen-bonded nucleofuges, an &#x03B1;-deuterium kinetic isotope effect of ca. 1.2 is reliable evidence of an S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 mechanism.</p>

<figure id="eq_5.11"  style="width:70%;text-align:right">
<img src="../images/page_89_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">On the other hand, if the parabola describing the C-L vibration in the transition structure is narrower than that for its vibration in the reactant, i.e. there is an increase in the force constant of the C-L vibration as reactant becomes transition structure, then an inverse deuterium kinetic isotope effect will be observed, i.e. <i>k<sup>H</sup>/k<sup>D</sup></i> &#x003C; 1. This is typical of reactions in which the carbon bearing the hydrogen(s) undergoes a change from sp<sup>2</sup> to sp<sup>3</sup> and an example is shown in.<a href="#eq_5.12"> eqn 5.12 </a>although the effect here is rather small.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Bimolecular mechanisms.</i> The analysis of secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects based up n<a href="#fig_5.5"> Fig. 5.5</a> may be extended to include bimolecular mechanisms and the deductions are similar. If the force constant of a molecular vibration involving a C-L bond (which is not part of the reaction coordinate) undergoes a change as reactants become transition structure, then a finite deuterium kinetic isotope effect is expected. If the carbon bearing the hydrogen undergoes an increase in coordination as reactant becomes transition structure, effects are usually inverse as in the following addition reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">Isotope effects for elements other than hydrogen have been determined in mechanistic investigations but, as the ratio of rate constants depends upon the ratio of isotopic masses (rather than their difference), much smaller effects are observed. Because the effects are so small and it is difficult to obtain isotopically pure samples, normal kinetics procedures are inadequate. Rate constants <i>k<sup>H</sup></i> and <i>k<sup>D</sup></i> are determined by separate (but usually concurrent) rate measurements upon the <sup>1</sup>H  and <sup>2</sup>H analogues, but heavy atom isotope effects are measured by a quite different procedure. A sample of the reactant with an accurately known ratio of isotopes at a particular location, e.g. <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C or <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N, is reacted then the ratio is again accurately measured mass spectrometrically. From the ratio before and after a precisely known extent of reaction, the ratio of rate constants can be calculated.</p>
