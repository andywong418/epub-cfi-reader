<p class="noindentf">In the process of establishing the structure and properties of an inorganic compound, an array of spectroscopic techniques is required. Due to the varied nature of inorganic compounds, the approaches are often more diverse than that utilized within organic chemistry; the link to symmetry is generally stronger, both for vibrational and magnetic resonance spectroscopies. The accent of this book is on showing how these techniques are utilized in inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="indentf">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually be covered in a 8&#x2013;10 week lecture course. As well as giving up-to-date information, this series provides explanations and rationales that form the framework of understanding inorganic chemistry. Alan Brisdon here provides a general handbook for spectroscopic characterization of inorganic compounds. It provides an accessible and thorough guide to the application of spectroscopic techniques that should be of great assistance to chemistry students right through their undergraduate career.</p>
