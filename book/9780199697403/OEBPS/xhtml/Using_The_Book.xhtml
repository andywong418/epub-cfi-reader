<h1 class="main">USING THE BOOK</h1>
<p class="noindent">For the tenth edition of <i>Atkins&#x0027; Physical Chemistry</i> we have tailored the text even more closely to the needs of students. First, the material within each chapter has been re-organized into discrete topics to improve accessibility, clarity, and flexibility. Second, in addition to the variety of learning features already present, we have significantly enhanced the mathematics support by adding new Chemist&#x0027;s toolkit boxes, and checklists of key concepts at the end of each topic.</p>
<div class="sandal">
<h2 class="h2">Organizing the information</h2>
<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4;Innovative new structure</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">Each chapter has been reorganized into short topics, making the text more readable for students and more flexible for instructors. Each topic opens with a comment on why it is important, a statement of the key idea, and a brief summary of the background needed to understand the topic.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4;Notes on good practice</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">Our <i>Notes on good practice</i> will help you avoid making common mistakes. They encourage conformity to the international language of science by setting out the conventions and procedures adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4;Resource section</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">The comprehensive <i>Resource section</i> at the end of the book contains a table of integrals, data tables, a summary of conventions about units, and character tables. Short extracts of these tables often appear in the topics themselves, principally to give an idea of the typical values of the physical quantities we are introducing.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Checklist of concepts</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">A <i>Checklist of key concepts</i> is provided at the end of each topic so that you can tick off those concepts which you feel you have mastered.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Presenting the mathematics</h2>
<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Justifications</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">Mathematical development is an intrinsic part of physical chemistry, and to achieve full understanding you need to see how a particular expression is obtained and if any assumptions have been made. The <i>Justifications</i> are set off from the text to let you adjust the level of detail to meet your current needs and make it easier to review material.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Chemist&#x0027;s toolkits</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">New to the tenth edition, the <i>Chemist&#x0027;s toolkits</i> are succinct reminders of the mathematical concepts and techniques that you will need in order to understand a particular derivation being described in the main text.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Mathematical backgrounds</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">There are six <i>Mathematical background</i> sections dispersed throughout the text. They cover in detail the main mathematical concepts that you need to understand in order to be able to master physical chemistry. Each one is located at the end of the chapter to which it is most relevant.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4;  Annotated equations and equation labels</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">We have annotated many equations to help you follow how they are developed. An annotation can take you across the equals sign: it is a reminder of the substitution used, an approximation made, the terms that have been assumed constant, the integral used, and so on. An annotation can also be a reminder of the significance of an individual term in an expression. We sometimes colour a collection of numbers or symbols to show how they carry from one line to the next. Many of the equations are labelled to highlight their significance.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Checklists of equations</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">You don&#x0027;t have to memorize every equation in the text. A checklist at the end of each topic summarizes the most important equations and the conditions under which they apply.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Setting up and solving problems</h2>
<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Brief illustrations</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">A <i>Brief illustration</i> shows you how to use equations or concepts that have just been introduced in the text. They help you to learn how to use data, manipulate units correctly, and become familiar with the magnitudes of properties. They are all accompanied by a Self-test question which you can use to monitor your progress.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4;  Worked examples</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">Worked <i>Examples</i> are more detailed illustrations of the application of the material, which require you to assemble and develop concepts and equations. We provide a suggested method for solving the problem and then implement it to reach the answer. Worked examples are also accompanied by <i>Self-test</i> questions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Discussion questions</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;"><i>Discussion questions</i> appear at the end of every chapter, where they are organized by topic. These questions are designed to encourage you to reflect on the material you have just read, and to view it conceptually.</p>
<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Exercises and Problems</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;"><i>Exercises</i> and <i>Problems</i> are also provided at the end of every chapter, and organized by topic. They prompt you to test your understanding of the topics in that chapter. Exercises are designed as relatively straightforward numerical tests whereas the problems are more challenging. The Exercises come in related pairs, with final numerical answers available on the book&#x0027;s Online Resource Centre for the &#x2018;a&#x2019; questions. Final numerical answers to the odd-numbered problems are also available on the Online Resource Centre.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x27A4; Integrated activities</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">At the end of most chapters, you will find questions that cross several topics and chapters, and are designed to help you use your knowledge creatively in a variety of ways. Some of the questions refer to the Living graphs in the Online Resource Centre, which you will find helpful for answering them.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">&#x27A4; Solutions manuals</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="width:70%;">Two solutions manuals have been written by Charles Trapp, Marshall Cady, and Carmen Giunta to accompany this book.</p>
<p class="indent" style="width:70%;">The <i>Student&#x0027;s Solutions Manual</i> (ISBN 9780198708001) provides full solutions to the &#x2018;a&#x2019; exercises and to the odd-numbered problems.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="indent">The <i>Instructor&#x0027;s Solutions Manual</i> provides full solutions to the &#x2018;b&#x2019; exercises and to the even-numbered problems (available to download in the Online Resource Centre for registered adopters of the book only).</p>
