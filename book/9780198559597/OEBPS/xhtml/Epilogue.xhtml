<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 3em;">Even within the limited syllabus which was defined at the outset of <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, there are many variations on, and combinations of, the main themes of carbonyl chemistry we have outlined, about which nothing has been said. Reactions of enolates at the <em>&#x03B1;</em>-position with <em>Se</em>-electrophiles, for example; and at the carbonyl carbon with <em>C</em>-nucleophiles such as diazoalkanes, or with <em>&#x03B1;</em>-anions derived from nitroalkanes, sulfoxides, and sulfones, which are enolate analogues. Many of the chemical procedures for heteroaromatic synthesis depend on additions to and/or substitutions at carbonyl carbon (see Primer 2). And there are diverse lesser themes within the chemistry of aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acid derivatives which might have been touched on if space had allowed. These include reactions in which the key events involve molecular rearrangement (see Primer 5), the addition of an electron, excitation by light, the intermediacy of acyloxy-radicals, or cycloaddition, e.g. with alkylidenephosphoranes (Wittig reaction).</p>
