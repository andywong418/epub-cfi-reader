<p class="noindent">The reactions of enols and enolates with electrophiles are not confined to the simple <i>&#x03B1;</i>-substitutions so far discussed. The electrophile can also be a carbonyl compound, and, as with the attack of simpler nucleophiles on carbonyl groups, the formation of a tetrahedral adduct can be followed by protonation, dehydration, or loss of a leaving group.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">The dimer in this specific case has the trivial name aldol (<i>ald</i>ehyde&#x2013;alcoh<i>ol</i>), and this is also the name given to the whole class of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-hydroxycarbonyl compounds which can be formed in this way. The reaction is called the aldol condensation, which is rather misleading, as the classical meaning of the term &#x2018;condensation reaction&#x2019; is a reaction in which two molecules combine with loss of water. The mechanism of the base-catalysed formation of aldol itself is as shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0065-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">The equilibria favour aldol. At all except very low concentrations, the rate of aldol formation is proportional to [MeCHO][OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>], which is consistent with enolate formation being the rate-determining step. Treatment of acetone with aqueous base leads to corresponding equilibria being established, but in this instance the product, diacetone alcohol, is not favoured, and the rate of its formation depends on [Me<sub>2</sub>CO]<sup>2</sup>[OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>], which is consistent with carbon&#x2013;carbon bond formation being rate-determining in this case. <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Chapter9 Aldol condensations and related reactions</a></p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0066-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">In order to use the unfavourable equilibria shown to prepare diacetone alcohol from acetone, a clever practical trick is employed. Acetone is refluxed in such a way that <i>en route</i> back to the flask the distillate percolates through some Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>, an insoluble basic catalyst. Equilibration takes place while there is contact with the catalyst, and it is an equilibrium mixture which returns to the flask. As acetone has a lower boiling point than diacetone alcohol, it is pure acetone which distills up to be passed through the catalyst again; the concentration of diacetone alcohol builds up in the flask because there is no base catalyst there to make it revert to acetone.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">These aldol condensations are reversible because the carbon&#x2013;carbon bond formed in the reaction can break under the influence of base by a cleavage mechanism which is general for <i>&#x03B2;</i>-hydroxycarbonyl compounds&#x2014;the reverse or retro aldol reaction.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Crossed aldol condensations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The aldol condensations which were outlined in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.2">Section 9.2</a> are special very simple cases, in which there is only one possible <i>&#x03B2;</i>-hydroxycarbonyl product. With unsymmetrical ketones, there is regiochemical and stereochemical ambiguity: three racemic products can in principle result, as in the base-catalysed aldol condensation of methyl ethyl ketone.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0067-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Base-catalysed aldol condensation of methyl ethyl ketone&#x2014;only one enantiomer of each possible product is shown.</p>
<p class="indent-ka" style="text-align:justify;margin-top:1em;">The situation can become quite imponderable if a crossed condensation, i.e. a reaction in which the electrophile and nucleophile in the product-forming step come from different starting materials, is attempted simply by mixing the two components under basic conditions. Regiochemical and stereochemical control can be achieved by using specifically preformed lithium or boron enolates, but these elegant procedures are beyond the scope of this Primer. However, crossed all-in-together aldol reactions are unambiguous and useful if certain conditions are satisfied. If one reactant is more electrophilic than the other, and that more electrophilic reactant lacks <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH, then a single product results. Formaldehyde thus reacts unambiguously with 2-methylpropionaldehyde.</p>

<p class="noindent">With aldehydes and excess formaldehyde in strongly basic conditions, a Cannizzaro reaction (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.8">Section 2.8</a>) follows replacement of all the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">In the Perkin reaction, acetate ion is the base and acetic anhydride is the source of the enolate reactant.</p>

 <img src="../images/f0069-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Note that in the Perkin reaction, the alkoxide oxygen of the tetrahedral adduct is trapped by acetylation, which opens the way to the effectively irreversible elimination of acetic acid. The Stobbe condensation has a similar critical feature.</p>

<p class="indent-ka"><a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter9 Aldol condensations and related reactions</a>&#160;&#160; Here the alkoxide oxygen of the initial adduct is caught by lactonization, which ultimately results in formation of a carboxylate anion. In the prevailing basic conditions, the equilibria which lead to this carboxylate anion are all displaced in its favour, and none of the other reversible pathways which could in principle be followed can compete. Under the conditions of the reaction, acetone could self-condense (see above), and so could diethyl succinate (see the next section). A crossed condensation the other way round&#x2014;i.e. attack of acetone enolate on an ethoxycarbonyl group&#x2014;would be no surprise, because that is in fact what happens if acetone and ethyl acetate are treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0070-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">None of these possibilities, however, give an end product which has acidity anything like as great as a carboxylic acid, so none of them is favoured by displacement of the relevant end-of-the-line equilibrium. The Stobbe reaction is subject to thermodynamic control. The Darzens reaction also involves the trapping of the alkoxide oxygen of the tetrahedral adduct, and only one product is isolated despite the potential of the reactants to lead to others.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0070-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In this case kinetic control is operative. The epoxide-ring closure is effectively irreversible, because chloride ion is a poor nucleophile versus such substrates. The other possible products, in contrast, are related to the starting materials by freely reversible equilibria. This situation has the consequence that eventually all the reactants are converted to the epoxide.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">The crossed aldol condensations surveyed above all work because the structures of the reactants in some way dictate that one of several possible products is favoured. What of the case where it is desired to go against Nature&#x003F; Consider the potential crossed aldol reaction shown below.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Why must the acidification be done under mild conditions&#x003F;</p></aside>
<p class="indent-ka">This procedure works for two reasons. Firstly no strong base is present, so none of the possible base-catalysed condensations take place. Secondly the zinc enolate intermediate which is formed is stabilized, relatively unreactive, and therefore selective, so it reacts preferentially with the more reactive ketone carbonyl group. A modern way of procuring reaction between an ester and a ketone with the same outcome is to generate the enolate of the ester quantitatively using a lithium amide base, and then quench it with the ketone, as in the eqn 9.21.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Acid-catalysed crossed aldol condensations are often complex in outcome, and are only useful in special instances. However, there is an analogue in the Mannich reaction which is of synthetic importance. It is exemplified by the reaction of acetone, formaldehyde, and diethylamine under mildly acidic conditions.</p>

With rings of intermediate size (say 8&#x2013;12 carbons in the ring), there are unfavourable steric interactions between ring substituents as well. The Dieckmann reaction also fails with strained small-ring targets. Diethyl succinate, for example, undergoes intermolecular Claisen ester condensation and then a Dieckmann-type cyclization, to give a six-membered ring. <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter9 Aldol condensations and related reactions</a></p>

<p class="indent-ka">One of Nature&#x2019;s ways of making new carbon&#x2013;carbon bonds uses a thiol ester analogue of the Claisen ester condensation, taking advantage of some key facts about thiol esters. Firstly, they are more reactive to nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group than ordinary esters. Secondly, their <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH acidity is greater. These differences arise because in an ordinary ester electron-release by the ester oxygen to the carbonyl carbon <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Chapter9 Aldol condensations and related reactions</a>diminishes (compared to the situation in a ketone) the electrophilic character of that carbon, and destabilizes the corresponding enolate.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">This conjugation arises from overlap of the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized ester oxygen with the carbonyl <i>&#x03C0;</i>-system. In a thiol ester, the orbitals of the sulfur atom are larger and more diffuse, so they do not overlap effectively with the carbonyl <i>&#x03C0;</i>-system. Despite the fact that the electronegativity of sulfur is less than that of oxygen, there is less electron release by sulfur. To this extent, thiol esters are more &#x2018;ketone-like&#x2019; than ordinary esters. This is not, however, a helpful analogy, because thiol esters do not undergo typical ketone reactions like oxime formation: RS<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is in fact a better leaving group than RO<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, so nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group invariably leads to overall substitution, not condensation.</p>
