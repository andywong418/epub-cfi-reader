<p class="noindent">The esters which were considered in the previous chapter lie roughly in the middle of a reactivity series in which the ease of nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon decreases from left to right.</p>

<p class="noindent">The carboxylic acids themselves are the least reactive of the above series to, say, Grignard reagents, because they are converted to carboxylate complexes on which nucleophilic attack is very difficult.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0046-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In fact, even with excess Grignard reagent, no further reaction takes place, and the carboxylic acid is recovered on acidification. The more reactive organolithium reagents, however, are able to carry things through, and the carboxylate produced by the first equivalent of reagent reacts with a second, giving an adduct which survives to yield a ketone on work-up.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">LiAIH<sub>4</sub> reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, via a carboxylate complex again, as in the marginal example, but NaBH<sub>4</sub> is not reactive enough to do this.</p>

<p class="indent-ka"><a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter6 Reactions of nucleophiles with other carboxylic acid derivatives</a> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ammonia and amines simply form salts with carboxylic acids, and these are stable except at high temperatures. To achieve carbon&#x2013;nitrogen bond formation, it is necessary first to activate the carboxyl group by replacing the OH with a better leaving group, such as Cl, which can be brought about indirectly by reaction with an electrophilic reagent. Thionyl chloride is a suitable reagent: the carbon&#x2013;chlorine bond forms after attack at oxygen.</p>

<p class="noindent">Acyl chlorides react very easily with ammonia and amines: see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.4">Section 6.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">Although carboxylic acids are unreactive towards nucleophilic reagents, they are reduced to primary alcohols very easily with borane followed by aqueous work-up. This is because the primary events with this reagent involve it acting as an electrophile. The reaction is mechanistically complex, but the essence of what happens can be outlined as shown below.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0047-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">The complexity of the reaction is obvious if we reflect that the borane reagent is actually a dimer in the gas phase, which might react as such in solution; that the reaction might involve a mono-, di-, or tri-acyloxyoborane; that once underway, there are likely to be several different Lewis acids in the field of play; that there are several candidates for the complex which transfers hydride to make the new carbon&#x2013;hydrogen bonds; that whether one draws intramolecular or intermolecular transition states for some stages is more a matter of taste than evidence; and so on. It is hardly surprising that different texts offer apparently different mechanisms (compare Norman and Coxon with Kemp and Vellaccio), and that some texts baulk at the prospect and say nothing. However, the student need not be confused; the niceties make no difference to the outcome or to the main point, which is that substrate reactivity towards borane depends not on the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, but on the Lewis basicity of the carbonyl oxygen.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Amides</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The electrophilic reactivity of the carbonyl carbon in amides is low, because of interaction with the adjacent nitrogen atom, which is essentially nonbasic for the same reason. The nitrogen atom is <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridised, and the whole system has a strong preference for planarity, because only then are the three <i>p</i>-orbitals aligned to overlap. This restraint is of far-reaching significance in the structure of proteins, which are polyamides. If an amide group is artificially distorted by incorporating it into a bicyclic ring system, the normal conjugation cannot take place and the carbonyl group is ketone-like.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Amides are hydrolysed to carboxylic acids by aqueous alkali and strong aqueous acid, by B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 and A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 pathways like esters, but much more vigorous conditions are required&#x2014;typically overnight reflux.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">The reduction of amides with LiAIH<sub>4</sub> involves, in its first stage, nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, analogous to (albeit somewhat slower than) the reduction of esters. Whereas in the ester case at room temperature the tetrahedral adduct decomposes into two parts with cleavage of the molecular backbone (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>), in the amide case the corresponding tetrahedral adduct decomposes with carbon&#x2013;oxygen bond cleavage and preservation of the backbone. This is because <img src="../images/f0048-05.jpg" alt="images"/> is a very poor leaving group.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:2em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0048-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">If LiAIH<sub>4</sub> reduction is performed at low temperature the decomposition of the tetrahedral adduct may be slow, and aqueous work-up gives an aldehyde. This sort of procedure only works well if there is also a structural feature in the amide which inhibits collapse of the adduct by making electron release by the nitrogen atom difficult.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Similarly, Grignard reagents react with .<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-disubstituted amides to give ketones, and with dimethylformamide to give aldehydes. <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Chapter6 Reactions of nucleophiles with other carboxylic acid derivatives</a></p>

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Organolithium reagents react analogously with <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dialkyl amides but the tetrahedral adducts tend to collapse to ketones, resulting in further reaction. This difficulty can be completely overcome if the adduct is stabilized by chelation, as in the following example of the so-called Weinreb amide procedure.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Acyl chlorides</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Acyl chlorides, also called acid chlorides, are exceedingly and indeed sometimes violently reactive towards nucleophilic reagents. They fume in moist air because of facile hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid and HCl.</p>

<p class="indent-ka"><a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Chapter6 Reactions of nucleophiles with other carboxylic acid derivatives</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Alcohols react analogously, to give esters; carboxylic acids, and their salts, react to give anhydrides; and amines give amides, but excess amine or added base is required to take up the HCl which is produced. The Schotten&#x2013;Baumann procedure (see below for an example) is a convenient way of performing the reaction in simple cases. It entails adding the acyl chloride to an efficiently agitated alkaline solution of the amine, which is maintained at a high enough pH to keep the amine in its free base nucleophilic form. Cooling is often necessary. The procedure works better for aroyl chlorides than alkanoyl chlorides, because the latter are so reactive that hydrolysis competes with aminolysis.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:10em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0050-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Acyl chlorides react with Grignard reagents to give tertiary alcohols, because, as with esters, the intermediate ketone which is formed reacts further. Dialkyl cadmium reagents, however, while being insufficiently reactive to attack ketones or esters, are reactive enough to attack acyl chlorides, in a process which stops at the ketone stage. Similarly, LiAIH<sub>4</sub> reacts with ease in two stages to give a primary alcohol, but the less reactive reagent lithium tri-<i>t</i>-butoxyaluminium hydride is able to achieve only the first stage at low temperatures, providing a useful aldehyde synthesis.</p>

<p class="indent-ka"><a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Chapter6 Reactions of nucleophiles with other carboxylic acid derivatives</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The high reactivity of acyl chlorides towards nucleophilic reagents arises because the chlorine atom is pulling electrons away from the carbonyl carbon, enhancing its electrophilicity. By the same token, the Lewis basicity of the carbonyl oxygen is diminished.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Borane, which reduces carbonyl groups by a mechanism involving as its first and critical stage a boron&#x2013;oxygen Lewis acid&#x2013;base interaction, does not react with acyl chlorides.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">Although textbooks normally pigeon-hole the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation of electron-rich aromatic rings by acyl chlorides in the presence of Lewis acids as an electrophilic aromatic substitution, which is perfectly correct, the reaction also belongs here. The electrophile is an acylium ion, which is captured by the aromatic substrate acting as nucleophile, attacking at the carbon which belonged to the carbonyl group.</p>
