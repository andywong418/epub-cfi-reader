<p class="noindent">In the series formaldehyde&#x2013;acetaldehyde&#x2013;acetone, reactivity to nucleophiles decreases in that order. This is partly because Me is electron-releasing compared to H, so successive H-replacement by Me diminishes the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon; and partly because Me is bigger than H, so H-replacement by Me introduces steric hindrance to approach by a nucleophile. If we go further with the introduction of Me groups, to, say, diisopropyl ketone, we find that this is much less reactive than acetone.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">The electronic factor here is deactivating, but slight, because the additional Me groups are not attached directly to the carbonyl carbon. They are largely insulated from it by saturated carbon atoms. Unreactivity in this case is mainly down to steric effects, to which there are two contributions, both operating in the same sense. To begin with, obviously there is the sheer obstruction of the large isopropyl groups, making it difficult for a nucleophile to follow the necessary trajectory towards the electrophilic centre, which is from above and behind the carbonyl group. More subtle, in the trigonal ketone the two isopropyl groups are attached by bonds which diverge from each other at an angle of about 120&#x00B0;, but in the tetrahedral adduct this angle is reduced to about 109&#x00B0;: the additional internal compression between the bulky groups which results from nucleophilic addition and rehybridization militates against it.</p>

Substituents on the aromatic ring can have a profound effect. Thus <i>p</i>-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde has a rather unreactive carbonyl group, because of electron-release by the dimethylamino nitrogen. <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Chapter2 The addition of nucleophilic reagents to aldehydes and ketones</a></p>

<p class="indent-ka">By the same token, the alkene unit here is less reactive versus electrophiles than otherwise similar but isolated carbon&#x2013;carbon double bonds, and indeed acquires susceptibility to attack by nucleophiles at the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-carbon. Looked at another way, the effect of the electronic interaction between the two unsaturated groups is to share reactivity towards nucleophiles between them.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Hydration</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Both aldehydes and ketones are reversibly hydrated in aqueous solution. At 20 &#x00B0;C in pure water, formaldehyde is almost 100 per cent hydrated at equilibrium; acetaldehyde is about 60 per cent hydrated; but acetone remains almost 100 per cent in the unhydrated form. The presence of the hydrated form in aqueous acetone is easily demonstrated, however, by the addition of H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O, when <sup>18</sup>O is rapidly incorporated into the carbonyl group.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent-ka">High degrees of hydration at equilibrium generally result when the carbonyl group has strong electron-withdrawing substituents attached, and in extreme cases it is the hydrate which is the familiar form of the carbonyl compound. The soporific chloral hydrate, and the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino-acid colorimetric reagent ninhydrin, for example, are both really fully hydrated forms of carbonyl compounds. In the case of ninhydrin, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds may contribute to the stability of the hydrate. Another example of this can be seen in 1,1-dihydroxycyclopropane: dehydration to cyclopropanone is difficult <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Chapter2 The addition of nucleophilic reagents to aldehydes and ketones</a>because it involves rehybridization from <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> to <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>, and a corresponding hike in the angle strain. The ring bond angle of a tetrahedral carbon in a three-membered ring is already deformed by 40&#x00B0; from its relaxed value of 109&#x00B0;, but for a trigonal carbon (relaxed angle 120&#x00B0;) the deformation is 60&#x00B0;.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">Carbonyl hydration is subject to catalysis by both acids and bases. The acid-catalysed pathway can be represented as follows.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">The transition state here entails the pull of electron density through the carbonyl oxygen, with concerted electron supply by the nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon. Because it is HA which is involved in the transition state, the rate of the reaction depends on [HA], or, if there are several catalysing acids, on <i>&#x03A3;</i>[HA]&#x2014;not on [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]. This is called general acid catalysis: the key feature is that a proton transfer is part and parcel of the rate-determining step. The base-catalysed pathway can be sketched similarly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Aldehydes and ketones, except those which are sterically hindered or electronically deactivated, react with HCN, as in the marginal example. The reaction is base-catalysed and reversible; its mechanism is of historical interest, as it was the first reaction of organic chemistry to be interpreted (Lapworth, 1903) along modern lines.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Pure HCN reacts only very slowly, because it is a weak acid (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> about 9), but the reaction proceeds easily if base or a trace of CN<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is added. Because HCN is so hazardous&#x2014;it is lethally poisonous and very volatile (b.p. 26 &#x00B0;C)&#x2014;the reaction is usually performed by mixing the carbonyl substrate with NaCN and then adding sufficient acid to liberate the required amount of HCN <i>in situ.</i> The cyanide ion has electron density at both ends, either of which can react, according to the type of electrophile: with carbonyl groups it reacts through its more polarizable or &#x2018;soft&#x2019; end. Note that in this reaction a new carbon&#x2013;carbon bond is formed by causing a nucleophilic carbon atom to react with a complimentary electrophilic carbon atom. As such, it can be regarded as a prototype for a diverse and very important class of synthetic reactions which we shall have more to say about in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. Here we will mention only one close analogy, the sodamide-induced reaction of acetylene with acetone in liquid ammonia. As the p<i>&#x039A;<sub>a</sub></i> of ammonia (35) is greater than that of acetylene (25), the acetylene loses a proton to <img src="../images/f0012-03.jpg" alt="images"/>, giving an acetylide ion, which is isoelectronic with cyanide and reacts with electrophiles similarly.</p>

The equilibria are shifted back towards starting materials by aqueous acid or base.

<p class="noindent">Lithium aluminium hydride, lithal&#x2019; in lab jargon, reacts readily and irreversibly with aldehydes and ketones in aprotic media. Aqueous work-up gives alcohols, formally the products of successive attack by H<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

This can be turned to advantage, for such alkoxyaluminium hydrides are easily prepared by reaction of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> with controlled amounts of alcohols, and their moderated reactivity gives greater selectivity.

Thus excess NaBH<sub>4</sub>/EtOH reduces cyclopentenone completely to the saturated alcohol. The carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond must be reduced first in this case, as the allylic alcohol which would otherwise be an intermediate is not affected under the same conditions. The selectivity can be inverted, however, by the addition of cerium trichloride, when only the carbonyl group is reduced (the Luche reduction).</p>

<p class="indent-ka">When aldehydes are treated with NaBH<sub>4</sub> in aqueous or alcoholic media, the formation of hydrates and/or hemiacetals is of no practical consequence, because the addition of water and alcohols is freely reversible. Only the free aldehyde is reduced, but its consumption causes more to be released by displacement of the equilibrium, until all the starting material has reacted. Aldehydes have greater intrinsic reactivity towards nucleophiles than ketones. They are consequently reduced more easily by NaBH<sub>4</sub>, despite the much easier addition of water and alcohols to the former. Inverse selectivity can nevertheless be achieved, again by the clever use of Ce<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, which probably coordinates to and stabilizes aldehyde hydrates, thereby preventing reduction, but leaves essentially unhydrated ketones exposed.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">This process bears close comparison with the reduction of aldehydes and ketones by complex metal hydrides, and like that reaction is sensitive to steric hindrance. With some ketones, side-reactions provide easier pathways than nucleophilic attack at an obstructed carbonyl carbon. If <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH is present, it is likely to be more accessible, and the reagent may then act as a base instead of as a nucleophile, leading to enolate formation and regeneration of the starting ketone on aqueous acid work-up.</p>

<p class="noindent">This selectivity above can be interpreted in hard and soft terms. The relatively ionic methyllithium reagent is practically a source of a hard Me<sup>&#x2013;</sup> nucleophile, which seeks out the harder of the electrophilic sites on the substrate; the more covalent MeMgBr presents a methyl nucleophile which is of intermediate and undiscriminating hardness/softness; but the large and polarizable copper(I) atom makes the Me<sub>2</sub>Cu<sup>&#x2013;</sup> nucleophilic moiety in Me<sub>2</sub>CuLi soft and selective for the softer electrophilic substrate site. This picture, especially in relation to the copper-containing reagent, which exhibits structural and mechanistic complexity, is undoubtedly too simplistic, but it does provide a convenient rationalization of the facts.</p>

<p class="noindent">When an achiral nucleophilic reagent adds to an achiral aldehyde or simple acyclic unsymmetrical ketone, a chiral centre is formed, but the two enantiomers are of course formed in equal amount. Thus the reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide with methyl ethyl ketone gives a racemic tertiary alcohol, methyl ethyl phenyl carbinol. However, if a chiral centre already exists near the carbonyl group, there are two possible diastereoisomeric products, and these are in general not formed in equal amounts.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">With freely reversible nucleophilic additions like cyanohydrin formation, thermodynamic differences between the diastereoisomeric products&#x2014;which may be slight in simple cases&#x2014;will determine which will predominate. With irreversible processes such as LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduction or reaction with Grignard reagents, on the other hand, kinetic considerations depending mainly on steric factors will determine the outcome. <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Chapter2 The addition of nucleophilic reagents to aldehydes and ketones</a></p>
<p class="indent-ka">Consider a carbonyl compound, where L is the largest group, M is a group of intermediate size, and S the smallest group. If a Newman projection is made along the bond between the chiral <i>&#x03B1;</i>-carbon and the carbonyl carbon, and the carbon&#x2013;oxygen double bond is placed anti to</p>

<p class="noindent">the substituent L, then Cram&#x2019;s rule predicts the stereoselectivity by supposing that this is the reactive conformation, and that the nucleophile will attack the electrophilic carbon most easily on the side where the smallest <i>&#x03B1;</i>-substituent S is. Thus (<i>R</i>)-3-phenylbutan-2-one gives about 75 per cent of the (<i>R</i>,<i>S</i>)-3-phenyl-2-hydroxybutane and 25 per cent of the (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-diastereoisomer on treatment with LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, followed by aqueous work-up as usual.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Cram&#x2019;s rule is a useful general guide, despite the fact that it is based on a model for the reactive conformation which is no longer favoured, but it breaks down if nonsteric factors enter into consideration. For example, if there is an <i>&#x03B1;</i>-substituent which can join forces with the carbonyl oxygen to chelate a metal cation, the conformation of the substrate is constrained. Nucleophilic attack still takes place on the least hindered side, but this may or may not lead to the product predicted by Cram&#x2019;s rule.</p>

 <img src="../images/f0020-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">The rationale behind Cram&#x2019;s rule as first postulated was that the carbonyl oxygen, being in effect enlarged by coordination to Lewis acids, <a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chapter2 The addition of nucleophilic reagents to aldehydes and ketones</a>would seek to be as far from the group L as possible. It is now thought more plausible&#x2014;this is the Felkin&#x2013;Anh model&#x2014;to suppose that lowest energy transition state (i.e. the one leading to the favoured diastereoisomer) will be derived from the substrate conformation in which the group L distances itself equally from the R group and the carbonyl oxygen, with the group S lying close to the trajectory of the nucleophile. The predicted outcome is, however, the same as that arrived at with Cram&#x2019;s original model.</p>
