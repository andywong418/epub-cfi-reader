<p class="noindent">Simple enolates react irreversibly with soft (polarizable) electrophiles such as methyl iodide. A new carbon&#x2013;carbon bond is formed, in an S<sub><i>N</i></sub>2 reaction which is of considerable synthetic importance.</p>

<p class="noindent">If cyclohexanone is treated with ethanolic sodium ethoxide in the presence of methyl iodide, most of the latter reacts with ethoxide ion (Williamson&#x2019;s ether synthesis). However, if the considerably more hindered and slightly more basic <i>t</i>-butoxide is used as base, little reaction of it with the methyl iodide occurs. The methyl iodide therefore remains available to react with the ketone enolate as it is generated. From a preparative point of view, however, there is still the complication that the product here has <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH, so further reaction to give both possible dimethyl products can take place.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">The difficulty arises from the fact that substantial concentrations of bases derived from alcohols (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 16&#x2013;19) are necessary to obtain even small concentrations of enolates from simple ketones (<i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH p<i>&#x039A;</i><sub>a</sub> about 20). The monoalkyl product is therefore formed in the presence of excess base, and as the reaction proceeds there is increasing competition for the alkylating agent between the monoalkyl product enolate and that of the starting ketone. This problem can be solved by separating the enolization and alkylation stages, which can be done by using one <a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, Chapter8 Enolate alkylations with alkyl halides</a>equivalent of a very strong base to (e.g. LDA) to enolize the ketone quantitatively, and then quenching the resulting enolate with a modest excess of alkylating agent.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">There is also obviously a regiospecificity problem when it is required to alkylate an unsymmetrical ketone such as 2-methylcyclohexanone. A number of ingenious modern methods of achieving control in this situation have been devised. We shall exemplify just one. In 2-methylcyclohexanone, the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH<sub>2</sub> group loses a proton to strong base more rapidly than the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CHMe group does. In conventional jargon, the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH<sub>2</sub> has the greater &#x2018;kinetic acidity&#x2019;. This is partly for steric and statistical reasons, and partly because the electron-releasing effect of the methyl group discourages ionization on its side of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, of the two possible enolates, the one formed by ionization at the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CHMe group has the lower free energy (i.e. the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CHMe group has the greater &#x2018;thermodynamic acidity&#x2019;), illustrating the general principle that the more highly alkylated a carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond is, the more stable it is. Thus 2-methylcyclohexanone reacts with LDA at low temperatures to give the &#x2018;kinetic enolate&#x2019;, which can be trapped as its trimethylsilyl ether, but heating with triethylamine and trimethylsilyl chloride gives the trimethylsilyl ether of the &#x2018;thermodynamic enolate&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Note that, as indicated at the outset, although enolates usually react through their relatively soft and polarizable carbon atoms with soft electrophiles like methyl iodide, they are in fact bifunctional&#x2014;&#x2018;ambident&#x2019;&#x2014;nucleophiles. Hard electrophiles, and trimethylsilyl chloride is in that class, react at the hard end of the enolate, i.e. oxygen, the site of greatest negative charge density.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">The two isomeric trimethylsilyl enol ethers can each be isolated in a pure condition. Their silicon&#x2013;oxygen bonds can be cleaved by nucleophilic attack at silicon, with methyllithium or a tetraalkylammonium fluoride. This generates in a specific controlled manner, a single enolate which can be caught by addition of an alkylating agent (benzyl bromide in the following examples) before equilibration takes place.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">There is also a stereochemical issue associated with the mono-<i>&#x03B1;</i>-alkylation of simple ketones, except at methyl groups, because a new chiral centre is created. In general, of course, the mono-<i>&#x03B1;</i>-alkyl derivative is produced as a racemic mixture as in the methylation of diethyl ketone. Stereochemical control can, however, be achieved by the temporary derivatization of the carbonyl group with a chiral auxiliary reagent, (<i>S</i>)-l-amino-2-methoxylpyrrolidine (SAMP) or its (<i>R</i>)-enantiomer (RAMP). The resulting hydrazones <i>&#x03B1;</i>-deprotonate on treatment with LDA, giving chelated anions which react with electrophiles on one side only, so that on removal of the auxiliary group and regeneration of the carbonyl group single enantiomers result (<i>S</i> from the SAMP reagent, <i>R</i> from the RAMP reagent).</p>

<p class="noindent">Because the acidity&#x2014;both kinetic and thermodynamic&#x2014;of the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH in an ester such as ethyl acetate is lower than that of the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH in a simple ketone, very strong bases are indispensable for enolate generation. With such bases alkylation presents no difficulty, as in the following example.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>8.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Enolates derived from</b> <b><i>&#x03B2;</i>-dicarbonyl compounds</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">When a CH or CH<sub>2</sub> group lies between two carbonyl groups, the enhanced acidity enables complete ionization to be achieved with bases like ethoxide ion, and alkylation with NaOEt/EtOH/RHal systems is facile. Applications of acetoacetic ester and diethyl malonate as substrates in such reactions have been important for over a century, and remain so.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Applications of acetoacetic ester</h3>
<p class="noindent">Treatment of acetoacetic ester with an alkyl halide in the presence of an equivalent amount of sodium ethoxide results in alkylation at the carbon between the carbonyl groups, as exemplified below.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0061-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">The principal usefulness of acetoacetic ester lies in the fact that hydrolysis of alkylated derivatives with aqueous acid gives <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto acids, and it is characteristic of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto acids for them to decarboxylate with great ease, via a cyclic transition state.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0061-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="indent-ka"><a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Chapter8 Enolate alkylations with alkyl halides</a>&#160;&#160; The overall result of an alkylation&#x2013;hydrolysis&#x2013;decarboxylation sequence starting with an alkylating reagent RHal is its conversion to RCH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>. Since monoalkyl derivatives of acetoacetic ester still have an acidic proton, a second alkylation with a different alkylating reagent is possible under slightly more vigorous conditions, leading by the same work-up operations to a ketone of general structure RR&#x2032;CHCOCH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Similar synthetically important transformations can be carried out with other <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto esters, including cyclic cases. There are two kinds of side-reaction to contend with. Firstly, <i>O</i>-alkylation of the enolate may compete significantly with <i>C</i>-alkylation. Dipolar aprotic solvents (DMF, DMSO, HMPA) are in many ways suitable, but tend to encourage <i>O</i>-alkylation compared to protic solvents, because in the latter the oxygen of the enolate is encumbered by H-bonded solvent molecules. In a series of alkylating agents RCl, RBr, RI, the iodide is the most polarizable and therefore the softest electrophile, so it leads to the least <i>O</i>-alkylation, because oxygen is the harder end of the enolate. The iodide is therefore the reagent of choice, subject to economy and availability. Secondly, alkaline hydrolysis of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto esters is usually accompanied by some carbon&#x2013;carbon bond cleavage, leading to two carboxylic acids on acidic work-up.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0062-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Hydrolysis under acidic conditions may therefore be preferred, provided it is compatible with other aspects of the case in hand.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Applications of diethyl malonate</h3>
<p class="noindent">Diethyl malonate can be alkylated under similar conditions to those used with acetoacetic ester, in one or two stages.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">Hydrolysis with aqueous acid gives a free malonic acid, which decarboxylates once by a mechanism analogous to the decarboxylation of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto acids. Diethyl malonate&#x2014;often simply called malonic ester in casual laboratory talk&#x2014;thus gives easy access to substituted acetic acids</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0063-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">There are a number of other important applications, of which we shall note just one, the use of diethyl acetamidomalonate.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0063-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The acetamido substituent does not interfere with enolate formation, and <i>&#x03B1;</i>-alkylation proceeds smoothly in the presence of sodium ethoxide. Hot aqueous acid hydrolyses not only the two ester groups but also the amide, and decarboxylation takes place under these conditions, giving an <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino acid. This is one of the most general syntheses of the proteinogenic <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino acids and their analogues.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dianions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Acetylacetone enolizes on treatment with alkoxide bases exclusively by loss of a single proton from the CH<sub>2</sub> group, which has vastly greater kinetic and thermodynamic acidity than the methyl groups. Electrophiles therefore react at the CH<sub>2</sub> group in the presence of alkoxide bases. However, if two equivalents of a very strong base are used, a dianion is formed, the second proton being taken from a methyl group. Now if one equivalent of an alkylating agent is added, it is attacked by a former methyl carbon.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0063-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Analogous procedures can be carried out on other <i>&#x03B2;</i>-dicarbonyl and related compounds: in unsymmetrical cases, where two dianions could in principle be formed, in practice one of the two is often formed more easily than the other. <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Chapter8 Enolate alkylations with alkyl halides</a></p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0064-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Both of the last two examples illustrate the general rule that in dianions with two nucleophilic carbons, it is the one corresponding to the less acidic site of the starting material which reacts fastest with electrophiles. The same rule applies to dianions derived from carboxylic acids, which are also useful synthetic intermediates.</p>
