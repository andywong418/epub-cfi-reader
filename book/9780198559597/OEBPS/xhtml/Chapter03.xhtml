<p class="noindent">We have already seen that aldehydes and ketones react reversibly 1:1 with alcohols under general acid or general base catalysis, to give hemiacetals and hemiketals, respectively (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>). With excess alcohol and a catalytic amount of a strong acid, further reversible reaction takes place to replace the OH group and give an acetal (from an aldehyde) or ketal (from a ketone). The overall equilibria are as follows.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">If arrangements are made to remove the water from the continuously equilibrating mixture, by distillation or other means, then the aldehyde or ketone is quantitatively converted to an acetal or ketal, as the case may be. The reaction proceeds more easily with aldehydes than with ketones, and, in the simple form sketched above, is practically limited to primary alcohols. 1,2-Diols and 1,3-diols react easily, giving five- and six-membered rings, respectively.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">In the reactions of diols the favourability of ring-formation offsets the intrinsic unreactivity of secondary hydroxyl groups, and cyclic ketal and acetal formation is of great importance in carbohydrate chemistry.

<p class="noindent">Note that although methanol is a primary alcohol, and present here in vast excess, it cannot compete with cyclization through the more hindered secondary OH group at C-5. Mixed acetal derivatives of carbohydrates involving C-1 are called glycosides. Many complex glycosides occur in living things. Cellulose, for example&#x2014;the main constituent of plant cell walls&#x2014;is a polymer in which <i>&#x03B2;</i>-<small>D</small>-glucopyranose units are connected by glycoside formation between C-1 of one unit and the OH at C-4 of the next. Here the mixed acetal construct serves both to maintain the rings and to join the units together.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chapter3 Acetals and ketals</a> The rate-determining step is the unimolecular dissociation of the protonated hemiacetal. The rate of this step, and therefore of the overall reaction, depends only on [hemiacetal.H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>], which must depend in turn on [&#x0397;<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup>], i.e. on pH. Such catalysis, where the acidity of the medium is what matters, is termed specific acid catalysis, in contrast to general acid catalysis, where the total concentration of catalysing acids is the controlling factor. The key difference between the two types of catalysis is that in general acid catalysis a proton transfer from a catalysing acid to the substrate is taking place in the rate-determining transition state, but in specific acid catalysis the proton transfer which induces reaction is complete before the rate-determining stage is reached. The two types of acid catalysis can be distinguished experimentally by investigating the response of the reaction to buffer concentration at constant pH: ideally, a reaction subject to specific acid catalysis should show invariant rate, whereas one subject to general acid catalysis should accelerate with increasing buffer concentration. Ketal formation from ketones via hemiketals takes place by exactly the same mechanism as acetal formation from aldehydes via hemiacetals.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">The polymerization which takes place on evaporation of an aqueous solution of formaldehyde (formalin), giving paraformaldehyde, is a special case of acetal formation.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Treatment of formaldehyde with sulfuric acid, on the other hand, gives a trimer, trioxane; acetaldehyde also gives a cyclic trimer (paraldehyde) or a cyclic tetramer (metaldehyde) on treatment with catalytic amounts of sulfuric acid, depending on the conditions. These acetals are all solids, which can be used as convenient sources of the aldehydes from which they are derived, to which they are readily hydrolysed with dilute aqueous acid.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Properties</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The CH between the oxygen atoms in an acetal or ketal is of low acidity, because there is no scope for delocalization of the anion which would be <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Chapter3 Acetals and ketals</a>formed. Ketals are completely stable to bases. So are acetals, to all except extremely basic reagents such as butyllithium, with which the acetal proton may be abstracted, as in the example below.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0025-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Since acetals and ketals are saturated compounds, nucleophilic attack can only occur if a carbon&#x2013;oxygen or carbon&#x2013;carbon bond is broken. This would involve displacement of alkoxide or alkyl anions, which are, respectively, poor and exceedingly poor leaving groups in the absence of special stabilizing structural features. Acetals and ketals are thus stable to most nucleophilic reagents, although carbon&#x2013;oxygen bond fission can be induced by Grignard reagents with the assistance of added Lewis acids. This reaction takes place with difficulty, however, compared to other reactions of Grignard reagents, such as addition to carbonyl groups.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">In complete contrast to the high stability of acetals and ketals to base, aqueous acid easily hydrolyses them by displacing the formation equilibria (see above) back to the carbonyl compounds from which they were derived.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Dithioacetals and dithioketals are not only stable to aqueous base like their oxygen counterparts, but also to aqueous acid: for hydrolysis to the corresponding carbonyl compounds, addition of mercury(II) compounds is required.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">The CH between the heteroatoms in dithioacetals is rather more acidic than it is in acetals. Five-membered cyclic dithioacetals undergo the same <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter3 Acetals and ketals</a>fragmentation on treatment with alkyllithium reagents as five-membered cyclic acetals do (see above). A six-membered cyclic dithioacetal is not set up to fragment in this way, however, and gives a stabilized organometallic intermediate, which is highly nucleophilic at the central carbon atom. Treatment of this intermediate with an electrophile such as an alkyl iodide gives a dithioketal, from which a ketone can be obtained by mercury(II)-mediated hydrolysis. These reactions can be used to convert an aldehyde to a ketone.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">In this sequence, the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the original aldehyde is temporarily made nucleophilic for the purposes of the synthesis, emerging finally electrophilic again in the ketone product. This relatively novel concept was developed in German-speaking parts, and there is a convenient German word for the inversion of polarity which is involved: <i>umpolung,</i> which has now become part of the English vocabulary of organic chemistry.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The protecting group principle</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In elementary textbooks, the reactions of organic chemistry are generally illustrated for simplicity&#x2019;s sake with transformations of monofunctional compounds. In real chemical life, however, polyfunctionality is the norm, and a common problem is the selective execution of an interconversion at one functional centre when a second is present which might interfere, or itself undergo irreversible change under the intended conditions. In this situation, it is desirable to derivatize the second functionality in such a way that its reactivity is blocked whilst enabling it to be liberated subsequently on demand. A group employed for such a purpose is called a protecting group. Acetals and ketals are ideal for protecting aldehydes and ketones, because they can be prepared from them easily; they remain <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter3 Acetals and ketals</a>aloof from all except extremes of nucleophilic and basic reagents; and they yield up the original carbonyl groups when required on mild acidic hydrolysis. For example, suppose that it is desired to reduce an ethyl ester group with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> (here we anticipate a little: see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.5">Section 5.5</a>) without affecting a methyl ketone group elsewhere in the molecule. As posed, this is an impossible task, because, as we have seen (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.6">Section 2.6</a>), LiAlH<sub>4</sub> also reduces ketones readily. Protection of the ketone as a ketal provides the solution, and enables the desired ester reduction to be achieved with complete selectivity, albeit by slightly roundabout means.</p>
