<p class="indent">This process (on which there are many variants, as we shall see) is an acyl transfer reaction, in which the RCO&#x2013; group is passed from an alcohol oxygen to a nucleophile, liberating the alcohol. Alternatively, less commonly, the nucleophile may react with the carbon of the alcohol moiety, in an S<sub><i>N</i></sub>l or S<sub><i>N</i></sub>2 fashion.</p>

<p class="noindent">When an alkyl ester of a carboxylic acid is hydrolysed, that is to say is cleaved into its component alcohol and carboxylic acid by water, it is not</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a> obvious by inspection whether the substrate bond which is broken is the acyl-oxygen bond or the alkyl-oxygen bond. Cleavage at (a) or (b) would yield the same products. An isotopic labelling experiment is necessary to resolve the ambiguity. Thus the hydrolysis of a simple methyl ester which has an <sup>18</sup>O-labelled saturated oxygen gives methanol containing all the <sup>18</sup>O: exclusive acyl&#x2013;oxygen fission takes place in this case.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Alkyl&#x2013;oxygen fission can be similarly proved to occur when <i>t</i>-butyl esters are hydrolysed under acidic conditions.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0037-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Ester hydrolyses may be acid- (A) or base- (B) induced (hydrolysis in completely neutral conditions is slow in simple cases), may go with acyl&#x2013;oxygen (<i>AC</i>) or alkyl&#x2013;oxygen (<i>AL</i>) fission, and may have uni- (1) or bi- (2) molecular rate-determining steps. We shall consider only the three most common mechanisms, which are designated B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2, <small>A</small><sub><i>AC</i></sub><small>2 <i></i></small>and &#x0391;<sub><i>AL</i></sub>1, and a less general mechanism which is designated A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>l, although these do not by any means exhaust the field.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">On treatment with aqueous alkali, methyl and ethyl esters are hydrolysed irreversibly via a tetrahedral adduct of substrate and OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, the formation of which is rate-determining. The overall process is irreversible, because the carboxylic acid product is fully ionized.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0037-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Hydrolysis also takes place under these conditions with esters of secondary alcohols, but the mechanism is sensitive to steric hindrance, and <i>t</i>-butyl esters are quite inert to alkali and other nucleophilic reagents. Electron-withdrawing substituents on either side of the ester functionality favour the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, and accelerate the reaction. The rate constant for the B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 hydrolysis of ethyl benzoate, for example, is increased about a hundredfold by placing a nitro group at the <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a><i>p</i>-position of the aromatic ring. Similarly, in a series of phenyl acetates, which are as a class all subject to facile <i><small>B</small><sub>AC</sub><small>2 </small></i>hydrolysis, electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic moiety accelerate the reaction markedly.</p>
<p class="indent">The hydrolysis of alkyl esters by alkali is often called saponification, a term which originally had the more limited meaning of soap-production by the action of alkali on oils and fats, which are mixtures of triesters of glycerol with long chain carboxylic acids (fatty acids), such as palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0038-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3">The A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Methyl and ethyl esters are also hydrolysed by aqueous acid via a tetrahedral intermediate, but this mechanism is reversible.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0038-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If, instead of ester and excess water with a catalytic amount of strong acid, we begin with carboxylic acid and excess alcohol and a catalytic amount of strong acid, we can drive the whole system of equilibria backwards, to completion if we remove water as it is formed. Used in that reverse sense, the process is called esterification. Whether going forwards to hydrolyse an ester, or backwards to esterify an acid, the <small>A</small><sub><i>AC</i></sub><small>2 </small>mechanism is, like the B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 mechanism, sensitive to steric hindrance; but the response of the two pathways to electronic effects is quite different. Whereas the rate of a B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 reaction is greatly increased by electron-withdrawing substituents near the reaction centre (see above), <small>A</small><sub><i>AC</i></sub><small>2 </small>reactions are insensitive to electronic effects. This is not because the effects are inoperative, but rather because they operate in an opposing sense on different stages and balance so far as the overall rate is <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a>concerned. The overall rate of an A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 reaction depends on the electrophilic reactivity of the carbonyl group in the protonated ester intermediate. This is enhanced by an electron-withdrawing substituent on either side, as with the B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 mechanism. However, the overall rate also depends on the concentration of the protonated ester intermediate, and thus in turn on the basicity of the ester functionality, which is diminished by an electron-withdrawing substituent on either side. The rate constants for the A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 hydrolysis of ethyl <i>p</i>-nitrobenzoate and benzoate are consequently about the same.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The A<sub><i>AL</i></sub>1 mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Esters of tertiary alcohols such as <i>t</i>-butanol are inert to alkali, as already mentioned, because of the very unfavourable steric interactions which would attend the formation of a B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 tetrahedral adduct. For the same reason the A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 pathway is not open to <i>t</i>-butyl esters under acidic conditions. Rapid hydrolysis nevertheless takes place under acidic conditions, but by alkyl&#x2013;oxygen fission through a mechanism which is termed &#x0391;<sub><i>AL</i></sub>1, although it is in fact an S<sub><i>N</i></sub>l reaction of the protonated substrate.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0039-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This is a feasible process because a relatively stable (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion is formed in the key step. Alkyl&#x2013;oxygen fission in the same way with a methyl primary ester would give a <img src="../images/f0039-02.jpg" alt="images"/> ion, an intermediate of prohibitively high energy, so it does not occur.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>t</i>-Butyl esters can be prepared by treating carboxylic acids with excess <i>t</i>-butanol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, when (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions formed by the <i>t</i>-butanol are caught by the carboxylic acid. This is simply the &#x0391;<sub><i>AL</i></sub>1, hydrolysis in reverse. The most convenient general method in practice, however, is to react the carboxylic acid with excess isobutene and a trace of strong acid, when (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions formed by protonation of the isobutene are trapped by the carboxylic acid.</p>

</aside>
<h3 class="h3">The A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>1 mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a mechanism of much more limited scope than the three outlined above. Methyl mesitoate has a carbonyl group which is sterically hindered by the <i>o</i>-methyl groups on the aromatic ring. The B<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 and A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 routes for hydrolysis are thus closed off. Since it is a methyl ester, the A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>1 route is not open either. &#x0392;<sub><i>AL</i></sub>2 (&#x003D; S<sub><i>N</i></sub>2) cleavage is possible in theory, but in practice is very slow. However if this ester is dissolved in <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a>concentrated sulfuric acid and the resulting solution is quenched with water, quantitative conversion to the free acid and alcohol ensues. In this reaction, the protonated ester functionality springs apart to give an acylium ion, with relief of steric compression because the acylium ion is linear, as drawn. Although stable in concentrated sulfuric acid (a medium lacking good nucleophiles), on adding water the acylium ion is trapped to give the carboxylic acid.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0040-01.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">By quenching a solution of the carboxylic acid in concentrated sulfuric acid with excess methanol, the reaction may be operated backwards, as an esterification.</p>

<p class="noindent2">pH dependence ofthe rate of hydrolysis of aspirin.</p>
</aside>

<p class="noindent">Ester hydrolysis can, if the appropriate structural features are present, be greatly accelerated by intramolecular catalysis. Aspirin, for example, is hydrolysed in the pH range 3&#x2013;9 much more rapidly than its <i>p</i>-isomer&#x2014;which, in the absence of special effects, might have been expected to be the more reactive because it lacks the <i>o</i>-steric hindrance of aspirin. It is clear that in this case the <i>o</i>-substituent actually helps the hydrolysis. The way in which the rate of hydrolysis depends on pH reveals that the sharp increase in rate between pH 3 and pH 4 is in step with the dissociation of the carboxyl group (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 3.5), implying that the hyper-reactive species is the carboxylate anion. Without additional evidence there are two possible mechanisms to consider for its hydrolysis. Intramolecular nucleophilic catalysis has been ruled out by running the hydrolysis of aspirin in <img src="../images/f0040-02.jpg" alt="images"/>: no <sup>18</sup>O was incorporated into the salicylic acid produced, some would have been (by cleavage a) if an anhydride intermediate had been involved. This result is, however, consistent with intramolecular general base catalysis, which involves carbon&#x2013;oxygen bond formation by <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a>attack at the acetyl carbonyl group exclusively. The balance between the two pathways is fine: application of the same criterion to 3,5-dinitroaspirin shows that its hydrolysis does involve intramolecular nucleophilic catalysis.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0041-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Intramolecular catalysis is effective because helper groups are held near the reaction site, poised ready to guide the chemistry more swiftly and smoothly than intermolecular interactions dependent on chance encounter could. There is an enormous jump of complexity and subtlety between simple cases of intramolecular catalysis, like the hydrolysis of aspirin, and enzymic catalysis, but the bottom line is the same: enzymic catalysis depends on catalytic functionalities which are able to operate with delicacy and precision in the temporary enzyme&#x2013;substrate assembly, because they are correctly placed for optimal effectiveness. Nothing is left to chance.</p>
<p class="indent">The chymotrypsin hydrolysis of <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate is a relatively simple example. Chymotrypsin is a digestive enzyme whose natural function is the degradation of food protein by catalysis of peptide bond hydrolysis. Like all enzymes, it is a macromolecular protein designed by Nature to have an active site sculpted to fit the substrate and bring it into reaction with the catalytic groups. <i>p</i>-Nitrophenyl acetate is not a natural or even a reactive substrate for chymotrypsin, but it has served as an experimentally convenient model. When it is mixed in solution with the enzyme, there is an immediate release of one mole of <i>p</i>-nitrophenol per mole of chymotrypsin. This corresponds to the fast formation of an acetylenzyme; slower hydrolysis of this covalent intermediate completes the reaction and regenerates catalytic enzyme. After the initial burst of <i>p</i>-nitrophenol, the rate of its release is steady and limited by the rate at which the enzyme is regenerated.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ammonia and its derivatives&#x2014;alkylamines, hydroxylamine, hydrazine, etc.&#x2014;all react with simple esters (except those of tertiary alcohols) under neutral or basic conditions, by mechanisms involving tetrahedral adducts which are broadly similar to the &#x0392;<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 and A<sub><i>AC</i></sub>2 mechanisms of hydrolysis. <a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Chapter5 Reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid esters</a></p>

<p class="indent">Alkylamines are even slower to react: the electron-releasing effect of an alkyl group raises the intrinsic reactivity of the nitrogen slightly, but this is more than offset by the additional steric hindrance, to which, as we have seen, all reactions of this class are sensitive. As with hydrolysis, electron-withdrawing substituents on either side of the ester function greatly enhance its reactivity. Ethyl chloroacetate and <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl acetate, for example, are both much more reactive towards ammonia than ethyl acetate is.</p>
