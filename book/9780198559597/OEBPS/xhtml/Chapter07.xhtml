<p class="noindent">An aqueous solution of a simple ketone such as acetone is a surprisingly complex system. In addition to the reversible hydration of the keto form (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>), it is in equilibrium with an enol tautomer and an enolate ion. At equilibrium, the concentrations of enol and enolate are very small in this case; the enol tautomer is of high energy compared to the keto tautomer, and the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of acetone is about 20, compared to about 15&#x2013;16 for water and alcohols. So the conjugate base derived from acetone (i.e. the enolate) can only exist at trace concentrations in aqueous or alcoholic solution.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">If two carbonyl groups flank a CH or CH<sub>2</sub> (which is thus <i>&#x03B1;</i> to two carbonyl groups) then the p<i>K</i>a of that CH or CH<sub>2</sub> is much higher (about 9 in the case of acetylacetone) than the CH<sub>3</sub> of acetone, because the enolate is stabilized by greater delocalization. The enolate can therefore exist at substantial concentrations in water and alcohols.</p>

<p class="noindent">The corresponding enol is stabilized not only by delocalization, but also by the scope for the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond.</p>
<p class="indent-ka">Ethyl acetoacetate, commonly called acetoacetic ester, is a similar case which has been thoroughly studied. At equilibrium in the pure neat liquid state at room temperature, the keto and enol forms are present in proportions of about 12:1. Careful fractional distillation, with rigorous <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Chapter7 Enols and enolates</a>exclusion of all possibility of acidic and basic catalysis of the equilibration, enables the two tautomeric forms to be separated. The pure enol gives an immediate bright red colour with ferric chloride, a classical colour test for phenols, which have OH attached to an unsaturated system, like enols; the pure keto tautomer does not give this colour test, except on standing. The enol reacts instantly with bromine; the keto form reacts only slowly, but to give the same monobromo product. If either pure tautomer is allowed to stand with traces of acid or base, an identical mixture is produced which is indistinguishable physically and chemically from acetoacetatic ester as ordinarily prepared.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">In principle, all carbonyl compounds can form enols and enolates. Because the electronic factors which stabilize the corresponding enolates tend to stabilize enols similarly, the enol contents of carbonyl compounds correlate with the p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> values of their <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH groups.

<p class="indent-ka">The conjugate base of any acid in the table will react with any carbonyl compound above it, to generate the enolate, quantitatively if the p<i>K</i><sub>a </sub>difference is sufficient. Thus treatment of acetoacetic ester in ethanol with an equivalent amount of sodium ethoxide causes complete conversion to the enolate.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">A simple ketone like acetone or cyclohexanone will be left in the unionized form under the same conditions&#x2014;the enolate will be there, and if consumed more will be formed rather rapidly in the same way, although there will never be much of it. If instead of sodium ethoxide in <a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Chapter7 Enols and enolates</a>ethanol we take a base derived from a secondary amine, such as LDA, in an unreactive aprotic solvent like tetrahydrofuran, then quantitative enolate formation occurs, as in the following example.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:11em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0054-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">A certain amount of chemical commonsense is required here, however. Thus the similar p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of acetyl chloride and ethanol might suggest that addition of acetyl chloride to sodium ethoxide in ethanol would result in an equilibrium being set up with the formation of substantial amounts of the enolate.</p>

<p class="noindent">In fact, if done incautiously on a significant scale, a violent and possibly catastrophic reaction (nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine) would take place.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Simple enol and enolate reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Enols and enolates both react with electrophiles (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>). We shall consider here some examples of reactions where the electrophile is H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, D<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or Br<sub>2</sub>. Cases where the reactive atom of the electrophile is carbon, so that a new carbon&#x2013;carbon bond is formed are very important in synthesis: they are dealt with in the two closing chapters.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Racemization and epimerization of chiral ketones</h3>
<p class="noindent">Single enantiomers of ketones with chiral <i>&#x03B1;</i>-carbons are easily racemized under acidic or basic catalysis, provided <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH is present. This takes place via the enol or enolate respectively, both of which are planar and can accept a proton at carbon on either side of the plane, with equal probability, giving a racemate.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">If, however, the two products of <i>C</i>-protonation are not of equal energy, they will not be formed with equal facility. Thus the enolate derived from the two decalin derivatives shown in the margin is protonated preferentially to give the less strained <i>trans-</i>isomer<i>,</i> providing a means of transforming <i>cis</i> to <i>trans.</i> <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter7 Enols and enolates</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">Deuterium exchange</h3>
<p class="noindent">Aldehydes and ketones with <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH undergo exchange of all such hydrogen by deuterium in D<sub>2</sub>O. As with the racemization of chiral ketones, the process is both acid- and base-catalysed and involves the enol or enolate, respectively.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0055-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Only the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-positions are affected. The rates of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-deuterium exchange of carbonyl compounds correlate with their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values i.e. <i>&#x03B2;</i>-dicarbonyl compounds react faster than simple aldehydes and ketones, which are in turn more susceptible than simple esters.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Bromination</h3>
<p class="noindent">Acetone reacts easily with bromine under both acidic and basic catalysis, to give monobromoacetone as the first-formed product in both cases.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0055-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">The rate of product formation depends on [acetone], but is independent of [Br<sub>2</sub>]; the rates of chlorination, bromination, and iodination under the same conditions are the same. In more complex ketones, only the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-position is brominated. These observations all point to mechanisms involving rate-determining enol and enolate formation.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-16.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent-ka">For preparative monobromination of ketones, acid-catalysed procedures work well. Thus acetophenone reacts with bromine in acetic acid to give an excellent yield of phenacyl bromide. The reaction, which is autocatalytic because the HBr coproduct catalyses enol formation, does not proceed beyond the monobromo stage, as the enol derived from the product is deactivated towards further electrophilic attack, by the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine atom. The rates of base-catalysed brominations of carbonyl compounds follow the same trends as their acidities&#x2014;very fast with <i>&#x03B2;</i>-dicarbonyl compounds, rapid with simple aldehydes and ketones, very slow with simple esters. From a preparative point of view, difficulty arises from the fact that if there is more than one enolizable hydrogen in the substrate, the monobromo product has a more acidic hydrogen than the substrate, so a second bromination takes place. In the case of a methyl ketone, all three hydrogens are replaced by <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter7 Enols and enolates</a>treatment with bromine in aqueous alkali, but then further reaction takes place with carbon&#x2013;carbon bond cleavage, to give tribromomethane (bromoform). The same reaction occurs on treatment of methyl ketones with iodine and alkali, giving iodoform. The iodoform usually separates as a pale yellow crystalline solid with a characteristic odour, and the reaction is a classical test-tube method of identifying methyl ketones. It is specific to methyl ketones (and compounds which are converted to methyl ketones under the conditions used) because it is necessary for three halogens to have been introduced for the cleavage stage to be possible.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Although carboxylic acids, simple esters and amides do not undergo acid- or base-catalysed bromination because the respective enols and enolates do not form easily enough, the Hell&#x2013;Volhard&#x2013;Zelinsky bromination of carboxylic acids gives easy access to <i>&#x03B1;</i>-bromocarboxylic acid derivatives. In one popular variation of this procedure, a carboxylic acid is treated with bromine and a little red phosphorus. Some PBr<sub>3</sub> is formed, which converts the carboxylic acid to the corresponding acyl bromide; the crucial stage probably entails enolization of the acyl bromide and reaction of its enol with bromine; acyl bromide interchange with unmodified carboxylic acid (via an acid anhydride, which may also be brominated through its enol) allows the process to be repeated until all the starting acid is consumed. Aqueous work-up gives a good yield of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-bromocarboxylic acid.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0056-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent-ka">Only the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-position of the carboxylic acid is brominated, and only one bromine is introduced, except under forcing conditions. There are several useful modifications of the Hell&#x2013;Volhard&#x2013;Zelinsky method. It is not essential for the PBr<sub>3</sub> to be formed <i>in situ.</i> It can be added in stoichiometric amount, and PCl<sub>3</sub> may be used, when the key intermediate is the acyl chloride. Alternatively, in a convenient preparation of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-bromoesters, a carboxylic acid may be converted separately to the acyl chloride before bromination and alcoholysis, as in the marginal example.</p>

<p class="indent-ka">Similarly, nitrous acid (i.e. acidified aqueous sodium nitrite solution, a source of NO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cations) reacts with enols to give, after tautomerization, oximes, providing through their hydrolysis a useful route to <i>&#x03B1;</i>-diketones.</p>
