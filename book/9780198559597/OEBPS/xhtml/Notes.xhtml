<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 1</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch01_n1">1. Reaction at oxygen can occur as shown below. Methyl iodide, however, is a relatively soft electrophile, and reacts preferentially at carbon with simple enolates, as that is the softer end.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ch01_n2">2. A reaction pathway is open to acetyl chloride in which negative charge is pushed onto oxygen when the ethoxide anion attacks, giving a reasonably stabilized tetrahedral intermediate. The corresponding mechanism is not possible with 2-chloropropene, because it would push charge onto a carbon which is out on a limb, without any electron-accepting substituent attached.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch01_n3">3. Diazomethane reacts as <img src="../images/f0081-05.jpg" alt="image"></img>, attacking the electrophilic carbon of the ketone giving a tetrahedral adduct, which can collapse in two ways to the respective products.</p>

<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch02_n1">1. The Grignard reagent opens the hemiacetal ring, revealing an aldehyde function which reacts with a further mole of Grignard reagent in the usual way.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0081-03.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Notes on the end of chapter problems</a></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch02_n2">2. This is an industrial process for the preparation of methyl methacrylate, an important polymer precursor. Reaction takes place through the cyanohydrin, which undergoes dehydration to give a C&#x003D;C bond, and methanolysis of the nitrile group.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch02_n3">3. The Grignard reagent reacts in the usual way to give a tertiary alcohol.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0082-01.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent">The OH group is protonated during workup, yielding after loss of water a delocalized cation.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0082-02.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent">The delocalized cation reacts with water at &#x002A; to give an enol which promptly tautomerizes to the observed product.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0082-03.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch03_n1">1. See Primer 33, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_19">p. 19.</a></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch03_n2">2. The Grignard reagent reacts with acetone in the usual way to give a tertiary alcohol; aqueous acid reveals an aldehyde function which is trapped by the OH group as a hemiacetal; oxidation of the hemiacetal secondary OH group gives the observed lactone.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0082-04.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 5</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch05_n1">1. A hydrazone is formed by reaction at the ketone carbonyl and the remaining amino group then attacks the ester carbonyl, giving a pyrazolone.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0082-05.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Notes on the end of chapter problems</a></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch05_n2">2. The other product is benzyl bromide, formed by an S<sub><em>N</em></sub>2(A<sub><em>AL</em></sub>2)-like attack of bromide ion on the protonated ester.</p>
<p class="imagel" style="text-align:left;margin-left:12em;"><img src="../images/f0083-01.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch05_n3">3. The mechanism here is also S<sub><em>N</em></sub>2(A<sub><em>AL</em></sub>2)-like; water attacks the protonated lactone on the alkyl side of the ester function, with inversion of configuration at the reaction site, a general feature of S<sub><em>N</em></sub>2 reactions.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 6</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch06_n1">1. A mixed anhydride of the starting acid and pivalic acid is formed; this reacts preferentially with benzylamine at the carbonyl group from the original acid, because the other one is sterically hindered. This is one of many procedures for activating carboxyl groups.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0083-02.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch06_n2">2. The bond between the CO and N of the four-membered <em>&#x03B2;</em>-lactam ring. The N is constrained by the fused ring geometry, so that its three bonds cannot all lie coplanar with each other and the CO group, as is required for the conjugation which deactivates normal amide bonds to nucleophilic attack at the CO group. Furthermore, the <em>&#x03B2;</em>-lactam ring is strained, and the system is like a compressed spring, ready to fly open.</p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 7</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch07_n1">1. In water, solvent competes for the hydrogen bonds which stabilize the enol (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec_7.1">Section 7.1</a>, in the margin).</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch07_n2">2. There are many ways of achieving this conversion. The simplest is <em>&#x03B1;</em>-bromination and displacement of bromide with ammonia as below. See Primer 7, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, for more possibilities.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0083-03.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch07_n3">3. The most acidic hydrogens are as follows.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0083-04.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Notes on the end of chapter problems</a> In the case of methyl propyl ketone, the most stable enolate is the one which has most substitutents on the C&#x003D;C bond, so the CH<sub>2</sub> group next to the CO is more acidic than the methyl group on the other side of it; the remaining hydrogens are of course not acidic at all. In the case of the <em>&#x03B1;&#x03B2;</em>-unsaturated ketone, ionization by loss of a proton from the methyl group most distant from the CO group gives a more delocalized anion than ionization from any other position.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0084-01.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 8</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch08_n1">1. It is impossible to place a double bond at a bridgehead, because it would be so twisted that there would be no <em>&#x03C0;</em>-overlap of the necessary <em>p</em>-orbitals, which would in fact be orthogonal (try making a model&#x0021;). This is Bredt&#x2019;s rule. Because the enolate which would be generated by ionization of the bridgehead hydrogen would violate Bredt&#x2019;s rule, it is not formed. Only the hydrogens of the CH<sub>2</sub> next to the CO can be removed to give an enolate. A single enolate is formed&#x2014;it does not matter which of the two hydrogens is lost to the base&#x2014;but methyl iodide reacts preferentially on the least hindered face to give a single product.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch08_n2">2. Enolates also react with alkylating agents such as epoxides. In this example lactone formation ensues; hydrolysis and decarboxylation in the usual way gives <em>&#x03B3;</em>-butyrolactone. If the lactone ring opened during hydrolysis and decarboxylation it would close again on isolation, as such lactone rings are formed with great ease.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0084-02.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch08_n3">3. This coupling reaction involves successive iodination and alkylation, giving a tetraester which undergoes hydrolysis and decarboxylation at both ends in the usual way to give succinic acid.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0084-03.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Notes on the end of chapter problems</a></p>
<p class="h2"><b>Chapter 9</b></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch09_n1">1. It is tempting to propose that what is involved here is nucleophilic attack across the ring as shown below.</p>
<p class="imagel" style="text-align:left;margin-left:8em;"><img src="../images/f0085-01.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent">But this is stereoelectronically impossible. The displacement of an enolate from a methyl group as shown would be improbable in any case, because only good leaving groups are so displaced by nucleophiles, but there is also a fundamental objection to the proposal. For an S<sub><em>N</em></sub>2-type displacement, the nucleophile must be able to get behind the reaction site and push out the leaving group in line on the other side, which it cannot do here. What actually happens is that the ring is opened by a reverse Dieckmann reaction to give a diester which then cyclizes the other way round. Isomerisation takes place in the direction shown because the product is a much stronger acid than the starting ester; in the product there is a CH which lies between two CO groups, whereas in the starting ester the ionizable hydrogens are only activated by one CO group.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0085-02.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch09_n2">2. This is an example of the Robinson ring extension. It involves successive Michael addition to give A, aldol cyclization to give B and finally dehydration to give the observed product C.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0085-03.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch09_n3">3. B<sub><em>AC</em></sub>2 <em><sub></sub></em>ester hydrolysis is followed by a reverse aldol reaction, which is driven by release of ring strain. This gives an open-chain <em>&#x03B3;</em>-diketone, which cyclizes by a forward aldol reaction to give a comfortable 5-ring, followed by loss of water to give the observed product. Actually the cyclization could have taken place to give another 5-ring product: reflect on this.</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="../images/f0085-04.jpg" alt="image"></img></p>
<p class="noindent" id="ch09_n4"><a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Notes on the end of chapter problems</a> 4. This is a variant of Robinson&#x2019;s tropinone synthesis, in which a naturally occurring complex ring system was prepared under very mild conditions from rather simple precursors, mimicking the biosynthetic process. The dimethoxytetrahydrofuran starting material is a double acetal and is easily hydrolysed under acidic conditions to succindialdehyde. Two Mannich reactions follow, and the synthesis is completed by loss of the two carboxyl groups, both of which are <em>&#x03B2;</em> to a ketone carbonyl.</p>
