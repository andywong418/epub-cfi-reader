<p class="noindent">Nitrogen stands beside oxygen in the periodic table, so NH<sub>3</sub> and &#x007E;NH<sub>2</sub> can be regarded as structural analogues of water and alcohols, respectively. The reversible reaction of &#x007E;NH<sub>2</sub> with an aldehyde or ketone is very similar to that of water, involving as it does nucleophilic addition followed by dehydration. A general mechanism can be outlined as shown below.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondary amines R<sub>2</sub>NH are intrinsically just as nucleophilic as primary amines RNH<sub>2</sub>. They react with aldehydes and ketones similarly, except that the final stage is blocked because there is no proton to discard, so iminium ions&#x2014;intermediates in enamine formation (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec_4.4">Section 4.4</a>) and in the Mannich reaction (see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sec_9.3">Section 9.3</a>)&#x2014;are generated.</p>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps the best-known reactions of the above type are those of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, semicarbazide, and hydroxylamine with aldehydes and ketones, which give 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones, semi-carbazones, and oximes, respectively. These derivatives (Fig. 4.1) which</p>

They have been valued for the identification of aldehydes and ketones since the early days of organic chemistry. The case of acetoxime formation has been thoroughly studied, and is instructive. The rate of the reaction depends critically on the pH. A graph of rate versus pH has a bell-shaped profile characteristic of many reactions in this class.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to function as a nitrogen nucleophile, and to attack generating the tetrahedral intermediate, the hydroxylamine reagent must be present in the free base form, the concentration of which is lower the lower the pH. At low pH, the formation of the tetrahedral adduct is rate-determining. On the other hand, the dehydration of the tetrahedral intermediate to give the oxime product is acid-catalysed, and is therefore slow and rate-determining at high pH.</p>

<p class="indent">The two opposing trends reach an optimum compromise at intermediate pH, when there is both enough neutral nucleophile for the first stage to generate a supply of the tetrahedral intermediate and a <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter4 Reactions of amino compounds with aldehydes and ketones</a>sufficient concentration of protons for effective catalysis of its dehydration in the second stage.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>N</i>-Monosubstituted hydroxylamines also react as nitrogen nucleophiles with aldehydes and ketones, but in this case the tetrahedral adducts dehydrate to give nitrones (azomethine <i>N</i>-oxides).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Reactions of ammonia and primary amines with aldehydes and ketones</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Ammonia itself and primary aliphatic amines react with aliphatic aldehydes and ketones to give imines as shown in section 4.1, but further reaction usually takes place. Treatment of formaldehyde with ammonia, for example, gives hexamethylene tetramine.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0031-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Aromatic aldehydes and ketones give isolable but still quite reactive imines with primary aliphatic amines. Their greater stability is due to the conjugation of the carbon-nitrogen double bond with the aromatic ring.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0031-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">If an intramolecular hydrogen bond is present, as in imines derived from salicylaldehyde, this further stabilizes the system.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter4 Reactions of amino compounds with aldehydes and ketones</a></p>
<p class="indent">Aromatic primary amines also condense to give imines (sometimes called anils) which are stabilized by delocalization.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0032-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">An imine is a planar polarized functionality like a carbonyl group. It reacts analogously towards nucleophiles, especially if acidic catalysis is available to assist by pulling electron density through nitrogen.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0032-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Imines are, for example, quite easily hydrolysed by reversal of the equilibria involved in their formation, and the reactions of aldehydes and ketones with cyanide, bisulfite, complex metal hydrides, Grignard reagents, etc all have parallels in the chemistry of imines. Of particular value are the so-called reductive alkylation procedures, in which ammonia or an amine and an aldehyde or ketone are brought together in reducing conditions, so that the imine which is formed is converted immediately to an <i>N</i>-alkyl derivative.</p>
<p class="indent">The Leuckart reaction, for example, yields amines when aldehydes or ketones are heated with ammonium formate. The reductive stage involves hydride transfer.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">
 <img src="../images/f0032-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Eschweiler&#x2013;Clarke procedure for the <i>N</i>-methylation of secondary amines is closely related to the Leuckart reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter4 Reactions of amino compounds with aldehydes and ketones</a> Here there is a very electrophilic iminium ion intermediate, which is reduced by hydride transfer from formate.</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium cyanoborohydride is an elegant reagent for reductive alkylation. It works as a reducing agent like NaBH<sub>4</sub> but the cyanide ligand gives the complex anion greater kinetic stability, and it can be used in the pH range 5&#x2013;6, which are favourable conditions for imine formation. Mixing an aldehyde or ketone with an appropriate alkylamine at that pH in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride thus gives an alkylated amine directly, in a single operation, as shown below.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Here, as with all reductive alkylation procedures applied to primary amines, the secondary amine produced may react further with the starting carbonyl compound, to give, after reduction of the iminium ion, a tertiary amine. Excess ammonia or amine must be used if conversion is to be held back to the secondary amine stage.</p>

<p class="noindent">If an aldehyde or ketone which has <i>&#x03B1;</i>-CH reacts with a secondary amine, the iminium ion produced sheds that proton reversibly, giving an enamine.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">In this procedure, as modified by Huang Minion, aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alkanes by heating with hydrazine and strong alkali in diethylene or triethylene glycol, as in the marginal example. The high- <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter4 Reactions of amino compounds with aldehydes and ketones</a>boiling (b.p. 285 &#x00B0;C) solvent enables high temperatures to be attained. Water is driven off as the reaction proceeds. The hydrazone which is formed under these conditions tautomerizes before loss of N2 to give a carbanion, and thence the alkane product.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:5em;margin-top:1.2em;">

</figure>
<p class="noindent">The carbanion intermediate is remarkable because it is not stabilized by delocalization. The elevated temperatures obviously help the formation of this high-energy species, but the principal driving force is probably the release of N<sub>2</sub>, which is the most stable diatomic molecule known.</p>

<p class="noindent">Imine formation is also at the heart of a number of important biochemical processes involving pyridoxal-5-phosphate, including transamination, a stage in the degradation of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino acids. Transamination results overall in loss of the amino group by transfer to <i>&#x03B1;</i>-ketoglutaric acid, giving an <i>&#x03B1;</i>-keto acid and glutamic acid.</p>
