<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1&#160;&#160;Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Three-dimensional (3-D) networks are the toughest and most rigid materials, since the polymer chains are linked together in all directions to give effectively a single giant molecule. Stone is a natural inorganic ionic-linked 3-D network, whereas polymer 3-D networks are generally held together by covalent bonds. The bridging units are called cross-links and, while in the previous two chapters it has been convenient to divide linear polymers mechanistically into chain- and step-growth types, networks can be hybrids, employing either or both systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Only relatively few cross-links per chain are needed to provide a useful material, since too many cross-links produces a brittle powder under internal stress. If the material requires a particular shape for an application then this must be done before the final cross-linking takes place because, once &#x2018;set&#x2019; into its final form, the cross-linked polymer can only be sawn or cut into shape. Three-dimensional networks do not melt, although segments may go through phase changes with temperature. They are insoluble, although lightly cross-linked ones can be solvent-swollen. They are therefore prepared in two stages, the first giving a processable intermediate that becomes the intractable final product in the second one. These principles are demonstrated for several systems, including Bakelite (phenol&#x2013;formaldehyde polymers) (which is fully step-growth) and fibre glass (linear unsaturated polyesters) (which is a step-growth backbone with chain polymer cross-links), and also the vulcanization of rubber (which is a chain polymer backbone with chain cross-links). Polymers which set hard after heating, usually because of a thermal cross-linking reaction, are called thermosets.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2">
<h2 class="h2"><b>5.2&#160;&#160;Formaldehyde (methanal) systems</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">This is the oldest fully artificial polymer system, produced by Leo Baekeland in 1907 and known as Bakelite, although the reaction of phenol with aldehydes had been studied earlier. In a successful marketing ploy Bakelite was patented as &#x2018;fireproof celluloid&#x2019; to capitalize on the dangerous flammability of the existing material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Two procedures may be followed, which lead to an intermediate soluble and fusible (meltable) resin by attack of a phenol-derived species on the carbonyl-derived species. Baekeland&#x2019;s original base-catalyzed technique is called the Resol process, while the newer acid-catalyzed Novolak process is widely used. Both processable intermediate resins are converted to the final cross-linked solid by acid-catalyzed second stages.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The chemistry of <b>Resol resins</b> involves attack of the phenolate anion upon the polar carbonyl group in the aldehyde as shown in <a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>. The next steps <a id="page_112" class="page">Page 112, Three-dimensional networks</a>involve nucleophilic displacement of hydroxy from the hydroxymethyl group, which can lead to either methylene bridges between rings or ether linkages between rings.</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The opportunities for cross-linking occur because phenol can react at ortho and para positions and the whole point of the two-stage process is to limit the first stage of reaction to avoid insoluble gel formation. There is an excess of methanal in the mixture so the end-groups in the intermediate resin are CH<sub>2</sub>OH, and conditions are controlled to avoid over-reaction. A sketch of possible resin structure is shown in <a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>. To form the final 3-D network in a separate second step the processable resin is made slightly acid and heated to 150 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<p class="noindent">(mass spectroscopy, etc.) are ineffective. Thus chemical reactions in these 3-D networks are not known with certainty. The acid-catalyzed processes that may occur in phenol-methanal systems are shown in <a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a> for the <b>Novolak</b> process, where excess phenol is used in the starting mixture.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This gives an intermediate resin of possible structure shown in <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>. With all methanal consumed the end-groups cannot react further until a cross-linking agent is added, which is a benefit of the Novalak system since different species such as hexamethylene tetramine, itself made separately from methanal and ammonia (<a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>), can be used instead of simply adding more methanal. This can be used to affect final properties.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenol&#x2013;formaldehyde resins are chemically stable to all but strong oxidizing acids, although they are more easily attacked by bases. They have good electrical insulation properties and were once ubiquitous as the brown-coloured electrical plugs and adaptors since they are easily processed into complex shapes. They also form laminates and composites with many materials and <a id="page_114" class="page">Page 114, Three-dimensional networks</a>fillers, particularly cellulose-based biorenewable materials such as wood, cotton, fabric or paper. These composites are tough and have tensile strengths in excess of 40 MPa.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Other methanal&#x2013;amine resins</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The basis of the phenol&#x2013;methanal chemistry described above is acid- or base-catalyzed attack of a nucleophile upon the carbonyl group of methanal. Phenol can be replaced as a nucleophile by a reactive amide or polyfunctional amine, which produces a similar network system. These are two main examples: urea&#x2013;methanal and melamine polymers, although other systems such as urea&#x2013;casein have also been used commercially.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Urea&#x2013;methanal</i></p>
<p class="noindent">It was known in the 1880s that urea reacts with methanal (formaldehyde) to give resins, but moulding systems required the development of acidic accelerators in the 1930s. The present material is used in electrical fittings, caps for plastic bottles and other rigid mouldings, as well as adhesives and coatings (in versions with lower RMM), while cellulose compatibility has resulted in large scale use onwards from the 1950s in reconstituted wood products, particularly chipboard. Another use, in a foamed form as &#x2018;cavity wall insulation&#x2019;, started in the 1960s, but is decreasing because of concerns over slow release of methanal from the <i>in situ</i> prepared foams. Factory-prepared materials are less affected, since devolatization (accelerated removal of volatile species) occurs during the high-temperature processing of most polymers (e.g. during extrusion, moulding, etc.).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Urea (made from ammonia and carbon dioxide at 200 &#x00B0;C and 300 atmospheres) is heated with methanal (as aqueous formalin) in first mildly alkaline then acidic conditions. The two-step reaction system goes via a low-RMM resin (itself a useful adhesive), before finally the 3-D network is formed as represented in <a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A useful example of industrial fine-tuning of a process is that resin stability and miscibility can be altered by end-capping with an alcohol, as shown in <a href="#fig_5.7">Fig. 5.7</a> for butanol capping.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Urea&#x2013;methanal resins are tough (&gt; 50 MPa tensile strength when filled with cellulose or glass) and, unlike the phenol analogues, may be produced in a range of colours. A useful feature of many polymer applications is that uniform coloration may be maintained throughout the bulk of an article. So whereas wood, for example, is painted on the surface and rapidly shows up scratches and abrasions, a plastic chair does not do so.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Melamine</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This methanal-based system has a surface energy such that it is stain-resistant, particularly to tea, coffee and foodstuffs, and it thus became popular in the 1950s as a coating material in the catering industry. It is also easy to colour, with good thermal and chemical stability and is used as domestic mouldings in tableware, handles for irons and other decorative consumer products.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Melamine is the trivial name for a cyanuric derivative. This class of compound contains a six-membered carbon&#x2013;nitrogen ring that has some similarities to benzene. Other derivatives are widely employed, e.g. triallylcyanurate (TAC) (cf. <a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>). These compounds may look complicated, but they are readily formed by trimerization of species obtained from starting materials that are already available to polymer companies. Thus for melamine there is dehydration of urea and trimerization of the resultant cyanamide, as shown in <a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">If melamine is considered as a sophisticated variant of R&#x2013;NH<sub>2</sub> then chemistry with methanal via methyl derivatives, onwards through methylene bridges and ether bridges can easily be envisaged. The practical process is in two steps, first heating to 80 &#x00B0;C in mild alkali (aqueous carbonate) with an excess of methanal over melamine to give the intermediate resin as a syrup, followed by heating at a higher temperature to give the solid network. Butanol can also be employed to alter properties, particularly for surface coatings, in a similar manner to urea&#x2013;methanal systems.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Finally, a further variation on methanal-based networks was described in the 1890s and become popular in the 1930s (as as &#x2018;Erinoid&#x2019;) for buttons, door handles and other decorative coloured articles with a shiny finish. This was manufactured by reaction of methanal with casein, which is a protein found in milk. This demonstrates a useful hybrid between an artificial component and a <a id="page_116" class="page">Page 116, Three-dimensional networks</a>readily available natural material. In the early 1900s polymers became popular for decorative items, replacing tortoiseshell, ivory, horn, and stones, for example as &#x2018;artificial jade&#x2019;. The control of shape by processing allowed many novel items to be made.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.3&#160;&#160;Linear unsaturated polyesters (&#x2018;fibreglass&#x2019;)</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">A processable polyester chain with a relatively low RMM (a step-growth resin) with double bonds deliberately placed in the backbone can be subsequently cross-linked to a 3-D network by chain polymer chemistry, as shown schematically in <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This type of polyester, and the great strength enhancement due to glass-fibre reinforcement, resulted in Fibreglass becoming commercially available on a wide scale in the 1950s leading to usage as large-scale mouldings for boat hulls, lorry (truck) cabs, car bodies, roofing panels and other structural components, as well as the familiar fibreglass bodywork repair kits for cars.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The polyester backbone needs components that are internally compatible and also compatible with the alkene derivative later used for cross-linking. Unsaturated diols are more expensive than unsaturated acid derivatives, so the normal system is to use propylene glycol (propane, 1,2 diol) in which the methyl group produces greater organic compatibility and is also necessary to limit crystallinity, since the highly ordered crystallinate regions would hinder thorough microscopic mixing between components of the two-part cure system. The unsaturation is in the acid derivative. Maleic acid is readily available. The anhydride is preferred because this reacts to give the two ester linkages with the expulsion of only one molecule of water (which must be removed to drive over the equilibrium). In addition, the anhydride is more reactive than the acid, to help the first step, although the second step is normal esterification of an acid group as shown in <a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>. (This is a general feature of nucleophilic attack upon anhydrides, and also applies in reactions leading to polyamides and other polymers. See, for example, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig_4.27">Fig. 4.27</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A saturated acid derivative is present to limit the available double bond sites to avoid over cross-linking. For economic reasons and for compatibility in the mixture phthalic anhydride is often used.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Both the anhydrides are made by variants of a catalyzed industrial reaction that would not be employed in the small-scale science laboratory. For maleic <a id="page_117" class="page">Page 117, Three-dimensional networks</a>anhydride, benzene (cheap from petroleum) or more recently n-butane is directly oxidized with air (cheap) in the vapour phase at &#x2C;400 &#x00B0;C over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst (<a href="#fig_5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>). For phthalic anhydride aerial oxidation of xylene (previously naphthalene) is used (<a href="#fig_5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">The components are reacted together to give an oligomeric resinous polyester whose structure is represented in <a href="#fig_5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">After resin formation the cross-linking agent is then added for the second stage. Styrene can be used when the fibre glass is prepared and cured at the factory, but for applications where there are environmental concerns, a less volatile alkene such as diallylphthalate or TAC is used (<a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The cross-linking reaction is set off by a free radical initiator, such as benzoyl peroxide, which thermally decomposes to give aryloxy and then aryl radicals.

<p class="indent3-ka1">Accelerators are added to control peroxide breakdown. These are usually transition metal salts, usually of organic anions such as octoates or naphthenates for organic compatibility in the polymer matrix (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>). The colour of, for example, cobalt ions can be seen in two-part automobile bodywork repair kits. The ability to cross-link at room temperature is useful for these small-scale kits, while accelerators are also useful to avoid problems from differential heating from factory-prepared large items such as boat hulls.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A key aspect of fibre glass is the strength reinforcing effect of glass fibre, which is mixed in before final cure of the resin. Exact properties vary with the nature of the filler, as shown in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>, and needle-like particles have a better effect than spherical ones. Glass has hydroxy groups on its surface, and polyester systems seem particularly compatible (all fillers have compatibility requirements with the matrix polymer and choice of filler for any purpose can be a subject of some deliberation). Note the tremendous increase in strength in the glass-loaded systems. All entries in <a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a> concern the same composition of matrix polymer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Cured fibre glass is very strong, is mostly unaffected by reagents apart from strong alkalis and oxidizing agents, is moderately temperature-resistant, the good physical properties degrading above 100 &#x00B0;C (except in a temperature-resistant grade).</p>

<p class="noindent">This class of cross-linked coatings remains widely used and is based on glycerol as the alcohol component of a polyester. Glycerol is a triol and straightforward reaction with phthalic anhydride directly produces a cross-linked network. &#x2018;Glyptal&#x2019; resins, produced by General Electric in 1912, have a <a id="page_119" class="page">Page 119, Three-dimensional networks</a>typical structure as shown in <a href="#fig_5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>. An early use for this was bonding mica into sheets for electrical insulation, but in general these coatings were prone to over cross-linking since the system forms its cross-links during the chain-building esterification reaction.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A more sophisticated variant employs a two-stage process in which esterification gives a material which subsequently cross-links in a chain-growth reaction. This allows the processable resin intermediate to be manipulated before coming to a final intractable network, in a process analogous to that employed in fibre glass, but in this case the polyester chain is saturated and the alkene double bonds are in the pendant side chains. No extra cross-linking agent needs to be added, and &#x2018;alkyd&#x2019; resins were first produced in the 1930s to be widely used as coatings and particularly as paints. A schematic of the principle is given in <a href="#fig_5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Glycerol is found naturally as a triester containing some unsaturated acid groups and the triester is mixed with phthalic anhydride and free unsubstituted glycerol triol in correct proportions. Transesterification (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) &#x2018;scrambles&#x2019; the acid-derived side chains to give a resin with some saturated and some unsaturated side chains attached to each triol unit. The resin is dispersed in a solvent and kept hermetically sealed in a tin but, once painted onto a surface and the solvent allowed to evaporate, oxygen from the air can attack the alkene groups and cause cross-linking. Only a low cross-link density is needed for the paint to set. It is now irreversibly altered and will not redissolve in the original solvent.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Hydrogen abstraction, disproportionation and other free-radical and auto-oxidation processes occur so that even saturated pendant chains can become involved in the cure, and catalysts and accelerators may be added for enhancement.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">As always with modern commercial processes there has been significant development and the &#x2018;accelerated sulphur vulcanization&#x2019; system now used is significantly more complex than simply heating rubber with sulphur to 150 &#x00B0;C, where reaction is relatively slow. The &#x2018;accelerators&#x2019; are sulphur-containing compounds such as mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) or other molecules such as diphenylguanidine (DPG) (<a href="#fig_5.18">Fig. 5.18</a>), together with an &#x2018;activator&#x2019; which is a mixture of zinc oxide and a surfactant for compatibility. Other additives such as carbon black (for car tyres) may be necessary for the application. All components are blended together and heated. Details of the chemistry are not all understood, but this does not detract from the continuing practical use of this technologically important process.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">As in all networks the degree of cross-linking affects pliability and physical properties, and highly cross-linked vulcanised rubber gives the tough rigid material &#x2018;ebonite&#x2019; (&#x2018;vulcanite&#x2019;).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chloroprene (poly 2-chloro 1,3-butadiene) and chlorosulphonated polyethene</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Chloroprene is an artificial rubber where the methyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>). The electronegative chlorine interferes so that the reaction with sulphur is ineffective. Instead the term vulcanization is used for cross-linking of this material by heating with zinc and magnesium oxides. The chemistry is complex but rearrangements and chlorine removal lead to ether cross-links. A similar strategy works for other halogenated polymers such as chlorosulphonated polyethene elastomers.</p>

<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:3em;"><b>Silicones</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These are step-growth polymers but the term vulcanization is applied to their cross-linking reactions, which are shown in <a href="#fig_5.19">Fig. 5.19</a>. These are often two-part systems and are effective at room temperature. Thus if a siloxane copolymer with a reactive Si&#x2013;H bond is mixed with a hydroxy-ended analogue, hydrogen is evolved and the chains are joined. Alternatively, two silanol-ended chains are reacted with an alkoxysilane to join the chains (shown for dialkoxy, but tri-and tetra-alkoxy give more opportunities for cross-linking), while a useful one-part silicone vulcanization system involves protecting the silanol as an acetoxysilane ester. This is stable until exposed to moisture whereupon Si&#x2013;OH groups are liberated to join chains by directly attacking other acetoxysilane groups.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.6&#160;&#160;Other chemically cured network systems</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There is a wealth of chemistry available for the formation of cross-links in polymer systems. It is worth mentioning a number of systems widely used as tough coatings; these include thermosetting acrylics and epoxies (also used as adhesives), as well as photocured systems.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Thermosetting acrylics/epoxies</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The oxirane ring (epoxide) is readily opened by a nucleophile. This is the basis of epoxyresin adhesives and is shown schematically in <a href="#fig_5.20">Fig. 5.20</a>. Adhesives involve the joining together of resinous components, to give final structures with high RMM, and reaction may occur at end-groups or at trifunctional junction points in mid-chain.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Epoxy resins</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The epoxy species can be added to a step-growth polymer by reaction of epichlorohydrin with bisphenol A as shown in <a href="#fig_5.21">Fig. 5.21</a>. This gives epoxy-ended polyether chains with hydroxyalkyl internal units from ring opening of the oxirane. The epoxyether end-groups are called &#x2018;glycidyl&#x2019; units in the industry. Epoxy resins were produced by CIBA&#x2013;Geigy in 1943 and are usually cured by a polyfunctional amine or an anhydride as nucleophile. Again the practical system involves promoters, accelerators and other additives.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Thermosetting acrylics</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Here an all-chain polymer system is used, often a tri-block copolymer containing a strength-conferring section (acrylonitrile, styrene, methyl methacrylate), a more flexible unit (ethyl or butyl acrylate esters), and a unit with necessary functionality (acrylic acid for COOH, hydroxyethyl acrylate [&#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH] for pendant hydroxy groups, or glycidyl acrylate which contains the oxirane ring). Depending on the structure of the tri-block these can either self-react upon heating or else additional cross-linking agents (epoxy-ended resins for nucleophilic chains, or polyfunctional amines <a id="page_123" class="page">Page 123, Three-dimensional networks</a>appropriately) are used to facilitate the cure. Tough resilient coatings are obtained.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Photocured acrylics</i></p>
<p class="noindent">These have biomedical applications, for example as the white plastic fillings for teeth used in dentistry. Photochemical reaction of activated alkenes was shown as long ago as the 1830s (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#Ch01">Chapter 1</a>) and has the benefit that initiation is detached from the thermal conditions of the system. Development effort has produced acrylic/urethane composite resins for better properties and biocompatibility and dangerous ultraviolet radiation has been replaced by blue visible light.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.7&#160;&#160;Electron beam cross-linking</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">A high-energy electron beam induces reactivity upon striking a polymer in air. In particular free radical-type processes can occur, leading to cross-linking of a saturated chain without need for deliberate introduction of chemically reactive sites.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This was exploited commercially in the 1950s by Raychem, who targeted electrical wiring for aircraft as a specific market. Previously plastic insulation had been relatively heavy and unwieldy, and electron beam cross-linking shrank the plastic down so that better insulation was obtained from lighter and tougher coatings, an immediate benefit given the extensive amounts of wiring in an aeroplane. Passing wire at speed through the beam allowed kilometre-scale lengths to be easily processed.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A further development by this company was &#x2018;heat-shrink&#x2019; plastics. It was found that the low levels of cross-linking desirable for most applications of polymer networks do not greatly affect phase changes in the sections between cross-links (though the concept of melting point is not directly applicable). If, therefore, a moulded object is exposed to an electron beam, and is then heated above its glass transition temperature (<i>T<sub>g</sub></i>), stretched and rapidly quenched by cooling, it remains &#x2018;frozen&#x2019; in an expanded form. Subsequent heating above <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> will cause the article to snap back into the original shape it had when it was exposed to the beam. This allows, for example, telephone splice cases to be fitted in the expanded form, then heated to shrink to the exact dimensions around a wiring junction. Other connectors can be protected in a similar way.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A number of chemical processes can occur in the electron beam and a wide range of polymers, both chain-and step-growth, will react, the exceptions being polymers containing aromatic rings or other extended conjugation systems, where beam energy becomes dissipated with loss of effect.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Cross-linking by X-rays and <i>&#x03B3;</i> radiation is also feasible, though it is expensive and subject to regulatory control because of the use of radioactivity.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.8&#160;&#160;Physical cross-linking</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Network systems tend to be thermosets, in which a cure produces new covalent chemical bonds to link chains permanently, but there are also physical methods of cross-linking that are reversible. To some extent all <a id="page_124" class="page">Page 124, Three-dimensional networks</a>thermoplastics (tough when cold, fluid when hot) behave as a result of physical interactions between their long chains, but there are some more specific systems. For example, ionic bonds between pendant acid groups on a polymer (e.g. polyacrylic acid) and a polyvalent metal cation will hold chains together, particularly in a low dielectric environment that promotes ion-pairing.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polar forces are also important and edible jelly is held together by sufficiently strong hydrogen bonds in a gelatin matrix such that water in quantities many times the mass of the matrix can be trapped in the gel which still feels relatively dry to the touch.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A neat example of physical cross-linking is found in block copolymers that have one section amorphous and another section crystalline, such as styrene-ethene copolymers. In this case, in the solid the crystalline regions contain many chains fitted into regular arrays and held tight together in a microcrystallite, while the amorphous regions are disordered and allow some chain motion. Such polymers can also trap solvents in the amorphous regions to become gels. However, when heated above the melting point of the crystal region the polymer immediately flows giving a reversible cure on cooling down again.</p>
