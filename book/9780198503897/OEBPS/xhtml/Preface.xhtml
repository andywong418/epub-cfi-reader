<p class="fmnoindent" style="margin-top:-1em;">Polymers are the archetypal modern materials, and they have transformed the world in which we live. This Primer covers the span of polymer types and their uses, starting from natural polymers, with a review of polymer history, followed by discussion of the statistical nature of polymer chains, from which originates their physical properties, and in particular the ease of processing that allows the production of complex shapes, which is a great benefit in technology. The main polymer types are discussed in detail, with emphasis upon practical commercial considerations and description of real industrial processes. The behaviour of polymer networks is explained, and finally the modern importance of functional polymers is discussed, in which a property in addition to great molecular size is exploited, for example electrical conductivity. It is intended that the reader will gain an overview of key aspects of this important class of compounds.</p>
