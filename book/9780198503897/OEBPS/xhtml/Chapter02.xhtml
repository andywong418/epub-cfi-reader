<h2 class="h2"><b>2.1&#160;&#160;Molar mass</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Typically vinyl polymers (from chain polymerization of alkenes) have molar masses (RMMs) in the range of 10<sup>5</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>6</sup> whereas typical step-growth condensation polymers (e.g. polyamides or polyesters) may be as low as 15 000&#x2013;20 000. The techniques most commonly used to determine polymer RMM include end-group analysis, osmometry, light scattering, ultracentrifugation, sedimentation, viscometry and chromatography. However, most of these involve rather lengthy procedures and in practice molar masses are obtained from high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) or viscosity measurements. It is important to recognize that the fundamental measurements of molar mass must be performed on dilute solutions so that intermolecular interactions can be ignored.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Number average molar mass</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>End-group analysis</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The number average molar mass <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mover accent='true'><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy='true'>&#x00AF;</mo></mover></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> can be measured for any polymer which has an end-group that can be determined by physical or chemical means. However, it must be remembered that the concentration of end-groups in a polymer is low and this will set a practical (experimental) limit to the measurement. Take for example an unsaturated polyester as used in the manufacture of fibre and film reinforcement which is usually of fairly low molecular weight and is hardened by subsequent chemical reactions (i.e. cross- linked) (see &#x2018;fibreglass&#x2019; <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>). To determine <i>M<sub>n</sub></i> one can titrate the terminal COOH and then determine the moles of polymer per gram using <a href="#eqn_2.1">eqn 2.1</a> and then apply <a href="#eqn_2.2">eqn 2.2</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In simple terms osmosis can be compared to diffusion except that in diffusion movement takes place from high to low pressure (or concentration), whereas in osmosis movement takes place from a region of high chemical potential (pure solvent) to one of lower chemical potential (solution) through a membrane. In practical terms the experiment is easier to perform by applying a<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Polymer properties and characterization</a>pressure to the solution compartment of the cell to stop the osmotic action. Osmotic pressure (&#x220F;) is related to the polymer solution concentration (<i>c</i>) and molar mass <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mover accent='true'><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy='true'>&#x00AF;</mo></mover></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> by the Van&#x2019;t Hoff equation (<a href="#eqn_2.3">eqn 2.3</a>)</p>

<p class="noindent">This technique is most useful for molecular masses below 25 000. The principle is analogous to membrane osmometry although there is no membrane. A drop of solvent and a drop of solution are placed by syringe on matched thermistors in an insulated chamber saturated with solvent vapour.

<p class="indent3-ka1">Experimentally the temperature change (&#x0394;<i>T</i>) is measured by the change in resistance between the two thermistors (&#x0394;<i>R = k<sub>R</sub></i> &#x0394;<i>T</i>) for a series of solution concentrations (<i>c</i>, g/dm<sup>3</sup>).

<p class="indent3-ka1">Experimentally, the ratio of intensity of scattered light (<i>i<sub>&#x03B8;</sub></i>) to the intensity of incident light (<i>I<sub>&#x03B8;</sub></i>) is measured at a particular distance (<i>r</i>) from, and at an angle <i>&#x03B8;</i> to the source.

It is based upon the principle that molecules, under the influence of a strong centrifugal field (several thousand times the acceleration due to gravity), distribute themselves according to size perpendicularly to the axis of rotation. The progress of the solute under the influence of the field can be followed optically and allows measurement of the sedimentation velocity, which in turn allows the deduction (<a href="#eqn_2.10">eqn 2.10</a>) of the sedimentation constant (<i>s</i>), a parameter necessary for the determination of the molar mass (<a href="#eqn_2.12">eqn 2.12</a>).</p>

The polymer solution is injected into a solvent stream which flows through a column packed with a highly porous material which separates the polymer molecules according to their size (size exclusion chromatography, SEC). The small molecules enter the pores and are retarded relative to the larger one. Detection of the polymer in the eluant is usually by either refractive index (RI) or ultraviolet/visible spectroscopic detectors. The instrument needs to be calibrated with samples of known RMM. This can sometimes be problematic if a polymer of a new type is being studied because available standard RMM samples may be from a different polymer type. Polystyrene is most often used as standard. Ideally, the standard samples should be from the same polymer as the test sample.</p>

Viscometry operates on the principle that on dissolution in a solvent, a polymer molecule increases its dimensions and becomes more viscous and hence the slower its movement or flow. Take, for example, the addition of methyl cellulose (wall paper paste) to water &#x2014; there is a considerable increase in viscosity.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">In <a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>, the monomer is a substituted (vinyl) alkene, CH<sub>2</sub> = CHX, exemplified for X = Cl, and the groups <img src="../images/page31-6.jpg" alt="images"/>, <b>H</b> and <b>X</b> of the polymer radical are arranged trigonally (120&#x00B0;) around the carbon radical (C<sup><img src="../images/bull.jpg" alt="images"/></sup>) such that attack from the incoming monomer can either be from the front or the back,<a id="page_32" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 32, Polymer properties and characterization</a>giving rise to three different spatial arrangements called atactic (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>), syndiotactic (<a href="#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>), and isotactic (<a href="#fig_2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>). These are best seen from Fischer projections of the chain.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">For maximum crystallinity, polymer molecules, similar to small molecules (e.g. iodine), should be composed of arrangements or structures which can pack easily, i.e. isotactic or syndiotactic. However, some atactic polymers are also able give crystalline polymers, the best example being linear (non- branched) polythene which can pack in the solid lattice in a similar regular manner to small molecule material (<a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">It is also possible to get close packing in an atactic straight chain macromolecule even when some groups are larger than H. For example, in atactic polyvinylalcohol the hydroxy group is small enough for the polymer to pack into a lattice and a crystalline material results.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, the majority of polymers are unlikely to produce straight chains naturally, unless the macromolecule is stretched, as it might be in an elastic band, <a id="page_33" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 33, Polymer properties and characterization</a>so that the likelihood of having 100% crystallinity is very low. Macromolecules are more likely to be coiled like cooked spaghetti and therefore the chances of close packing, and hence crystallization, are lessened. Any material with regular arrays can form crystalline regions, so isotactic and syndiotactic versions of chain-growth polymers are expected to be more crystalline in general. (In practice all vinyl polymer samples are either mixtures of isotactic and atactic molecules or mixtures of syndiotactic and atactic molecules. It is these differences in structure which dictate the extent of crystallinity or non-crystallinity (e.g. amorphous nature) found in a polymer.) The degree of ordering or crystallinity in a polymer can affect physical and mechanical properties, and control of structure is an important aspect of commercial polymerization procedures.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Most polymers tend not crystallize on cooling, instead they vitrify to produce a glass-like solid. To illustrate the significance of crystallization on vitrification, consider the volume&#x2013;temperature curve for a low molecular weight compound such as glycerine (<a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">At high temperature (A), the glycerine is a somewhat viscous liquid. As the temperature is reduced the volume contracts in an approximately linear fashion until the melting point (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) is reached. At this point (B), isothermal crystallization occurs as more heat is removed. As crystallization proceeds, a sharp drop in volume accompanies it (B&#x2013;E). When crystallization is complete, the temperature can fall again with thermal contraction of the crystalline solid (E&#x2013;F).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">On the other hand, no crystallization may occur. Glycerine is quite viscous at its melting point (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) and nucleation of the solid phase is slow. If no nuclei <a id="page_34" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 34, Polymer properties and characterization</a>are present, the glycerine may simply continue to cool as a (metastable) supercooled liquid (B&#x2013;C) until such time as the viscosity is so high that flow is negligible (C&#x2013;D). Below point C, the material is referred to as a &#x2018;glass&#x2019; or a &#x2018;glassy solid&#x2019;. Structurally, it is amorphous just as a liquid is but mechanically it acts as a solid. The temperature at which this occurs is called the <b>glass transition</b> temperature and is given the symbol <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> is as important a parameter in polymer technology as is the melting temperature, <i>T<sub>m</sub></i>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">For the final type of isomerism, geometric isomerism, to occur in a polymer the chain must contain double bonds. This is most commonly found where the initial monomer contains two double bonds (i.e. is a diene) so that on polymerization the chain still contains unreacted double bonds. Isoprene is an example (<a href="#fig_2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>). The trans form packs better giving greater crystallinity and hence a harder rubber. It should also be noted that dienes can polymerise through one of the single double bonds (i.e. acting as a simple vinyl monomer) thereby giving rise to the various tacticities discussed above. For isoprene, the methyl group makes the carbons non-equivalent. Thus the 1,2 and 3,4 polymers may be represented in <a href="#fig_2.7">Figs 2.7</a>, <a href="#fig_2.8">2.8</a> and <a href="#fig_2.9">2.9</a> by replacing Cl with &#x2013;CH=CH<sub>2</sub> (for the 1,2 polymer) and &#x2013;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)=CH<sub>2</sub> (for the 3,4 polymer). For butadiene with no methyl groups, both vinyl polymer forms are the same (see page 81).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The glass transition temperature</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">It has been shown previously that some liquids may be supercooled to form glasses (<a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>) without crystallization taking place as the temperature is lowered. In such materials, the viscosity (equal to the shear stress/velocity gradient) changes at so great a rate that over a small temperature interval the character of the material changes from a liquid to a rigid solid or glass. In fact for some polymers, in going from a liquid polymer melt or rubber to a rigid glass, the Young&#x2019;s Modulus (stress/strain) &#x2014; a measure of the material&#x2019;s strength &#x2014; may change by a factor of 1000. This change is now known to take place at the glass transition temperature, (<i>T<sub>g</sub></i> (see <a href="#sec_2.6">Section 2.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">While the melting point of a polymer (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) represents a true phase change from solid to liquid and is governed by the laws of thermodynamics, the nature of the glass transition is not completely understood and is termed a second-order phase change since both phases before and after <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> are solids. However, since all polymers have glass transitions which affect the mechanical properties, it is convenient to treat the phenomenon as a true transition.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Glass transition temperatures can be determined by many experimental techniques, but traditionally, they are determined from the change in volume of the material as a function of temperature (e.g. <a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Knowledge of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> value allows the generalization that a material with a <i>T<sub>g</sub> above</i> room temperature is a plastic (i.e. it is rigid at room temperature) whereas a material with a Tg <i>below</i> room temperature is a rubber (i.e. it is flexible at room temperature).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Perhaps the best example of this phenomenon is the cooling of a rubber tube in liquid nitrogen. At room temperature the tube is flexible and elastic yet after several seconds of being immersed in liquid nitrogen it is stiff and brittle and can even be splintered into fragments with a hammer blow. This cannot be done if the tube is struck with the hammer at room temperature, where the energy of the blow is simply absorbed by polymer chain movement. The hammer rebounds from the rubbery solid. At a low temperature the chains cannot rotate or move and the impact breaks bonds in the polymer structure.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another good example of the importance of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> can be underlined by considering polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (wet look, simulated leather) boots. These boots have a <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> of about +70 &#x00B0;C and are rigid and stiff at room temperature (25 &#x00B0;C) and are therefore impractical as footwear. However, by the addition of a plasticizer (which is a small molecule compound which improves flexibility; see Section 2.4.3) or the use of a copolymer of PVC (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>), it is possible to lower the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> to approximately +10 &#x00B0;C, thereby increasing the flexibility at room temperature. Unfortunately, the loss of plasticizer or the wearing of the boots at the lower temperatures found in the winter (1&#x2013;2 &#x00B0;C) causes a return to rigidity with possibility of the material cracking.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In the absence of a plasticizer, <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> reflects inherent properties of the polymer chain in the solid. In the melt state any polymer molecule has both translational motion, in which the whole chain is moving, and chain segment movement, in which various sections (or segments) of the main chain of the polymer kink and unkink, with the rate of change of configuration being dependent upon the <a id="page_36" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 36, Polymer properties and characterization</a>temperature. To make sure that any macromolecule can undergo this internal movement there must be sufficient thermal energy to surmount the activation energy needed for the rotation around the chain bonds and also that there is a void or a hole in the total structure into which the particular segment of the chain can move. This is shown in <a href="#fig_2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>, where the void into which the illustrated 8-carbon atom segment of the chain can rotate is known as the free volume and is temperature-dependent, such that the higher the temperature the bigger the void. The movement of the chain segment also depends on whether the polymer molecule has pendant groups attached to the main chain (or is branched), since such molecules will need larger free volumes if they are to rotate. <a href="#fig_2.13">Fig. 2.13</a> also shows that long molecules are not usually found as straight chains, but are twisted and kinked and hence there is less possibility of them fitting closely together to give crystals. In fact, it is this coiled nature that gives rubbers their elastomeric properties, because they can stretch out to give elongated straight chain polymers.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 2.14</b> Effect of flexibility on glass transition temperature.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since most polymers find application as solids it is important that the structural factors affecting the magnitude of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> are recognized and considered, since by doing so we can design molecules with appropriate temperature-dependence of properties.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Relation of glass transition to structure: factors affecting glass transition temperature</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Chain flexibility</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Chain flexibility is probably the most important factor in determining the magnitude of <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. A consideration of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> values for polythene and polycarbonate (<a href="#fig_2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>) can be rationalized in terms of increased rigidity of the chain, giving less opportunity for bond rotation and therefore an increase in <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, it is often difficult to separate the effect upon <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> of chain flexibility, compared to for example steric hindrance from the bulkiness of a side group.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Steric hindrance</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This effect can be best illustrated by comparing the methyl-substituted styrenes. Having the methyl group in the ortho position gives an increase in <i>T<sub>g</sub></i><a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Polymer properties and characterization</a>of 24 &#x00B0;C. This is because rotation of the back bone has been restricted, and <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> is increased as less &#x2018;cooling&#x2019; is required to &#x2018;freeze out&#x2019; motion. A similar comparison can be made for polymethylacrylate and polymethylmethacrylate (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 2.15</b> Effect of steric hindrance on glass transition temperature.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Side group effects</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Any increase in the size of the group usually also causes steric hindrance and results in an increase in <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. This is illustrated by comparing the series polythene, polypropene, polystyrene and polyvinylcarbazole in which the side groups are H, methyl, benzyl and carbazole (<a href="#fig_2.16">Fig. 2.16</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-5em;" id="fig_2.16">
 <img src="../images/page37-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:5em;"><b>Fig. 2.16</b> Rigid side groups effect on <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">However, <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> depends not only on the size of the side group but also on its flexibility. For instance, in the series of acrylates (<a href="#fig_2.17">Fig. 2.17</a>) the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> actually decreases as the side group gets larger.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-5em;" id="fig_2.17">
 <img src="../images/page37-3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:5em;"><b>Fig. 2.17</b> Flexible side groups.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The increased flexibility of the side group compensates for its increased size and gives a more flexible polymer (i.e. a lower <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> owing to an increase in the free volume). Such action is often referred to as internal plasticization.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Symmetry</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Any increase in symmetry lowers <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. Typical examples are asymmetric PVC and the symmetric analogue polyvinylidene chloride (PVC<sub>2</sub>) and, similarly, polypropene and polyisobutene (<a href="#fig_2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>). In both cases the increased number of side groups is more than compensated by the increased symmetry.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 2.19</b> Polarity effects on <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindentt">The most plausible explanation is a free-volume effect. Here the chains find it more difficult to pack, which leads to the presence of a larger free volume and therefore less thermal energy (i.e. lower temperature) is required to create sufficient free volume to allow chain rotation and hence flexibility.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Polarity</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Any increase in polarity (or cohesive energy density) has a tendency to raise the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. For example, non-polar polypropene has a <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> below room temperature, moderately polar PVC has a <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> in excess of room temperature and highly polar polyacrylonitrile has a <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> in excess of 100 &#x00B0;C (<a href="#fig_2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>). The increase in <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> can be rationalized in terms of the increased amount of polar bonding which occurs between the chains as the methyl group is successively replaced by the chlorine and cyano groups, respectively, thereby giving stronger bonding and restricting rotation about the backbone.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In a similar manner, replacing the methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) group in polyisoprene by the polar chlorine atom group (Cl) in chloroprene raises the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> 25 &#x00B0;C from &#x2212;73 &#x00B0;C to &#x2212;50 &#x00B0;C (<a href="#fig_2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>). Again this increase is due to restriction of rotation and movement of individual atoms by polar bonding.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Crystallinity and melting point</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Examples of crystalline polymers are high-density polyethene (HDPE), isotactic polypropene, 6,6-nylon, and polyvinylidene chloride. Semi-crystalline polymers behave like mixtures of amorphous (<i>T</i><sub>g</sub>) and crystalline (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) material, i.e. the polymer melts over a temperature range rather than possesses a sharp melting point (<a href="#fig_2.21">Fig. 2.21</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are two useful empirical rules of thumb regarding crystalline polymers. The first relates the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> to the melting point. For an unsymmetrical polymer such as PVC, the ratio <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>/<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> &#x2245; 0.66, while for a symmetrical polymer such as polyvinylidene chloride ((poly(1,1 dichloroethene), PVC<sub>2</sub>) the ratio <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>/<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> &#x2245; 0.5, where <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> are in Kelvin. This identity seems to apply irrespective of whether polymers are chain-growth or step-growth. Thus for polyethylene terephthalate, which is unsymmetrical (<a href="#fig_2.23">Fig. 2.23</a>) and has a <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> of 267 &#x00B0;C (540 K), the predicted <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> of 87 &#x00B0;C compares favourably with the measured value of 80 &#x00B0;C. For polyvinylidene chloride the agreement is not quite as good, with a <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> of&#x2212;19 &#x00B0;C (254 K), giving a predicted <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> of 235 &#x00B0;C as compared to 190 &#x00B0;C. However, the pure homopolymer is relatively unstable which complicates the assessment of thermal behaviour.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1t" style="margin-top:1.5em;">The second rule predicts that molten polymers crystallize at maximum rate at a temperature of 0.9 of the <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> (expressed in Kelvin). With polymers which are difficult to crystallize, it is convenient to be able to estimate the temperature at which the material ought best to crystallize. For example, isotactic polystyrene melts at 235 &#x00B0;C and the maximum rate of crystallization occurs at 184 &#x00B0;C. These types of empirical rules are widely used in polymer processing.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The degree of crystallinity may be measured by a number of techniques: X- ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy or density measurements. X-ray is probably the most useful since the crystalline portions of the polymer produce sharp X-ray diffraction peaks while the amorphous region gives broad peaks (<a href="#fig_2.22">Fig. 2.22</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The degree of crystallinity is estimated from the relative areas under the two types of peak (i.e. percentage crystallinity is (A + B)/(A + B + C)).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Although the crystals melt over a temperature range, there is a temperature above which the crystalline form cannot exist. This is the melting point (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>).

<p class="noindent">Using polyethene, polypropene and polystyrene as examples (<a href="#fig_2.24">Fig. 2.24</a>), larger side groups increases <i>T<sub>m</sub></i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Higher <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> is representative of more crystallinity and better packing. What may be difficult to reconcile is that the introduction of a rigid phenyl ring has led to a higher melting point. In fact the rigid side groups produce repulsion and lead to a loss of planarity to give a helical structure having alternating trans and gauche positions along the polymer chain (<a href="#fig_2.25">Fig. 2.25</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, the results in <a href="#fig_2.24">Fig. 2.24</a> refer to stereoregular polymers and it is important to recognize that the atactic polymer would prevent the formation of a regular helix. Clearly stereochemistry affects <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> and regular isotactic and syndiotactic polymers are more crystalline than random (atactic) ones. An increase in flexibility of side group leads to a lowering of <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> (<a href="#fig_2.26">Fig. 2.26</a>); this is similar trend to the previously discussed effects on <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Symmetry effects</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Symmetrical molecules have higher melting points since they are more rod-like and are capable of rolling.

However, the meta-linked analogue would have a different shape when reversed. Thus a meta compound can gain more entropy (randomness) by becoming free to move and tends to melt at a lower temperature (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <i>High-performance Polymers</i>). This is the exact opposite to what was discussed for the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and is a fundamental difference between <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>m</sub></i>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Thus symmetry, flexibility, tacticity, and polarity alter <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> in the same sense, with only symmetry widening the gap between them. These parameters are important in applications such as clothes made from polymeric fibres. For example, it is preferable that a polymer has a <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> &gt; 200 &#x00B0;C so that a garment can be ironed without melting, but needs a <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> &lt; 300 &#x00B0;C to enable the fibre to be spun from the melt, whereas the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> should lie between 30 and 120 &#x00B0;C, which allows for permanent creases. Obviously a cloth softens when ironed at about 200 &#x00B0;C so that any creases or pleats made will be retained on cooling. Subsequent washing is normally carried out a temperature too low to resoften the polymer significantly and so destroy the pleats. This permanent pleat is a desirable feature of some clothing and is deliberately sought.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.4&#160;&#160;Polymer processing</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3">Polymer melts</h3>
<p class="noindent">The behaviour of polymer melts (rheology) is an important subject beyond the scope of this <i>Primer</i>, but it is important in controlling the choice of polymer processing conditions and therefore worthy of a brief description. In general, polymer melts (and also some solutions, particularly concentrated ones) can be non-Newtonian in behaviour; that is, the melt parameters are dependent upon shear rate or other stimuli. Although melt viscosity often decreases with shear force, it can increase if stress-induced crystallization occurs in the melt. Molar mass also affects melt behaviours since chain entanglements become more pronounced with greater chain length. Furthermore, although <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> is not pressure-sensitive, melt viscosity is significantly affected by pressure and this must be borne in mind when designing processing procedure. There is also a time-dependence of viscosity and a fluid whose viscosity varies with time under shear is called thixotropic. Many phenomena can also apply in reverse. For example, crystallization from the melt is time-dependent. Polymers do not simply crystallize as small-molecule compounds do; instead the chains fold over as sheets (lamellae) to give structures called spherulites (see Section 2.6.1).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>General processing techniques</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The convenient broad classification of polymers into thermoplastics, thermosets, and rubbers also defines their processing characteristics (<a href="#fig_2.29">Fig. 2.29</a>). Although this is a wide subject, some general points may be made.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;" id="fig_2.29"><a id="page_44" class="page" style="width:88.5%;">Page 44, Polymer properties and characterization</a>
 <img src="../images/page44-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 2.29</b> States of bulk polymers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1t" style="margin-top:1.5em;"><b>Thermoplastics</b> can be safely processed by melting and shaping the melt, after which cooling gives the final product. Scrap, such as reject mouldings, mould flash, etc., can be reprocessed by regrinding and repeating the process, although repeated processing may degrade the polymer chemically and special precautions in the form of antioxidants and heat stabilizing additives must be taken.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>Thermosets</b> will cure irreversibly during heating, usually because of chemical cross-linking (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>). Here heating must be the last stage of processing and the process must be designed to ensure that shaping is complete before the irreversible chemical reaction has occurred. It is not usually necessary to cool the finished product before removal from the mould.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>Rubbers</b> are processed in the rubbery state and are then thermoset by vulcanizing. Rubber processing employs the rubbery state rather than the melt, i. e. the polymer is above its <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and below <i>T<sub>m</sub></i>. Before vulcanization, the cross-links along the polymer chain are not present and the shaping processes are able to use viscous flow. Once vulcanization has taken place, viscous flow will no longer occur. This is a variation on the theme of thermosets.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Some branches of the polymer processing industries have evolved traditional ways of handling their materials, usually because they began by using polymers of natural origin. In most cases, these traditional methods have persisted into modem times because of the inertia of existing plant and skills. Particular examples are rubber, cellulose, and textiles. The rubber industry was founded on natural rubber which was obtained from trees as latex, dried and supplied as large, unwieldy bales. Powerful and specialized machinery was developed to handle the polymer in this form and today synthetic rubber is supplied in an identical type of bale. It would have been perfectly feasible to produce synthetic rubbers in other more easily handled forms, but the industry already had plant and skills for natural rubber and preferred its new materials in similar form. For example, in its early days PVC was largely processed by rubber manufacturers. This has resulted in the adoption of rubber processing techniques for PVC.</p>
<a id="page_45" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 45, Polymer properties and characterization</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In the earliest days of polymer processing, techniques were evolved for moulding and casting cellulose-derived polymers and many of these persist today, e.g. film casting and solution spinning of fibres. Thus synthetic fibres are handled on a plant which is virtually identical to that devised for handling natural fibres such as wool and cotton, e.g. synthetic staple fibre is supplied in highly entangled compressed bales. The traditional processes of opening, carding, spinning, weaving, scouring, and finishing are still followed.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Although full discussion is beyond the remit of this <i>Primer</i> it is worth listing here the major typical processes used in fabricating polymer articles. These are extrusion, injection moulding, blow moulding, compression moulding, foam-cored moulding, reaction injection moulding (RIM), vacuum forming and calendering (roller-processing).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Additives</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Since fabrication processes can take place at moderately high temperature and the resultant polymer product could be subject to a hostile in-service environment, the polymer is usually mixed with additives such as <b>process aids</b>(lubricants, antistatics), <b>stabilizers</b> (antioxidants, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers) and <b>modifiers</b> (plasticizers, vulcanizers, fillers, impact modifiers, blowing agents, and pigments) before fabrication. These additives may account for over 50% by mass of the resultant article. A full list of additives is extensive but mention should be made of the following.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Fillers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">These are added to improve the properties and decrease the cost of the material. For example, finely powdered wood added to phenol-formaldehyde resins (Bakelite) makes it mouldable, decreases its brittleness and decreases the cost of the final product. Finely divided carbon added to rubber increases its tensile strength. Alumina and silica are cheap inorganic powders often added to bulk out polymers. Finely divided carbon is also added when electrical conductivity is desired, e.g. for antistatic applications such as car tyres (this is different to the intrisically conducting polymers discussed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Pigments</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Pigments are added solely for decorative purposes and should be able to withstand the high temperatures during processing. A feature of polymeric articles is that they can be coloured throughout the bulk material.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Cross-linking agents</i></p>
<p class="noindent">These agents are used to produce cross-linkages between chains, thus turning a thermoplastic into a thermoset (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Blowing agent</i></p>
<p class="noindent">These agents are used in polymer foams. They consist of chemicals which, when heated, release a gas which will &#x2018;blow up&#x2019; the polymer while it is plastic. Bicarbonates have been used to release carbon dioxide but compounds such as azobisdiisobutyronitrile (AZBN which releases nitrogen) are now more commonplace.</p>
<a id="page_46" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 46, Polymer properties and characterization</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>Other process-enhancing additives</i> include surfactants, lubricants, viscosity modifiers and mould-release agents ('sticky&#x2019; polymers can have problems of adherence during processing).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>Additives to counter environmental attack</i> include antimicrobials, bacteriocides, fungicides, and similar species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>Flame retardants and smoke suppressants</i>: since most polymers are inherently inflammable, this is an important aspect of polymer technology. Flames involve free-radical processes and so species which produce halogen atoms, particularly bromine atoms, are good flame retardants, e.g. hexabromocyclodecane, activated by antimony oxide. Such synergistic systems are effective, although there is increasing environmental concern over the presence of antimony (also arsenic salts) in some practical polymers.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Plasticizers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">These are added to make processing easier or to make the final product softer or more flexible. Generally they act by interposing their molecules between the chains, so decreasing the attraction between the chains. Dinonyl and dioctyl phthalate are two liquids with boiling points above 200 &#x00B0;C which are used to make PVC more flexible. If the polymer is to be used under conditions in which a liquid plasticizer may be dissolved out of the material, plasticizers such as polypropylene adipate, which is itself a low molecular weight polymer, are used. Many resins with low RMM are similarly used as plasticizers. With the increase in convenience foods and use of microwave ovens, plastics for food require involatile plasticisers&#x2014;see page 89.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Stabilizers</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Most rubbers contain carbon-carbon double bonds. Some other polymers which one might not expect to contain such bonds also contain &gt;C=C&lt; bonds. For example, while PVC is normally written as shown in <a href="#fig_2.30">Fig. 2.30</a>, a more accurate representation is <a href="#fig_2.31">Fig. 2.31</a>. This imperfection is a result of side reactions. These double bonds are reactive and ozone (atmosphere) is capable of breaking the chains at these points, so degrading the material. Further, at 420 K, PVC breaks down forming double bonds with the HCl formed catalysing further reaction (<a href="#fig_2.32">Fig. 2.32</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Stabilizers are available to prevent these deleterious chemical changes, e.g. the addition of lead carbonate to remove HC1 or antioxidants such as phenols which are oxidized more readily than the polymer. Many stabilizers are</p>

The acual shapes of the stress-strain curves found for polymeric materials depend on whether they can be regarded as soft and weak, or hard and brittle, etc. Unlike metals, polymers show a variation between these stress-strain behaviours as a function of temperature (<a href="#fig_2.34">Fig. 2.34</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1t">Obviously different structures will deform to different extents and <a href="#fig_2.36">Fig. 2.36</a> compares the behaviour of crystalline, amorphous, elastomeric and cross-linked polymeric materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Highly crystalline polymeric materials soften more gradually as the temperature increases until the melting point (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) is approached, at which point fluid flow becomes more significant. Vulcanized rubber is harder than unvulcanized rubber, and its curve would be raised more and more as a larger fraction of the possible cross-links are connected. It is important to recognize that the effects of cross-linking carry beyond the melting point into the true liquid. In this respect, a network polymer like phenol&#x2013;formaldehyde is an extreme example of cross-linking. It gains its thermoset characteristics by the fact that the three-dimensional amorphous structure carries well beyond an imaginable melting point. For this reason it is used in rocket nose cones (networks are further discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mechanical failure of polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although softening and creep may be the first steps in terminating the usefulness of a polymeric material, failure by fracture, fatigue or tearing is of more concern to a consumer. For example, a plastic bag maybe strong enough to resist a tear &#x2014; unless it already has a hole in it. Likewise, cracks in plastic toys usually occur at comers where the stresses are most concentrated. Thus, although the design engineer relies to some extent on stress-strain information, because of the problems associated with these measurements, especially in terms of temperature and the rate of application of the stress, they tend also to use special tests, e.g. bag-bursting, needle penetration, cloth tearing.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Fracture and tearing are called <b>ultimate failures</b> and are as much characteristics of dimensions and shapes of products as they are of geometry of load.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The actual mechanism of fracture is complicated since the structure of the polymer is often complex and the following is only a generality.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Below the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> a material is brittle. This can lead to a fracture surface (at, say, a void, a crack, a notch or an imbedded particle) which cuts through the molecules with very little absorption of energy (<a href="#fig_2.37">Fig. 2.37</a>).</p>

If energy can be absorbed by a reorientation of the molecules, the crack is slowed or even stopped. This type of behaviour is called <b>crazing</b> and the effect can sometimes be to <b>toughen</b> a polymer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, toughness is more usually built into materials by one of the methods below.</p>
<p class="indenthangingb" style="text-align:justify;">1.&#160;&#160;Addition of a filler. This could be particles of glass, or any material that interacts with the polymer matrix. Since the filler is usually harder, stronger, and more rigid than the polymer, any crack which develops must either remain in the polymeric phase or follow the phase boundary. If the filler can be made to bond strongly with the polymer matrix, the crack will stop moving. A typical glass reinforced plastic, &#x2018;fibreglass&#x2019; (GRP) is ISOPON<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="indenthangingbb" style="text-align:justify;">2.&#160;&#160;Using polyblends of rubbery and glassy polymeric phases. The rubber section is capable of withstanding more strain, before failure, than rigid glassy section.</p>
<p class="indenthanginga" style="text-align:justify;">3.&#160;&#160;Make block copolymers with both crystalline and amorphous segments (see Section 3.3.4). The amorphous region gives an improved ability to withstand stress without failure, while the crystalline region improves ability to withstand large stresses.</p>
<p class="indenthanginga" style="text-align:justify;">4.&#160;&#160;Increase the amount of plastic flow available by adding a plasticizer. This pushes the molecules further apart and thereby increases flow and decreases brittleness. The disadvantage of this method is that yield stress will also decrease.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.6&#160;&#160;Other properties</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Optical properties</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Examples of where the transmission of light through a polymeric material is important are in the manufacture of contact lenses, wrappings, windscreens, etc. In general materials are either transparent (transmits all light), translucent (scatter some light) or opaque (scatter all light). Translucent and opaque materials scatter the light by reflection or refraction from the phase boundary between the polymer&#x2013;additive or amorphous&#x2013;crystalline regions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The amount of refraction, <i>n</i> is given by <i>c/v</i> where <i>v</i> is the velocity of light in the material and <i>c</i> is the velocity of light in a vacuum. This phenomenon can be used in stress analysis.</p>
<a id="page_50" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 50, Polymer properties and characterization</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">For example, strains modify the index of refraction of any material. Light vibrating in one plane within a plastic which is under strain travels faster than light vibrating in a plane at right angles (i.e. not under strain). The difference between the two velocities, shows up as bifringence, <i>n<sub>slow</sub> &#x2013; n<sub>fast</sub></i> and, with appropriate optical analysers, the distribution and areas of stress can be studied.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The phenomenon can also be used to identify the spherulitic regions in a material. (In simple terms, spherulites consist of numerous crystallite regions formed by nucleation at different points in the sample.) Here the structure of the material gives rise to destructive interference and with the help of polarized light the polymer scientist can investigate the structure. As an example of the property of a spherulitic material, examine what happens if the cellophane of a cigarette packet is folded in half several times. The material will appear initially transparent and will become increasingly more translucent (less transparent).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Electrical properties</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The resistivity values of traditional polymers exceed 10<sup>12</sup> Ohm cm compared to the values for metals which are approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> Ohm cm, and compared to the value for semiconductors which are of the range 10<sup>2</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>4</sup> Ohm cm. Since resistivity is the inverse of conductivity, it is obvious that most polymers are insulators. However, one can make rubbers or plastics conductive by incorporating conducting fillers (typically graphite) into them. Thus, an appropriately compounded plastic or rubber can be used as the non-metallic ignition wires on cars or used to ground static charges.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Charge transportation or conductivity in plastics can also occur as a consequence of the transport of surface charges or surface conductivity. For example, polyesters contain ester linkages (<a href="#fig_2.39">Fig. 2.39</a>) which provide exposed electrons on the oxygen atom adjacent to the surface. These polar groups can attract moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O has a dipole), protons (H from butyric acid, a constituent of perspiration) or other surface contaminants (dirt is statically charged) and spoil the appearance of the article. To avoid this happening, one may use highly resistive non-polar coatings such as selected silicones.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are new classes of functional polymer which have intrinsically high electrical conductivities. These are dealt with in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Polymer Degradation</b></h3>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Chain scission</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Polymers which have the longest molecules (hence biggest RMM) usually have the greatest strength and resistance to deformation (creep). This is due to the fact that the longer the molecule the greater the chain entanglement and therefore the more resistance to chain slippage and movement which leads to<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Polymer properties and characterization</a>the permanent deformation. Obviously, at very high stresses the carbon&#x2013;carbon backbone will rupture and break; this is the brittle nature of the polymer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, it is also possible to break a polymer backbone by treatment with high energy radiation, e.g. ultraviolet light, neutrons, or X-rays. Such a process maybe commercially important since it can lead to branching and cross-linking and hence higher molar masses, increased strength and resistance to creep and changes in the magnitude of <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>. In fact <i>&#x03B3;</i>-rays have been used to modify the structure of low density polyethene (LDPE) and to produce highly branched material to be used as the insulating material for the wiring used in tunnels (see also <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a> for electron-beam cross-linking).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">An estimation of how much energy (<i>E</i>) is contained in one photon of ultraviolet light of wavelength (&#x03BB;) 300 nm can be obtained using <i>E</i> = <i>hf</i>, where <i>h</i> is Planck&#x2019;s constant (6.62 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;34</sup> Js) and <i>f</i> is the frequency of radiation (<i>c/&#x03BB;</i>), <i>c</i> being the velocity of light (3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>8</sup> m/s). While the value obtained (6.62 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;19</sup> J) may appear small, the bond dissociation energy of a carbon&#x2013;chlorine bond, such as that found in PVC (polychloroethene), is 328 kJ/mol or 5.45 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;19</sup> J/molecule. Since this value is less than the energy contained in a photon of ultraviolet light it is unsurprising that uPVC (unplasticized PVC) articles are not sold with long guarantees.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Thermal and chemical degradation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A particularly important class of degradation concerns chain-growth polymers, in which the reverse of chain build-up occurs. This can occur by scission in the middle of the chain, followed by break-up to oligomers, or by sequential loss of monomers from the end, in the exact reverse of propagation (i.e. unzipping). An example of the former is polystyrene, in which initial scission may occur at a chain defect, leading to proton transfer to give a short alkene-ended chain. Further heating produces a mixture of monomers, dimers, trimers, and beyond. An example of the latter is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are other numerous specific chemical opportunities for degradation depending upon polymer chemistry. For example, step-growth polyester and polyamides can undergo main chain scission by hydrolysis, while side chain ester groups such as polyvinyl acetate and acrylates can also be hydrolysed. PVC can dehydrohalogenate. Polyurethanes are susceptible to bacterial attack, which involves environmental aspects of degradation (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">Chapter 6</a>). Allylic hydrogen atoms are susceptible to oxidation and these are found in natural rubber and dienes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Not all degradation is negative. For example, polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAN) can be partly pyrolysed to give carbon fibre and the mechanochemical scission of polymer chains can also be useful in the control of RMM. Mechanochemical scission can conveniently be accomplished by the ultrasonic irradiation of a polymer solution. During irradiation, the chains cannot flex sufficiently quickly to follow the alternating sound pressure waves and as a result the bond breaks, giving radicals which can recombine with other fragments to give a final material with an average RMM rather than the extremes of RMM found in the original sample. Mechanochemical breakage of polymers to give radicals can be seen visually if an envelope is opened in a <a id="page_52" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 52, Polymer properties and characterization</a>darkened room. A pale triboluminescence ensues from the breakage of bonds in the adhesive sticking down the flap of the envelope.</p>

</figure>
<p class="tfoot" style="margin-top:-0.9em;">a)&#160;general principle</p>
<p class="tfoot">b)&#160;reaction of rubber</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">There are useful analytical studies which involve degradation. The classic example is the work on the ozonolysis of rubber by Harries in 1904. This reaction cleaves a double bond to give the two respective carbonyl compounds, through an addition&#x2013;rearrangement&#x2013;cleavage mechanism, <a href="#fig_2.40">Fig. 2.40a</a>. Natural rubber gives laevulinic aldehyde which can be further oxidised to the carboxylic acid. This shows that rubber is composed of 1,4 linked isoprene units, as shown in <a href="#fig_2.40">Fig. 2.40b</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Swelling and permeation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unlike chain scission, which is the breakage of strong intramolecular bonds, swelling is caused by the breaking of weaker intermolecular (chain to chain) bonds. Typically it is the contact of the material with solvent molecules which reduces the chain interactions and thereby causes the polymer chains to move apart, i.e. to swell, thereby becoming flexible and reducing the mechanical strength. Typical examples are the effects of water on polyvinyl alcohol and of petrol on rubber hose. The problem of swelling may be remedied by the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingb" style="text-align:justify;">1.&#160;&#160;The use of highly cross-linked or crystalline polymers. Because of the presence of close meshed chains they will be resistant to swelling.</p>
<p class="indenthangingb" style="margin-top:-0.2em;text-align:justify;">2.&#160;&#160;The use of incompatible polymer/solvent mixtures. For example, more polar neoprene is used as the petrol pipe in a motor car since petrol is non-polar, but non-polar isoprene is used as the brake fluid pipe, brake fluid being more polar.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1t" style="margin-top:1.5em;">The opposite to swelling is obviously shrinkage. Here the polymer&#x2013;solvent molecular attractions are greater than either the solvent&#x2013;solvent molecule attractions or the polymer&#x2013;polymer chain attractions. The result is the chains are pulled closer together. A typical example is the effect of absorption of water into dry nylon.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Permeation is somewhat different to swelling and refers to the capability of small molecules to travel through a polymer matrix. It is very important in the protection of wrapped articles. Permeation of gases through polymers takes place by solution and diffusion, i.e. the permeating molecule must first<a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Polymer properties and characterization</a>dissolve in the outer layer of the film and then diffuse across it. Obviously the solubility depends upon compatibility in chemical structure. For example, water diffuses through cellophane a hundred times faster than through polythene, which is hydrophobic. Diffusion needs holes of comparable size to that of the permeating molecule, so the rate of diffusion falls off rapidly with increase RMM or as <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> is approached, i.e. rotation is hindered. The fact that water is capable of diffusion through cellophane, which is a semi-crystalline solid, is due to the fact that it acts as a plasticizer, thereby lowering the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and allowing rotation to occur.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.7&#160;&#160;Thermal methods of polymer analysis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">This is a group of techniques in which some physical property of a substance is measured as a function of temperature or time while the substance is subject to a controlled temperature programme. The most common techniques are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetry (TG), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), dilatometry, and also applications-oriented specialized tests such as heat-deflection temperature and melt index.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Differential Scanning Calorimetry</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whenever a substance undergoes a phase change (or transition) such as melting (ice to water) or vaporization (water to steam), the temperature tends to remain constant (provided pressure is fixed) while energy is taken into the system to effect the phase transition, i.e. solid to liquid (latent heat of fusion) or liquid to gas (latent heat of vaporization). DSC is essentially a technique which compares the difference between the energy input into a substance and a reference (or blank) as a function of temperature (or time) while both the reference and the sample are subject to a controlled temperature rise (<a href="#fig_2.41">Fig. 2.41</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since the blank contains no material and therefore cannot undergo any phase change, any energy input will simply raise the temperature. In order that the reference and sample are at the same temperature there is an accelerated inflow of energy to the sample. <a href="#fig_2.42">Fig. 2.42</a> shows a typical DSC of the polyester PET in which the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> are clearly visible at 87&#x00B0;C (360&#x00B0; K) and 267&#x00B0;C (540&#x00B0; K) respectively.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">Also visible in the figure is the energy of crystallization. Once the material has sufficient energy for free rotation around the carbon&#x2013;carbon bonds (i.e. above <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>), it is able to crystallize. Since a crystalline materials is more stable, this crystallization is accompanied by a release of energy, i.e. the converse of melting which required an energy input. DSC proves not only useful in characterizing a polymer by measuring the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> and T<sub>m</sub>, it can also be used to characterize polymer blends such as that between polyethene and polypropene (<a href="#fig_2.43">Fig. 2.43</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">In this method the change of mass of a polymer sample is measured as it is heated (<a href="#fig_2.44">Fig. 2.44</a>). Weight loss by decomposition can be characteristic (<a href="#fig_2.45">Fig. 2.45</a> gives some typical curves) and can be performed under a range of gaseous atmospheres (air, nitrogen, etc.) to give further information while greater sophistication involves the use of mass spectrometry or some other means of trapping and identifying species that are volatized. If the identity of <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Polymer properties and characterization</a>the species is important then other methods of volatilization such as secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) or laser-ion mass-analysis (LIMA) are useful, but these are not strictly thermal methods.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Dynamic mechanical analysis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this technique the properties of a sample are studied as it goes through a time- dependent regime of mechanical change. This can give important information about relaxation processes and phase morphologies. There are considerable subtleties in the technique. The mechanical strain may be applied in a range of oscillatory manners, allowing resolution of the resulting stress into real and imaginary components, while the phase angle between stress and strain gives storage and loss moduli and loss factors. Low stress values are used to avoid permanent deformation. Experimental parameters include temperature, modulation frequency and amplitude. Modem apparatus can apply a variety of dynamic, compressive, tensional, and flexural strains. Subtle information can be obtained from the way that forces in the solid are dispersed. Some phase changes, difficult to detect by other methods, can be clearly seen by DMA. It is a powerful method used to identify segmental and side-chain motions within a chain and can be used on copolymers, additive-containing systems and other practical materials.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Dilatometry</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is an old technique but still useful. It involves measuring volume change with temperature. The sample is sealed into a bulb fitted with an accurate capillary and mercury (with its well known coefficient of thermal expansion) is used to fill the system. Upon gradual heating the volume expansion is measured as motion of the mercury level up the capillary. Deviations from a linear temperature&#x2013;volume curve identify not only phase changes but also indicate their nature. A true first-order phase change such as melting is shown by a discontinuity in the trace (see <a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>), while a second-order phase change such as the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> is shown by a change of gradient only.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Heat distortion (deflection) temperature</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is included to exemplify a practical applications-led method. Here reproducibility between different materials is obtained by following a specific protocol. The heat distortion temperature is defined by the (American) standard measurement test (ASTM) as the temperature at which a polymer bar of standard dimensions deflects by a fixed amount when heated with a standard load attached to its midpoint.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Melt index</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This ASTM test refers to the mass in grams of molten polymer extruded through a standard size capillary at a known temperature for a known time. The values obtained depend on RMM and other properties of the sample. The test is used by manufacturers to compare the performance of materials in reproducible conditions relevant to practical applications. Many polymer tests are based on pragmatic measurement of practical behaviour rather than a quantification of the fundamental underlying parameters. Here extraction of rheological parameters would be a more challenging task.</p>
