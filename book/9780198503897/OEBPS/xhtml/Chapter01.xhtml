<p class="noindent">This primer is intended as an introduction to the methods of producing synthetic polymers and to show how the structures of these materials give the properties which are important in daily life. The organization of the book is designed to provide an overview, graduated from simple systems through to more complicated modern polymer technology. Thus <a href="#Ch01">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#Ch02">2</a> provide general principles, while <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">4</a> treat two main types of polymers and their practical industrial applications respectively. <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a> addresses hybrid systems while <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">Chapter 6</a> addresses more sophisticated modern functional polymers that have unusual properties.</p>

<p class="noindent">Polymers are formed by linking large numbers of small molecules together. The term polymer derives from the Greek &#x2018;poly&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;many&#x2019; and &#x2018;mer&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;units&#x2019;. Perhaps the simplest of all macromolecules is poly(ethene) (<a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>) which can be viewed as simply an extension of the covalently bound micromolecule ethane. Here <i>n</i> represents the number of (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>) units making up the polymer chain.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The value of <i>n</i> is termed the <b>degree of polymerization</b> <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mover accent='true'><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy='true'>&#x00AF;</mo></mover></math>.

In other words</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">Molar mass of the chain = Molar mass of the repeat unit times <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mover accent='true'><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy='true'>&#x00AF;</mo></mover></math></p>
<p class="noindentt">Other terms encountered are &#x2018;oligomers&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;several units&#x2019; (i.e. a very small polymer), trimer (three units, <i>n</i> = 3), dimer (two units, <i>n</i> = 2), and monomer, which is the basic unit from which a polymer is constructed. Macromolecules are therefore simple extensions of micromolecules in which chains of atoms are held together by covalent bonds. The chemical bonds within the chain are very strong and directional along the chains and, although linear chains are most commonly and easily produced, by changing the chemistry involved chains can be linked together to produce both branched and networked structures (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polymers are now ubiquitous in daily life. They have taken over from previous structural materials such as wood and stone, or from fibres used in the manufacture of clothing such as silk, cotton and wool (<a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a>). Their increased usage and success has been based on economic factors such as the discovery of oil and the fact that as natural materials become scarcer they <a id="page_2" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 2, General principles and historical aspects</a>become relatively more expensive. For example, cast iron gutters and buckets have been replaced by poly(propene) and polyvinyl chloride, woodworking glue (originally made from the extract of bones) by polyvinyl acetate, and natural rubber and gutta percha by artificial polyisoprene. <a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a> gives a flavour of cases where some naturally occurring polymers have been replaced by synthetic (artificial) analogues.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Not only have polymers found a wide use in structural and textile materials, polymer substitutes have also found a wide application in medicine: for example, the use of polyethene hip joints, perspex in artificial corneas, nylon in arteries, and silicone rubber in artificial hearts.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Synthetic polymers have had a sizeable impact in the field of fibres, plastics and rubbers (elastomers), but they also exist in other categories and <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a> lists typical examples and the industries in which they are used.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">While the majority of polymers listed in <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a> are synthetic polymers, there are natural polymers such as proteins, natural rubber, and cellulose each of which could be fitted into a similar category.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Of the various polymer categories in <a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a>, fibres, plastics and elastomers (rubbers) are probably the most important technologically. Fibres are thought of as being very strong with good pliability, resistant to abrasion</p>

<p class="noindentt">and able to hold their shape, while an elastomer should be flexible, able to return to its original dimensions, and must not deform of its own accord. Plastics are seen as intermediate between the above two, being tough, having reasonable strength, some flexibility, and ability to retain their shape. A clue to the difference in the properties of fibres, elastomers, and plastics lies in the difference in their structures (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">For example, whereas the fibres cellulose and terylene contain ring structures to assist rigidity, the elastomer poly(isoprene) contains double bonds leading to the possibility of linking between chains (see later) to provide rigidity via a network; plastics contain mainly covalent chains with no functionality available for interchain linkage.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">It is clear from <a href="#tab1.1">Tables 1.1</a> and <a href="#tab1.2">1.2</a> that, while the term &#x2018;plastic&#x2019; is often used to describe polymers, the words &#x2018;polymer&#x2019; and &#x2018;plastic&#x2019; are not synonymous and strictly the term &#x2018;plastic&#x2019; should only be used to describe the stress&#x2013;strain behaviour rather than refer to the chemistry. For example plastic sulphur, as it<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, General principles and historical aspects</a> is known, formed by quenching molten sulphur in water, was the first true plastic material before the discovery of natural rubber. The subsequent discovery of a host of other materials which exhibit plastic deformation has revolutionized materials science and is the basis of the great usefulness of polymers.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Other advantages of polymeric materials over conventional materials are that they are light and easy to transport, easy to repair and highly resistant to corrosion, solvent action and moisture. However, they possess disadvantages in that they can have poor mechanical strength, a short lifespan and poor resistance to temperature.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another feature of polymer physical properties concerns the time-dependence of mechanical behaviour. This phenomenon, known as viscoelasticity, is shown for example by the toy &#x2018;silly putty&#x2019;, which, if stretched rapidly, snaps, but if pulled slowly elongates elastically (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>). The rich span of mechanical and physical properties shown by polymers is their great contribution to science.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polymers also possess another property, namely processability. Previously only metals and glass were truly melt-processable, while the other natural materials such as stone, wood, and leather required mechanical cutting and then gluing or stitching into final shape. In fact, the widespread use of electricity benefited greatly from having plastic insulation extrudable onto wires, instead of the laborious wrapping of each wire with oil-soaked paper or similar material. This is just one example of the advantages of polymer processability in daily life.</p>

<p class="noindent">Polymers produced by this mechanism usually involve the typical condensation reactions of organic chemistry where a small molecule, e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O or HCl, is expelled as the link is built. For example:</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">It requires little imagination to see that any such reaction, on paper at least, provides a route to polymer chains provided the starting materials are <b>bifunctional</b>. For example, taking X = OH (alcohol) and Y = COOH (carboxylic acid) gives an ester which is capable of further reaction with another unit (<a href="#fig_1.4">Figs 1.4</a> and <a href="#fig_1.5">1.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1t">The use of multifunctional monomers can produce network polymers. <a href="#fig_1.6">Figure 1.6</a> gives an example of a polymer produced from a trifunctional alcohol and a difunctional carboxylic acid.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The production of terylene shown earlier is by the condensation reaction between a diacid monomer and a diol monomer. Provided that the monomer contains both a hydroxyl group (X) and an acid group (Y) condensation will take place. However, there is a subtlety of structure best seen by drawing out several repeat units:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-6.3em;">

<p class="noindent">each time. This can affect crystal packing, hydrogen bonding, and polarity and hence polymer physical properties, (see nylons <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">chapter 4</a>, and kevlar<sup>TM</sup> <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#Ch06">chapter 6</a>)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another way of influencing the physical properties (e.g. crystallinity, melting point, etc.) within a single class of polymer is to alter the proportions of the polar linking groups within the chain. Using nylons as example of a series of related compounds the effect of altering the length of the hydrocarbon units between the polar NH/CO links can be seen. For example 6,10 nylon can be prepared from the amine H-HN-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>-NHH and the carboxylic acid HO-CO-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>-CO-OH (or acid chloride Cl-CO-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>-CO-Cl); 8,6 nylon can be prepared by reacting H-HN-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>-NHH and HO-CO-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>-CO-OH, and 6 nylon can be prepared by self-condensation of the aminocarboxylic acid NH<sub>2</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>-COOH. The spacing and regularity between the NH and CO groups in nylon 6,6 or nylon 6,10 will obviously be different. Therefore for identical RMM more CONH groups would be expected to be present in 6,6 than 6,10 nylon and, if these groups participate in interchain hydrogen bonding, as they do, more hydrogen bonding is expected in 6,6 than 6,10. The consequence is that more thermal energy is required to separate chains composed of 6,6 than 6,10 and thus 6,6 has a higher melting point. The length of the hydrocarbon (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> sections also affects flexibility and mechanical properties as well as hydrophobicity and water repellency in the polymer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">While the ultimate aim in any synthesis is to obtain a particular RMM (and hence particular physical and mechanical properties), other processes may intercede. For example, the acid unit may decarboxylate to some degree under the conditions of polymerization (e.g. high temperature). This would give Y = H as the end-group which, in the case of polyester production, would be unable to react with the alcohol, thereby terminating the polymerization reaction prematurely. Secondly, it may be advantageous to stop the reaction when a particular RMM has been achieved (i.e. a given value of <i>n</i>). For the polyester, addition of a monovalent alcohol R&#x2032;OH or monovalent carboxylic acid R&#x2033;COOH could be used as a chain stopper to seal one end of the polymer chain.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chain polymerization</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is the second common method of synthesizing polymers. The word chain refers to the mechanism of polymerization, which in many cases is technically also an addition reaction, hence this term is sometimes used. The most common type of addition polymer is based on ethene CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>, in which the monomer contains at least one double (pi) bond which, on being activated (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>), opens up to produce two single sigma bonds and the homopolymer poly(ethene) (<a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>). Note the resultant polymer backbone is joined together by carbon-carbon bonds, unlike the condensation polymer systems where there are oxygen, nitrogen or other heteroatoms in the chain.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">If two monomers, e.g. ethene CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> and propene CH<sub>2</sub>=CH(CH<sub>3</sub>), are reacted together then there is the possibility of producing a copolymer. <a href="#fig_1.8">Figure 1.8</a> is an example of the copolymer produced by reacting ethene and propene. The actual structure of the copolymer will depend on the reaction condition and is explained in more detail in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">An important distinction between macromolecules and small molecules can be seen when the homologous series of the alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane) is considered, e.g.</p>

<p class="noindentt">We could redraw ethane, butane, and hexane as shown in <a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a> and could imagine that if <i>n</i> = 1 we have ethane, for <i>n</i> = 2 we have butane and <i>n</i> = 3 we have hexane.</p>
<a id="page_9" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 9, General principles and historical aspects</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Small molecules such as alkanes have distinct identities and are always treated as separate compounds. For example, ethane is a gas, hexane is a liquid and octadecane (H-(CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>9</sub>-H) is a solid at room temperature. However, as the value of <i>n</i> increases the differences become less clear. For example, if <i>n</i> = 50 we have a relatively short-chain poly(ethene), although as prepared the end-groups are unlikely to be H, while if <i>n</i> = 1000 we have a high polymer of poly(ethene) with a molar mass of 28 000. These will differ in their physical and mechanical properties, but will otherwise be chemically identical, being effectively long chains of -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>- units. The same principle applies to the long-chain isomeric polyamides. As the chain becomes long, they may be considered chemically identical and differences in their properties originate from differences in chain length.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 1.10</b> Typical polymer RMM distribution.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In a real polymer sample consisting of many chains there is not usually a single value of <i>n</i> for all chains in the sample. Regardless of how much the polymer chemist may wish to produce molecules of one size, e.g. <i>n</i> = 1000, in practice a spread of RMMs will arise, as shown in <a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>, with some molecules having an <i>n</i> value larger than 1000, and some molecules having a smaller <i>n</i> value. In this regard polymer science lags behind nature, which is able to produce protein polymers of exact dimensions. All ethene molecules would simply appear as a point in <a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a> at RMM = 28.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">If we consider the (self) condensation of hydroxyhexanoic acid, HO-RCO<sub>2</sub>-H where R = (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> and where <i>n</i> = 5, the concept of an RMM distribution is easy to visualize. The first reaction to occur is between the end-groups on a pair of monomers to eliminate water (<a href="#fig_1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>) and produce the dimer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since the end-groups are still active the next reaction of the dimer H-(ORCO)<sub>2</sub>-OH can either be reaction with another monomer (M<sub>1</sub>) or reaction with a dimer (M<sub>2</sub>) to yield a trimer (M<sub>3</sub>) and a tetramer (M4) respectively, e.g.</p>

<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">

</figure>
<p class="noindentt">Obviously from such a random set of reactions (<a href="#fig_1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>) a distribution of RMM will be observed. In the case of chain addition polymerization, there will be a need to activate the monomer (ethene say, CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>) before polymerization can occur. The detailed mechanisms will be dealt with in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a> and the discussion here will be restricted to chain free radical polymerization.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A free radical is an uncharged species with an unpaired electron. It is highly reactive and undergoes reactions to extract an electron from another substrate so that it can produce a full complement of electrons within the newly created molecule. If a representative radical is termed R then reaction with a monomer such as ethene may be written as:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;">
<img src="../images/page10-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindentt">This new species is still a free radical with an unpaired electron, and it can continue to attack another ethene monomer (i.e. propagating or polymerizing) without the loss of activity. The radical can only lose (or terminate) its activity by reacting with another radical to form a covalent bond (<a href="#fig_1.13">Fig. 1.13</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;" id="fig_1.13">
<img src="../images/page10-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-left:7em;margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 1.13</b> Reactions of radicals.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1t" style="margin-top:1.6em;">A consequence of the reaction scheme in <a href="#fig_1.13">Fig. 1.13</a> is that the termination reaction of the dimer radical (RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><img src="../images/bull.jpg" alt="images"/>) with the activator radical (R<img src="../images/bull.jpg" alt="images"/>) gives exactly the same molecule (RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>R) as the termination reaction between two monomer radicals (RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><img src="../images/bull.jpg" alt="images"/>). It is the random nature of these initiation and termination reactions which produces a mixture of chain lengths. As an example of the diversity of possible chain lengths that could be present in a hypothetical addition polymerization, <a href="#fig_1.14">Fig. 1.14</a> charts the progress of a radical R (OH<img src="../images/bull.jpg" alt="images"/> from the homolytic cleavage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> say) coming into contact with four ethene monomers. For simplicity the monomer unit will be represented by M, the dimer unit by M<sub>2</sub>, trimer unit by M<sub>3</sub> etc. Also included in the figure are the RMM of each species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Thus both step-growth and chain mechanisms give a spread of chain lengths and RMMs in the resultant polymer sample, and the question is which molar mass should be quoted &#x2014; the lowest, the highest, or should a range be given? Although it is possible to obtain the spread of RMMs in a particular sample, in fact this is what was done previously to construct the RMM distribution (<a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>), it is a very tedious and time-consuming exercise. Therefore what is actually quoted is an average value. However, to do this some property of the polymer sample must be measured, against which to set the average. The easiest method is one which will count the number of molecules of a particular RMM. For example, with a total of 300 molecules in <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, General principles and historical aspects</a>the sample, of which 150 molecules have an RMM of 100 000 and 150 molecules have an RMM of 300 000, then intuitively the average would be calculated at 200 000. Likewise, with a total of 300 molecules, of which 100 had an RMM of 100 000, 100 had an RMM of 200 000, and 100 had an RMM of 300 000, then again intuitively the average would be 200 000. Mathematically the value could be deduced from <a href="#eqn_1.1">eqn 1.1</a>:</p>

<p class="noindentt">Any method which counts the number of molecules in solution is termed a colligative method. Particular methods include the lowering of vapour pressure, depression of freezing point, elevation of boiling point and osmotic pressure (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#Ch02">Chapter 2</a>). These methods work well for small-molecule compounds, provided there is no dissociation, aggregation, or impurities present which will alter the total number of particles and hence the observed RMM value. Colligative methods are also applicable to polymer samples but, because of their great size, the actual number of macromolecules present in any polymer sample is not as high as for a sample of a micromolecular compound so that a smaller effect is observed for freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, osmotic pressure etc. The fact that this small effect is more difficult to measure helped fuel the controversy that existed from the nineteenth century through to the early part of the twentieth century over whether macromolecules actually existed.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Obviously there are many ways of taking averages. For people it could be the colour of their eyes, the colour of their hair, their height, or the <i>number</i> in a group, or the weight, or <i>mass</i>, of a group. Thus, it is also possible to obtain average molar mass values based on the size of a molecule (i.e. mass). The techniques commonly used to determine the mass average are chromatography (especially high performance gel chromatography, HPGPC), light-scattering (turbidity), ultracentrifugation or sedimentation (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#Ch02">Chapter 2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.5&#160;&#160;History of polymers</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">While the polymers discussed so far have been fully artificial macromolecules produced by step-growth or chain reaction of small-molecule species, there are a number of naturally occurring polymers. It was as a result of early attempts to modify these natural materials that the important understanding of polymer behaviour arose.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Natural polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Proteins</i></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 1.17</b> Representative structure of a segment of protein. Structures of R groups are given in <a href="#tab1.4">Table 1.4</a></p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Proteins are based on a-amino acids (<a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a>) and are regarded as the archetypal natural polymers from which many biological materials derive. They are complex molecules, with the individual repeat units containing some 24 different R groups (<a href="#tab1.4">Table 1.4</a>). They have an enormous range of molar mass and each protein has exactly the correct amino acid residue in the correct place along the chain. At present it is beyond the ability of artificial systems to produce polymers with the different units all in exactly the correct position.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Wool is an example of a protein (keratin) which is also present in hair and is used as tough fibres to make clothing. Another tough natural fibre is cellulose, which is a chain of polyether-linked sugar rings (see <a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>a). It is found in a pure state in cotton which has long been used as fibres for clothing. As cotton, cellulose is a tough, insoluble and infusible fibre, which can only be cut, woven or mechanically manipulated. The structure has substantial opportunities for hydrogen bonding between rings and chains, via hydroxyl groups and also via the ether oxygens, and its high melting point (beyond decomposition temperature) and its insolubility originate because forces in the</p>

<p class="noindent">solid lattice are greater than the energy benefit from dispersion in the melt or solution energy obtained upon dissolution. Cellulose is also found as approximately 50% of wood, together with lignin and other components. Wood of course has long been used as a structural material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">These natural polymers are flexible, but are not processable in solution or in the melt. A less common natural material which is genuinely processable and which became available to industrialized nations in the early 1800s was natural rubber.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>DNA</i> (Deoxyribonucleic acids)</p>
<p class="noindent">Another class of natural polymer of great importance to life, but not useful for their mechanical properties are the nucleic acids which are used to transmit genetic information in living creatures, even bacteria. The basic polymer structure (<a href="#fig_1.18">Fig. 1.18</a>) is a long chain of nucleotide bases attached to sugar rings joined by phosphodiesters.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A feature of DNA is its very high RMM. A human cell is some 20 <i>&#x03BC;</i>m in diameter of which the nucleus is part. The DNA, despite its carefully maintained helical nature over a short distance, is able to coil and fold over long distances, as most polymers do. If the DNA from a single human cell nucleus is uncoiled, it is over 1 metre long (in chromosomal fragments of up to 20-cm individual lengths), an astonishing example of polymer dimensions. Its cross-sectional area of course is very narrow</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Natural rubber</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This is obtained as latex (a heterogeneous aqueous suspension of micro-globules) from the sap of a tree. (The name originates from early use as an eraser.) After solving some initial processing difficulties (the material needed to be ground up to improve flow to allow ease of fabrication), Mackintosh made use of its elastic properties and developed rainproof clothing in the early 1820s.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, a drawback to greater commercial acceptance was the temperature performance of the rubber and also the stickiness of the polymer in warm conditions which necessitated not only a textile lining for a coat but also a textile outer surface. This doubled a labour-intensive part of the process and mitigated against cost-effectiveness of garments made from this new material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In 1836 in America, Charles Goodyear addressed the problem of surface tackiness and tried heating with elemental sulphur. What he obtained was a considerable increase in strength and mechanical properties. The process, later termed &#x2018;vulcanization&#x2019;, produced dramatic effects and formed the basis of the vehicle tyre industry, giving an impetus to the eventual development of motor transport among other things. Strength is increased by joining polymer chains together to give a giant molecule, linked by polysulphur bridges. The chemistry is somewhat complex and is elaborated in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Cellulose esters</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Cellulose is a triol (<a href="#fig_1.18">Fig. 1.18</a>) containing one primary and two secondary alcoholic hydroxyl groups. By treating cellulose as an alcohol, workers in the mid-to-late-1800s identified routes of producing processable cellulose, some of which are still used on an appreciable scale today.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;" id="fig_1.18"><a id="page_16" class="page" style="width:84%;">Page 16, General principles and historical aspects</a>

<figcaption style="margin-left:7em;margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 1.18</b> Natural polymer nucleic acids:<br/>a) a tetranucleotide-4 units of ribonucleic acid (RNA)<br/>b) double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)<br/>c) base pairing, adenine-thymine<br/>d) base pairing, guanine-cytosine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1t">The basic strategy was to diminish hydrogen bonding by selective conversion of alcohol groups into esters of different types. While esters of organic alcohols with mineral acids (e.g. HNO3) are not commonly used in organic chemistry, being generally more reactive than esters of an alcohol with a carboxylic acid, Schonbein showed in 1848 that cellulose treated with nitric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid was converted to nitrate esters (<a href="#fig_1.19">Fig. 1.19</a>). These are sometimes called "nitrocellulose". This is a misnomer because they contain C-O-N bonds rather than the C-N bonds found in true nitrocompounds.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The most important feature of the nitration reaction is that it can be controlled. Complete reaction produces cellulose trinitrate, a solid known as<a id="page_17" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 17, General principles and historical aspects</a>&#x2018;gun cotton&#x2019; and which is a shock-sensitive explosive. A lesser degree of nitration is achieved by increasing the water content of the reaction mixture. It is also possible by deliberate further heating to cut the long natural chains and give a lower RMM material which is soluble in ether/ethanol. This product was known as &#x2018;collodion&#x2019;, a lacquer which could be used medicinally by dabbing on to wounds and allowing the solvent to evaporate to leave an &#x2018;artificial skin&#x2019;. It was also used in the early development of photography to coat the glass plates that were then used. Cellulose nitrate was arguably the material at the birth of the polymer industry, when Parkes demonstrated solid moulded articles from mixtures of it with oils at the Great International Exhibition in London in 1862.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-left:7em;margin-top:0.5em;"><b>Fig. 1.19</b> Representative formation of cellulose nitrate</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A further use of cellulose nitrate was developed in 1884 by Le Chardonnet, who opened up the field of &#x2018;regenerated&#x2019; cellulose, a strategy in which the natural polymer is converted to a processable intermediate, here the nitrate ester, and is then turned back to cellulose again by reduction with ammonium hydrogen sulphide <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">NH</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x002B;</mo></msubsup><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">HS</mi></mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></math> The fibres so obtained have subtle differences from the original cellulose, in particular a silken lustre. The &#x2018;Chardonnet silk&#x2019; immediately found a high added-value application in the fashion industry and continued to provide an artificial alternative to expensive natural silk until the 1930s when clothing from fully artificial polymers (&#x2018;nylon&#x2019; polyamides and later &#x2018;terylene&#x2019; polyesters) became widely available throughout society.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Arguably the most important cellulose nitrate derivative, at least in terms of its effect upon the development of modern life, was the discovery that a mixture of solid cellulose dinitrate and camphor was melt-processable. (Melt-processing is a particularly useful technology which here allows production of optically transparent films as continuous strips.) The material was called celluloid and it revolutionized the photographic industry which until then was forced to rely on rigid, inflexible and breakable glass plates to support the necessary light-sensitive chemicals. The availability of this tough, flexible, pliable, and transparent material which could be transported around sprockets and spools allowed the development of the film industry with its great effect on twentieth century life. However, being composed of a nitrate ester, the early movie films were potentially flammable and presented a fire hazard to early cinemas. Although celluloid is no longer used, it has an important place in polymer history as being a truly melt-processable derivative of otherwise intractable cellulose.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Viscose Rayon</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The success of Le Chardonnet silk prompted other approaches to regenerated cellulose. For example, the viscose Rayon process of Cross and Bevan in 1892 <a id="page_18" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 18, General principles and historical aspects</a>employed as the first step the treatment of cellulose (here behaving as a typical alcohol) with a base to form a water-soluble alkoxide salt, a step which is also now used to make a number of permanently modified cellulose derivatives (<a href="#fig_1.20">Fig. 1.20</a>). Cross and Bevan reacted the alkoxide (alkali cellulose) with carbon disulphide to give a xanthate salt (<a href="#fig_1.20">Fig. 1.20</a>). The resulting viscous solution was then made acidic and forced through spinnerets (or another processing device) where it lost carbon disulphide to give regenerated cellulose either as fibres, Rayon, or as transparent sheets of Cellophane with essentially the original structure. This was a substantial processing enhancement since the material could be recovered with slight effect on the original RMM. The processing advantage for Rayon was that the fibre thickness and dimensions could be controlled, whereas cotton fibres possess dimensions dictated by the plant on which they grow.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-left:7em;margin-top:0.5em;"><b>Fig. 1.20</b> The viscose rayon process</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since carbon disulphide is both toxic and extremely inflammable, its choice in the above process may not seem obvious. Bicarbonate might seem more obvious since at first sight the chemistry is similar (<a href="#fig_1.21">Fig. 1.21</a>). However, bicarbonate chemistry is too unstable to be useful in this application. The eventual choice of system shows how commercial chemical products require substantial developmental studies after the original idea has been shown to be viable.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Also, in the case of cellophane the actual process contains a number of stages, all optimized after considerable effort. This is a feature of all industrial processes, but polymer processes show this particularly well, and will be emphasized in this primer. Thus, although the underlying chemistry may seem simple in concept, the actual practical system may be more sophisticated than otherwise expected.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A whole range of cellulose polymers is now available using the initial step of the xanthate process. For example, if 2-chloroethanol replaces carbon disulphide then hydroxyethyl cellulose, a hydrophilic polymer used as a filler in ice cream is produced, while the use of chloromethane leads to methyl cellulose (<a href="#fig_1.22">Fig. 1.22</a>). These products are sometimes termed &#x2018;cellulose ethers&#x2019;, and, although cellulose itself is a polyether, the name refers to the addition of the extra ether functionality.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Cellulose acetate</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Schutzenberger first attempted the esterification of cellulose in 1865 but found the reaction too difficult to control. Treatment with acetic acid and acetic anhydride led to the formation of the triacetate (<a href="#fig_1.23">Fig. 1.23</a>), a product which has relatively poor mechanical properties and, more importantly at the time, is only soluble in halogenated solvents such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane). At the end of the last century these solvents were very expensive and could not be countenanced for large-scale applications. Nowadays these solvents are cheaper and the economics are overturned such that cellulose triacetate is used for cigarette filters.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-left:7em;margin-top:0.5em;"><b>Fig. 1.23</b> Formation of cellulose triacetate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, a more useful material is the diacetate, in which (approximately) two hydroxyl groups are acetylated per ring. This leaves one hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding. It was discovered in the early 1900s that the diacetate could be made in a two-step process in which acetylation with acetic anhydride containing sulphuric acid catalyst gives the triacetate, then controlled partial hydrolysis with dilute aqueous sulphuric acid gives the diacetate. This exploits the discovery that while acetylation cannot be controlled, hydrolysis of <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, General principles and historical aspects</a>the acetate esters can. Cellulose diacetate is soluble in acetone, which was then, and still is, one of the cheapest solvents. One of the reasons that cellulose diacetate rapidly became accepted was that it could be used to strengthen canvas (&#x2018;cellulose dope&#x2019;). Thus an acetone solution was sprayed onto, for example, the canvas wings of the newly invented aeroplanes, and the solvent allowed to evaporate, giving an early example of the strengthening effect of a composite material. Military use in the First World War provided an impetus for acceptance of the new material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Cellulose diacetate became the major thermoplastic moulding material in the early part of the twentieth century and is still used for some minor applications such as plastic combs and toothbrushes, although polyethene and polystyrene have now taken over in importance.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Cellulose materials continue to remain important. In the mid-1990s Courtaulds, who pioneered Rayon and cellulose acetate commercially, produced a new cellulose-based polymer (&#x2018;Tencel&#x2019;) which employs a different solvent system. The benefit of cellulose is that it is inherently biodegradable and environmentally friendly; it is of course continuously renewable being obtained from plant sources. In principle it will still be available when coal-and petroleum-based resources become scarcer.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Artificial polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The remainder of this <i>Primer</i> mainly concerns artificial polymers &#x2014; chain and step-growth. The distinction between chain polymerization and step-growth polymerization is crucial to the commercial preparations of these materials. Quite different conditions are employed and control of the reaction (to give the desired RMM and polymer properties) is therefore quite different.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The synthesis of artificial polymers (<a href="#tab1.5">Tables 1.5</a> and <a href="#tab1.6">1.6</a>) has actually been studied as long as the chemical modification of natural polymers. The photochemical polymerization of vinyl chloride and the polymerization of styrene were discovered respectively in 1838 and 1839 just as Mackintosh and Goodyear were improving the properties of natural rubber. However, this new polymeric state of matter was not really understood and the large scale commercial exploitation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waited almost 100 years until 1927 with polystyrene following in 1937. Of the step-growth polymers, nylon 6,6 became commercially available in 1938 with polyesters later.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Since then polymers have become more and more widely used. Exploitation of their physical and mechanical properties and developments in processing to open up further applications have all helped, but a recent development is in the use of functional polymers in which a property is exploited outside those due simply to the long chain structure. These include the presence of chemically reactive pendant groups, the conduction of electricity, biomedical uses of polymers and the like. These will be discussed towards the end of this <i>Primer</i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Although polymers tend to be thought of as modern materials, industry tends to use pre-IUPAC nomenclature which can be confusing. Accordingly, <a href="#tab1.5">Table 1.5</a> gives old and new names, some acronyms and structures for many important chain-growth polymers which may be variously referred to throughout this book. <a href="#tab1.6">Table 1.6</a> gives the structures of important step-growth polymers.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.6">
<h2 class="h2"><b>1.6&#160;&#160;General principles of industrial polymer synthesis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is important to emphasize commercial and practical aspects since these underpin the great usefulness of polymers in modern society. Practical industrial preparations often differ from laboratory scale synthetic routes, a principle underlined in the polymer industry. In this <i>Primer</i> several practical polymerizations are examined in detail to give a feel for the factors which must be addressed in the development of feasible processes. However, first some general principles are discussed.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Economics</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This can be very difficult to predict since each process has its own economics. For example, extreme situations could be the production of a large-volume <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, General principles and historical aspects</a>low-cost product (e.g. polyethene) compared to a high added-value low-volume material (e.g. Kevlar<sup>TM</sup>) where an expensive process can be tolerated.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Other costs include raw materials, e.g. solvents and reagents; oxygen in the air is by far the cheapest oxidant, water is much cheaper than any organic solvent; mineral acids and alcohols are relatively cheap, while ethanoic acid (and its derivatives) is the cheapest organic acid.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Ideal processes make use of all products, since the selling of an unwanted side-product can tip the economic balance of a process. Significant formation of a byproduct which is of no value represents a complete waste of mass which has to be moved, lifted, dissolved, pumped, filtered or otherwise taken through the production line: thus there is considerable impetus to improve any process. Often, however, this does not extend to implementing a completely new synthetic strategy because a major investment in new plant is then required.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another important consideration nowadays concerns environmental aspects. The toxicity of reagents, byproducts, effluents, emissions, and general health and safety concerns can mitigate against an old process and enforce a new one. Environmental legislation has now become an important criterion in process selection, and can alter the traditional interplay of economic factors.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Catalysts</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although strictly a catalyst alters the rate of a chemical reaction without changing the position of equilibrium, the term tends to be applied to any species which improves the quality of a reaction. A yield improvement of a few per cent can alter the economics of a reaction and industry expends considerable effort to develop improved catalytic systems. Practical catalysts are often sophisticated mixtures with accelerators, promoters and other species present, with the exact detail being kept secret. In particular, the use of heterogeneous transition metal species is very common. The variable valency of the metal atom allows electron transfers to occur with concurrent changes of orbital geometry and other factors which are important in the chemistry of coordination complexes and organometallic systems. The catalyst is often solid in an otherwise liquid or gaseous medium, such that surface phenomena are controlling factors. Catalyst science is a large and increasingly important topic beyond the scope of this book, and virtually every optimized industrial chemical reaction involves a catalytic system. Polymer manufacture from initial raw materials through to final products shows the important of catalysts very well and there are a number of catalytically enhanced reactions which would not be considered on laboratory scale, e.g. the oxidative conversion of benzene to maleic anhydride in vapour phase over a vanadium pentoxide catalyst.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The cost of a specialized catalyst is offset by the relatively small quantity required and the number of times it can turnover before deactivation.</p>
<p class="noindentta"><i>Purity</i></p>
<p class="noindent">An important consideration in catalysis is &#x2018;poisoning&#x2019; in which small traces of impurities deactivate the catalyst. Sulphur-containing species seem particularly <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, General principles and historical aspects</a>deleterious to a wide range of catalytic systems. It is always desirable in any case to avoid impurities in a reaction and in polymer manufacture particularly so, because of the effect of trace impurities upon the final polymer molar mass. A species which deactivates the propagating end-group in a chain polymerization can significantly alter RMM distribution and a variable batch-to-batch impurity level can complicate calculation of the appropriate initiator concentration. As will be seen later in step-growth polymerizations, the final RMM relates to the degree of polymerization such that for the joining of 10 000 units in a chain, an extent of reaction of 99.99% is required (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#Ch02">Chapter 2</a>). Imagine being asked routinely to produce a yield of 99.99% in a typical laboratory experiment! Clearly high purity is crucial here, as well as are other means to drive the reaction towards maximum yield. Industrial strategies to do so sometimes involve reaction conditions that would not be employed in the small-scale laboratory.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>General reaction conditions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The small-scale chemical laboratory typically employs reflux in glass-walled apparatus as the major methodology for a thermally-activated chemical process. This is thermodynamically a constant pressure (1 atmosphere) and variable volume system in which the equilibrium constant depends upon Gibbs Free energy; but it should be recalled that there is another thermodynamic regime at constant volume and variable pressure. This is harder to implement in the laboratory but industry is at home with constant volume systems, using stainless steel reactors or other infrastructure which can tolerate extremes of high or low pressure. Thus reactions which are inefficient in the laboratory can be driven over to effective thermodynamics by proper choice of conditions. A good example of a reaction that would be difficult and hazardous in the laboratory, but which is industrially effective, is hydrogenation with hydrogen gas at several hundred atmospheres&#x2019; pressure.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Process enhancements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These are sought at all levels and continual effort goes into better economics and process improvement. Thus even in a well established polymer system a new synthetic reaction, improved catalysts and diminution of side-products and waste are all axiomatic benefits. Both heating and cooling cost money and any development which minimizes extremes of temperature is very much sought after. Better control of polymer RMM (thus physical properties) is a key issue, while a whole science outside the scope of this book concerns engineering aspects of polymer processing and how these affect polymer applications and performance.</p>
