<p class="fmnoindent" style="margin-top:-1em;">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Phil Lorimer and David Walton present a clearly written and stimulating introductory account of Polymer Chemistry considering both fundamental aspects and applications. The book explains in simple terms the basic ideas of the subject and outlines the importance of polymeric materials in the modern world; essential knowledge for all chemists. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
