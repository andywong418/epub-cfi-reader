<h2 class="h2"><b>6.1&#160;&#160;Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Commonly the emphasis for polymer applications has been based upon the physical and mechanical properties arising from high molar mass (RMM). The deliberate enhancement and exploitation of some other properties has been less widely studied, although the presence of chemical functionality in many polymer systems has been recognized for a long time. In <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a> it was shown that the presence of reactive alkene functionalities in the polymer chain allows the vulcanization of natural rubber, a strategy later adapted to an artificial polymer system in linear unsaturated polyesters (fibre glass), with a variation employed in the drying (curing) of certain paints (alkyd resins) where oxygen in the air initiates free radical cross-linking of pendant alkene functionalities. In general, the chemistry of adhesives involves the presence of groups that can react with each other.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The use of cellulose-based polymers arises from reaction of the hydroxy groups on the sugar rings (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>) and the properties of nylons can be manipulated, for example by post-reaction with aldehydes. However, the specific search for added value polymer behaviour has been a relatively recent phenomenon. A good example is the development of the water-absorbent polymers used in babies nappies (diapers). These materials are based on water-soluble polymers such as cellulose derivatives, oligosaccharides or acrylamides which are lightly cross-linked to prevent them dissolving. Instead they become swollen and can absorb more than 100 times their own weight of water. This capability originates not just from the intrinsic hydroxylic nature of the polymer chain, but also from developments in the control of porosity and permeability related to the specific application.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This chapter concerns a review of recent developments in functional polymers, selected to show the essential strategic factors in each case. Some materials have found practical uses, while others remain research curiosities at present.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2&#160;&#160;High performance polymers</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Principles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This refers to polymers with extreme mechanical strength and toughness. The strategy to achieve this is instructive, since enhancement of one specific property occurs at the expense of other properties and eventually the best practical system involves a trade-off between desired features and those attainable.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Many commercial polymers of moderate strength employ aromatic rings in the backbone chain, mixed with sp<sup>3</sup> carbon units (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>). This combines the toughness (on the microscopic scale) of the planar, conjugated <a id="page_126" class="page">Page 126, Functional polymers</a>and multiply bonded sp<sup>2</sup> carbon system with the flexibility of the sp<sup>3</sup> singly bonded carbon units (with substantial freedom around the tetrahedral carbon). A good example of this is poly(ethylene terephthalate), Terylene, while for the same reason many step-growth systems employ derivatives of bisphenol A (see page 97) which has planar aromatic rings sandwiching an sp<sup>3</sup> carbon unit that also possesses space-filling methyl group substituents.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-top:1em; width:70%;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 6.1</b> Representative fully aromatic polymer systems (a) a polyester, poly (p-hydroxybenzoic acid); (b) a polyamide, poly (p-aminobenzoic acid).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The aromatic nature of the chain can be increased in, for example, poly (p-hydroxybenzoic acid) or poly (p-aminobenzoic acid) (<a href="#fig_6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">These materials would be expected to be extremely strong because there is a degree of double bond character in the chain, even the single bonds, because of the resonance opportunities shown in <a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The two resonances cannot be drawn with a single set of &#x2018;curly arrows&#x2019;. Essentially the nitrogen lone pair conjugates in two separate directions. In reality, of course, overlap of orbitals to transfer electron density will be a simultaneous mixture of the various possible structures and thus such &#x2018;cross-conjugation&#x2019; can be viewed usefully to explain the strengths of all materials of this type. Note that para substitution is needed for conjugation (ortho substitution is also suitable in principle but the chain is generally sterically hindered). A similar situation pertains in polyesters where O replaces NH in the linking unit of the chain.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

</figure>
<a id="page_127" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 127, Functional polymers</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Unfortunately, rigidity generally hinders solvation, since the co-ordination of solvent molecules to the dissolved polymer solute requires flexibility and chain motion to maximize the energy benefit from dissolution. Rigidity also hinders molecular motion in the melt. It turns out that both poly (p- hydroxybenzoic acid) and poly (p-aminobenzoic acid) are insoluble and intractable materials, with very high melting points, (in excess of 600 &#x00B0;C) such that they decompose before melting even under inert atmospheres. Possible benefits in toughness and strength cannot therefore be turned into reality.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">However, a number of commercial high performance polymers are viable, depending on the added value of potential applications <i>versus</i> the greater production costs compared to more traditional versions of these polymers. There are several strategies, all of which involve backing off from the perfect cross-conjugated chain to trade-off strength against improved processability.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Alignment of linking units</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This exploits the relationship between isomeric polymers shown by nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>). Thus, while poly (aminobenzoic acid) has repeating CONH....CONH.... linkages, the equivalent chain from reaction of a diamine with a diacid can be envisaged as having the respective linkages alternating CONH....NHCO....CONH.... along the chain (see also page 6).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are similar resonance structures to describe the cross-conjugation possibilities, and likewise for the polyester equivalent (replace NH with O in the linking unit of the chain). In both of these all bonds in the linking units are more than single, but each alternate aromatic ring is &#x2018;disconnected&#x2019; from the next since two NH groups try to donate to the same ring, while two CO groups try to withdraw from the same ring.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This affects the polyamide system enough to produce the best known example of a commercial high performance polymer, Kevlar<sup>TM</sup>, first produced by Dupont in 1972 (<a href="#fig_6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>). (Aromatic polyamides are generally known as &#x2018;aramids&#x2019; in the industry.)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Note the use of the diacyl chloride for greater reactivity to promote polymerization, which needs a solvent mixture of <i>N</i>-methyl pyrrolidone and the toxic hexamethyl phosphoramide. Kevlar<sup>TM</sup> is not melt-processable because it decomposes below its still high melting point, but it can be processed from solution. The processing solvents are also unusual e.g. concentrated sulphuric acid. This requires use of acid-resistant apparatus which adds to the start-up costs of the commercial process.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 6.3</b> Synthesis of Kevlar<sup>TM</sup> high performance polyamide.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The monomers are relatively expensive and the commercial feasibility of this polymer revolves around the high added value nature of its applications. It is best known as the polymer used for bulletproof vests, which exploits its tremendous impact-resistance. Kevlar<sup>TM</sup> is usually solution-processed into fibres for weaving and if these are combined with an <a id="page_128" class="page">Page 128, Functional polymers</a>appropriate conventional polymer, then more cost-effective composites can be made, although there is a trade-off between properties. Kevlar<sup>TM</sup> fibres are used to reinforce car tyres.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;width:70%;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 6.4</b> Synthesis of Nomex<sup>TM</sup> high performance polyamide (note meta-linked aromatic rings).</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Aromatic ring substitution pattern and the Crankshaft Effect</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The above considerations have all assumed para connections between the aromatic rings and the linking units, which maintain conjugation and tend to keep a degree of linearity in the chain, which affects crystallinity and toughness. However, when simple para-linked systems were found to be too insoluble and to have too high a melting point for practical processing, the strategy was to employ meta-linked units. This disrupts conjugation in the aromatic rings and also &#x2018;kinks&#x2019; the polymer chain to affect physical properties.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The commercial polymer is Nomex<sup>TM</sup>, which is older than Kevlar<sup>TM</sup>, being first produced in the late 1960s by Du Pont (<a href="#fig_6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">This simultaneously exploits the crankshaft effect as well as the alternate alignment of linking units. The polymer is expensive, since meta-distributed aromatics are, in general, dearer than para-distributed analogues. Nomex<sup>TM</sup> has similar properties to aliphatic nylon polyamides at room temperature but is considerably better at higher temperatures (up to 200 &#x00B0;C). It is difficult to melt-process and is generally provided in fibre form or as paper sheets by interfacial polymerization and extrusion into a non-solvent. A further example of the crankshaft effect is to use naphthalene derivatives instead of benzene ones. The fused second ring skews the polymer chain, but the monomers required are relatively costly.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The relative cost of starting materials has prompted investigation of mixed para- and meta-linked systems, where a modicum of the crankshaft effect is imported to enhance processability. A typical strategy for a polyester might be to employ quinol as a paradihydroxy compound, since the meta-diol is considerably more expensive than the meta diacid derivative, and to use a mixture of terephthalate and isophthalate monomers as the acid components. The diacyl chlorides could be used to improve reactivity, but it is less desirable for polyesters than polyamides to allow the generation of hydrogen chloride as a byproduct, so an alternative strategy exploits a transesterification reaction in the reverse sense to that previously encountered in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>. Instead of a volatile alcohol such as methanol being evolved to drive over the equilibrium, the alcohol component is used as the ester of a volatile acid. Quinol diacetate evolves acetic acid during the polymerization to give the appropriate molar mass.</p>
<a id="page_129" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 129, Functional polymers</a>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Transesterification with commercial polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Since polyethylene terephthalate is a cheap and readily available material that contains terephthalate units (see page 90), another strategy towards chain rigidity involves transesterification of this polymer with an appropriately reactive but more expensive quinol derivative or polyester containing quinol units. This evolves ethylene glycol during the reaction and yields essentially a random copolymer with a high degree of aromaticity in the chain, punctuated by occasional flexible sp<sup>3</sup> carbon links from residual ethylene glycol units.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Substitution on the aromatic rings</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A final strategy to disrupt the strict linearity of the aromatic linked high performance polymer chain is to put groups in the rings to induce steric interactions that hinder crystallinity. An obvious example is to use, for example, a methyl substituent (i.e. replace an aromatic proton by a substituent group R in <a href="#fig_6.3">Figs 6.3</a> or <a href="#fig_6.4">6.4</a>). However, whether as part of the diacid or on the diol unit, the starting materials are relatively expensive, and even when copolymerized with somewhat cheaper unsubstituted units the materials are less cost-effective.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Main chain liquid crystalline polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">High performance polymers of the types described above are sometimes termed &#x2018;main chain liquid crystal polymers&#x2019; because rigid materials can display certain co-operative properties associated with solids when they are either in the melt or sometimes in solution. Such high performance polymers as can be melted show thermotropic liquid crystallinity, while in solution Kevlar<sup>TM</sup> (which cannot be melt-processed) displays the less common lyotropic (solution) liquid crystallinity.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are subtle consequences of this phenomenon, since the liquids show anisotropic shear dependence of viscosity. This means they flow more readily in the direction of shear than normal polymer solutions. Special processing apparatus is required and a company desiring to produce items made from these materials has an additional start-up cost. Furthermore, differential cooling of a melt near the edge of a mould, and the presence of necessary additives such as mould-release agents and lubricants, further complicates the moulding process and mitigates against simplistic economic considerations when addressing potential applications. Nevertheless, high performance polymers remain a useful example of structure&#x2013;property relationships applied to polymeric materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Other functionalities are available, with consequence upon properties, and polyether etherketone (PEEK), (<a href="#fig_6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>) is a successful commercial polymer with &#x2018;high-performance&#x2019; mechanical properties.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.3&#160;&#160;Electrically conducting polymers</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Principles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Polymers are best known for their effectiveness as electrical insulators, and electrical wiring throughout the world is now sheathed in plastic. However, it was recognized some time ago that polymers with an appropriate structure ought to be able to conduct electricity, but the same features that might allow this phenomenon also introduce intractability and processing difficulties, and hence the science of conducting polymers had to wait until the mid 1970s when better defined materials started to be made. There are now numerous polymers with substantial conductivities, as can be seen compared with inorganic materials in <a href="#fig_6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>. The backbone structures of the most important conducting polymers are given in <a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>. (Note&#x2014;these are different systems to those obtained by adding conducting fillers such as carbon black to conventional polymers&#x2014;see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_50">page 50</a>)</p>

<a id="page_131" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 131, Functional polymers</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">For electrical conductivity it is necessary to transfer charge along a conjugated chain, between chains, and also along grain boundaries or between particles as shown schematically in <a href="#fig_6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>. The most difficult process energetically will control the rate of charge transport and this will vary with the nature of the polymer, its physical form and other parameters, but in all cases conjugation along the chain is necessary although it is not sufficient for carbonaceous polymers simply to possess a conjugated chain. <a href="#fig_6.8">Figure 6.8</a> shows the polymer polyacetylene, which may be considered an archetypal system. Conducting polymers tend to fall into two distinct types, those similar to polyacetylene and those similar to polypyrrole, although with discoveries of yet more materials, the distinction becomes less evident.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">(NB: measurement of conductivity is not a simple task. Effects of AC and DC currents can be different and thin films may show different phenomena compared to, for example, compressed pellets or powders. Conductivities are usually quoted from measurement at low values of DC current performed by a method to avoid contact resistance phenomena.)</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Polyacetylene and related materials</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The simplest conjugated polymer chain is a polyacetylene chain, which may be represented in shorthand in <a href="#fig_6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;" id="fig_6.9">
 <img src="../images/page131-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 6.9</b> Resonance of a neutral polyacetylene chain.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Charge motion, shown by &#x2018;curly arrows&#x2019;, produces a dipolar form. Such charge separation is counter to coulombic forces and thus requires a significant input of energy. Consequently, &#x2018;neutral&#x2019; polyacetylene does not conduct at room temperature.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another way of putting this is that all bonding orbitals are filled and the gap between the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied (LUMO) orbitals cannot be bridged in this temperature regime. However, if the HOMO is incompletely filled then a different situation arises. Now, for example, a positive charge (missing electron) could move along the chain without the problem of charge separation, as shown in <a href="#fig_6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>. Note that the &#x2018;herringbone&#x2019; pattern of double bonds reverses at the charged discontinuity.</p>

<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:9em;"><b>Fig. 6.10</b> Resonance of a single positive charge (polaron) along a polyacetylene chain.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Removal of an electron to leave the positive charge is an oxidation reaction which can be performed by a chemical oxidant or electrochemically (<a href="#fig_6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>). In both cases the positive chain requires compensation by an anionic <a id="page_132" class="page">Page 132, Functional polymers</a>species from the system (chemical oxidants will have associated anions, while an electrochemical cell contains an electrolyte salt to carry current). This anion must penetrate the polymer matrix and diffusion also affects conductivity build-up. The depiction in <a href="#fig_6.11">Fig. 6.11</a> is simplistic, since many more than one charge will be present on any one chain. Unlike polypyrrole it is readily possible to make a polyacetylene chain negative by reduction, as also shown in <a href="#fig_6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">So the production of conducting polyacetylene is a two-stage process. First the polymer is prepared in its neutral, non-conducting form. Acetylene (ethyne) and is readily polymerized by a Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalyst (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>) such as AlEt<sub>3</sub>/Ti(OBu)<sub>4</sub> in toluene. Low temperatures favour the <i>cis</i> isomer while temperatures towards 100 &#x00B0;C favour the <i>trans</i> isomer. Although polyacetylene has this complication of <i>cis/trans</i> isomerization in the neutral form, the polymer automatically converts to the <i>trans</i> isomer in the conducting form and <a href="#fig_6.12">Fig. 6.12</a> shows the enhancement of conductivity as polyacetylene is exposed to iodine oxidant. Note the tremendous change as the same sample goes through an increase of 14 orders of magnitude in conductivity. Very few bulk materials can show a similar phenomenon and when it is also noted that a wide range of other properties such as density, porosity, surface energy, charge storage, colour and morphology also change with oxidation level, then the great present interest in conducting polymers is explained.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The charged conducting forms of conducting polymers are often termed in the literature &#x2018;doped&#x2019;, by analogy with semiconductors such as silicon, which becomes conducting upon &#x2018;doping&#x2019; with small quantities of different valence species such as phosphorous atoms, although the charge levels are very different between semi conductors and conducting polymers.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Doping is an equilibrium and gaseous iodine is evolved from the doped polymer; thus iodine-doped polyacetylene is not useful in practical applications. However, this clean solvent-free system in which the solid polymer is doped with a gaseous oxidant remains useful for mechanistic and theoretical studies.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The most conductive polymer to date is polyacetylene prepared very carefully to avoid defects such as sp<sup>3</sup> carbons, cross-links or side products that interfere with conjugation. Other defects include carboxyl groups or hydroxyl groups from attack of oxygen, because a major drawback of polyacetylene is its sensitivity to air. The highest conductivity of doped polyacetylene is close to that of copper, but this does not mean that these materials will replace <a id="page_133" class="page">Page 133, Functional polymers</a>copper in wires. The ductility, pliability, strength and temperature-resistance of copper will always give it the advantage as a simple current-carrier, but the benefit of a conducting polymer is where other properties are required in addition to the ability to conduct electricity.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;" id="fig_6.13">
 <img src="../images/page133-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="margin-top:1em;margin-left:9em;width:70%;"><b>Fig. 6.13</b> Possible &#x2018;all-plastic&#x2019; battery; electrode reactions exemplified by polyacetylene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Such an application is one which exploits the ability of polyacetylene to become positively or negatively charged. This allows the possibility of an all-plastic battery as shown in <a href="#fig_6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>. Lithium perchlorate is driven out of the electrodes as the cell is discharged, and then back in again upon recharging. Either half-cell could be employed with a more traditional battery electrode and many cationic-chain conducting polymers such as polypyrrole can be used as one electrode. At the moment problems of shelf-life, cycle life and stability mitigate against more widespread usage although there are promising niche applications.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are other polymers similar to polyacetylene which are prepared in a neutral form before separate conversion to a charged conducting form. These include poly (p-phenylene) (PPP) and poly (phenylene vinylene (PPV) as shown in <a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">PPP requires forcing conditions (e.g. AsF<sub>5</sub> oxidant) to dope into its conducting form. This precludes routine use in conducting applications and it is actually commercially viable in its neutral form as an insulating coating.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">PPV may be considered an alternating copolymer of polyacetylene and PPP. It is attracting attention because of its photophysical properties as the basis of a polymer light-emitting diode (LED) in which an electrical potential is converted into the emission of light. This requires the availability of charge carriers with appropriate energetics, but the polymer must be in the neutral uncharged form or it would short itself out rather than emit light. Normal LEDs are small-scale inorganic crystals such as gallium arsenide, and benefits of polymers include the possibility of large area displays, greater processability and the ability to tailor the emitted wavelengths of light to give a range of colours by control of structure.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">PPV can be substituted on the aromatic ring (e.g. ortho&#x2013;methoxy) and on the bridging unit (e.g. cyano replaces alkene H). This represents the sort of functional manipulation that is possible. Substituted monomers can be used as homopolymers or else copolymerized with other PPV units.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Precursor routes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The structural feature of extended conjugated double bonds confers rigidity in the polymer. Conducting polymers do not have carbonyl or amido functions in the chain as do the high performance polyesters and polyamides discussed in <a href="#sec_6.2">Section 6.2</a> so there is less hydrogen bonding, although there are polar interactions between the chains and the dopant ions in the ionomeric conducting forms. The result is that conducting polymers are not as strong as<a id="page_134" class="page">Page 134, Functional polymers</a>high performance polymers and can be more flexible. They do not dissolve as readily and attempts to melt them produce decomposition. Three main strategies have been employed to circumvent this problem of processability in the conducting form: two are to involve either employment of a functionalized monomer or to incorporate some other processability-enhancing components in the final polymer, and both strategies have been employed with the polypyrrole class of polymer and are further discussed below. The third strategy is used for the polyacetylene class and the idea is to make a processable precursor polymer. This non-conjugated, hence non-conductive polymer, tends to have more conventional polymer properties and thus can be processed into the desired format and converted to the conducting form afterwards. This is exactly the strategy employed for three-dimensional networks (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>) which have similar processing problems when in the final form and require the involvement of processable intermediates. Elegant precursor routes have been devised for polyacetylene, PPP and PPV. These are given in <a href="#fig_6.14">Fig. 6.14</a> and demonstrate the depth of subtlety in organic chemistry that can be employed in polymer science.</p>

<a id="page_135" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 135, Functional polymers</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The route to polyacetylene was devised by scientists at Durham University in collaboration with British Petroleum and involves a ring-opening metathesis reaction (ROMP; see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>) to produce the processable precursor which then undergoes a thermal retrocycloaddition reaction to give polyacetylene with release of hexafluoroxylene. A number of variations on this route have been devised to control the final step in different thermal conditions with release of different molecules.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The route to PPV has been exploited by among others Cambridge University, the University of California and related commercial organizations and again uses an elimination reaction to produce the conjugated chain. Further sophistications have been introduced to produce derivatives of PPV, or else functionalized copolymers, and the scheme is representative. The route to PPP developed by ICI involves a neat bacterial oxidation as a key step.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Polypyrrole and related polymers</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is now by far the most widely studied class of conducting polymers. Pyrrole (or similar monomer) is oxidized either chemically or electrochemically to give the polymer directly in its positively charged conducting form, charge-compensated by anions from the oxidizing medium. A plausible mechanism is shown in <a href="#fig_6.15">Fig. 6.15</a>. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and here the monomer forms a radical cation that dimerises with proton loss.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The intermediate dimer has longer conjugation than the monomer and hence oxidizes onwards in the reaction conditions to give the polymer, which must be predominantly linked at ring positions next to the nitrogen atom to maintain conductivity. It is found that there is one charge per three or four pyrrole rings, across a range of preparation conditions. It is more difficult to obtain an intermediate doping level in this polymer than it is for the iodine doping of poly acetylene (<a href="#fig_6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>). In the pyrrole structure the anion could be Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and FeCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> from FeCl<sub>3</sub> or an anion from the electrolyte.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polypyrrole requires a single step to be produced in the conducting form and, in the reverse sense to polyacetylene requires a reduction step to convert to the neutral form. Reduction gives a tremendous conductivity change accompanied by changes in many other properties including colour. A very thin film of polypyrrole is dark green&#x2013;blue in the conducting form and yellow in the neutral. For polythiophene the respective colours are blue and orange, which offers greater promise for electrochromic (electrical colour</p>

<p class="noindentt">changing) displays as shown in <a href="#fig_6.16">Fig. 6.16</a>. An important point is that these polymers offer opportunities for large area displays.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Other effects of redox are useful, particularly since these polymers seem intrinsically more biocompatible than metals. They can act as electrically switched perm-selective ion-exchange membranes and, if the simple anion BF<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is replaced by a bioactive anion such as salicylate (aspirin) or glutamate, then an electrically driven drug delivery system is possible to release specific amounts by external control of the reduction current. There is also a change in size and solvent-swelling properties during redox and thus a possible application is &#x2018;artificial muscles&#x2019; in which electrically controlled expansion and contraction is exploited.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polypyrrole is surprisingly tolerant of preparation conditions, particularly given the intermediacy of cationic species which in principle could be attacked by nucleophiles. It can even be prepared in water and is stable in both air and water in its conducting form (unlike polyacetylene). It is less stable, however, to oxygen in its neutral uncharged form although other polymers of this class, such as polythiopene, suffer less from this problem. Polypyrrole is the easiest conducting polymer to prepare. A very wide range of chemical oxidizing conditions will produce a powder, while electrochemistry in a wide range of conditions also produces freestanding films that can be peeled from an electrode if desired. Subtle differences between samples require accurate description of preparation conditions to maintain reproducibility. This is because conducting polymers in their ionomeric forms are non-stoichiometric compounds and thus are different to conventional polymer systems where properties and structures are less dependent on exact preparation protocol.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A further benefit of the polypyrrole class of polymer is the range of structural manipulations that can be performed (<a href="#fig_6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>). Conductivity may be diminished to some extent compared to the simple polypyrrole archetype, but often other beneficial properties may be enhanced.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1t">All of these approaches can produce acceptable conducting polymers. If the substituent group R is alkyl or alkoxy then the polymer can have solubility in organic solvents while, if R is an alkanesulphonic acid chain or its salt (e.g. <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mo>-</mo><mtext>C</mtext><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><mtext>C</mtext><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><mtext>S</mtext><msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>), then the polymer has some solubility in water in its charged form because the anionic dopant is attached permanently to the polymer chain. These so-called &#x2018;self-doped&#x2019; materials have yet further ion-exchange properties.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Quite complex groups such as dye molecules (photoactive), redox species (e.g. ferrocenyl groups) with further electron transfer effects, co-ordinating ligands (e.g. bipyridine units to sequester metals such as ruthenium), or electrocatalytic species can all be attached to the monomer ring. If these are so bulky that the pure monomer cannot polymerize then copolymerization with non-functionalized (and non-sterically hindered) pyrrole monomer allows formation of a copolymer in which the functional species are present proportionally along the chain (i.e. exemplifying the principle shown by the symbol Y in <a href="#fig_6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>). Many other copolymer systems can be proposed, even with conventional polymers, with suitable chemistry. The nature of the dopant anion A<sup>&#x2212;</sup> also affects polymers more than might be expected. Even changes between simple organic and inorganic anions such as <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">ClO</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msubsup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">BF</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">CH</mi></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><msubsup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">SO</mi></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>, trifluoromethanesulphonate, p-toluene sulphonate and other sulphonate salts can significantly alter conductivity, elasticity, flexibility, permeability, morphology, and other physical and mechanical properties. However, more complex anions may be incorporated, such as sulphonated derivatives of phthalocyanines (photoactive and catalytic species), bipyridines (metal co-ordination complexes), sulphonated conventional polymers acting as polyanions (e.g. polystyrene sulphonate) and bioactive anion species such as heparin (the aim being to coat metal implants in medical systems to avoid rejection since heparin is the natural blood anticoagulant). More than one anion can be incorporated, such as a small amount of a functionalized anion bolstered by a simpler one.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another consequence of biocompatibility is that nerve regrowth may be facilitated upon a conducting polymer template. This addresses a longstanding problem in medicine. It is also possible to entrap proteins and enzymes in a polypyrrole film as it is formed. Glucose oxidase continues to act when immobilized in polypyrrole and there is considerable scope for novel biosensors with this technology.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Composites</b></h3>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polypyrrole has an ability to blend with conventional polymers giving a trade-off in properties between the two polymer systems. A charged conventional polymer (such as polystyrene sulphonate) can be used as polyanion dopant, but a simpler approach is to saturate a conventional polymer (chain- or step- growth depending on compatibility) with for example pyrrole vapour, and then expose to an oxidant, or else saturate the conventional polymer with an<a id="page_138" class="page">Page 138, Functional polymers</a>oxidant and then perfuse with the monomer. Electrochemical polymerization can be achieved by moving strips of conventional polymers perfused with the monomer over electrodes that are also rollers in a film-producing process. Laminates, latices, emulsions and suspensions may also be made. Applications such as anti-static (very important to protect computer chips) or shielding from electromagnetic interference (also important because of the density of emitters and receivers for communications in modem life) do not require great conductivity, so a balance between processability and conductivity may be achieved. There are a vast range of systems which may be considered and composites of many heteroaromatic conducting polymers are widely studied.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Polyaniline</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Polyaniline (<a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>) is not strictly a heteroaromatic monomer but has a number of similarities to polypyrrole (chemical oxidation to &#x2018;aniline blacks&#x2019; has been long known as &#x2018;pyrrole blacks&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Similar studies on electrochemical and chemical oxidation, redox behaviour, the presence of additional functionality, processability etc. have been performed as for polypyrrole and its derivatives and polyaniline has unique features. There is an extra equilibrium in the switching between conducting and insulating forms, as shown in <a href="#fig_6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>. The figure also gives representative chain units in the various forms (3&#x2013;6). (There are three redox levels, each of which may be protonated or deprotonated.) Of these, the pH- driven switch between emeraldine salt and emeraldine base is attracting interest (shown as structures 1 and 2 in <a href="#fig_6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polyaniline is less tolerant of preparation conditions than polypyrrole and the list of anion dopants used in the preparation is more limited. However, subsequent replacement of preparation anion by a dodecyl benzene sulphonate makes polyaniline become soluble in solvents such as <i>N</i>-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), or m-cresol, and can be spin-coated or otherwise solution-processed. This anion exchange is an example of post-treatment, which is another way to modify conducting polymer properties, although not widely used for polypyrrole.</p>

<a id="page_139" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 139, Functional polymers</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Functionalized anilines may also be polymerized, although the derivatives so far studied are less complex than those for polypyrrole.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Polyaniline-composite textiles have also been prepared and processing features of the polymer are useful. In addition, in Victorian times the capabilities of &#x2018;aniline black&#x2019; (deep green when dispersed) to protect against corrosion were appreciated and iron seats at railway stations, exposed to the weather, were coated in a polyaniline-containing lacquer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In summary, conducting polymers provide a classic example of structure- property relationships in which the inherent macromolecular nature of a polymer combines with functionality to produce features that lead to applications well outside the normal run for conventional polymers.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.4&#160;&#160;Polymers with functionalized side chains</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Principles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This provides a large class of useful polymers, and the full range of polymer-supported reagents provides a breadth beyond the scope of this <i>Primer</i>. The idea is to employ traditional polymeric physical properties from the backbone chain while adding external properties from the side chains. Ion-exchange resins are a simple example. A key feature of any exchange chromatography system is that a reactive stationary phase be employed that is readily separated from the eluent containing the desired target molecule. Polymer beads can be made accurately to desired dimensions and, if suitably cross-linked, will not dissolve in the eluting solvent. Polystyrene cross-linked with divinyl benzene is a popular system. If the beads are derivatized such that the surfaces contain exposed acidic groups (e.g. sulphonic acids, phosphoric acids, carboxylates, etc.) or basic groups (various amine functionalities) (<a href="#fig_6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>), then passage of a pH-sensitive species past the beads will result in ion-exchange equilibria being set up. Optically active immobilized species can also enhance chiral separation. The beads can contain other functionalities to entrap reaction intermediates or products. The important feature is the ease of separation of the polymer-bound reagent from other species, and the desired product may either be deliberately attached to the polymer, and so removed with the polymer to a separate vessel and recovered, or else left in the original solution when unwanted species which attach themselves to the polymer are removed.</p>

<p class="nointent2" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 6.19</b> Examples of functionalities used in polystyrene ion-exchange resins.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A sophisticated example of the principle involves the polymer coating of magnetic iron oxide to give &#x2018;magnetic beads&#x2019;. If these are then also coated with, for example a biological antibody or similar species, then this can &#x2018;clamp on&#x2019; to its target biomolecule from a mixture. The beads can then be removed by a magnet for separation and onward treatment.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The list of chemical reagents that can be attached to polymers by various strategies is long and there are important modem developments based in particular upon the ease of removing a polymer-based reagent from a reaction mixture. The first of these was the Merrifield synthesis of amino acids, joined in the correct order by peptide (amide) linkages.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">First, a polystyrene bead is converted to the chloromethylated derivative by electrophilic attack and then the desired amino acid previously protected at its amino group, displaces the chlorine by nucleophilic substitution using its <a id="page_140" class="page">Page 140, Functional polymers</a>carboxylate group. The protecting group is removed and now another protected amino acid is added via a coupling agent. Further deprotection and reaction with yet another protected amino acid allows the desired peptide to grow away from the polystyrene bead. Final scission with hydrogen fluoride removes the peptide from the bead as shown in <a href="#fig_6.20">Fig. 6.20</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The whole process can be automated, since the beads are readily separated for filtering and washing after each step, whereas side-products remain in solution for disposal. The synthesis, named after the 1984 Nobel Prize Winner, would be very cumbersome if all steps took place in solution, with traditional isolation and extraction of products after each step.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The principle has now been extended in the development of combinatorial chemical synthesis (sometimes called &#x2018;chemical libraries&#x2019;), as shown in</p>

<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig_6.21">Fig. 6.21</a>. This provides a rapid screening system, for example for the preparetion of a number of members of a class of compounds which might have pharmaceutical activity. An initial substrate molecule is attached to a polymer before the sample is divided and exposed to different reagents A, B and C. Each product is further divided and exposed to reagents D, E and F. The benefit again is that the products remain attached to the polymer throughout the manipulation, until the initial linkage (which must be labile in appropriate conditions) is cleaved to liberate each of the nine possible products (3 &#x00D7; 3) as shown. Tens of thousands of products can be obtained very rapidly by this procedure which has had a considerable impact upon synthetic chemistry.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Thermotropic Liquid crystals show co-operative behaviour over the temperature range just after they start to melt. Essentially, to exhibit this phenomenon, a molecule needs to have a high aspect ratio, i.e. its length should be several times its cross-sectional area. Examples are given in <a href="#fig_6.22">Fig. 6.22</a>. Such rod-like<a id="page_142" class="page">Page 142, Functional polymers</a>molecules cannot easily tumble past each other when lattice bonds are broken at the onset of melting. Instead, a number of ordered liquid forms can occur as planes of molecules start to float apart, still keeping interplanar integrity, leading to a smectic (soap-like) phase. The liquid looks milky due to scattering by particles of similar dimensions to the wavelengths of visible light. Further heating produces disruption of intraplanar forces, but still the molecules cannot freely tumble and hence the nematic (thread-like) phase is formed. Finally, further heating provides sufficient energy for tumbling to give the optically transparent normal isotropic liquid with random orientation of each molecule. If the molecule has a dipolar structure the polar vector remains in the ordered liquid forms to interact with electromagnetic radiation and allow the molecules to respond to an electric field. The liquid crystal displays, for example in wristwatches, employ a polarizing filter to provide a directional sense to light passing through the liquid crystal phase, the ordering of which can be modulated by the electric field produced by the watch battery. Photoactive molecules may also exhibit non-linear optical effects (for example, frequency doubling) which are of interest in the development of optical data storage, &#x2018;optical computers&#x2019; and other optical equivalents of electronic systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The importance for polymers is that when a small molecule liquid crystal is attached to a suitable polymer backbone chain by a sufficiently flexible spacer linkage, and, if there is not too high a density of such side chains (i.e. not on every monomer unit), then co-operative liquid crystalline behaviour and associated phenomena from the side chains will still be observed. Side chain liquid crystal polymers offer flexibility, robustness and strength over small molecule analogues, and in display systems suffer less from parasitic degradative electrochemical discharge at the electrode (which is meant to be there only to induce an electric field and not to initiate electrochemistry).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The attachment of liquid crystal side chains is typical of strategies for side chain polymer modification and extension to other chemistries for attachment of other functionalities can easily be imagined.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The commonest backbones used are polyacrylates and polysiloxanes. Each requires a different end-group on the spacer chain for attachment. <a href="#fig_6.23">Figure 6.23</a> shows an alcohol-ended unit that can be attached to, for example, polyethylacrylate (polypropenoic acid ethyl ester) by a simple transesterification reaction, yielding an equilibrium polymer containing azo side units and unreacted ethyl groups.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the production of printed circuit boards for microelectronics, or in compact disc manufacture there may be over 20 different layers of materials. Laying down of these with appropriate microscopic definition often involves protecting one area of the surface to let another process occur only on desired regions. This is achieved by polymers that either react to cross-link under irradiation, or else decompose under irradiation. The former protect a defined area against reaction in the next step while the latter degrade the polymer coating to allow subsequent reaction on the previously covered area.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">If acrylamide (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCONH<sub>2</sub>), a divinyl cross-linker, and a photosensitizer are irradiated at an appropriate wavelength (often in the ultraviolet region), then the exposed areas become coated in an insoluble polymer, while washing with water removes unreacted monomers from areas that were masked from light. Alternatively, organic-soluble polyvinyl cinnamate (an analogue of polyvinyl acetate (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>) with PhCH=CH COO replacing CH<sub>3</sub> COO in the pendant group) may be spin-coated on to a surface and, where irradiated, becomes cross-linked by cyclodimerization so again cannot be washed off. Similarly, heat-treated (and precyclized) polyisoprene may also cross-link under irradiation in the presence of a suitable sensitizer.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In the reverse sense polysilanes (which contain direct Si&#x2013;Si bonds and are more reactive than siloxanes) degrade upon exposure to light such that the polymer is lost from the exposed area, but remains intact under the mask. Other systems include novolak phenol&#x2013;formaldehyde resins (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#Ch05">Chapter 5</a>) with naphthalene diazoquinone sulphonate (NDS) as photosensitizer. Photolysis<a id="page_144" class="page">Page 144, Functional polymers</a>causes complex chemistry with evolution of nitrogen and rearrangement to form a more soluble polymer that is washed from the exposed regions. Considerable developmental effort has gone into the optimization of the specialized polymer systems.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.6&#160;&#160;Polymers in the environment</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The functionality in this case is the role of the polymer in the ecosystem. This is a large topic and this <i>Primer</i> is closed with a few comments on key issues. These include bioproduction of useful technological polymers, remediation and biodegradability, and waste treatment and recycling. All of these have long-term implications for the ecosphere.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Many polymers, particularly polyalkenes (polyethene, polypropene), polyhalocarbons (PVC, PITH) and aromatic-containing step-growth systems (PET, polycarbonates, some polyamides) are very resistant to microbial degradation. In ultraviolet-stabilized grades with antioxidants they are difficult to break down by exposure to the elements and so remain in the environment for a long time. They also require consumption of non-replaceable petroleum for their feedstocks.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">They can be destroyed by incineration and so return some useful heat energy, but can cause emission into the atmosphere of catalyst residues and species derived from additives, which may involve toxic heavy metals and other problematic materials. In principle, polymers based on carbon, oxygen and nitrogen could be burnt cleanly, but halogen-containing polymers have difficulty with the fate of the halogen atoms. PVC must be incinerated at very high temperatures otherwise partial combustion leads to cyclization reactions with the formation of toxic dioxins, while PTFE evolves fluoro species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The key aspect is to know which polymers are present in the waste sample. Only when one is sure of polymer identity can recycling become feasible.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">PET can be reused directly as a lower grade material following reprocessing; for example, it can be ground up and reconstituted as insulation boards to replace polystyrene, where the higher melting point of PET <i>versus</i> polystyrene (260 &#x00B0;C <i>versus</i> 100 &#x00B0;C) allows use of hot-melt adhesives in board preparation.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Step-growth polymers can generally be hydrolysed back to their original components for re-use, but chain polymers require thermal degradation back to the monomer, usually in forcing conditions. At present this is costly, but the economics may become overturned if environmental legislation forces the issue. The disposal of car tyres is an obvious chain polymer target to be addressed.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another strategy is to develop polymers which are more readily degraded in the environment. However, there must be a balance between loss of desirable properties and decomposition rate. For engineering applications attack by environmental vectors could be dangerous, but is acceptable for high volume low grade packaging materials.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">When polyethene is prepared by free radical reaction in the presence of carbon monoxide a small number of carbonyl-derived units appear in the chain. Polyethene is usually quite resistant to photodegradation, but this makes it open to attack by sunlight when inappropriately discarded in the environment.</p>
<a id="page_145" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 145, Functional polymers</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Decomposition by bacteria and micro-organisms is attractive for polymers left in landfill sites, but many materials are quite resistant: for example, PVC, PET, polypropene and polystyrene seem to be immune to enzymatic attack. Natural biopolymers offer opportunities for remediation. The difficulty in practical applications is finding materials with the correct physical properties and processing characteristics. One approach is to blend a bioactive species with a traditional polymer. Thus plastic bags can be made from polyethene mixed with the cheap oligosaccharide (sugar-derivative) starch. The idea is that attack on the starch by micro-organisms in a landfill will break the bag down to smaller particles.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Some synthetic polymers are more readily attacked by biovectors than others. Thus polyurethanes, particularly polyether&#x2013;polyurethanes, can be degraded over time and their general biocompatibility allows use in disposable artificial sutures and in other biomedical applications requiring self-destruction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are many esterases (enzymes that hydrolyse esters) in the environment but they do not attack aromatic esters such as PET. Aliphatic esters are open to bioattack but generally have less desirable physical properties than aromatic ones (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#Ch04">Chapter 4</a>), though they are suitable for some applications. The synthetic polymer polycaprolactone (<a href="#fig_6.25">Fig. 6.25a</a>) is susceptible to environmental degradation, as are hydroxy-functionalized polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and its ester derivatives (e.g. polyvinyl acetate, see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#Ch03">Chapter 3</a>) and cellulose derivatives provided that not all the hydroxy groups are functionalized i.e. there is a free &#x2212;OH available.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Finally, a most desirable situation is one in which a relatively simple and processable polymer can be produced naturally on a sufficient scale for practical usage, and also be biodegradable. Cellulose fits this description but requires the processing strategies given in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#Ch01">Chapter 1</a>. Another class of natural material, first identified in 1925 but now better appreciated, is aliphatic polyesters, exemplified by polyhydroxy butyrate (<a href="#fig_6.25">Fig. 6.25c</a>). This is synthesized as an energy storage medium by the bacterium <i>Alcaligenes eutrophus</i> and is obtained in 100% isotactic stereochemistry from bacterial cultures. Some mechanical properties are similar to polypropene (flexural modulus, tensile strength), but with poorer extension-to-break. It is useful as a packaging material and is completely biodegradable. Polyhydroxyvalerate (<a href="#fig_6.25">Fig. 6.25c</a>) is a homologue, also produced by bacteria. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a semi-synthetic material produced by step-growth polymerization of lactic acid, which is obtained by fermentation. In this case the product of polymer degradation can be metabolized and so PLA offers promise as an encapsulant for controlled release of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. It can also be used for sutures and other medical implants that are required to dissolve.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In summary, polymers have moved on considerably from the simple systems used only for their mechanical properties. This chapter has tried to give a flavour of the type of consideration important in modem functionalized systems.</p>
