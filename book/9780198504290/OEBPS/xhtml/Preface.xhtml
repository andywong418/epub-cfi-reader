<h1 class="main"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">Mathematics plays a central role in the life of every scientist and engineer, from the earliest school days to late on into the college and professional years. While the subject may be met with enthusiasm or reluctance, depending on individual taste, all are required to learn it to some degree at university level. This Primer is the &#x2018;worked examples&#x2019; half of a two-volume set that summarises the basic concepts and results which sould be familiar from high school, and then extends the ideas to cover the material needed by the majority of undergraduates. It assumes a familiarity with the theoretical content of the subject explained in the main maths Primer (OCP 77), and aims to bolster the reader&#x2019;s practical confidence by providing &#x2018;model answers&#x2019;, and additional comments, for a wide range of exercises.</p>   
<p class="fmindent">We would like to thank several friends and colleagues who showed keen interest in the project, and helped to facilitate its speedy conclusion: namely, Drs. Jerry Mayers, Jeff Penfold and Andrew Taylor. Professor Richard Compton&#x2019;s guidance and encouragement was invaluable throughout.</p>
