<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer Devinder Sivia and Steve Rawlings present a book of worked examples to complement their elegant introductory account of <i>Foundations of Science Mathematics</i> (Oxford Chemistry Primer 77). The two books together explain and illustrate in simple terms the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is essential knowledge for any practising scientist. These Primers will be of interest to all students of science (and their mentors).</p>
