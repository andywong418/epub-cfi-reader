<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">In the case of alkyl halides two main modes of nucleophilic substitution are possible. For those halides which can dissociate to give a stable carbocation this is the rate determining step. The subsequent reaction between the planar <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbocation and the nucleophile is very fast. The slow step only depends upon the alkyl halide and overall the reaction is called a S<sub>N</sub>1 process (substitution, nucleophilic, unimolecular) (<a href="#eq_5.1">eqn 5.1</a>). This is a typical reaction mechanism of tertiary halides, where the corresponding tertiary carbocation derives stability through hyper-conjugation.</p>

<p class="indent">Simple primary carbocations are too unstable to be formed in this way, and here the nucleophile approaches the alkyl halide so that the angle between it and the departing halogen is 180&#186;. A transition state develops in which the nucleophile and the halide ion are partially bonded to the alkyl residue. The reaction is thus bimolecular and the rate depends on both the concentrations of the nucleophile and the alkyl halide: it is designated a S<sub>N</sub>2 process (substitution, nucleophilic, unimolecular) (<a href="#eq_5.2">eqn 5.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of chlorobenzene, resonance between the lone pair electrons of the halogen atom and the &#960; system generates some double bond character (<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>), and thus extra strength, to the carbon&#8211;halogen bond (C&#8211;Cl bond lengths are 170 pm for chlorobenzene and 178 pm for <sup>t</sup>buty1 chloride). Further, the positive charge of the corresponding carbocation formed by the loss of the chloride anion would be accommodated in an <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> orbital orientated at right angles to the &#960; system, thereby preventing effective mutual overlap and charge delocalization. For these reasons the <i>S</i><small><sub>N</sub></small>1 reaction is not observed. <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter5 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a></p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.5em;">Whereas insufficient energy is available to allow dissociation of the C&#8211;Cl bond and the formation of the benzene carbocation, such species may be produced during the decomposition of diazonium salts. Here the elimination of a nitrogen molecule is a highly exothermic event providing the driving force for the reaction (see p.59).</p>

<p class="indent">The typical <small><i>S</i><sub>N</sub></small>2
process is equally disfavoured, since apart from repulsion between 
the nucleophile and the &#960; system, the geometry of the ring
prevents the development of the usual
<small><i>S</i><sub>N</sub></small>2 transition state where the
nucleophile and the leaving group are aligned in a linear fashion.
Despite this, nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions showing
second order kinetics do occur, but only for arenes containing
strongly electron withdrawing groups in the <i>ortho</i> and/or
<i>para</i> positions. An addition/elimination sequence is followed
and 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene, for example, can be reacted with
sodium methoxide to form 2,4,6-trinitromethoxy-benzene, (<a href="#eq_5.3">eqn 5.3</a>). The
effect of the nitro groups is firstly to reduce the electron density
of the &#960; system and allow the nucleophile (MeO<sup>&#8722;</sup>) to approach the ring and form a negatively
charged sigma complex (a Meisenheimer complex). This is then
stabilized through delocalization of the negative charge with the
nitro groups. The forward reaction eliminates chloride ion and
reforms the aromatic ring. Where the nucleophile and the leaving
group are chemically similar, mixtures form. For example, if
2,4,6-trinitromethoxybenzene is crystallized from ethanol a mixture
of starting material and 2,4,6-trinitroethoxybenzene is produced.
This illustrates just how easily a Meisenheimer complex can form:
here the activational effect is maximized since all three nitro
groups participate in the delocalization of the negative charge (eqn
<a href="#eq_5.3">5.4</a>).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.5em;">It is not always necessary to delocalize the negative charge of the Meisenheimer complex through conjugation with an unsaturated group such as <b>NO<sub>2</sub></b>. The presence of several strongly electronegative atoms may achieve the same result through inductive effects: thus 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene reacts with hot sodium hydroxide solution to afford 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (<a href="#eq_5.5">eqn 5.5</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2&#160;&#160;<b>Aryne formation</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Following these comments it might be supposed that a simple aryl halide like chlorobenzene would not react with nucleophiles. However, if chlorobenzene is heated at 350 &#186;C with sodium hydroxide under high pressure, sodium phenate is produced. Similarly if bromobenzene is treated with potassium amide, aniline is produced. Potassium amide is a very strong base and if bromobenzene which has been isotopically labelled at C-1 is used, it can be shown that the label is almost equally divided between C-1 and C-2 in the product (<a href="#eq_5.6">eqn 5.6</a>). <i>A direct replacement of the halogen atom does not occur</i><b>,</b> instead a highly strained and reactive molecule named benzyne is formed. The role of the strong base is thus to eliminate hydrogen bromide (as ammonia and bromide ion). Amide anion then attacks benzyne, prior to protonation and the formation of aniline. Overall this is an elimination&#8211;addition process, and since benzyne is symmetrical the addition of ammonia cannot be selective.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.5em;">The first step of <a href="#eq_5.7">eqn 5.6</a> is not concerted, but is an example of an E1<sub>C</sub>B reaction (Elimination from a conjugate Base). Deprotonation to an intermediate carbanion is fast and reversible but loss of bromide ion from the intermediate is slow and rate limiting.</p>

<p class="indent">Benzyne is the parent of a series of related molecules, collectively known as arynes, which can be synthesized from a variety of starting materials. For example, arynes are formed by the action of lithium or magnesium on 1<b>,</b>2-dihalobenzenes (<a href="#eq_5.7">eqn 5.7</a>). Benzyne is also considered to be generated in the reaction of chlorobenzene with sodium hydroxide, but since the latter reagent is a weaker base than potassium amide much more vigorous conditions are required (<a href="#eq_5.7">eqn 5.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Benzyne reacts with itself, in the absence of a suitable nucleophile, to give biphenylene (<a href="#eq_5.9">eqn 5.9</a>). Furthermore, it combines with dienes (as a dienophile) to give cyclo adducts. For example, with anthracene (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_80">p. 80</a>) benzyne yields triptycene (<a href="#eq_5.9">eqn 5.10</a>).</p>
