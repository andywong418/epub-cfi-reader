<p class="noindent">Methylbenzene is better known as toluene, and the dimethylbenzenes as <i>o</i>-, <i>m-</i>, and <i>p</i>-xylenes, depending on the relative orientations of the two methyl groups. 1,3,5-Methylbenzene is called mesitylene, and 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, durene. Previously benzene, toluene, and the xylenes were obtained almost exclusively from the light oil fraction of coal tar, but in modem times a major source is petroleum, via the aromatization of other hydrocarbons. Laboratory syntheses are usually achieved through direct alkylation of arenes by the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts method (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_14">p. 14</a>), although it is also possible to reduce carbonyl groups directly bonded to the ring by the Wolff&#x2013;Kishner procedure (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_72">p. 72</a>) or the Clemmensen reaction, just as in the aliphatic series.</p>
<p class="indent-bottom">Alkenylbenzenes are normally synthesized through the dehydration of arylalkanols, or by the dehydrohalogenation of arylalkyl halides (<a href="#fig_6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). The best known alkenylarene, ethenylbenzene (styrene), is obtained commercially from benzene in two steps: (i) alkylation with ethene in the presence of an acid or a Lewis acid, and (ii) dehydrogenation of the product, ethylbenzene, by heating over a catalyst at 600 &#x00B0;C (<a href="#eqn_6.1">eqn 6.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Styrene undergoes radical initiated polymerization with itself, to form polystyrene (<a href="#eqn_6.2">eqn 6.2</a>), or with other molecules to form copolymers; both processes have important commercial applications. First, attack of an initiating radical (R&#183;) is favoured at the (&#x03B2;-carbon atom of the side chain to give the <i>benzylic</i> radical (i.e. the radical centre is situated on the carbon next to the benzene ring) which, although resonance stabilized, enters readily into chain reactions utilizing the &#945; carbon as the centre for the chain extending process. Electrophiles (R<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) similarly attack the &#x03B2; position of styrene and thus afford benzylic cations, which are also resonance hybrids in which the positive charge is delocalized by the &#960; system of the benzene nucleus (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). In the presence of a nucleophile (X<sup>-</sup>) the carbocation is attacked at the &#945; carbon (<a href="#eqn_6.3">eqn 6.3</a>); thus the overall process is an addition to the double bond which, in the case of styrene itself, follows the Markownikoff rule (i.e. the attack of the electrophile proceeds to give the &#x2018;better&#x2019; carbocation, prior to the addition of the nucleophile).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Substituents in the benzene ring may influence the mode of reaction. For example, strongly electron withdrawing groups at the <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> sites will destabilize a cationic centre at the benzylic position and thus favour anti-Markownikoff addition.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">It is important to note that, although the carbocation is resonance stabilized, the major contributor has the charge located in the side chain thereby retaining an aromatic sextet of electrons. For this reason reaction with the nucleophile occurs in the side chain and not in the nucleus. Hydrogen bromide, reacts with styrene and gives 1-bromoethylbenzene (<a href="#eqn_6.4">eqn 6.4a</a>), but if a peroxide initiator is present bromine atoms are produced, and these react with styrene to form the benzylic radical. The radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from hydrogen bromide to give 2-bromoethyl-benzene and another bromine atom. A chain reaction is thus established (<a href="#eqn_6.4">eqn 6.4b</a>). <a id="page_33" class="page">page 33, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Styrene adds halogens across the double bond and can be hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions to give ethylbenzene (<a href="#fig_6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>); it also reacts with peroxides to afford the corresponding oxirane, styrene oxide. This molecule can be ring opened with nucleophiles, which attack at the less hindered &#x03B2; position.

<p class="noindent">Aryl halides (halobenzenes) are compounds in which the halogen atom is directly bonded to the aromatic ring. Benzyl halides (phenylmethyl halides) have a single halogen atom attached to the &#945; carbon atom of an alkyl side chain (i.e. the carbon atom adjacent to the aromatic nucleus). The terms benzal and benzo refer to phenylmethyl di- and tri-halo compounds respectively (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_34">p. 34</a>). The position of halogen atoms at other positions in the side chains of alkyl benzenes should be denoted by either a number or a Greek letter. <a id="page_34" class="page">page 34, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">The usual route to aryl halides is through the direct halogenation of the arenes in the presence of a Lewis acid (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_14">p. 14</a>). It is also possible to use the diazonium salts as starting materials (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_59">p. 59</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">If the hydroxyl group is benzylic, the corresponding carbocation is stabilized by resonance and is easily formed. This species may then eliminate a proton and give the corresponding styrene, rather than a benzyl halide.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Arylalkyl halides (X &#x003D; Cl or Br) are obtained either from the corresponding alcohols by reaction with the appropriate phosphorus halides, or halogen acids (<a href="#eqn_6.6">eqn 6.6</a>), or by the addition of halogen acids to arylalkenes (see above).</p>
<figure id="eqn_6.6">
<img src="../images/page34-1.jpg" alt="img"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzyl chlorides are available through the chloromethylation of arenes with formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride. Direct chlorination of toluene in sunlight, or treatment with sulphuryl chloride in the presence of dibenzoylperoxide as initiator, gives, in sequence, benzyl chloride, benzal chloride, and benzotrichloride (<a href="#eqn_6.7">eqn 6.7a</a>, <a href="#eqn_6.7">b</a>). This reaction is similar to the radical chain chlorination of methane, and is facilitated because the benzylic radicals involved are stabilized through the delocalization of their unpaired electron with the pi system of the aromatic nucleus.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Due to the high reactivity of chlorine atoms, higher homologues of toluene are not attacked selectively. In the case of ethylbenzene, for example, a mixture of 1-chloro- and 2-chloroethylbenzene is produced (<a href="#eqn_6.8">eqn 6.8a</a>). Bromine atoms are less reactive so that more radical character develops in the transition state. Therefore the bromination reaction is more regioselective giving only <b>1</b>-bromoethylbenzene (<a href="#eqn_6.8">eqn 6.8b</a>).</p>

Aryl Grignard and aryl lithium reagents undergo similar reactions to those shown by their aliphatic counterparts, combining with a range of electrophiles (including carbonyl compounds and nitriles) to give a wide selection of important derivatives (<a href="#fig_6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent3-ka1">The Grignard and lithium reagents of arylalkyl halides are prepared and react similarly, but benzylmagnesium halides are often contaminated with bibenzyls which are formed as byproducts. It should be noted that Grignard reagents are bases capable of forming enolate anions from carbonyl compounds with &#945; hydrogen atoms. In such cases attack at the carbonyl centre may be superseded by aldol type reactions where the enolate combines with a second molecule of the carbonyl compound (<a href="#eqn_6.9">eqn 6.9</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">There has been much discussion of the nature of the actual species present in solution and it has been shown that aggregates tend to form. The nature of the solvent is important. For example, arylmagnesium halides are in equilibrium with diarylmagnesiums and the magnesium halide (eqn <a href="#eqn_6.11">6.11</a>). In diethyl ether the arylmagnesium halide is preferred, whereas in tetrahydrofuran its predominance is less and in some cases more diarylmagnesium is present. This can influence the reactivity of the reagent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Aryl iodides couple with lithium copper reagents (R2CuLi) to afford substituted aryls (R &#x003D; primary and, sometimes, secondary alkyl, allyl, vinyl, and benzyl) (<a href="#eqn_6.13">eqn 6.13</a>). Arylalkyls are also obtained when arylmagnesium bromides are reacted with primary alkyl halides in the presence of cuprous ions (<a href="#eqn_6.13">eqn 6.14</a>). Aryl iodides when heated with copper afford biaryls: this is the basis of Ullmann reaction. Aryl copper intermediates [ArCu] are initially formed, but the precise structures of these compounds are uncertain (<a href="#eqn_6.13">eqn 6.15</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The nucleophilic substitution reactions of aryl halides in which the halogen atom is directly bonded to the ring have already been discussed (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_27">p. 27</a>). When the halogen is in a side chain the compound behaves as an alkyl halide, except when the carbon atom bearing the halogen is bonded to the ring, in which case the <a id="page_37" class="page">page 37, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a>corresponding carbocation is stabilized by resonance. Thus even though the benzyl cation is primary, the energy requirement for its formation is relatively low and benzyl halides react with nucleophiles by the <i>S</i><sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">&#x03B2;-Arylethyl halides (phenethyl halides) react with nucleophiles by two mechanisms: one is a straight forward <i>S</i><sub>N</sub>2 process, whereas the other involves neighouring group participation (anchimeric assistance) from the &#960; electrons of the aryl ring. These &#8216;push out&#8217; the halide ion to form a bridged carbocation called a <i>phenonium ion</i> which is then attacked by the nucleophile (<a href="#fig_6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2">In the absence of suitable nucleophiles, phenonium ions can be analysed by NMR spectroscopy: they show no aromatic character and thus resemble arenium ions. Such species are not solely restricted to &#x03B2;-arylethyl halides, but are recognized as intermediates in similar reactions of other &#x03B2;-arylethyl derivatives, such as sulphonates etc., where there is the potential for a &#x2018;good leaving group&#x2019; to form. The involvement of a phenonium ion can have a significant rate enhancing effect.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The triphenylmethyl cation and the triphenylmethyl radical are both easily produced, and each is further stabilized by resonance with the benzene nuclei. A solution of triphenylmethyl chloride in sulphur dioxide for example, conducts electricity due to heterolytic dissociation of the C&#x2013;Cl bond (<a href="#eqn_6.16">eqn 6.16</a>), whereas if triphenylmethyl chloride is reacted with silver in the non-polar solvent benzene a yellow solution forms, due to homolytic fission of the bond. The triphenylmethyl radical combines with oxygen to afford the peroxide, or reacts with itself to yield an adduct (<a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>). At one time this adduct was considered to be hexaphenylethane, but such a compound is unlikely to form through the dimerization of the very bulky PH<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#8226;</sup> radicals.</p>

Oxidation of primary arylalkanols affords first the aldehyde and then the corresponding acid, whereas <a id="page_39" class="page">page 39, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a>secondary arylalkanols give ketones. When the hydroxyl group is in the benzylic position, protonation is followed by rapid loss of water to give the benzylic carbocation which is resonance stabilized.

They also react, although less well, in a similar manner to their aliphatic counterparts with a wide range of nucleophiles. For example, they combine with primary aromatic amines (ArNH<sub>2</sub>), arylhydrazines (ArNHNH<sub>2</sub>), semicarbazide (NH<sub>2</sub>NHCONH<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) by a similar pathway. Initial nucleophilic attack by the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen derivative at the carbon atom of the carbonyl group is followed by protonation and the elimination of a molecule of water to give imines (Schiff&#8217;s bases), hydrazones, semicarbazones, and oximes respectively (<a href="#eqn_6.21">eqn 6.21</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Reaction with sodium bisulphite yields bisulphite compounds, from which cyanohydrins can be obtained by treatment with sodium cyanide (<a href="#eqn_6.21">eqn 6.22</a>). The direct formation of cyanohydrins is complicated by the propensity of aromatic aldehydes to form benzoins. Thus the reaction of benzaldehyde with sodium cyanide in ethanol solution gives rise to benzoin itself. The initial step is identical with that of cyanohydrin formation, but in ethanol protonation is slower than internal charge redistribution and the carbanion so formed now reacts with a second molecule of benzaldehyde to give the hydroxy ketone (<a href="#fig_6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Aromatic aldehydes cannot be enolized since they lack a hydrogen atom &#945; to the formyl group. In this respect they resemble formaldehyde. None the less, they react readily with carbanions formed from suitable aldehydes, ketones, esters, and anhydrides. Again, initial nucleophilic addition is followed by the elimination of water so that &#945;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated products form. By eliminating a molecule of water an enone unit is formed, the conjugation of which is extended by the benzene &#x03C0; system. As a result the products acquire considerable thermodynamic stability. Most of these reactions have long histories and they are named after their discoverers (<a href="#fig_6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">

If sodium hydride is employed as base, the reaction occurs at -5 &#176;C.</p>

The reaction can be made synthetically useful if an equimolar mixture of an araldehyde and formaldehyde is used (<a href="#eqn_6.25">eqn 6.25</a>). Formaldehyde is more reactive towards nucleophiles than the araldehyde (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_39">p. 39</a>).

The steric factor applies equally to benzoic acids bearing electron withdrawing groups at the <i>o</i> position. Such groups bonded to either the <i>o</i> or <i>p</i> sites, through resonance (see <a href="#fig_6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>), allow the development of positive charge adjacent to the carboxyl group.

<p class="noindent">The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline under acidic conditions is a very complex process, and other compounds (azoxybenzene, azobenzene, and hydrazobenzene) are also formed. Normally these molecules do not survive, since they undergo further reduction to aniline, However, if the reduction conditions are varied, it is possible to isolate them: thus reduction of nitrobenzene with zinc in the presence of aqueous ammonium chloride gives phenylhydroxylamine, and reduction with arsenic trioxide in alkaline solution affords azoxybenzene. Hydrazobenzene can be synthesized by reducing nitrobenzene with hydrazine in alcoholic sodium hydroxide or in the presence of ruthenium on carbon as catalyst. An alternative method uses glucose and sodium hydroxide. Sodium dithionite can be employed for the individual reductions of azoxybenzene, azobenzene, and hydrazobenzene to aniline (<a href="#fig_6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Azoxybenzene is yellow in colour and azobenzene is a bright orange-red. Azobenzene is the parent of the class of compounds known as azo dyes (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_60">p. 60</a>). Note that hydrazobenzene is colourless, the single bond separating the nitrogen atoms preventing resonance between the &#960; systems of the two benzene nuclei. Azobenzene can be oxidised to azoxybenzene by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. It normally exists in the near planar <i>E</i>-form, but irradiation with ultraviolet light causes it to rearrange to the Z-isomer (<a href="#eqn_6.44">eqn 6.44</a>). In this configuration steric hindrance between the two phenyl rings twists the molecule, and as a result the extended &#x03C0; system is distorted and the molecule is less highly coloured. It is also less stable and in solution reverts back to the <i>E</i>-isomer.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Acid-catalysed rearrangement reactions are observed for both phenylhydroxylamine and hydrazobenzene.

<p class="indent3-ka1">The remarkable benzidine rearrangement has been widely studied.

The benzidine rearrangement reaction involves reorgnization of the electrons of the single bond between the two nitrogen atoms and the pi electrons to generate a new bond uniting two ring carbon atoms. One suggestion for the mechanism of the reaction under conditions of monoprotonation is that the N&#x2013;N bond fragments to give a &#x03C0; complex. The two aryl units then rotate about one another so that the centres for the new sigma bonds of the various products are brought into close proximity.</p>

<p class="noindent">Aniline (p<i>K</i><sub>b</sub> 9.4) is much less basic than methylamine (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>.4) because of (a) the inductive effect of the phenyl group (<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> - rather than <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup><i></i> -hybridized carbon atoms) and, more importantly, (b) delocalization of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom with the &#x03C0; system (<a href="#fig_6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>). Delocalization provides stability to aniline which is not available to the anilinium cation (<a href="#eqn_6.49">eqn 6.49</a>), and simultaneously renders the lone pair electrons less available for protonation. Despite this, aniline is rather more basic than might be predicted. Mutual overlap between the lone pair electrons and the &#x03C0; system would be maximized if the amino group were trigonal with the lone pair occupying a <i>p</i> orbital. This is not the most stable arrangement for an amine, and ammonia, for example, has a pyramidal structure, i.e. the orbitals have a high degree of <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> character. In aniline there is a compromise and the lone pair orbital has more <i>p</i>-character than it has in ammonia. Even so the H&#x2013;N&#x2013;H plane bisects the plane of the benzene ring at an angle of <i>c.</i> 40 &#x00B0;C and effective delocalization of the lone pair electrons is reduced. <a id="page_54" class="page">page 54, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a></p>

Aromatic diazonium salts are more stable due to delocalization of the diazonium group with the <i>&#960;</i> system (<a href="#fig_6.24">Fig. 6.24</a>), and aqueous solutions of diazonium salts can be prepared and used at 0&#x2013;5 &#x00B0;C. The solids tend to be explosive, but additional stability is noted when a non-polarizable counterion is present. Diazonium tetrafluoroborates and hexafluo- rophosphates can sometimes be isolated and handled with a degree of safety.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzene diazonium salts are very useful in the synthesis of a wide range of aryl derivatives. Whereas the <i>S</i><sub>n</sub>1<i></i> nucleophilic displacement of aryl halides is unknown, the decomposition of benzene diazonium salts is a first order process and the benzene carbocation is produced. Once formed the cation is very reactive and combines readily with available nucleophiles to afford substituted benzenes. The driving force for this reaction is the elimination of the very stable nitrogen molecule (see above), and evidence for the participation of the benzene cation is obtained from the observation that when Ar<sup><b>15</b></sup>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2261;N is the reactive species, and the opportunity for reactions with nucleophiles are minimized, recovered starting material consists of Ar<sup>l<b>5</b></sup>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2261;N and ArN<sup>&#x002B;</sup>&#x2261; <sup>15</sup>N.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is possible that &#x2019;aryl cations&#x2019; are not simple structures for there is evidence that they also contain unpaired electrons, i.e. they show radical characteristics.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzene diazonium salts react with water to give phenols, and with aqueous solutions containing halide ions to yield halobenzenes (<a href="#fig_6.25">Fig. 6.25</a>). If two ions of similar nucleophilicity are present then mixtures form: thus when diazonium chlorides are hydrolysed mixtures of phenols and chlorobenzenes are produced. For this reason if phenols are required it is usual to carry out the diazotization of the amine in sulphuric acid rather than in hydrochloric acid. Potassium ethyl xanthate with aryldiazonium salts gives arylethyl xanthates, which on hydrolysis produce thiophenols (<a href="#fig_6.25">Fig. 6.25</a>) (this is a safer method than using metal polysulphides).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Alkali metal azides yield azidobenzenes, and the reduction of benzene diazonium salts to the parent hydrocarbons is conveniently achieved by the use of hypophosphorus acid catalysed by copper, although sodium stannite and alkaline formaldehyde are also recommended.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The reduction may involve radicals, see below.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Certain cuprous salts &#8212; chloride, bromide, and cyanide &#8212; catalyse the decomposition of benzene diazonium salts and give the corresponding chloro-, bromo- or cyano-benzenes, respectively. Collectively these reactions are known as Sandmeyer reactions, and they involve a homolytic rather than a heterolytic fragmentation of the aryl-nitrogen bond. The cuprous ion acts to reduce the diazonium salt <a id="page_60" class="page">page 60, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a>and an aryl radical is formed which donates an electron to cupric ion reducing it back to the cuprous state. The cuprous salt is thus a true catalyst (<a href="#eqn_6.58">eqn 6.58a</a>, <a href="#eqn_6.58">b</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Fluorobenzenes cannot be made in this way but they are available through the Balz&#x2013;Schiemann reaction in which an aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate or pentaflu-orophosphate, is cautiously heated. Nitrobenzenes can be prepared by treating benzene diazonium tetrafluoroborates with aqueous sodium nitrite in the presence of cuprous ions (<a href="#eqn_6.59">eqn 6.59</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzene diazonium salts are also weak electrophiles and react (couple) with electron rich arenes (mainly phenols and amines) at the <i>para</i> position to give azo compounds. The coupling reaction with phenols must be carried out in alkaline media, so that in fact phenate anions are the substrates. In the case of primary amines, diazonium salts react faster with the lone pair of electrons of the amino group than with the ring carbon atoms, so that the initial products are <i>N</i>-diazoaminobenzenes (triazenes). Such compounds are thermodynamically less stable than the aminoazobenzene isomers and when they are heated with anilinium salts they rearrange. This is usually regarded as a reversal of the diazoaminobenzene formation, but it could be more complex (<a href="#fig_6.26">Fig. 6.26</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Azo compounds, because of their highly conjugated structures are brightly coloured and are used as dyestuffs. In the past, some were used as food colouring agents &#8212; butter yellow and BFK (brown for kippers) are two examples &#8212; but the possibility that such compounds might be carcinogenic has discouraged this practice.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzene diazonium salts, in a two-phase system containing aqueous sodium hydroxide and a suitable aromatic solvent (such as benzene), form benzenediazo-hydroxides. These products decompose by a complex series of reactions into aryl radicals (<a href="#eqn_6.60">eqn 6.60a</a>) which may couple with the aromatic solvent to give biaryls (<a href="#eqn_6.60">eqn 6.60b</a>). This process, known as the Gomberg&#x2013;Backmann reaction, is similar to the Ullmann reaction (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_36">p. 36</a>) and can sometimes be of synthetic value. However, there are many alternative pathways by which the radicals can react and yields are not good.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenols give rise to coloured complexes when treated with ferric chloride. These colours are often diagnostic for a particular phenol, and there is frequently a variation in the colour depending upon whether the test is carried out with water or alcohol as the solvent. Phenol gives an acid reaction to litmus and dissolves in dilute sodium hydroxide solution. This shows up a marked difference in chemistry between phenols and alcohols, which are neutral compounds (phenol p<b><i>K<sub>a</sub></i></b> 10; cyclohexanol p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 18). If electron withdrawing substituents, such as nitro groups, are present at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions the acidity of the phenol is increased (4-nitrophenol p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 7.2). The acidity of phenol can be attributed to the stability of the phenate anion in which the formal negative charge on the oxygen atom is delocalized throughout the ring (<a href="#fig_6.29">Fig. 6.29</a>). <i>Ortho-</i> or <i>para-</i> nitro groups allow further extensions of this effect.</p>

<p class="noindent">The resonance effect of the lone pair electrons of the hydroxyl group increases electron density in the benzene nucleus promoting electrophilic attack and similarly lowering the energy contents of the relevant <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> sigma intermediates. This is reflected in the ease of electrophilic&#x2013;substitution reactions. Phenol reacts with bromine in carbon tetrachloride to give <i>p</i>-bromophenol and no Lewis acid is required (<a href="#eqn_6.64">eqn 6.64</a>). With bromine water 2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed (<a href="#eqn_6.64">eqn 6.65</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Although rapid electrophilic monobromination is expected, subsequent brominations should be more difficult. The ease with which the tribromo derivative forms suggests that a complex reaction mechanism operates. In bromine water the initial product is a tetrabromodienone, which is reduced by treatment with aqueous sodium hydrogensulphite.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Nitration occurs with 20&#x0025; aqueous nitric acid, below 30 &#x00B0;C, to give mainly <i>o- <b></b></i>and <i>P</i>-notrophenols (<a href="#eqn_6.64">eqn 6.66</a>). The rate of formation of <sup>&#x002B;</sup>NO2 in this medium is too low to explain the ease of reaction, and it has been shown that the active reagent is <a id="page_65" class="page">page 65, Chapter6 Aromatic compounds</a>actually nitrous acid. This nitrosates phenol through the agency of the nitrosonium ion <sup>&#x002B;</sup>NO. The <i>o-</i> and <i>p</i>-nitrosophenols which are produced are then rapidly oxidized by nitric acid to the corresponding nitrophenols. In this last reaction nitric acid is reduced to nitrous acid, which increases in concentration thus accelerating the first reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Nitrous acid alone reacts with phenol at 0 &#x00B0;C to give <i>o-</i> and <i>P</i>-nitrosophenols. The <i>para</i> derivative is tautomeric with the mono-oxime of 1,4-benzoquinone (<a href="#eqn_6.67">eqn 6.67</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">When phenol is deprotonated the phenate anion is produced in which electrophilic reactivity is enhanced further, as now the resonance effect involves a full negative charge. Phenates react readily with a range of relatively weak electrophiles. For example, sodium phenate combines with formaldehyde to give <i>o-</i> and <i>p</i>-benzyl alcohols (Lederer-Manasse reaction). If the reaction is carried out in an acidic medium these products react further to produce a complex phenol&#x2013;formaldehyde resin (Bakelite) (<a href="#eqn_6.67">eqn 6.68</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">When heated at 130 &#x00B0;C under pressure carbon dioxide reacts with sodium phenate to give mainly <i>o-</i>hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid). The reaction depends on the nature of the cation: if potassium phenate is used at a temperature of 180 &#x00B0;C the <i>p</i><b>-</b>isomer predominates. The reaction is known as the Kolbe process (<a href="#eqn_6.67">eqn 6.69</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Another reaction with a long history is the Reimer&#x2013;Tiemann reaction in which a phenol is treated with alkali and chloroform to give the corresponding <i>o-</i> and <i>p-</i>hydroxybenzaldehydes. The mechanism of this reaction puzzled chemists until it was shown that the electron deficient molecule dichlorocarbene is formed by the base promoted dehydrochlorination of chloroform (<a href="#eqn_6.70">eqns 6.70a</a>,<a href="#eqn_6.70">b</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">In the Lederer&#x2013;Manasse, the Kolbe and the Reimer&#x2013;Tiemann reactions the <i>ortho</i> product predominates over its <i>para</i> isomer. This is due to chelation control, which is only possible within the <i>ortho</i> dipolar reaction intermediates, and has the effect of lowering energy by delocalizing the charges. A change from sodium hydroxide to potassium hydroxide in the Kolbe reaction means that the less polarizable potassium ion replaces the sodium cation in the intermediate. Chelation is less effective and the <i>para</i> isomer is preferred.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenols are <i>O-</i>alkylated (affording ethers) by reaction with dialkyl sulphates or alkyl halides, and <i>O-</i>acylated (to give the corresponding esters) by treatment with acyl halides or anhydrides (<a href="#fig_6.31">Fig. 6.31</a>).

<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenols form complexes with Lewis acids, such as aluminium trichloride, through reaction of the electron deficient Lewis acid with the lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom. Even when Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation reactions are carried out using alkoxybenzenes similar complexation is possible and the products may be <i>O-</i>deal-kylated under the reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenolic esters rearrange in the presence of aluminium trichloride (Fries rearrangement), which initially reacts with the lone pair electrons of the oxygen atom to generate an acylium species (analogous to that formed in the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts reaction between an acyl choride and aluminium trichloride). This then attacks the ring (<a href="#eqn_6.71">eqn 6.72</a>). The reaction may be conducted under thermodynamic or kinetic control, hence at high temperature the <i>ortho</i> product is favoured as a result of stabilization through chelation with the aluminium.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The Fries rearrangement is intermolecular, but when allyl phenyl ethers are heated <i>C-</i>allylphenols are formed. The reaction known as the Claisen rearrangement follows an intramolecular course and is an example of a pericyclic [3,3]sigmatrophic rearrangement</p>

<p class="noindent">Phenols are prone to oxidation, frequently giving rise to complex mixtures. Sometimes a degree of control can be exerted and specific products can be obtained. For example, the oxidation of catechol and hydroquinone gives 1,2- and 1,4-benzoqui- nones, respectively (<a href="#eqn_6.74">eqn 6.74a</a>, <a href="#eqn_6.74">b</a>)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenate ions are particularly susceptible to oxidation and the initial products are the corresponding phenoxy radicals. These enter into self-coupling reactions to form hydroxylated biphenyls, which are further oxidized to quinones <i>(para-para</i> coupling of phenoxy radicals is often observed) (<a href="#eqn_6.75">eqn 6.75</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Unfortunately these are not the only products, and such reactions are notorious for the production of intractable tars. Thus although there have been many attempts to effect intramolecular cyclizations through the oxidative coupling of phenols in alkaline media, the yields of products are usually disappointing. Better results come from the oxidation of <i>O-</i>alkylphenols, where it is likely that the reactive species are radical cations. These can be generated electrochemically, or with the one-electron oxidants, as, for example, in the oxidative cyclization of metacyclones to bis- dienones by reactions with ferric chloride (<a href="#eqn_6.75">eqn 6.76</a>).</p>
