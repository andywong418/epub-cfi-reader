<p class="indent">The fusion of benzene rings leads to an array of polycyclic arenes, of which naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene, are the best known. Other compounds in the series include chrysene, pyrene, tetracene, and coronene (<a href="#fig_7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>).</p>

Some are procarcinogens, being oxidized within the body to the true cancer promoting compounds. Very large polycyclic systems are known, and graphite consists of planes derived from an infinite linear fusion of benzene nuclei, each plane being separated from its neighbour by a distance of 3.4 &#197;.</p>

<p class="noindent">The naphthalene ring is numbered as shown, but the C-l and C-2 positions are commonly referred to as &#945; and &#946; respectively (<a href="#fig_7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). The &#945; sites are also known as <i>peri</i> positions.</p>

</aside>

<p class="indent">Naphthalene is much more easily hydrogenated than benzene (see below), but the reduction only proceeds as far as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin). Tetralin resembles 1,2-dimethylbenzene, and further hydrogenation requires high pressure and elevated temperatures. This result is fully in accord with the aromatic character of naphthalene, but the empirical resonance (or stabilization) energy (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_3">p. 3</a>) of naphthalene (241 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> ) is not twice that of benzene (172 kJ mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> ): a consideration of the main contributors to the valence bond description of naphthalene show that it is not possible for both rings to be benzenoid at the same time (<a href="#fig_7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>). Carbon-carbon bond lengths also reflect this and, in particular, the 1,2-bond is shorter (137 pm) (more double bond character) than the 2,3- bond (140 pm).</p>

<h3 class="h3">7.2.2&#160;&#160;Synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">A classical synthesis of naphthalene starting from benzene employs a Haworth succinoylation reaction (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_15">p. 15</a>) as the first step. This Friedel&#8211;Crafts type procedure affords 4-phenyl-4-oxobutanoic acid, which is reduced by a modified Wolff-Kishner reduction (utilizing hydrazine, glycol, and potassium hydroxide as reagents) to 4-phenylbutanoic acid. The acid is then cyclized to 1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetra- hydronaphthalene (&#945;-tetralone) by treatment with polyphosphoric acid. Reduction of the ketone group of &#945;-tetralone, as for 4-phenyl-4-oxobutanoic acid, gives tetralin; finally, oxidative aromatization (dehydrogenation) to naphthalene is effected by heating tetralin with a palladium catalyst (<a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). The synthesis can be applied to other naphthalene derivatives, providing the substituents in the benzene ring are not deactivating. In addition, &#945;-tetralone allows a further extension of the approach since reactions of it with Grignard reagents allows access to 1-substituted naphthalenes.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important route to naphthalenes employs Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions between 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,3-dienes. The adducts which form can be enolized to dihydroxydihydronaphthalenes, and then oxidized to 1,4-napthoquinones (<a href="#eq_7.1">eqn 7.1</a>).</p>

<p class="h3a">7.2.3.1&#160;&#160;Monosubstitution</p>
<p class="noindent">Under conditions favouring kinetic control, naphthalene reacts with electrophiles (Y<sup>+</sup>) faster at the &#945; position. The selection of the &#945; site follows from an analysis of the valence bond contributors to the appropriate sigma complexes: thus the intermediate corresponding to attack at C-1 has two contributions in which one benzenoid ring remains intact, whereas that for C-2 attack has only one (<a href="#fig_7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>). These contributions have lower energies than the others where both benzene &#960; systems are disrupted. The fact that the wave equation describing the a intermediate has two such low energy factors accounts for the lower energy of this sigma complex.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">Electrophiles tend to react with naphthalene more rapidly than with benzene. For example, bromine in boiling carbon tetrachloride affords <b><i>c.</i></b> 75% 1-bromonaphthalene and no carrier is necessary. Similarly, Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation with acetyl chloride and aluminium trichloride, in tetrachloroethane as solvent and under mild conditions, affords mainly 1-acetylnaphthalene (<a href="#fig_7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>). If the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction is repeated in nitrobenzene, rather than in tetrachloroethane as solvent, a 90% yield of 2-acetylnaphthalene is obtained (see below).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This reflects the reduction in overall resonance stabilization energy when two benzenoid units are fused together, plus the fact that in the sigma complexes for monosubstitution, at least, the unattacked nucleus retains its aromatic character.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">Nitration with nitric acid in acetic anhydride at 60 &#176;C gives 1-nitronaphthalene and 2-nitronaphthalene in the ratio 10:1, plus smaller amounts of 1,8- and 1,5-dinitronaphthalenes (<a href="#eq_7.2">eqn 7.2</a>). The dinitronaphthalenes are the products of further nitration of 1-nitronaphthalene. It is noteworthy that the presence of the deactivating nitro group in one ring directs further electrophilic attack into the unsubstituted benzene nucleus (see below).</p>
<p class="indent">Although attack at C-l is faster than at C-2, a number of examples exist where the kinetically favoured &#945;-substituted naphthalene reverts to a thermodynamically more stable &#946; isomer if the temperature is raised and sufficient time is allowed for equilibration to occur. Such illustrations of thermodynamic versus kinetic control are important since they provide access to other &#946;-functionalized naphthalenes.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The isomerization is commonly noted when the substituent group is large. This is because the fused nature of naphthalene dictates that there is steric hindrance between the hydrogen atom at C<b>-</b>8 and a group at C-1. At C-2 the substituent is immediately flanked by two protons, as in a monosubstituted benzene derivative, and the steric problem is less. The size of the incoming group is also important if steric clashes are to be minimized. In the Friedel&#8211;Crafts acetylation reactions discussed above, for example, the change to nitrobenzene as solvent, which has a high dielectric constant, is thought to allow more effective solvation of the Lewis acid/reagent complex, thereby increasing its size over that formed in the less polar solvent tetrachloroethane. As a result reaction at C-2 is favoured over attack at C-l.</p>
<p class="indent">The sulphonation of naphthalene, provides a good example of thermodynamic versus kinetic control. In sulphuric acid at 80 &#176;C the major product (96%) is naphthalene-1 -sulphonic acid. If this compound is heated in sulphuric acid at 160 &#176;C, or if the reaction temperature is raised to about 160 &#186;C, naphthalene-2-sulphonic acid becomes the predominant product (86%) (<a href="#fig_7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The same rules of activation and deactivation apply to substituent groups in both the benzene and the naphthalene series. Electron-donating groups facilitate electrophilic attack, whereas naphthalenes bearing unsaturated electron-withdrawing substituents react more slowly than naphthalene itself. In the latter case the incoming electrophile is directed to the unsubstituted ring, whereas the reverse is true if the substituent activates the molecule to attack.</p>

<p class="h3a">7.2.3.2 Orientation preferences for monosubstituted naphthalenes</p>
<p class="noindent">As for monosubstituted benzenes (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_18">p. 18</a>), the orientation preferences for the entry of an electrophile into a naphthalene which already bears a single substituent can be assessed by a consideration of the extent of charge delocalization in the sigma complexes. Thus substitution at either C-2 or C-4 is favoured for a naphthalene bearing an electron donating group X at C-1. Should such a group be at C-2 then attack is faster at C-l. This follows because if the electrophile became bonded to C-3, the aromaticity of the other ring would be disturbed (<a href="#fig_7.8">Fig. 7.8</a>). <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Chapter7 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">7.2.5 Naphthalene derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many naphthalene derivatives can be synthesized by routes similar to those used in the benzene series. In general, the substituent groups also react in the same way. Thus halonaphthalenes form lithium and Grignard reagents, which then show comparable chemistry to that of their monocyclic analogues. The halogen atoms are resistant to nucleophilic displacement, but halogenated naphthalenes yield naphthynes under severe conditions (<a href="#fig_7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>).</p>

<p class="h3a">7.2.5.1&#160;&#160;Naphthylamines</p>
<p class="noindent">Aminonaphthalenes (naphthylamines) are formed from the corresponding nitro compounds by reduction, or from the hydroxynaphthalenes (naphthols) by the Bucherer reaction. In this process, not normally exhibited in the benzene series, a naphthol is heated with ammonia, or a primary amine (RNH<sub>2</sub>) and sodium hydgrogensulphite. The reaction involves an overall addition-elimination mechanism and is only possible because of the reduced aromatic character of the naphthalene system. In the first step protonation at C-4 occurs and then hydrogensulphite anion adds at C-3 to form an enol, which is in tautomeric equilibrium with its keto form. The latter reacts with ammonia, or the amine, to give an imine &#4502; enamine pair, which eliminates sodium hydrogensulphite. The reactions are reversible and thus also provide a route from naphthylamines to naphthols (<a href="#fig_7.10">Fig. 7.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A similar reaction occurs with 2-naphthol giving 2-naphthylamine ((&#946;-naphthylamine). This compound was once important in the dyestuffs industry, and its diazonium salt was used to form a wide range of azo dyes. Unfortunately, 2-naphthylamine is now known to be a carcinogen. Naphthylamines are weak bases which behave in a similar manner to aniline. They react readily with electrophiles and are easily oxidized to naphthoquinones. As with aniline, electrophilic substitution reactions are best carried out using the N-acylated derivatives. For example, 1-acetamidonaphthalene can be nitrated with nitric acid in acetic acid to afford a mixture of 2- and 4-nitro-1-acetamidonaphthalenes (<a href="#eq_7.4">eqn 7.4</a>).</p>

<p class="h3a">7.2.5.2 The naphthols</p>
<p class="noindent">The hydroxy equivalents of the naphthylamines are the naphthols. The parent compounds, l-(&#945;-) and 2-(&#946;-) naphthols, are usually prepared by fusing the sodium salt of the corresponding sulphonic acid with sodium hydroxide (<a href="#eq_7.5">eqn 7.5</a>). Mechanistically these reaction <i>may</i> occur through the addition of hydroxide ion to the <i>ipso <b></b></i>position of the sulphonate, followed by the elimination of sulphite ion. This suggestion is not proven, although the participation of a naphthyne seems to be ruled out because of the regiointegrity of the reaction. <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Chapter7 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a></p>

<p class="indent">The naphthols are typical phenols and dissolve in alkali, but not in aqueous sodium carbonate solution. They produce colours with ferric chloride, and can be <i>O</i>-alkylated by reaction with alkyl halides or with dialkyl sulphates in basic media. Similarly, <i>O</i>-acylations can be effected under Schotten&#8211;Baumann conditions. Coupling occurs when alkaline solutions of the naphthols are treated with diazonium salts (<a href="#eq_7.5">eqn 7.6a, b</a>), and they undergo other electrophilic reactions easily. For example, naphthols react with nitrous acid to give <i>C</i>-nitroso naphthalenes, which are in equilibrium with their oximino tautomers (<a href="#fig_7.11">Fig. 7.11</a>).</p>

A Diels&#8211;Alder approach can also be adopted, and if 1,4-naphthoquinone is reacted with 1,3-butadiene a tetrahydroanthraquinone is produced (<a href="#eq_7.8">eqn 7.8</a>).

Indeed, this is manifested in much of the chemistry of anthracene, where additions across the 9,10-positions are commonplace giving 9,10-disubstituted dihydroanthracenes in which the two &#8216;outside&#8217; rings are fully benzenoid.

Some dehydrogenation also takes place and the product is contaminated with the appropriate 9,10-dihaloanthracene (<a href="#eq_7.9">eqn 7.9</a>). 9-Bromoanthracene is also obtained when anthracene is treated with thallium(III) acetate and bromine (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_17">p. 17</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Concentrated nitric acid oxidizes anthracene to anthraquinone, whereas dilute nitric acid, or nitric acid in acetic acid (ROH = CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), affords 10-hydroxy- or 10-acetoxy-9-nitro-9,10-dihydroanthracenes, respectively. These compounds lose water or acetic acid, respectively, on treatment with alkali to yield 9-nitroanthracene (<a href="#eq_7.9">eqn 7.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Chapter7 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Large groups at C-9 suffer steric hindrance from both the hydrogen atoms at positions 1 and 8 (<i>peri</i> positions). Thus, although attack at C-9 is the kinetic preference, sulphonation with sulphuric acid at 20 &#186;C occurs to give mainly 1,5- and 1,8-anthracene disulphonic acids (<a href="#fig_7.15">Fig. 7.15</a>). Even so, these products still suffer adverse non-bonded interactions between the sulphonic acid functions and the <i>peri</i>-hydrogen atoms, and when the reaction is repeated at 130 &#186;C the more thermodynamically stable 2-anthracene sulphonic acid is obtained, together with 2,6- and 2,7-anthracene disulphonic acids.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are numerous syntheses of phenanthrene, mainly due to the fact that the phenanthrene strutural unit is frequently found in complex natural products.</p>
<p class="indent">Naphthalene undergoes the Haworth succinoylation reaction to afford 1-naphthyl-4-oxobutanoic acid, which can be reduced under Clemmensen conditions (Zn/HgCl) to afford the corresponding butanoic acid. This product is then cyclized to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-oxophenanthrene by treatment with sulphuric acid. Reduction, dehydration, and dehydrogenation of the tetrahydrophenanthrene affords phenanthrene, whereas reactions with alkyl Grignard reagents, prior to dehydration and oxidation, gives 1-alkylphenanthrenes (<a href="#fig_7.16">Fig. 7.16</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Trans</i><b>-</b>stilbene when irradiated with ultraviolet light gives a <i>trans</i>-dihydrophenanthrene which readily aromatizes to phenanthrene in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as iodine or oxygen (<a href="#eq_7.11">eqn 7.17</a>). The reaction can be used to cyclize derivatives of stilbine, although its application is limited to compounds which bear electronically similar groups in the two rings.</p>

<p class="indent">Under photochemical conditions <i>trans</i>-stilbene is converted into <i>cis</i>-stilbene; it is this species, as its excited singlet, which cyclizes to the dihydrophenanthrene. The <i>trans</i> stereochemistry in the product is determined by the principle of the <i>conservation of orbital symmetry</i>, see Fleming (1976).</p>

<p class="noindent">The resonance description of phenanthrene shows that the bond between C-9 and C-10 has a high degree of double bond character (<a href="#fig_7.17">Fig. 7.17</a>). In line with this prediction, the chemistry of phenanthrene shows many similarities to that of anthracene. Addition reactions across the 9,10-bond are common, but rather less easily effected. This can be accounted for since initial attack of an electrophile (Y<sup>+</sup>) produces a <i>singly</i> benzylic carbocation, which can either be deprotonated or quenched with available nucleophiles (X<sup>&#8722;</sup>) (<a href="#fig_7.18">Fig. 7.18</a>).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-top:0.5em;">For anthracene the corresponding cation is <i>doubly</i> benzylic (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_81">p. 81</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Chlorine in acetic acid solution gives <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-9,10-dichloro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes, plus <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-9-acetoxy-10-chloro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes. Both the dihalides and the acetoxychloro derivatives eliminate hydrogen chloride to form 9-chlorophenanthrene or 9-acetoxyphenanthrene respectively. The acetoxychloro compounds may also lose acetic acid and give 9-chlorophenanthrene (<a href="#fig_7.19">Fig. 7.19</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the less polar solvent, carbon tetrachloride, bromine yields 9-bromophenanthrene. This reaction has been shown to be a typical aromatic substitution reaction, not one involving the above type of addition-elimination process.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxidation of phenanthrene with chromic acid gives 9,10-phenanthraquinone, which on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride affords <i>trans</i>-9,10-dihydroxy- 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene plus 9,10-dihydroxyphenanthrene (<a href="#eq_7.12">eqn 7.12</a>).</p>
