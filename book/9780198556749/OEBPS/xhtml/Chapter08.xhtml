<p class="noindent">The H&#x00FC;ckel (4<i>n</i>&#x002B;2 &#960; electron) rule predicts that certain planar cyclic molecules, built up through the union of <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms, should show aromatic character. In principle, however, other atoms can replace carbon provided that they contribute an appropriate number of <i>p</i> electrons to the &#960; system. Pyridine, for example, is isoelectronic with benzene. The nitrogen atom is <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> -hybridized, and of the three hybrid orbitals two are involved in bonding to the flanking carbon atoms, while the third contains a non-bonded pair of electrons. The remaining valency electron of the nitrogen atom is not hybridized, it resides in a <i>p</i> orbital which overlaps the <i>p</i> lobes of the carbon atoms, thereby forming a delocalized six &#960;-electron system, similar to that of benzene.</p>

<p class="indent">Six atoms in a ring are not always required, and the five membered heterocycles pyrrole, furan, and thiophene are also aromatic molecules. Each of the four carbon atoms in these compounds contributes one <i>p</i> electron, but the hetero atom provides the extra two <i>p</i> electrons needed to make up the aromatic sextet. It follows that both pyridine and pyrrole share aromatic character. In addition pyridine is a base since it has a lone pair of electrons at the nitrogen atom which is available to capture a proton. This feature is not present in the five membered heterocycle pyrrole, which is a neutral molecule. Obviously, more than one heteroatom can be incorporated into the ring and these atoms do not necessarily need to be identical. As a result there are many aromatic heterocycles, both monocyclic and polycyclic. The subject area is immense and outside the scope of this text.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The annulenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Returning to carbocycles, the simplest aromatic compounds are cyclopropenium salts. These obey H&#x00FC;ckel&#8217;s rule, and exemplify the case where n &#x003D; 0, so that (4<i>n</i>&#x002B;2) &#x003D; 2 (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_4">p. 4</a>). Despite the ring strain that the cyclopropenium tricyclic inherits from having formal bond angles of only 60&#176;, cyclopropenium salts do exist and even survive in aqueous media. They represent some of the most stable carbocations known. Cyclopropenone and some of its derivatives are also stable molecules, and here the aromaticity of the ring can be interpreted if the dipolar resonance description of the carbonyl group is considered (<a href="#fig_8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>). This places a positive charge upon the carbon atom and allows the electrons of the double bond to generate a completely delocalized two &#960; electron system.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking H&#x00FC;ckel&#8217;s rule as the criterion for aromaticity, it follows that larger cyclic planar molecules should also be aromatic, provided they have the appropriate number of <i>p</i> electrons. Benzene is a member of a series of monocyclic compounds called annulenes, each differing from its neighbour by the presence, or absence, of an additional CH&#x003D;CH unit. Each member of the series is described by a number in <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Chapter8 Wider aspects of aromaticity</a>square brackets which denotes the number of <i>p</i> electrons present, thus benzene is [6]annulene and cyclooctatetraene is [8]annulene. There has been much effort to synthesize larger and larger annulenes and to examine them for aromatic character, most conveniently by <sup>l</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, which determines whether or not they sustain a ring current (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_2">p. 2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">H&#x00FC;ckel aromaticity is not the only factor, however, and there is a competition between stability, brought about by electron delocalization, and steric effects. There are, for example, three possible isomers of [10]annulene: the all<i>-cis,</i> the mono-<i>trans</i>, and the <i>cis-trans-cis-cis-trans</i>. The first two, but not the last, have been synthesized and obtained as crystalline solids at &#8211;80 &#176;C. However, their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra show only resonances in the olefinic region and it is clear that these molecules cannot achieve planarity, which is a hallmark of an aromatic compound and necessary for the effective overlap of individual p orbitals (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_2">p. 2</a>). Were [10]annulene to be a regular decagon, the internal C&#x2013;C bond angles would be 144&#176;, which in this case would induce more strain than could be offset by the resonance effect. Consequently the all-<i>cis</i> isomer is buckled, whereas the mono-<i>trans</i> resembles the tub structure of cyclooctatetraene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Angle strain is not insurmountable and several other molecules have been made which are planar and do have large internal angles.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Although ring strain is eliminated in the case of the <i>cis-trans-cis-cis-trans</i> isomer, the hydrogen atoms at the centre of the molecule point inwards and interfere sterically with one another. This non-bonded interaction is the reason for the instability of the compound, and it can be removed by bridging in the two central carbon atoms. 1,6-Methano[10]annulene, for example, can be prepared: it is stable and undergoes substitution, rather than addition, reactions (<a href="#fig_8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of [18]annulene shows two resonances, one due to the signals of the protons on the outside of the ring, at a chemical shift value of 9.0 ppm, and the other due to the resonances of the inner proton signals, at the very high field (shielded) position of -3.0 ppm (i.e. above the internal standard tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm).This evidence confirms the aromaticity of [18]annulene and indicates that a ring current is established in this molecule. The outer protons lie in the deshielding zone created by this ring current, whereas the inner proton are orientated directly into the shielding region of the induced field.</p>
