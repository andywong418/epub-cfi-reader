<p class="fmnoindent">The study of the structure and properties of benzene and the development of the concept of aromaticity represents a significant part of the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Very many natural products may be classed as aromatic compounds and the development of the chemical industry has relied heavily on aromatic chemistry. It is not surprising, therefore, that an understanding of aromatic chemistry forms a crucial part of all modern chemistry courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. In this primer, Malcolm Sainsbury provides an excellent account of the fascinating topic of aromatic chemistry presented in an easy to read and student-friendly style. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
