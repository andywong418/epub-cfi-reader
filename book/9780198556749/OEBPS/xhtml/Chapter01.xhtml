<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Benzene C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is a component of coal tar distillate and an aerial pollutant found in the exhaust gases of automobiles. It is the parent of a group of compounds known as <i>arenes</i> which exhibit different reactions to those shown by other unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. <i>alkenes.</i> Arenes are also described as aromatic molecules. The term aromatic is historical and derives from the fact that many naturally occurring fragrant compounds were observed to contain a benzene unit. Nowadays aromaticity has a wider scientific meaning and refers to planar cyclically conjugated structures having (4<i>n</i>+2) &#x03C0; electrons (where <i>n</i> is 0, 1, 2 etc.), <b>H&#x00FC;ckel&#x2019;s rule</b>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Early chemists accustomed to the concept of the tetravalency of carbon had great difficulty in interpreting the structure and chemical behaviour of benzene. Thus, for example, Ladenburg proposed that benzene had a prismatic structure, whereas Dewar considered it to be a distorted hexagon with a long central bond and two double bonds. A more reasonable interpretation was that of the German scientist Kekul&#x00E9;, who suggested that the molecule had a cyclic arrangement of carbon atoms joined by alternate single and double bonds.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Although the Kekul&#x00E9; hypothesis was an advance in understanding, it did not explain, for example, why there is only one 1,2-dichlorobenzene, two isomers of which should exist, one with the carbons bearing the chlorine atoms separated by a double bond, and the other with them separated by a single bond. Furthermore, single bonds (154 pm) are longer than double bonds (133 pm) and this would give rise to an irregular structure. This criticism was countered by Kekul&#x00E9; who argued that a very rapid equilibrium existed between, say, the two molecules of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, thus accounting for the observation of a single compound (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).&#x2003; <a id="page_2" class="page">page 2, Chapter1 Aromatic character and the structure of benzene</a></p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">One effect of the continuous &#x03C0; system is to create a ring current, which in turn generates a magnetic field. In the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum the ring protons of benzene give rise to a single peak at &#x03B4; 7.2. This chemical shift value is at lower field than expected for the signals of alkenic protons &#x00AC;(typically &#x03B4; 5.8&#x2013;6.5): this down-field shift is caused because the ring current enhances the applied field in the plane of the ring where the protons reside. Similar ring currents are produced for other planar cyclic polyenes containing (4<i>n</i>+2) <i>p</i> electrons which also show proton signals close to &#x03B4; 7.0. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy can thus be used as a simple probe of aromatic character (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#page_87">p. 87</a>).</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>This is incorrect: no such equilibration exists</i> and there is only one 1,2-dichloro- benzene. In benzene six carbon atoms each bond to a single hydrogen atom and to two other carbons forming a symmetrical sigma-bonded framework. X-ray studies confirm this and show the ring to be a regular hexagonal structure in which all carbon-bonds are equal (140 pm) with bond angles of 120&#x00B0;. Each trigonal (<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>- hybridized) carbon atom nominally has a single <i>p</i> orbital containing one electron. Since all the carbon-carbon bond lengths are identical, individual <i>p</i> orbitals must overlap equally with their neighbours so that a continuous &#x03C0; system is created above and below the ring within which the <i>p</i> electrons circulate (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig 1.3</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Representation of benzene</h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">While the circle device is attractive for monocyclic arenes its application to polycyclic molecules is strictly incorrect. A full circle within a ring signifies a &#x03C0; system containing six electrons. Thus in the structure of the fused bicyclic arene naphthalene (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_70">p. 70</a>, for example) such a representation would imply that there were twelve &#x03C0; electrons, six in each ring, whereas in fact there are only ten! Great care has to be exercised when using this device, especially as full circles are also commonly drawn in representations of monocyclic ions which may contain more, or less, than six &#x03C0; electrons, see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_4">p. 4</a>. Some authors recommend dashed circles to describe &#x03C0; systems other than those containing six electrons.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent">How, then, can we represent benzene, which contains a fully delocalized sextet of <i>p</i> electrons? One way is to draw a hexagon with a circle inside it to symbolize the free circulation of the six <i>p</i> electrons. A second representation uses the <b>valence bond</b> approach: here as many classical (electron localized) structures as are necessary to describe the molecule are drawn, thus benzene is regarded as a <b>resonance hybrid</b> of the two Kekul&#x00E9; formulae. Other planar representations are also included since they reflect the possibility of <i>p</i> electron overlap across the ring (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig 1.4</a>). It is important to realize that <i>no one formula truly represents benzene</i> and, since the positions of the atoms are fixed, <i>only the electrons are free to move.</i> In the valence bond approach each contributing form is regarded as a factor in the overall wave equation of the benzene molecule. Such an equation does not exist without all its component factors, but some are more important than others. Thus since overlap across the ring is less likely than the overlap between <i>p</i> electrons on adjacent carbon atoms, the Dewar contributions are less important than the Kekul&#x00E9; types. A double-headed arrow between each contributor, or canonical form, is used to indicate their interdependence in the description of a single molecule, <i>but care must be exercised not to confuse this symbol with that used to indicate equilibration</i> (&#x21CC;) <i>between different molecules</i>. <a id="page_3" class="page">page 3, Chapter1 Aromatic character and the structure of benzene</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Chemists tend to use &#x2018;curly&#x2019; arrows to show electron movements and to summarize reaction mechanisms. For this purpose classical structures are required and it is customary to use one Kekul&#x00E9; formula to represent benzene, its limitations being taken for granted. This is the system adopted in this book.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Resonance energy and the importance of H&#x00FC;ckel&#x2019;s rule</h2>
<p class="noindent">Benzene is more stable than predicted: for example, when cyclohexene is hydrogenated 120 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of energy is released. It follows that for a hypothetical cyclohexatriene <i>c</i>. 3 &#x00D7; 120 = 360 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of heat <i>might</i> be generated. When benzene itself is hydrogenated the heat actually liberated is 210 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-8em;" id="fig_1.5">
 <img src="../images/page3-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption>
<p class="center2"><b>Fig. 1.5</b></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The difference between the calculated and the experimentally derived values (3 &#x00D7; 120 &#x2212; 210 = 150 kJ) is called the <b>empirical resonance energy</b>, and it illustrates the extra stability that benzene has over a hypothetical irregular cyclohexatriene molecule. This is, however, not the <i>true</i> resonance, or delocalization, energy since this would be the difference in energy between benzene and a symmetrical non-delo-calized cyclohexatriene unit, which does not exist and for which there is no simple predictive model. As a result of this uncertainty, theoretical calculations of the resonance energy of benzene vary from 40 to 120 kJ mol&#x2212;1. Whatever the actual figure, there is no doubt of the stabilizing effect of electron delocalization provided by the formation of the delocalized &#x03C0; system in benzene. Addition reactions, such as hydrogenation, are thus much less easy than might have been expected. In fact the chemistry of benzene is dominated by substitution reactions in which the products retain the &#x03C0; system and only the hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Importantly, the empirical resonance energy of benzene is greater than that of its <i>acyclic</i> analogue hexatriene, and the latter molecule, like others in its class, undergoes addition rather than substitution reactions. Clearly, delocalization of the <i>p</i> electrons over six carbon atoms alone does not account for the special properties of benzene. A <i>cyclic array</i> is necessary, but if this were the only factor then the higher <a id="page_4" class="page">page 4, Chapter1 Aromatic character and the structure of benzene</a>homologue of benzene, cyclooctatraene, would also be expected to show aromatic properties. Cyclooctatraene is a stable compund, but unlike benzene it is not planar and it exists in the form of a &#x2018;tub&#x2019;. Two types of carbon-carbon bond are present, four in which the atoms are separated by 150 pm, and four by 135 pm.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">These bond lengths are closely similar to those of single and double bonds, respectively, in simpler molecules. The molecule undergoes addition reactions rather than substitution, and therefore behaves as a typical alkene. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the calculated and the experimentally determined energy content of cyclooctatetraene. However, cyclooctatetraene can be converted into a dianion which, significantly, has a planar structure: all the carbon-carbon bond lengths are equal (141 pm), and it has a delocalized &#x03C0; system. In the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum the protons of the dianion are all equivalent and give rise to a singlet at &#x03B4; 5.7.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Cyclooctatetraene and its dianion differ in the number of <i>p</i> electrons present, and, as we shall see, this determines whether &#x2018;aromatic character&#x2019; is observed or not. A related situation is noted for the lower homologue of benzene, cyclobutadiene. Here the parent molecule is unstable and decomposes above 4 K. It might be argued that the instability of this molecule is due to steric problems created by the small ring size and that this outweighs any benefits derived from the delocalization of the &#x03C0; electrons. Ring strain in such a small molecule is undoubtedly important, but the tetramethylcyclobutadienyl dication is stable in liquid sulphur dioxide solution, and can be formed by treating 3,4-dibromotetramethylcyclobutene with antimony pen- tafluoride in this solvent (<a href="#eqn_1.1">eqn 1.1</a>). (<sup>1</sup>H NMR studies show that all the methyl groups in the dication are equivalent.)</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-13.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">It might have been supposed that the chemical shift of this resonance should be at <i>c</i>. &#x03B4; 7.2, comparable with the proton resonance of benzene; the discrepancy is thought to be due to the effect of the charge which acts to oppose the induction of the ring current.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Cyclooctatetraene and cyclobutadiene contain eight and four <i>p</i> electrons respectively (4<i>n</i> systems), whereas benzene has six, and the dianion of cyclooctatetraene has ten (a 4<i>n+</i>2 system in which <i>n</i> = 2). The dication of cyclobutadiene is an example of a 4<i>n+2</i> species in which <i>n</i> = 0.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The presence of (4<i>n</i>+2) electrons conveys some aromatic stability to the cyclo- butadienyl dication and similarly allows the cyclooctatetraene dianion to achieve planarity. The question then remains: what is special about the (4<i>n</i>+2)<i> p</i> electron number?</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">From the results of quantum mechanical calculations H&#x00FC;ckel proved that the energy levels of the individual molecular orbitals within the &#x03C0; systems of regular planar-polygonic molecules, with an even number of atoms, form a symmetrical pattern as shown in <a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>. There is a single lowest energy level with the others arranged above it in pairs of equal energy (degenerate), until a single highest energy level is reached. The number of orbitals will depend upon the ring size of the polygon; some will be bonding and others antibonding. In certain cases a non-&#x2003; <a id="page_5" class="page">page 5, Chapter1 Aromatic character and the structure of benzene</a>bonding energy level will also be present: which by definition lies half way between the highest bonding and the lowest antibonding levels.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">A representation of the number, the types, and the relative separations of the energy levels for a particular polygon can be obtained by inscribing it inside a circle such that one vertex is at the lowest point of the circle. A line drawn horizontally across the centre of the circle represents the non-bonding level. The energy levels of the molecular orbitals are then indicated by those points where the polygon and the circumference of the circle meet. Those below the non-bonding line are bonding, those above are antibonding. This mnemonic device (see <a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>), first introduced by Musulin and Frost, not only describes the available molecular orbitals within <i>potentially</i> aromatic monocyclic systems, but also illustrates their relative energies.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Benzene is a regular planar hexagon so it has three bonding molecular orbitals and three antibonding orbitals. Since there are six <i>p</i> electrons to be accommodated, benzene has all its bonding orbitals filled, and it thus achieves stability in the same way as an inert gas. For an eight atom planar polygon there are also three bonding orbitals, but additionally two degenerate non-bonding orbitals. Were this to represent the energy levels in cyclooctatetraene, six of the eight available <i>p</i> electrons would occupy the bonding orbitals with their spins paired; but following the stipulation that electrons enter orbitals of equal energy singly, before pairing takes place, the remaining two electrons must occupy the non-bonding orbitals, <i>one in each.</i> These two electrons have their spin states parallel. Planar cyclooctatetraene is thus represented as a triplet diradical. Small wonder then that it is not a planar molecule, since if it were, and a delocalized &#x03C0; system were forced upon it, the two electrons would be forced into close proximity and would strongly repel one another. The analysis of a four membered polygon gives a similar result: if four <i>p</i> electrons were present two would occupy the bonding molecular orbital and the other two would be located in non-bonding orbitals with their spins parallel. It follows that fully delocalized cyclobutadiene, like planar cyclooctatetraene, should be a triplet diradical (see <a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>).&#x2003; <a id="page_6" class="page">page 6, Chapter1 Aromatic character and the structure of benzene</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-22em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Although orbitals may be degenerate, i.e. have the same energy, they must differ in symmetry properties. This ensures that thay are distinct from one another, in a quantum mechanical sense.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The cyclooctatetraene molecule is non-planar. it exists as two interconverting forms requiring inversion of the ring, and also exhibits valence isomerism where the single and double bonds can interchange; in addition there is the possiblity of isomerism between the monocyclic structure and bicyclo[4.2.0]octatriene (<a href="#fig_1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>).</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The small ring size of cyclobutadiene does not permit it to assume a nonplanar structure. However, there is evidence that below 4 K it exists as a rectangular structure, with alternate single and double bonds, which also rapidly equilibrates between two possible valence isomers. The non-symmetrical arrangement is adopted to overcome the mutual overlap of the two spin parallel <i>p</i> electrons predicted for a molecule having square planar geometry. By adopting a rectangular shape the degeneracy of the highest occupied orbitals is destroyed. Two new orbitals are created, one of lower energy than the other. Now <i>both</i> electrons can be accommodated in the lower energy orbital with their spins paired.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Note that although calculations suggest that derivatives of the cyclobutadienyl dication (such as the tetramethyl salt discussed above) cannot be completely planar because of steric interference between the substituents, there is sufficient effective overlap between the <i>p</i> orbitals to provide a significant stabilizing effect.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Planar cyclic polyenes with (4<i>n</i>+2) <i>p</i> electrons (<i>n</i> = 0,1,2,3, etc) fulfil the H&#x00FC;ckel requirement for aromaticity and are more stable than their acyclic counterparts (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_3">p. 3</a>). However, similar molecules with delocalized (4<i>n</i>) <i>p</i> electron systems are inherently unstable and are often said to be <i>antiaromatic.</i> When two electrons are added to either cyclooctatetraene or cyclobutadiene, they enter the non-bonding levels with the result that now these, as well as the bonding MOs, are filled (see <a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>). The anions now contain (4<i>n</i>+2) <i>p</i> electrons and, since all the electrons in such species are spin paired, planarity is possible and aromatic stabilization is achieved.</p>
