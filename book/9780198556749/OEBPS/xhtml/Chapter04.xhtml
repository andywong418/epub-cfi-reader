<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">When an arene C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>X is substituted by an electrophile R<sup>&#x002B;</sup>there are three principal sites for bonding: C-2 (<i>ortho, o</i>), C-3 (<i>meta, m</i>), and C-4 <i>(para, p</i>). From a statistical point of view since there are two <i>ortho</i>, two <i>meta</i>, and one <i>para</i> position the ratio of products should be 2:2:1. However, the nature of the group X has a major influence upon both the site of the attack and the ratio of products formed. Furthermore, it has a decisive effect upon the conditions needed to bring about the reaction. These facts are exemplified by the results of nitration experiments upon some simple monosubstituted benzenes (see <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Attack may also occur at the <i>ipso</i> position, i.e. at the carbon atom to which the group X is already bonded. For electronic or steric reasons this may be unfavourable. In addition, the original substituent X may not form a good cationic leaving group, so that even if the appropriate intermediate is formed it simply collapses back to the starting materials. Despite these factors <i>ipso</i> substitution can be a significant reaction under certain circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The results in <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a> indicate that it is more difficult to nitrate nitrobenzene than it is to nitrate the other compounds. In addition, whereas the nitration of nitrobenzene gives mainly <i>m</i>-dinitrobenzene, the other three compounds give products which arise predominantly through attack at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Inductive effects within the isolated molecule</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Halogen atoms and most of the commonly encountered substituent groups, apart from alkyl units (which are built up from <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>carbon atoms), are more electronegative than the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>hybridized carbon atoms which constitute the benzene ring. As a result <a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chapter4 Orientation of electrophilic substitution reactions</a>a dipole is created and charge is withdrawn from the ring. Inductive effects are exerted through bonds and diminish rapidly with distance: they will thus be strongest at the <i>ortho</i> positions and weakest at the <i>para</i>. While inductive effects certainly do have an influence on the rates of reactions, their ability to determine the orientation of the incoming electrophile is normally overridden by resonance (delocalization) effects.</p>
<p class="noindent">Strictly speaking the transition states should be considered, but unfortunately the geometries and charge distributions of such species are not easily assessed. However, as pointed out on <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_9">p. 9</a> it is reasonable to assume that a transition state will resemble its related sigma complex.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">For example, if the <i>ortho, meta,</i> and <i>para</i> sigma complexes for the substitution of nitrobenzene with an electrophile R<sup>&#x002B;</sup>are considered, the internal resonance of the resident nitro group places a positive charge next to the ring. In the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para sigma</i>  complexes this is conjugated with the positive charge carried by the ring carbon atoms. This is not so for the <i>meta</i> intermediate where the two charges are separated. The internal energies of the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> complexes are thus higher than that of the <i>meta</i> intermediate and they are formed more slowly (<a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>). The electrophilic substitution of arenes already bearing substituents containing carbonyl (C&#x003D;O), sulphonyl (O&#x003D;SO<sub>2</sub>H), cyano (C&#x2261;N), and similar electron-withdrawing unsaturated groups, bonded to the ring can be treated similarly and give the same result. <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Chapter4 Orientation of electrophilic substitution reactions</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1"><a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chapter4 Orientation of electrophilic substitution reactions</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Contrasting results occur for compounds such as methoxybenzene (Z &#x003D; CH<sub>3</sub>), or phenol (Z &#x003D; H)(<a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>), which have an oxygen atom directly bonded to the benzene nucleus. Here the oxygen atom has a lone pair of electrons in an orbital which is co-planar with and overlaps the &#960; system. In the cases of the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> intermediates this allows the lone pair electrons to delocalize with the nucleus and to share the positive charge with the oxygen atom. As a result the energy contents of the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> intermediates are reduced relative to that of the <i>meta</i> in which this is not possible. The rates of formation of the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> intermediates are thus faster than that of the <i>meta</i> <b>.</b></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Similar intermediates can be drawn for thiols and the halobenzenes, but note that an increase in atomic diameter decreases the effectiveness of the overlap between the lone pair electrons and the pi system. A lowering of the resonance effect may thus be anticipated in the order O>S and F>Cl>Br>I.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">While resonance normally has the dominant role in determining the site adopted by the entering electrophile (<b>the electromeric effect</b>), the rate of the reaction is also influenced by the electron withdrawing power of the original substituent (<b>the inductive effect</b>). Thus <i>all</i> substituents which are more electronegative than hydrogen exact a negative penalty on the reaction rate and the observed kinetics are in fact a compromise between the electromeric and the inductive effects. In chlorobenzene, for example, the lone pairs of electrons on the chlorine atom assist in delocalizing the positive charge in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> sigma complexes formed by attack of an electrophile <b>R</b><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, whereas this is not possible for the <i>meta</i> complex. This ensures that the preferred reaction products are the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> derivatives, but since the chlorine atom is strongly electron withdrawing the overall reaction rate is much slower than the reaction of the electrophile with benzene itself (<a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>).</p>

<b>Fig. 4.4</b> The nitration of aniline in acidic media
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The conditions used and the ability of the substrate to act as an acid or a base, also have a fundamental influence on the course of aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions. Thus the amino group of aniline strongly activates the molecule towards electrophilic attack, but aniline is a weak base and protonation, or reaction with a Lewis acid, generates the anilinium cation. Now the lone pair electrons are no longer available to delocalize the charge in the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> sigma complexes and because the group <sup>&#x002B;</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>itself bears a positive charge the overall rate of the reaction is severely decreased. It might now be thought that the product should consist entirely of the <i>meta</i> isomer, but in fact a mixture of all three isomers is formed, in which the <i>meta</i> and the <i>para</i> predominate (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>). There is strong evidence that in conc, nitric acid sulphuric acid mixtures all three isomers are derived through the nitration of the anilinium cation, not the free base (Bamford and Tipper 1972). Interestingly, in nitric acid sulphuric acid mixtures the proportion of the <i>para</i> isomer falls from 59&#x0025; to 37&#x0025;, whereas the <i>meta</i> increases from 36&#x0025; to 64&#x0025;, as the concentration of the sulphuric acid is increased from 82&#8211;98&#x0025;.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Similar results are noted for the nitration of <i>N</i>-methylanilines in nitric acid sulphuric acid mixtures (note the effect of the NMe<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>group upon the rate nitration versus benzene, <a href="#tab_4.2">Table 4.2</a>), and again the relative proportion of the <i>meta</i> and <i>para</i> isomers formed depends on the sulphuric acid concentration in the reaction mixture.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Phenols are weak acids and in alkaline solutions form phenate anions (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_63">p. 63</a>). The fully developed negative charge of the anion may be utilized to stabilize <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> sigma complexes &#8212; an advance on the stabilizing effect provided by the lone pair electrons of the parent phenol. As a consequence, reactions with electrophiles are more rapid in alkaline solution than they are in acidic or neutral media (<a href="#eqn_4.1">eqn 4.1</a>).</p>

Here the result is similar to that obtained by &#x2018;normal&#x2019; electrophilic attack at an unsubstituted carbon atom, but the product ratios may differ. The arenium ions in <i>ipso</i> reactions can sometimes be trapped by available nucleophiles. Thus in the case of the nitration of 1,2-dimethylbenzene with nitric acid-acetic anhydride the dimethylbenzenenium ion reacts with acetate anion to give a dihydrocyclohexadiene adduct. 1,4-Elimination of nitrous acid then affords 4-acetoxy-l,2-dimethylbenzene (<a href="#eqn_4.3">eqn 4.3</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Kinetic versus thermodynamic control</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">For a reaction capable of forming two or more products, the above discussion would indicate that the product ratio would follow directly from the relative stabilities of the individual sigma complexes, or, more correctly, from the energies of the respective activation barriers, i.e. the more accessible the intermediate the more abundant the corresponding product. However, so far, we have not considered the thermodynamic stabilities of the final products. Thus although one compound may form faster than another, it may involve less strong bonds, or it may be more sterically crowded. An important point to remember is that all reactions are potentially reversible, provided enough time and energy is available, and product ratios are often radically changed simply by raising the temperature and/or extending reaction times.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Birch reduction</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Although the catalytic hydrogenation of benzene and its derivatives is difficult because of the loss of resonance stabilization (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_3">p. 3</a>), it is possible to effect the reduction of many arenes to 1,4-dihydroarenes, including benzene itself, by the Birch reduction. In this procedure the arene, in liquid ammonia containing an alcohol (XOH) as a source of protons (ammonia is insufficiently acidic), is treated with a metal (M), usually lithium or sodium. Initially, a single electron transfer occurs from the metal to the arene to give a radical anion which is then protonated. The radical formed receives another electron yielding an anion, which protonates to form the 1,4-dihydroarene. If an aliphatic amine is the solvent, rather than ammonia, the reaction may continue so that two, or all three, &#x2018;double bonds&#x2019; of the parent arene are reduced.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In the case of alkylbenzenes the rate of reaction is slower than for benzene itself. This is due to electron donation from the substituent, through the hyperconjugative effect. The retarding effect is further enhanced for other groups, e.g. OAlkyl or N(Alkyl)<sub>2</sub>, in which a pair of electrons can be conjugated with the &#960; system of the ring. For these substrates the products are 2-substituted 1,4-dihydrobenzenes (1-substituted 1,4-cyclohexadienes) (<a href="#eqn_4.4">eqn 4.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">One <i>(not totally convincing)</i> explanation for the regioselectivity observed in the Birch reduction of arenes with an electron donating substituent is that the negative charge of the radical anion &#x2018;avoids&#x2019; the electron supply of the substituent. The <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter4 Orientation of electrophilic substitution reactions</a>converse would then be true for those arenes bearing electron withdrawing groups (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>H, or CONR<sub>2</sub>). Certainly the reaction rate of the first step is now faster, and the electron withdrawing substituent is found on a <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i>-hybridized carbon atom in the product. Regardless of the nature of the substituent, the hydrogen atoms are normally added <i>para</i> to each other, i.e. 1,4-cyclohexadienes are formed in preference to 1,3-cyclohexadienes, although the latter are more conjugated.</p>
