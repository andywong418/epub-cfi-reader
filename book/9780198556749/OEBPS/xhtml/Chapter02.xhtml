<p class="noindent">If benzene is reacted with a reagent R (<a href="#eqn_2.1">eqn 2.1</a>) it is reasonable to conclude that should R be positively charged (an electrophile) the process will be easier than when R is negative (a nucleophile). For example, as the reagent approaches the nucleus it will first come into contact with the electrons of the &#x03C0; system. If the reagent is negatively charged it will be repelled, whereas if it is positively charged it will be attracted. Also, in the substitution reaction, the reagent replaces a hydrogen from the nucleus. Thus if the attacking species is R<sup>&#x2212;</sup> then the hydrogen would leave as a hydride ion, whereas if R<sup>+</sup> is used the hydrogen is replaced as a proton. Hydride ions have a high energy content, whereas the solvated proton is a low energy species. For these reasons electrophilic substitution is commonplace, whereas nucleophilic substitution only occurs under special circumstances.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">All three names are commonly used and are interchangeable.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent">The energy profile of an electrophilic substitution reaction with benzene as the substrate can be represented diagrammatically, see <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. Here the various steps of the process are illustrated along the horizontal <i>reaction coordinate,</i> whilst the vertical axis denotes their relative free energies. Initially, the energy rises as the electrophile (R<sup>+</sup>) interacts and disrupts the &#x03C0; system passing through a transition state T<sub>1</sub> in which a sigma bond to one of the ring carbon atoms is partly formed. The difference between the maximum point on the curve and the free energy of benzene represents the activational barrier to the forward reaction &#x0394;G<sup>#</sup>. From T<sub>1</sub> the reaction sequence proceeds to form a sigma bonded intermediate (<i>sigma complex, arenium ion</i>, or <i>Wheland intermediate</i>) (see <a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). Here a bond between the electrophile and the ring carbon is fully formed and the hybridization state of the carbon atom at the point of attachment to the electrophile is <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>, rather than <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>. The true nature of the transition state is not easily predicted, but it is reasonable to assume that the transition state resembles the sigma complex. However, the energy content of the latter is lowered as some stability is achieved by delocalization of the positive charge over the remaining five <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms of the ring. The close relationship between the transition state and the intermediate is a useful concept, and for <a id="page_9" class="page">page 9, Chapter2 Reactions of arenes</a>more complex reactions as, for example, the electrophilic substitution of an arene already bearing a functional group, a consideration of the resonance effects within the possible sigma complexes provides an easy means of predicting the preferred orientation of substituents in the product(s) (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_18">p. 18</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Transition states are transient in nature and cannot be observed directly. As a result it is difficult to gain detailed information about them. In order to overcome the problem it is usual to adopt the <b>Hammond postulate:</b>&#x2018;if two states, as for example a transition state and an unstable intermediate, occur consecutively during a reaction process and have nearly the same energy content, their interconversion will involve only a small reorganization of molecular structure&#x2019; (Hammond 1955). Referring to <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>, this means that the transition state T<sub>1</sub> is more likely to resemble the intermediate than the reactants. Similarly, the same intermediate is a better model for the second transition state T<sub>2</sub> than the products.</p>

<p class="baindent">In order that the reaction should progress to the final product another transition state T<sub>2</sub> is traversed in which the sigma bond to the proton of the tetrahedral carbon atom weakens and eventually breaks. As this happens there is an initial increase in energy, but this falls as the proton is removed with a base B, and the &#x03C0; system is restored to yield an aromatic product (<a href="#eqn_2.2">eqn 2.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1"><a id="page_10" class="page">page 10, Chapter2 Reactions of arenes</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In certain cases the whole sequence is reversible and the rates of the forward and back reactions are governed by the heights of the respective activational barriers, represented by the energies of the two transition states T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> respectively. Whether the reaction is energy consuming (endothermic), or energy releasing (exothermic) will depend upon the relative stabilities of the starting compounds and the products. This is reflected in the magnitude of the standard free energy change &#x0394;<i>G</i>&#x00B0; (if it is assumed that the entropy change &#x0394;<i>S</i>&#x00B0; for the reaction is small then &#x0394;<i>G</i>&#x00B0; = &#x0394;<i>H</i>&#x00B0;-T&#x0394;<i>S</i>&#x00B0; approximates to &#x0394;<i>G</i>&#x00B0; &#x2248; &#x0394;<i>H</i>&#x00B0;).</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Evidence for the intermediacy of sigma complexes</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is much evidence for the formation of sigma complexes. Thus when benzene is treated with SbF<sub>5</sub>&#x2013;HSO<sub>3</sub>F in SO<sub>2</sub>ClF&#x2013;SO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> at -120 &#x00B0;C the benzenenium cation is formed and its <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum can be recorded (<a href="#eqn_2.3">eqn 2.3</a>). Sometimes sigma complexes can be isolated as solids, as in the case of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which reacts with HF/BF3 to give 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenenium tetrafluoroborate (<a href="#eqn_2.3">eqn 2.4</a>).</p>
<figure style="margin-left:-7em;" id="eqn_2.3">
 <img src="../images/page10-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The fact that sigma complexes form does not prove that they participate in electrophilic substitution reactions, but strong evidence is available from kinetic data. Thus the rates of the nitration of benzene and perdeuteriobenzene, under identical conditions, are virtually the same. If the breaking of the respective C&#x2013;H and C&#x2013;D bonds were involved in the rate determining step then differences in the strengths of these bonds would be reflected in different reaction rates. No significant isotope effect is detected and so the rate determining step must be the generation of very similar intermediates, namely two benzenenium ions (<a href="#eqn_2.5">eqn 2.5a</a>, <a href="#eqn_2.5">b</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;margin-left:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:1.5em;">Calculations suggest a maximum rate difference, <i>k<sub>H</sub></i>/<i>k<sub>D</sub></i>, of about 7 at 25 &#x00B0;C.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In certain types of electrophilic substitution reactions, such as the Friedel&#x2013;Crafts acylation (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_14">p. 14</a>), small kinetic effects are observed. This does not invalidate the addition/elimination mechanism, rather it indicates that the energy barrier for fragmentation of the carbon&#x2013;hydrogen isotope bond is greater than that required for the formation of the sigma complex, i.e. T<sub>2</sub>&gt;T<sub>1</sub> (see <a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). <a id="page_11" class="page">page 11, Chapter2 Reactions of arenes</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>&#x03C0; complexes</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is known that &#x03C0; or charge transfer complexes are formed between arenes and a large number of electrophiles (including halogens, Lewis acids, and unsaturated compounds bearing strongly electron withdrawing groups, such as tetracyanoethene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene). Thus, for example, the red-brown colour which develops when solutions of iodine (violet) and benzene (colourless) in carbon tetrachloride are mixed is probably due to a &#x03C0; complex in which charge is transferred between the two participants (<a href="#eqn_2.6">eqn 2.6</a>). <a id="page_12" class="page">page 12, Chapter2 Reactions of arenes</a></p>
<figure style="margin-left:-9em;" id="eqn_2.6">
 <img src="../images/page12-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The recognition that &#x03C0; complexes exist has led some organic chemists to suggest that they may be involved in electrophilic substitution reactions. However, the &#x03C0; bond in such complexes is very weak and their formation and dissociation is so rapid, that even if they do participate it is unlikely that the reaction rates would be affected. </p>
