<p class="noindent">We have seen in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a> how a molecule can fall apart if given enough energy in the form of radiation (photodissociation). If it is given a somewhat larger amount of energy, it can also be made to ionize</p>

<p class="noindent">the process is known as <i>photoionization</i>. It is very similar to the photoelectric effect in which radiation of a variable frequency is shone on the surface of an easily ionizable metal (like an alkali). Provided the photon energy <i>hv</i> is greater than a certain amount, known as the work function, electrons are emitted. The term photoionization is usually used to describe the same process when it is carried out in the gas phase. The threshold energy in this case is known as the <i>ionization energy.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in a particular orbital <i>n, I</i> is just the energy required to remove that electron from the influence of the Coulombic attraction of the nucleus (i.e. to infinity). In other words, it is the energy of the electron in that orbital, measured relative to the ionization limit. We have seen in the previous chapter how a similar orbital description can be applied to molecules. In that case, however, the description is only approximate, requiring the repulsive interaction between electrons to be neglected. Nevertheless, it provides a guide to the ordering of electronic levels and allows their symmetries to be determined. In this picture, the ionization energy can be equated with the energy required to remove an electron from a particular molecular orbital of the molecule. The first ionization energy <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> gives the energy to remove the electron from the highest occupied orbital in the neutral molecule, <i>I</i><sub>2</sub> gives the energy required to remove an electron from the next highest orbital and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">If a gaseous sample of molecules M is irradiated with a beam of light of a single, fixed frequency <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>, the excess energy (over the amount required to ionize the neutral molecule) appears almost completely as translational energy of the ejected electron. If the excess kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and subtracted from the energy of the photons <i>hv</i><sub>0</sub>, the difference is the ionization energy of the molecule. If there are several possible ionization processes which can occur below the photon energy, each will give a signal at the appropriate electron kinetic energy. This set of observations constitutes the photoelectron spectrum. The energy level scheme for the experiment is shown in <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The energy required for the experiment depends on the photoionization process involved. For example, the energy required to remove a valence electron is about 80 000 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> or 10 eV. A photon of this energy falls in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum (strictly the vacuum ultraviolet) and so an experiment of this type is called ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy or UVPES (often abbreviated to UPS). On the other hand, a source of soft (or  <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a>low energy) X-rays has enough energy (about 1000 eV) to remove inner-shell or core electrons. The technique in this case is referred to as X-ray PES or XPS. The first UPS experiments were carried out independently by F. I. Vilesov in Leningrad and by D. W. Turner in London in 1962; the original XPS experiments were performed a little earlier by K. Siegbahn in Sweden. In this chapter, we shall confine our attention to UPS.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">The basic arrangement of the photoelectron spectroscopy experiment is shown in <a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>. Monochromatic radiation in the vacuum UV is focused onto a gaseous sample of molecules M, causing them to be ionized according to <a href="#eqn8.1">eqn 8.1</a>. The excess energy from this process, over and above the ionization energy, is released almost completely as kinetic (i.e. translational) energy of the electrons. The electrons are ejected in all directions; a small fraction passes through a slit into the analyser region. The voltage across the curved electrostatic analyser is such that only electrons of a given energy reach the detector; the voltage can be varied, thereby changing the kinetic energy required for transmission. The photoelectron spectrum is then recorded as the number of electrons reaching the detector per second as a function of their kinetic energy.</p>
<p class="indent">The monochromatic source of light is usually an atomic lamp. A commonly used one is based on the He I resonance line at 58.4 nm (21.22 eV) which corresponds to the ls<sup>1</sup>2p<sup>1</sup> &#8722; 1s<sup>2</sup> (<sup>1</sup>P &#8722; <sup>1</sup>S) transition. It was through the development of such a lamp that Turner was able to record the first photoelectron spectra. Since those days, VUV radiation has also been provided for PES by a synchrotron source and, in more recent times, by lasers.</p>
 <p class="indent">The spectral linewidth achieved in photoelectron spectroscopy is rather poor compared with the other branches of spectroscopy described in this book. In practice, it is typically about 10 meV (or 80 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) although linewidths as small as 4 meV have been achieved in particular experiments. This means that the technique is limited to the resolution of vibrational structure only; it is not possible to observe rotational structure in a photoelectron spectrum. In the <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a>VUV experiment, the linewidth is not limited by that of the radiation source but rather by instrumental factors such as the cleanliness of the analyser surfaces. A recent variant of the photoelectron spectroscopic experiment, based on tunable lasers and confined to the detection of electrons at threshold, has a much higher resolution (a linewidth of 1 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> or less). This experiment is known as zero kinetic energy electron or ZEKE spectroscopy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Energy considerations</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If we apply monochromatic radiation of frequency <i>Vo</i> to our sample, the conservation of energy requires that</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.2"><mrow><mi>h</mi><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>trans</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>&#x2212;</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mtext>M</mtext></msub></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.2)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">(see <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>). Although the energy of the parent molecule M is quite small (it is just the thermal energy), that of the photon is large. This energy is shared between the products of the photoionization process in <a href="#eqn8.1">eqn 8.1</a>; the manner in which it is shared provides the information content of the photoelectron spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to conforming to the conservation of energy, the photoionization process must also obey the conservation of linear momentum. The momentum of M and that of the photon on the left-hand side of <a href="#eqn8.1">eqn 8.1</a> are very small and can therefore be neglected (the photon has a momentum of <i>h/&#x03BB;</i> from the de Broglie relation). Thus, if the ion M<sup>+</sup> and the photoelectron move apart with velocities Vi<sub>on</sub> and v<sub>e</sub> we have</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.3"><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext></mrow></msub><msub><mtext>&#x03BD;</mtext><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>e</mtext></msub><msub><mtext>&#x03BD;</mtext><mtext>e</mtext></msub><mo>&#x2248;</mo><mn>0.</mn></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Thus</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.4"><mrow><msub><mtext>&#x03BD;</mtext><mtext>e</mtext></msub><mo>&#x2248;</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>e</mtext></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mtext>&#x03BD;</mtext><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext><mtext>.</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.4)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From this, it is easy to show that the kinetic energy of the electron is a factor (Mi<sub>on</sub>/m<sub>e</sub>) larger than the kinetic energy of the ion M<sup>+</sup>. The least favourable case we can consider is the photoionization of H2; even for this, the kinetic energy of the electron is 3600 times larger than the ion kinetic energy. It is thus quite justifiable to assume that all the surplus kinetic energy in the process 8.1 is carried off by the electron. Rearranging <a href="#eqn8.2">eqn 8.2</a>, we see that kinetic energy of the electron is given by</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.5"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>trans</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>h</mi><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>&#x2212;</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>ion</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>&#x2212;</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mtext>M</mtext></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.5)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The energy of the ion M<sup>+</sup> has a translational and an internal contribution; the same applies to the parent molecule M. From the considerations above, we see that the translational contributions to M<sup>+</sup> and M can be ignored. The internal contributions can be further partitioned in accord with the Born-Oppenheimer principle:</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.6"><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>int</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>el</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mtext>vib</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.6)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Thus the measured kinetic energy of the photoelectron gives the difference in energy between the ion and the parent neutral molecule.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Electronic energy contribution</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ionization process can be thought of, to a first approximation, as the excitation of M in its ground state to form M<sup>+</sup> in a different electronic state. In other words, the bulk of the energy given to M is used to increase the electronic energy of the system. This <i>difference in electronic energy</i> is known<a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a> as the ionization energy (it is also called the ionization potential in some older textbooks).</p>
<p class="indent">If we ask ourselves what transitions of this type are allowed, it may be rather surprising to learn that there are almost no restrictions at all on this process. The selection rules governing photoionization are very lax (although it does turn out that one-electron excitations are much more likely to occur in practice). This is in fact one of the strengths of the experiment&#8212;it is possible to reach a much greater variety of electronic states of the ion than it is in conventional electronic spectroscopy described in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>. The one selection rule which applies to photoelectron spectroscopy concerns the allowed change in electron spin multiplicity. It is</p>

<p class="indent">The molecular orbital description of electronic structure, introduced in the last chapter, provides a very simple way of understanding the photoionization process. Suppose that an electron is allocated to a particular orbital in the neutral molecule. Photoionization consists simply of the removal of the electron from this orbital to infinity, leaving all the other electrons undisturbed in their original orbitals. In other words, the energy <i>I</i><sub>i</sub> required to remove the electron is a direct measurement of its orbital energy</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.8"><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mtext>i</mtext></msub><mo>&#x2248;</mo><mo>&#x2212;</mo><msub><mi>&#x03B5;</mi><mtext>i</mtext></msub></mrow></math><span class="no">(8.8)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">where <i>&#603;</i><sub>i</sub> is the orbital energy introduced in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#eqn7.11">eqn 7.11</a>. The negative sign is required because orbital energies are measured relative to the ionization limit and so are defined to be negative. The interpretation in <a href="#eqn8.8">eqn 8.8</a> was first proposed by Koopmans and is known as Koopmans&#8217; theorem. (Strictly speaking, the orbital energy in <a href="#eqn8.8">eqn 8.8</a> should be interpreted as the self- consistent field or SCF energy. In an SCF calculation, some account is taken of the presence of the other electrons in the molecule. Also, Koopmans&#8217; theorem applies only to closed-shell molecules.)</p>
<p class="indent">We know from its dependence on molecular orbitals that Koopmans&#8217; theorem must be approximate. Molecular orbital theory assumes that the electrons in a molecule move independently and so ignores the correlation between them caused by electron&#8211;electron repulsion. In addition to this, Koopmans&#8217; theorem assumes that the orbitals of M and M<sup>+</sup> are identical. This is clearly not the case because the electrons that remain in M<sup>+</sup> will rearrange themselves slightly after the ionization to establish a new minimum of energy (a phenomenon which is called electron reorganization).</p>
<p class="indent">The quantity that is measured in photoelectron spectroscopy is the ionization energy which corresponds to the difference in energy between the ion M<sup>+</sup> and its neutral parent M; this quantity is accurately defined. The approximation in Koopmans' theorem comes from the involvement of orbitals which are, in the final analysis, an imperfect theoretical construct. Despite this, the theorem is very useful because it shows that the ionization energies measured in a photoelectron spectrum give a direct representation of the molecular orbital diagram of the molecule, in so far as it is valid. It is this simple interpretation of a photoelectron spectrum which is so appealing to physical chemists.</p>

<p class="noindent">We know from earlier chapters that the vibrational motion of a molecule can make a significant contribution to its internal energy, <a href="#eqn8.6">eqn 8.6</a>. In the photoelectron spectroscopy experiment, we usually start with the neutral molecule M in its zero point vibrational level. However, excitation can produce the ion M<sup>+</sup> in one of several vibrational levels of the upper electronic state. To the extent that we can separate electronic and vibrational motion, the relative intensities of these different vibrational bands are governed by the Franck-Condon principle, exactly as they are for electronic spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter7.xhtml#ch7.5">Section 7.5</a>). Thus, for example, if the electron is removed from a non- bonding orbital of M, the potential energy curve and the <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> value for M<sup>+</sup> will be very similar to those of the parent molecule. Thus, the bulk of the transition intensity is confined to the (<i>&#965;</i>&#8242;, <i>&#965;</i>&#8243;) = (0, 0) band and there is essentially no vibrational structure in the photoelectron spectrum. However, the removal of an electron from a bonding or anti-bonding orbital causes a large change in bond length and consequently extensive vibrational structure in the photoelectron spectrum; there would be a long vibrational progression as shown in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>. Such behaviour is illustrated nicely by the photoelectron spectrum of H<sub>2</sub>. The two electrons in the single bond in this molecule are in the l&#963;<sub>g</sub> (1s) orbital (see <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). Removal of one of these electrons leads to a reduction in the binding energy and a longer bond length <i>r<sub>e</sub></i> in the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msup><mtext>X</mtext><mn>2</mn></msup><mstyle displaystyle='true'><msubsup><mo>&#x2211;</mo><mtext>g</mtext><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> state of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></math> which is formed, see <a href="#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>. The most probable vibrational transition is to the level <i>&#965;</i>&#8242; = 2 by the Franck-Condon principle. The long progression which results is shown clearly in the photoelectron spectrum of H<sub>2</sub> in <a href="#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The difference in the electronic energies of M and M<sup>+</sup> is obviously best defined as that corresponding to the (0,0) band. This quantity is known as the <i>adiabatic ionization energy.</i> However, it may not be very easy to measure this quantity in practice, especially if the vibrational progression is so long that the first members are weak and not observed. Because of this, a quantity known as the <i>vertical ionization energy</i> is defined in practice. This is the energy which corresponds to the intensity maximum in the <i>&#965;</i>&#8243; = 0 progression. We note that, <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a>since Koopmans&#8217; theorem makes no allowance for the reorganization of electrons or nuclei, it is probably more appropriate to interpret it in terms of the vertical rather than the adiabatic ionization energy. Such ambiguities of interpretation remind us not to place too much trust in the quantitative predictions of Koopmans' theorem.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Rotational structure</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In conventional photoelectron spectroscopy, it is very rare for the rotational structure in a vibrational band to be resolved. However, the laser techniques employed in ZEKE spectroscopy allow spectra to be recorded with much higher resolution and rotational structure is routinely observed, even for quite large molecules such as benzene. The rotational selection rules in this case are not very restrictive because they depend on the angular momentum carried off by the ejected electron. This can be seen by applying the conservation of angular momentum to the overall process (<a href="#eqn8.1">eqn 8.1</a>); the laxness of the &#916;<i>J</i> selection rule arises because the photoelectron can take away any amount of angular momentum.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the discussion of the molecular orbital diagram in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml#fig7.2">section 7.2</a>, we expect the 3&#963;<sub>g</sub> and 1&#960; orbitals to have bonding character (the latter more so than the former) and the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mover accent='true'><mi>&#x03C3;</mi><mo>&#x00AF;</mo></mover><mi>u</mi></msub></mrow></math> orbital to have antibonding character.

However, the progressions associated with the ionizations <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>3</sub> are both short, which implies that the bonding and<a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a> antibonding characteristics of the 3&#963;<sub>g</sub> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mover accent='true'><mi>&#x03C3;</mi><mo>&#x00AF;</mo></mover><mi>u</mi></msub></mrow></math> orbitals are, rather unexpectedly, only slight. Careful scrutiny of the spectrum also shows that the vibrational spacings are different in the three transitions. In particular, the interval for the <i>I</i><sub>2</sub> ionization to the A<sup>2</sup>&#928;<sub>u</sub> state is 1904 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, significantly smaller than the vibrational interval in the parent molecule (2359 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). This is also indicative of the bonding character of the 1<i>&#960;</i><sub>u</sub> orbital. The interpretation of the photoelectron spectrum (Fig. 8.5) is also consistent with the bond lengths of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></math> in the three electronic states, which have been determined by high- resolution electronic spectroscopy. These bond lengths are given, together with the harmonic vibrational wavenumbers, in <a href="#tab8.1">Table 8.1</a>. The largest change in bond length and vibrational wavenumber occurs on excitation from N<sub>2</sub> to the A state of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></math>. In the X state of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup></math>, the bond length is slightly longer and for the B state it is slightly shorter than for N<sub>2</sub> consistent with weak bonding and antibonding character of the 3&#963;<sub>g</sub> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mover accent='true'><mi>&#x03C3;</mi><mo>&#x00AF;</mo></mover><mi>u</mi></msub></mrow></math> orbitals.</p>

<p class="noindent">The direct photoionization process given in <a href="#eqn8.1">eqn 8.1</a> takes the molecular system from a region of bound, quantized energy levels to a continuum above the ionization limit. There is another, indirect route to the same final products, M<sup>+</sup> + e; this process is known as <i>autoionization.</i> It is summarized in <a href="#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>. The molecule M is first excited to an electronic state of the neutral molecule with energy above the ionization limit. From here, it can emit an electron spontaneously to form the ion M<sup>+</sup>:</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="eqn8.9"><mrow><mtext>M</mtext><mo>+</mo><mi>h</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>&#x2192;</mo><msup><mi>M</mi><mo>&#x2217;</mo></msup><mo>&#x2192;</mo><msup><mi>M</mi><mo>+</mo></msup><mo>+</mo><mtext>e</mtext></mrow></math><span class="no"><span class="space">&#160;</span>(8.9)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The first step of this scheme is a resonant process and obeys the usual electric dipole selection rules; it can be brought about only by light of the appropriate wavelength (or energy). The autoionization process is the second step. Since no radiation is involved, the only requirement is that the symmetry of the autoionizing state must be the same as that of the final state plus the electron. The overall process, <a href="#eqn8.9">eqn 8.9</a>, must satisfy the conservation of energy. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the electrons ejected in the second step is the same as the photoelectrons would have if they were ionized directly with light of the same wavelength. However, the probabilities of the direct and indirect processes are often very different. As a result, the intensities of the different electronic transitions and their vibrational structure are also different.</p>
<p class="indent">Autoionization will not affect a photoelectron spectrum unless it so happens that the frequency of the ionizing radiation just matches a transition<a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a> frequency of the neutral molecule. This occurs rarely but, when it does, it can produce a spectrum with a markedly different appearance. The autoionizing state is generally a Rydberg state of M, belonging to a series which converges on some higher ionization limit (the state must obviously lie below this limit). Because the ionization energy of most valence electrons is less than 21 eV, it is very unusual to observe autoionizing states with He 1 radiation. However, if a lower energy atomic lamp, such as the Ne 1 resonance line at 73.6 nm (16.85 eV), is used, several autoionizing states can be encountered. There is a well-known autoionization in molecular oxygen at this wavelength, for example.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Zero kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy</h2>
<p class="noindent">The resolution in conventional photoelectron spectroscopy is limited by the accuracy with which the kinetic energy of the electrons can be measured; it is typically 10 meV (80 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). As a result, much structural information, notably rotational structure, is not accessible to this experiment. A variant of photoelectron spectroscopy which has a much higher resolution has recently been developed by K. M&#252;ller-Dethlefs and colleagues in Germany. The technique is called zero kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy or ZEKE spectroscopy. The linewidth achieved in these experiments can be as small as 0.2 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, providing an improvement in resolution of over two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p class="indent">In the conventional photoelectron experiment, shown in <a href="#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>, the incident radiation has much more energy than is necessary to ionize the neutral molecule. The excess energy is carried off as kinetic energy of the photoelectron. If, on the other hand, we have available a <i>tunable</i> source of radiation, we can adjust the frequency so that it provides just enough energy to excite the molecule to a particular rotational-vibrational level of a given electronic state of the ion M<sup>+</sup>. In this case, the photoelectrons appear with zero kinetic energy. If we arrange to detect just those electrons which have zero kinetic energy, we can record a spectral line whose width is dictated only by that of the radiation source. The feasibility of such an experiment depends largely on the development of narrow-line, tunable sources of coherent radiation in the vacuum UV or at even shorter wavelengths. The radiation is usually provided by lasers whose frequency has been doubled or tripled.</p>
<p class="indent">The way in which the signal at the detector can be limited to those electrons with zero kinetic energy is based on a very simple idea. The molecules M in the sample chamber are ionized with a pulse of radiation of the appropriate frequency. Photoelectrons are ejected in all directions and with a spread of energy. The electrons with non-zero kinetic energy move away from the photoionization region whereas those with zero kinetic energy remain where they are formed. After a short time interval, therefore, only the electrons in which we are interested remain; they have become spatially separated from the moving electrons. These electrons can then be extracted into a time-of-flight drift tube by applying a pulsed electric field and will arrive at the detector after a characteristic, determinable delay to constitute the signal. The ZEKE spectrum consists of the electron signal plotted as a function of the frequency of the incident radiation.</p>
<a id="page_86" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 86, Photoelectron spectroscopy</a>
<p class="indent">The precise definition of the zero kinetic energy electrons can be somewhat spoiled in practice by small, stray electric fields which inevitably occur in the ionization region. A refinement of the basic ZEKE experiment has therefore been developed. Tunable radiation is applied to the molecule M with energy very slightly less than the ionization energy. This excites the molecule to a very high Rydberg state in which an electron is orbiting at a large distance around the M<sup>+</sup> ion core. This electron is very loosely held by the molecule and the Rydberg state can be easily ionized by application of a small, pulsed electric field which pulls the electron away from the core. As before, there is a delay between the laser and electric field pulses. During this interval, the M* molecules do not have time to move away and the field-ionized electrons are formed at the original excitation site (i.e. in the same place as the ZEKE electrons). Since they are formed only on application of the electric field, they can be detected much more efficiently than the ZEKE electrons. The technique is known as ZEKE-PFI (pulsed field ionization). While PFI and ZEKE electrons give rise to almost identical spectra, there is a small energy shift between them. This difference can be accounted for empirically to give the true, zero-field ionization energies.</p>
<p class="indent">ZEKE spectroscopy has two advantages over conventional photoelectron spectroscopy. As already mentioned, the resolution is much higher and it is routinely possible to observe rotational structure. For example, the ZEKE spectrum of the X<sup>1</sup>&#931;<sup>+</sup> &#8722; B<sup>2</sup>&#931;<sup>+</sup> transition of nitric oxide (NO) has been recorded at rotational resolution; a small part is shown in <a href="#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>. In addition, because ZEKE spectroscopy is based on pulsed lasers, measurements can be made as a function of time and it is possible to study the <i>dynamics</i> of the various processes involved.</p>
