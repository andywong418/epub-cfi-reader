<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Towards the end of the Napoleonic wars in Europe, Joseph von Fraunhofer carried out one of the first spectroscopic experiments. He simply focused the direct light from the sun onto a narrow slit, dispersed the light from this image with a prism, and looked carefully at what he saw. (This was effectively the same experiment which Isaac Newton had carried out some 150 years earlier but with much higher dispersion and some ability to measure the wavelengths). In addition to the familiar rainbow pattern formed by spreading out sunlight into its component wavelengths, he saw several black lines superimposed which corresponded to the image of the slit at particular wavelengths. Not knowing the explanation for these features, he simply produced a list of the lines, labelling the major ones alphabetically A, B, C .... H.</p>
<p class="indent">It was many years later (1859) that the correct explananation for these lines was suggested by G. R. Kirchoff, namely that the light from the sun was being absorbed at these particular wavelengths by chemical species that are present in the solar atmosphere. The double line in the yellow, labelled D by Fraunhofer, was assigned to the sodium atom because the wavelengths corresponded exactly with the bright lines seen when salt was introduced into the flame of a Bunsen burner. By working systematically through all conceivable possibilities, Kirchoff was able to assign all the Fraunhofer lines to a variety of different elements such as Fe and Ca. This early achievement demonstrates the power of spectroscopy to identify specific atoms and molecules remotely because their spectra are all different and uniquely characteristic. This ability is still exploited today, being used to identify and monitor molecules in remote astrophysical sources like the interstellar clouds, in the further reaches of our own atmosphere, and even in the exhaust gases of cars as they speed past on the highway.</p>
<p class="indent">This book is concerned with the basic ideas of molecular spectroscopy. The treatment is confined almost completely to diatomic molecules and the objective is to explain how spectra arise, what they look like in practice and what information about the molecule can be extracted from them. Because spectroscopy is Quantum Mechanics in action, it is necessary to understand something about this subject. Some of its simplest concepts are introduced in a qualitative manner as a framework on which to hang the discussion of the various branches of spectroscopy later on in the book. This dependence of spectroscopy on Quantum Mechanics is direct and inextricable. A thorough study of spectroscopy however returns the favour because it provides an insight into the quantum world from which perception flows.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The basic spectroscopic experiment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spectroscopy is the study of the way in which electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter as a function of frequency (or wavelength). The simplest<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Radiation and matter</a> possible experimental arrangement is shown in <a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>. The beam from a tunable source of radiation (nowadays almost always a laser) is passed through the sample contained in a cell and its intensity is measured by a detector. The variation of the signal intensity as the frequency of the radiation is scanned is called the <i>spectrum</i>. If the light wave does not interact at all with the sample in this frequency range, the spectrum is flat and uninformative (the sample is said to be transparent). If, however, the radiation interacts at particular wavelengths, energy is absorbed and various peaks occur in the spectrum (corresponding to a reduction in intensity at the detector). These absorption features are often called &#8216;lines&#8217;, harking back to the very earliest spectra when lines were indeed recorded, being the image of a slit on a photographic plate (or on the retina of the eye in the case of Fraunhofer). The spectral wavelengths recorded in this way are characteristic of the molecule being studied and are a primary source of information on its structure and dynamics.</p>

<p class="noindent">Electromagnetic radiation is described as a <i>transverse waveform</i>. By this is meant that it consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields which point transversely to the direction of propagation of the wave. For example, for linearly polarized light, the oscillating electric field might point in the <i>X</i> direction, the oscillating magnetic field in the <i>Y</i> direction, and <i>Z</i> is the direction of propagation, see <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>. The plane of polarization is conventionally defined as the plane containing the <i>E</i> field and the direction of propagation (<i>XZ</i>). Both the electric and magnetic field are oscillating at the same frequency <i>v</i> (in units of s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> or Hz) and the light wave travels through a vacuum at a very high (but finite) speed, <i>c</i> = 2.9979 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The distance between adjacent crests at a given point in time is called the wavelength, &#955;:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Although electromagnetic radiation has the same mathematical description throughout its whole spectrum, we are used to thinking of it in separate sections because of the different effects it has on its surroundings. The section which is most familiar is of course the region of visible light, spreading out from red light at the long wavelength end to violet at the short. Moving out to longer wavelengths (or lower frequencies) from the visible, we come in succession to the infrared, the microwave and finally the radiofrequency regions. On the other side of the visible region, we encounter the ultraviolet and then the X-ray regions (beyond this lie the regions of <i>&#947;</i>-rays and cosmic rays but radiation at these wavelengths is not used in laboratory-based spectroscopy). The wavelengths and frequencies which define these regions are shown in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Essentially all spectroscopic effects can be described by treating the radiation classically, as a transverse waveform. It is sometimes convenient and simpler to describe light of frequency <i>v</i> from a quantum standpoint. From this perspective, light is regarded as a stream of particles, called <i>photons</i>, each of which carries an energy <i>hv</i>, where <i>h</i> is Planck&#8217;s constant (of which, more anon) and <i>v</i> is the frequency. This was Einstein&#8217;s explanation for perplexing observations such as the photoelectric effect which could not be understood on the classical basis that light consisted of a continuous electromagnetic field. In order to explain some of the phenomena associated with light, it was necessary to ascribe rather bizarre properties to the photon. Thus, although a photon has no mass, it does possess linear momentum of magnitude <i>hv</i>/c. It also carries one unit of angular momentum (&#177;<i>h</i>/2<i>&#960;</i>).</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.4">
<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>The interaction between radiation and matter</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spectroscopy is the study of the exchange of energy between radiation and matter. The mechanism by which this occurs involves the interaction between the oscillating electric (or magnetic) field in the radiation with the appropriate dipole moment in the molecule. In order for this interaction to be strong, the dipole moment must be oscillating in some way (for example, through rotation or vibration of the molecule) at the same frequency as the radiation field. The spectrum recorded by Fraunhofer of material on the sun is quite typical of all spectroscopic observations in that matter can only respond to light at particular, discrete frequencies. There is no absorption of light in between individual lines. This is a direct effect of the quantization of energy at the molecular level. As we shall see later in this book, at the scale of atoms and molecules, the energy of the system cannot take on any value but only those which correspond to so-called <i>stationary states</i>. This behaviour is called the<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Radiation and matter</a> quantization of energy. In exactly the same way as we described light above as a collection of individual photons each carrying its own energy, so we can think of a molecule as moving around with only certain permitted amounts of energy. The exchange of energy that is at the heart of the spectroscopic process therefore corresponds to the photon giving up its energy <i>hv</i> to the molecule to raise it from a lower energy level <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> to a higher one <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>. Conservation of energy therefore requires</p>

<p class="noindent">If energy is emitted in the form of light (i.e. the reverse process takes place), <a href="#eqn1.4">eqn 1.4</a> still holds good. The molecule falls to a lower level and emits a photon of the appropriate frequency. <a href="#eqn1.4">Equation 1.4</a> enshrines an important statement, due primarily to Einstein and Planck, which says that the energy change produced in a molecule is proportional to the frequency of the radiation responsible. The constant of proportionality is called Planck&#8217;s constant and has a value of 6.6261 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;34</sup> J s, in other words, it is very small.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Relative energy units in spectroscopy</h2>
<p class="noindent">The practice of spectroscopy consists of the measurement of the discrete amounts of energy which are passed between molecules and radiation when they interact. These energy exchanges can then be interpreted in terms of the structural properties of the molecule as we shall see in later chapters. In the laboratory however, it is not energy that is measured directly. Rather, in the radiofrequency, microwave, and far-infrared regions, spectral measurements are made in frequency units (in Hz). For infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectroscopy where the primary standard of measurement is length, it is the wavelength &#955; (in m) of the radiation which is measured. It might seem a simple exercise to convert these quantities to energy units by invoking <a href="#eqn1.4">eqn 1.4</a> or equivalently</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>h</mi><mi>c</mi><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mtext>&#x2009;</mtext><mi>&#x03BB;</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&#x2212;</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>.</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math><span class="no"><span class="space">&#160;</span>(1.5)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">However, this conversion is almost never made in practice, partly because it is not necessary but more importantly because it is often the case that the frequency of a transition can be measured much more accurately than the uncertainty with which Planck&#8217;s constant <i>h</i> is known. (It used to be necessary to consider the uncertainty in the speed of light <i>c</i> also but this quantity was defined to be exactly 299792458 m s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 1983.) Therefore the amount of energy is less reliably known than the frequency from which it is derived. Consequently, the energy change involved in spectroscopic transitions is measured in relative units, either <i>frequency</i> in Hz, MHz, GHz (or whatever is appropriate) or the inverse of the wavelength (called the <i>wavenumber</i>) in m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> or more commonly cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The wavenumber <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mover accent='true'><mi>v</mi><mo>&#x02DC;</mo></mover></math> is defined by</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>n</i><sub>air</sub> is the refractive index of air for the wavelength concerned. This conversion is relevant because many spectrometers operate with their optical paths through air at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Mention should also be made of another unit of energy which is useful in spectroscopy, namely the electron-volt (or eV). This is the amount of energy<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Radiation and matter</a> which an electron acquires when it has been accelerated through a potential of 1 V. Substituting the charge of an electron in Coulombs, we calculate that 1 eV corresponds to 1.6022 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;19</sup> J molecule<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This unit is particularly appropriate to the measurement of ionization processes but it is also useful for the measurement of separations between electronic states of molecules. These separations correspond to a large number of cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (several tens of thousands) but only a few eV. The conversion factors between these various units are summarized in <a href="#tab1.1">Table 1.1</a>.</p>
