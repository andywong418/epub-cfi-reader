<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series aims to contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Professor John Brown presents an authoritative and precisely written account of <i>Molecular Spectroscopy</i> focusing largely on the spectroscopy of diatomic molecules to make the subject easily accessible to all. The topic is of fundamental importance in physical chemistry and undergraduates will be fascinated by the remarkable level of detail at which we now understand the behaviour of small molecules. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
