<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:3em;">2.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the protected forms of potentially nucleophilic FGs&#x2014;alcohols, amines, thiols&#x2014;the original heteroatom is usually present and capable of reacting with electrophiles unless steric encumbrance or conjugation is completely effective (which it rarely is). Whether or not this leads to deprotection depends on the groups attached to the heteroatom. Reversible protonation or activation with a Lewis acid polarises the electrons in the attached bonds leading to electron deficiency at adjacent centres. If one of the attached groups is capable of supporting a full positive charge then rapid cleavage is likely to follow. This behaviour forms the basis of a large range of <i>acid-labile</i> PGs that cleave by forming a stabilised cationic intermediate on addition of either a protic or Lewis acidic reagent (pathway <i>a</i> below).</p>
<p class="indent">If the attached groups do not readily support a full positive charge nothing further is likely to happen unless a good nucleophile is present (e.g. halide ion) whereupon deprotection may follow by displacement of the activated heteroatom (pathway <i>b</i>). Typical Lewis acid-nucleophile combinations include ZnBr<sub>2</sub>, TiCl<sub>4</sub> (with or without added LiI), R<sub>2</sub>BBr, TMSI, BBr<sub>3</sub>/NaI, Ac<sub>2</sub>O/FeCl<sub>3</sub>, and BF<sub>3</sub>OEt<sub>2</sub>/Et<sub>4</sub>N<sup>&#x002B;</sup>I<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. The two cases correspond respectively to S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution at the PG.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Cation stabilisation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Acid-labile PGs must contain molecular features that stabilise cations. Stabilisation can be achieved by inductive (&#x03C3;-framework), mesomeric (&#x03C0;-framework), or hyperconjugative (&#x03C3;-&#x03C0; overlap, OCP &#x0023;36, page 25) donation of electrons, or by the release of steric strain when the atom bearing the positive charge rehybridises to accommodate it. These features are summarised overleaf for a charge nominally localised on a carbon atom:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b><i>tert</i></b><b>-Butyl protecting groups</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A combination of inductive stabilisation and strain release on ionisation underlie the acid lability of PGs based on the <i>tert-</i>butyl group. The -OH group in alcohols and carboxylic acids and the -SH group in thiols can be directly protected by isobutene (condensed or in concentrated solution) in the presence of a protic or Lewis acid (usually H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or BF<sub>3</sub>.OEt<sub>2</sub> respectively). Handling isobutene as the gas or in condensed form can be inconvenient; therefore, methods have been devised for generating <i>t-Bu<sup>&#x002B;</sup></i> from more convenient precursors (e.g. <i>t</i>-BuOH &#x002B; c.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/MgSO<sub>4</sub>); <i>t</i>-Bu esters may also be produced by traditional esterification techniques (see page 56). The <i>t</i>-Bu group provides excellent steric shielding of alcohols, impedes nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group of <i>t</i>-Bu esters, prevents oxidation of thiols to disulfides and, being easily removed by acid, is a popular choice even for the protection of highly functionalised molecules.</p>

<p class="indent">Amines can also be protected by the <i>t</i>-Bu group but the acidic conditions required for direct teri-butylation preclude its use, the amine protonating in preference (R<sub>2</sub>NH &#x2192; R<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, the ammonium cation is non-nucleophilic, <i>cf</i>. page 5).

<h3 class="h3"><b>Benzylic protecting groups</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Stabilisation of positive charge by conjugation with an alkenyl &#x03C0;-system also provides a basis for acid lability. A lone unsubstituted double bond (i.e. an allyl PG) does not confer enough stability to a cation for ionisation to occur under normal protic conditions but if the double bond is substituted appropriately then cleavage can be significant, at least in the case of carboxyl protection, where the deprotection of methallyl esters follows an A<sub>A1</sub>1 pathway. Under comparable conditions benzyl esters are only partially cleaved which suggests a relative order of cation stability: allyl &#x003C; benzyl &#x003C; methallyl.</p>

<p class="indent">Only a few of the many combinations of FGs and PGs based on benzyl functionality are routinely cleaved by acidic hydrolysis; benzyl PGs are more often chosen because of their relative ease of cleavage by redox processes. In this section we will concentrate on those benzyl PGs whose acid lability is valued in synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">A single unsubstituted benzyl group can rarely be cleaved by protic acids alone and Lewis acid-nucleophile combinations are more reliable (<a href="#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>). However, two or more phenyl rings (or one if it is substituted with an <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 2 Acid-labile protecting groups</a>electron-donating group, e.g. OMe) <i>are</i> sufficient to ensure ionisation, and PG cleavage can be relied upon after addition of the usual proton sources.</p>
<p class="indent">For <i>alcohol</i> protection the Ph<sub>3</sub>C- (triphenylmethyl, trityl, Tr) group, historically developed for carbohydrate chemistry and later aiding the construction of oligonucleotides, is the most important. Only l&#x00B0;-alcohols react at a useful rate with trityl chloride in pyridine (S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism) so selective protection of these hydroxyls is possible (1); this feature is a major reason for using this PG. In the presence of the more powerful base 1,8-diazabicyclo&#x005B;5.4.0&#x005D;undec-7-ene (DBU), even 2&#x00B0;-alcohols can be tritylated (2).</p>

<p class="indent">In addition to providing selective protection of l&#x00B0;-hydroxyl groups the trityl group offers good resistance to bases but is easily removed by acid treatment, TFA, HCO<sub>2</sub>H, and AcOH offering progressively milder cleavage conditions (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s: page 19). Formic acid in ether is sufficiently selective to cleave trityl ethers in the presence of other acid-sensitive groups including acetals (page 24) and TBS ethers (page 77).</p>

<p class="indent">The rate of trityl group cleavage can be fine-tuned by substituents on one or more of the phenyl rings; electron-donating groups favour cation formation which speeds the cleavage process, and vice versa. This is particularly useful in the protection of the 5&#x2032;-OH in nucleosides where more acid-labile variants of the trityl PG can be removed without competing loss of the base (which can be a problem with the trityl group itself). Below is a comparison of the times required to effect complete hydrolysis of trityl (Tr), <i>p</i>-methoxy-phenyldiphenylmethyl (MMTr), di(<i>p</i>-methoxyphenyl)phenylmethyl (DMTr), and tri(<i>p</i>-methoxyphenyl)methyl (TMTr) ethers.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Cation stabilisation is enhanced by the presence of electron-donating groups particularly in the <i>para</i>-position where the balance of long-range mesomeric electron donation <i>vs</i>. short-range inductive electron withdrawal is most favourable.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The need for <i>amine</i> protection during amino acid and peptide synthesis has given rise to a variety of benzyl PGs that enjoy widespread use rather than being of merely academic interest.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, whilst simple benzyl amines are not efficiently cleaved under protic conditions <i>N</i>-trityl amines are. These are readily prepared with either TrCl or TrBr &#x002B; Et<sub>3</sub>N and, once on, are very stable to basic reagents. However, N-tritylation of &#x03B1;-amino acid derivatives sterically encumbers the carboxyl group inhibiting ester hydrolysis and peptide formation which limits its applications. A second drawback is that Tr amines can be <i>so</i> labile to acids that handling and purifying them is impractical; however, if two of the phenyl rings are joined by a single bond, the ease of cation formation is dramatically reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">This modified Tr PG&#x2014;the 9-phenylfluorenyl (PhFl) group&#x2014;shares many features in common with Tr (stability to bases and organometallic reagents, steric bulk and ability to shield adjacent carboxyl functionality, solubility in organic solvents) but is around 6000 times more stable to acid. The fluorenyl cation is a 12&#x03C0;-electron system, is therefore antiaromatic, and its formation is comparatively unfavourable.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg23-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Introduction of the PhFl group can be achieved under conditions similar to those used for trityl protection (e.g. PhFlBr, Et<sub>3</sub>N) but deprotection requires more strongly acidic conditions (aq. TFA, CH<sub>3</sub>CN) (hydrogenolysis or dissolving metal reduction is also effective, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.3">Section 5.3</a>). In the synthesis of unnatural amino acids the steric bulk of this PG disfavours deprotonation at the &#x03B1;-position of aspartic acid derivatives and prevents nucleophilic addition to the adjacent carboxyl group; DIBAL reduces the &#x03B3;-carboxyl group even though that ester is also quite hindered (by an adjacent 4&#x00B0;-centre).</p>

<p class="sidebar">The chiral catalyst (cat.* in the scheme below).</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Diphenylmethylene imine derivatives represent a further acid-labile benzyl PG for amines. Their most useful application is in the synthesis of amino acids by alkylation of protected glycine enolates either racemically or enantioselectively with a homochiral phase transfer catalyst derived from cinchonidine, an isoquinoline alkaloid. Protection in this way removes problems associated with the presence of a free amino function and the extra double bond facilitates deprotonation by adding stability to the enolate. When no longer required, this PG can be removed by mild acidic hydrolysis; citric acid is often used because its high solubility in water makes its removal by extraction a trivial process.</p>

<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg24-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Carbamates dominate nitrogen PG chemistry, combining ease of introduction and effective protection of the amine towards electrophiles with versatility because the cleavage conditions can be specified by appropriate choice of the <i>O</i>-alkyl substituent. In the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) group the single phenyl ring is insufficient to confer significant protic acid lability unless a good nucleophile is present (<i>cf</i>. <a href="#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>); usually, strongly acidic conditions are needed (e.g. HBr, AcOH) and TFA cleaves this group significantly more slowly than the Boc group (&#x21D2; selective deprotection). However, the <i>para</i>-methoxybenzyl (Moz) analogue is, as you should expect, more labile and can be cleaved with <i>p</i>-TsOH in acetone/CH<sub>3</sub>CN or 10% TFA in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>; in fact, this PG is <i>more</i> reactive under these conditions than Boc so a useful series is established graded for ease of removal by protic acid: RNHMoz &#x003E; RNHBoc &#x003E; RNHCbz. Many variants are possible and analogous <i>carbonates</i> have been used for alcohol protection.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Acetal protecting groups</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">From this discussion it should be evident that heteroatoms&#x2014;particularly oxygen&#x2014;can tip the balance and convert a relatively poorly acid-labile PG (e.g. benzyl) into one (e.g. <i>para</i>-methoxybenzyl) that may be cleaved reliably with mildly acidic reagents. Because a single phenyl ring exerts a relatively weak cation-stabilising influence, it can be dispensed with altogether if an oxygen atom is present on what was the benzylic position. This forms the basis of a second set of acid-labile PGs, those based on acetals (and aminoacetals, dithioacetals etc.):</p>

<p class="sidebar">Conceptual relationship between activated benzylic PGs and acetal PGs.</p>
<figure class="fig"><img src="../images/pg25-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As a reminder, an acetal is the product obtained when an aldehyde or ketone reacts with two molecules of an alcohol with liberation of water; a new compound is formed wherein the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two alkoxy groups (if a diol is used a cyclic acetal results). The process is catalysed by both protic and Lewis acids and, being reversible, requires removal of water to drive the reaction towards the acetal. To effect hydrolysis water is added, or acetal exchange with a large excess of an expendable carbonyl compound&#x2014; usually acetone&#x2014;can be used. In general:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg25-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Since both an alcohol and a carbonyl component combine to form a molecule which is readily decomposed by acidic hydrolysis, this represents a unified PG scheme for both these FGs.</p>
<h4 class="main3"><i>Acetal protecting groups for alcohols</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Protecting an alcohol as a symmetrical acetal by direct condensation with a carbonyl compound is rarely done because synthetic intermediates are often complex structures that are too bulky to be linked by a single carbon atom. If there is more than one OH group present a large number of acetals could be produced, and a chiral but racemic alcohol will lead to a series of diastereomeric acetals (<i>cf</i>. page 27), which makes identification and purification complicated. Overall, it is much more efficient to prepare <i>mixed</i> acetals where the second alkoxy group is expendable. By starting with an enol ether, which yields an oxonium ion after protonation, or a chloromethyl ether, which can lose Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ion as the first step of an overall S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution, mixed acetal products can be produced with predictable constitution.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg25-4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">These two classes of reagents differ in the conditions needed to introduce them. Enol ether PG reagents require acid catalysis&#x2014;a proton is added and removed for each product-forming reaction&#x2014;but acetal formation with a chloromethyl ether liberates HCl which must be removed if unwanted reactions are to be avoided; a 3&#x00B0;-amine (e.g. H&#x00FC;nig&#x2019;s base, <i>i</i>-Pr<sub>2</sub>NEt) or NaH is added for this purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest acetal PG is the methoxymethyl (MOM) ether which is easily introduced onto 1&#x00B0;- and 2&#x00B0;-alcohols using chloromethyl methyl ether (MOM-Cl) and H&#x00FC;nig&#x2019;s base; 3&#x00B0;-alcohols need MOM-I (formed <i>in situ</i> with</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 2 Acid-labile protecting groups</a>NaI) suggesting that the protection mechanism is at the S<sub>N</sub>1-S<sub>N</sub>2 borderline. The high toxicity of MOM-Cl has led to the use of alternative reagents (e.g. (MeO)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; FeCl<sub>3</sub>) that work on the same principle.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Synthesis of MOM-Cl (safer than HCHO &#x002B; MeOH &#x002B; HCI).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Aside from its ease of introduction, the principle virtues of the MOM group are that it is small and robust. MOM-protected alcohols provide little steric impediment to subsequent reactions and they can survive a wide range of reaction conditions. Sometimes they are <i>so</i> stable that cleaving them again can be a problem and the protic conditions needed to remove them (e.g. cone. HCl, MeOH) are sufficiently harsh that almost all the other acid-labile PGs are also cleaved. Milder reagents, based on Lewis acid/nucleophile combinations, are much more selective (<a href="#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Acetal PGs for alcohols formed from enol ethers include tetrahydropyranyl (THP) and ethoxyethyl (EE) derivatives, formed respectively from dihydropyran and ethyl vinyl ether with acid catalysis (by the general mechanism shown above), the acids of choice being CSA, <i>p</i>-TsOH, or PPTS (milder).</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg26-3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Both of these groups are very widely used in synthesis, offering similar benefits to MOM protection but being more readily cleaved by protic conditions as a result of the extra alkyl substituent at the acetal carbon which adds stability to the liberated oxonium ion. Even more rapid cleavage ensues when a second alkyl group is present on the acetal carbon; treatment of alcohols with 2-methoxypropene and an acid catalyst produces l-methoxy-l-methylethyl (MME) ethers which can be cleaved subsequently with aqueous AcOH. Similarly, 4-methoxy-THP ethers can be prepared from 4-methoxy-dihydropyran and then cleaved when desired under acidic conditions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Direct condensation<a id="nfn1" href="#rfn1">*</a> with carbonyl compounds <i>is</i> useful for the protection of 1,2- and 1,3-diols as cyclic acetals because both kinetic and thermodynamic factors act cooperatively to favour intramolecular acetal formation over the various intermolecular possibilities. The most useful cyclic acetals are those formed between diols and either acetone or benzaldehyde although those based on formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 5&#x2013;7-membered cyclic ketones are also frequently used. They can all be introduced onto the diol with the carbonyl compound itself, or with the synthetic equivalents listed below, plus an acid catalyst &#x005B;e.g. HCl, HBF<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (which also removes water), or <i>p</i>-TsOH&#x005D;:</p>

<p class="indent">In the presence of an acid catalyst these synthetic equivalents are capable of producing the oxonium ion intermediate necessary for nucleophilic attack by one of the hydroxyls of the diol to be protected. The idea is illustrated for acetonide formation:</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg27-3.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 2 Acid-labile protecting groups</a></figure>
<p class="indent">Since all these derivatives are formed under similar conditions how do we choose which acetal PG to use for a particular situation? A useful generalisation is that, given a choice of reacting with a 1,2- or 1,3-diol, ketones preferentially form five-membered cyclic acetals (i.e. the 1,2-diol is protected) whereas aldehydes form six-membered cyclic acetals as major products (the 1,3-diol is protected). These processes are reversible and therefore are subject to thermodynamic control, the major acetal product being that which is most stable <i>under the reaction conditions</i>; the italics are important as concentration, temperature, choice of catalyst, etc. can influence product ratios. Although the dioxane ring is inherently more stable than a comparable dioxolane, six-membered (dioxane) <i>ketone</i> acetals cannot avoid destabilising 1,3-diaxial interactions between one of the alkyl groups and coaxial substituents in either chairlike conformation; on the other hand, the single alkyl group in <i>aldehyde</i>-derived dioxanes is free to take up an equatorial position to avoid this effect.</p>

<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg28-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">In five-membered ring acetals (dioxolanes) axial and equatorial sites are less clearly defined and, on average, substituents on the acetal carbon are further away and therefore less able to interact unfavourably with other atoms around the ring. For this reason dioxolanes formed from aldehydes do not usually show a distinct preference for a particular configuration at the acetal carbon.</p>

In the example of acetonide formation in glucose (page 2), protection is accompanied by formation of the furanose product driven by the preferred formation of dioxolane rings. In contrast, treatment of glucose with benzaldehyde under equilibrating conditions proceeds to form the dioxane product that links the 4,6-diol pair.</p>

<p class="indentt">Selective protection of <i>cis</i>-1,2-diol pairings in carbohydrates is readily achievable since ds-fused dioxolanes are considerably more stable than their <i>trans-</i>fused counterparts (point 2 above). What if we need to protect selectively a <i>trans</i>-1,2-diol pairing? An elegant solution to this problem extends the idea of acetal formation to include the reaction between diequatorial 1,2-diols and 1,2-diketones in MeOH to give diacetal products. The formation of these diacetals is subject to thermodynamic control (the kinetics are complex), the major stabilising features being (i) formation of a <i>trans</i>-decalin ring system, (ii) placing the maximum number of alkyl groups in equatorial sites, (iii) maximisation of the number of anomeric effects (see OCP &#x0023;s 36 and 54). Although many important applications of this principle have been described&#x2014;notably for oligosaccharide synthesis&#x2014;in its simplest form the chemistry offers a useful complement to carbohydrate protection by acetonide and benzylidene formation.

<h3 class="h3">Substituted methyl ethers</h3>
<p class="noindent">Methyl ethers derive their stability from a reluctance to form CH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> which is too unstable to have a significant lifetime in solution. Electron-donating substituents on the methyl group stabilise the positive charge and, when sufficiently stabilising, can initiate ionisation after protonation or complexation; those cases have been discussed already. However, there are intermediate cases that are <i>capable</i> of cleavage under protic hydrolysis conditions but are more easily cleaved by the Lewis acid/nucleophile combinations mentioned above. MOM and 2-(methoxyethoxy)methyl (MEM) ethers fall into this category, as do benzyl PGs for alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines. The mechanistic principles are identical to those described for methyl ether cleavage except that, in these cases, there is more S<sub>N</sub>1 character in the cleavage event as a consequence of electron release by either oxygen or a benzene ring. The cleavage step is concerted but asynchronous, i.e. there are no discrete intermediates but, in the transition state, bond-breaking is more advanced than bond-making and the leaving group will be detached before the newly-forming bond is completed:</p>

The presence of the extra oxygen atom favours Lewis acid complexation (<i>cf</i>. page 36) and cleavage with, for example, ZnBr<sub>2</sub>, TiCl<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>BBr, or TMSI is rapid; of course the acetal linkage also leads to MEM cleavage under protic hydrolysis conditions.<a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter 2 Acid-labile protecting groups</a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Benzyl amines</h3>
<p class="noindent">Benzyl PGs for alcohols and carboxylic acids are usually selected because of their ability to be cleaved reductively, the Lewis acid/nucleophile cleavage pathway being available but less often used. However, benzyl <i>amines</i> are quite resistant to reductive cleavage but the nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom enables a useful indirect deprotection method that is mechanistically related to the activation/substitution methods discussed so far. The von Braun reaction between 3&#x00B0;-amines and cyanogen bromide (BrCN)&#x2014;developed for the degradation and characterisation of alkaloids&#x2014;proceeds by cyanation of the amine followed by bromide attack at one of the alkyl groups liberating alkyl bromide. The reaction continues no further since the nitrogen atom is deactivated as a nucleophile, its lone pair of electrons being conjugated with the nitrile. The process is normally followed (dotted arrows) by hydrolysis of the nitrile group with aq. HBr to give a carbamic acid (which loses CO<sub>2</sub>):</p>

Below, in the synthesis of chalcogran, a Norwegian spruce beetle aggregation pheromone, various useful points are illustrated: (1) dithioacetals can be prepared directly from <i>O</i>,<i>O</i>-acetals, in this case a methyl furanoside; (2) protected aldehydes can serve as acyl anion equivalents by deprotonation and alkylation; (3) 1,3-dithianes can be converted into dimethyl acetals in the presence of (protic) acid-sensitive groups (the <i>soft</i> Lewis acid Hg(II) activates only the <i>soft</i> sulfur atoms of the dithiane, not the <i>hard</i> oxygen atoms in the THP acetal groups); (4) internal acetals (spiroacetals) are generated when suitable dihydroxyketone functionality is liberated, in this case by acidic hydrolysis in the final step.</p>
