<h2 class="h2">1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries undertake multistep syntheses of complex organic molecules that possess desirable biological properties; studies of biomolecules&#x2014;proteins, oligosaccharides, and nucleic acids&#x2014;and the rapidly evolving areas of supramolecular chemistry and molecular electronics also rely on sophisticated synthesis. As structural complexity increases, so does the need to control the diverse reactivity exhibited by a wide variety of functional groups within a molecule. This book will survey a central aspect of the strategy of molecular synthesis, i.e. methods that aid the selective modification of molecules at specific sites by masking or protecting any other parts of the molecule that could potentially interfere.</p>
<p class="indent">This sub-discipline of chemical synthesis&#x2014;protecting group chemistry&#x2014; has been the subject of a number of excellent books and reviews that have been written largely with the practising research chemist in mind; these usually emphasise available laboratory methods rather than the underlying chemistry that guides the choice of protecting group. The approach adopted here places protecting groups within a mechanistic framework in order to convey an appreciation of how a protecting group can be selected from the multitude available.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec1.2"> 
<h2 class="h2">1.2 Strategy</h2>
<p class="noindent">In general, a protecting group (PG) is introduced onto a functional group (FG) to block its reactivity under the experimental conditions needed to make modifications elsewhere. The conditions under which a particular PG is either removed or left unaffected must be known; therefore, this book is organised around the mechanistic principles that influence PG reactivity.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, consider the selective oxidation of just the 3-hydroxyl group (starred in the scheme below) in glucose. It is unlikely that we could find a reagent to achieve this, so the other four hydroxyl groups must be prevented from reacting. In this specific case we can take advantage of the fact that glucose reacts with acetone in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a single compound in which the 3-hydroxyl group is unaffected. Oxidation with PDC is then unambiguous and subsequent acidic hydrolysis reveals the four hydroxyl groups. Overall, acetone protects four of the hydroxyl groups in glucose by forming two cyclic acetal derivatives (acetonides, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This use of two acetonide PGs allows the ketone to be prepared in good yield but a negative aspect of PG chemistry is immediately apparent; two extra synthetic steps have to be added to the sequence, one to introduce the acetonide PGs and one to remove them after oxidation. This is somewhat</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/pg1-1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>inefficient but, until organic synthesis reaches the level where there is a reagent available for every eventuality, we are stuck with the need to use PGs and must concentrate on maximising their efficiency.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg2-1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent">Given that PGs can be unavoidable, we have to place fairly stringent limitations on their properties if they are to be generally useful. Ideally, a PG should be introduced in quantitative yield at the desired site under conditions that cause no alteration of the rest of the molecule, preferably without introducing new stereogenic centres.<a id="nrfn1" href="#nfn1">*</a> The PG must remain intact during all the subsequent reactions and must neither induce side-reactions nor affect the outcome of the chemistry in an unpredictable manner. Ultimately, when no longer required, the PG must be removable under specific conditions that cause no disruption of the rest of the molecule. Accommodating all these requirements (and others: cost, toxicity, etc.) is a tall order and very few PGs have proven to be generally applicable to a wide variety of situations; this is one reason why there are so many&#x0021;</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><a id="nfn1" href="#nrfn1">*</a>Non-stereoselective introduction of a new stereogenic centre leads to the production of a mixture of 
diastereomers which complicates both purification and spectroscopic characterisation.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">In the middle of a synthesis it is usually desirable to be able to remove specific PGs without cleaving others but at the end of a synthesis it is more efficient to remove all of the PGs in a single step. This leads to two generalisations that guide PG strategy: (1) Reaction conditions should be available that remove just one type of PG leaving all the other types intact and groups of these other types should, when necessary, be removable without affecting the first type. Groups of PGs that can be deprotected under these &#x2018;mutually exclusive&#x2019; conditions are often referred to as <i>orthogonal sets</i>. For example, acetate esters (-OAc) are cleaved reliably with NH<sub>3</sub> but generally are unaffected by catalytic hydrogenolysis, whereas benzyl ethers (-OB<sub>n</sub>) are essentially inert to amine nucleophiles and catalytic hydrogenolysis is the method of choice for their removal.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">(2) Removing all the PGs at the end of the synthesis in a single step is incompatible with the presence of orthogonal sets of PGs; thus, within each set, there should be a degree of fine-tuning to allow selectivity during the synthesis (&#x2018;graduation of lability&#x2019;). Evans&#x2019; synthesis of cytovaricin, an antibiotic, made heavy use of silyl PGs of varying stability to allow differentiation during the synthesis. However, in the final step, HF was added as it is sufficiently powerful to remove all seven silicon atoms in four types of silyl PGs to expose the eight hydroxyl groups in the natural product.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.3 Functional group reactivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Broad strategic issues aside, the choice of PG is heavily influenced by the type of reactivity that must be blocked which requires a knowledge of the characteristic reactivity of each FG. Although this is discussed in detail in OCP &#x0023;35 (see Further reading list on page 17), the key FG characteristics are summarised here in the context of their need for protection.</p>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Alcohols (R-OH)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The lone electron pair(s) borne by heteroatoms&#x2014;O, N, and S&#x2014;in their lower oxidation states impart nucleophilicity (in general: O &#x003C; N &#x003C; S). Alcohols therefore react readily with oxidising agents (&#x2192; carbonyl compounds) and with other electrophiles (alkyl halides &#x2192; ethers, acyl halides &#x2192; esters); if electrophilic reagents are required and reactions at selected hydroxyl sites are to be avoided, this nucleophilic behaviour must be deactivated. Sterically encumbering the hydroxyl oxygen with a bulky PG can prevent it competing effectively for electrophiles. The triphenylmethyl (trityl, Tr) ether PG is an example; rotation about the O-CPh<sub>3</sub> bond is rapid and the phenyl rings sweep out a large volume around the oxygen atom to prevent the approach of <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>anything but the smallest electrophiles (e.g. H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, page 22).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The inherent nucleophilicity of an oxygen atom may be reduced by delocalising the lone electron pairs by conjugation with, for example, a carbonyl &#x03C0;-system. For example, pivaloate (Pv) esters can be introduced selectively onto l&#x00B0;-hydroxyl groups and have the added advantage that the carbonyl carbon is sterically hindered (by the <i>tert</i>-butyl group) towards attack by nucleophilic reagents.</p>

<p class="indent">Replacement of the hydroxyl proton with a relatively inert stand-in avoids this problem. For example, alkyl ethers are easy to prepare (Williamson ether synthesis and modifications), they survive a wide variety of reaction conditions, but can be difficult to remove when no longer required. Modified alkyl ethers, that incorporate additional functionality, may be removed under mild conditions; examples of these PGs will appear throughout the course of the book. Silyl ethers are easily introduced with silyl chlorides or triflates (trifluoromethanesulfonates) and offer a number of advantages over alkyl ethers: (1) they reduce the effective nucleophilicity of the oxygen atom sterically and electronically, (2) the silyl alkyl substituents can be chosen to provide the desired level of protection, and (3) they may be readily removed under highly selective conditions.<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Amines (R-NH<sub>2</sub>, R-NHR</b>&#x2032;<b>, R-NR</b>&#x2032;<b>R</b>&#x2033;<b>)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Proton removal from 1&#x00B0;- and 2&#x00B0;-amines by basic reagents is not as great a problem as it is with alcohols because the nitrogen atom has a reduced ability to bear a full negative charge (electronegativity: page 46). Even so, many organometallic reagents <i>are</i> sufficiently basic to fully deprotonate amines<a id="nfn2" href="#nrfn2">*</a> and protection is required in these instances. More importantly, this weaker capability to support negative charge is manifested in a much higher nucleophilicity, e.g.</p>

<p class="indent">Because amines compete <i>so</i> effectively for electrophiles it can be very difficult to handle molecules that bear free amines&#x2014;both from the point of view of reactivity and ease of purification&#x2014;therefore a good plan is to keep the amine in a protected form for as long as possible, only deprotecting it at the very end of the route. As with alcohols, the nucleophilicity of amines can be reduced by steric encumbrance but PGs that involve the lone pair of electrons in another bond are much more reliable. Quaternisation with a reactive alkyl halide (MeI, BnBr) or protonation to produce an ammonium salt completely remove the nucleophilicity of the amine; this finds use in protecting 3&#x00B0;-amines during oxidation.</p>

<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/pg5-2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, the nitrogen lone pair can be brought into conjugation with a &#x03C0;-system in analogy to the use of ester PGs for alcohols; many amides (e.g. formamides, acetamides, trifluoroacetamides) and carbamates have been devised that differ in their tolerance of nucleophiles and their deprotection requirements.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Carbamates (urethanes, R2NCO2R&#x2032;) may be prepared easily by treating the amine with an alkyl chloroformate under Schotten-Baumann conditions (aq. NaOH) or with the appropriate anhydride and equivalent reagents. These derivatives impart excellent deactivation of the nitrogen&#x2019;s nucleophilicity and the carbonyl group shows good stability towards nucleophiles. Their main advantage is that the <i>O</i>-alkyl group can be chosen to allow mild and specific deprotection by methods that do not require nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The carbamate C=O group is stabilised by mesomeric electron donation by both the N and O atoms and shows very low reactivity towards nucleophilic attack. However, the two heteroatoms &#x2018;compete&#x2019; for the carbonyl so they are individually <i>less</i> involved in conjugation than in amides and esters respectively (a carbamate N is more basic than an amide N).</p></aside>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Thiols (R-SH)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The chemistry of sulfur compounds is discussed in detail in OCP &#x0023;33 but in the context of PG chemistry the most important feature is that the valence electrons centred on sulfur are readily polarisable with the result that thiols and sulfides are highly nucleophilic and easily oxidised. Therefore, PG issues of sulfur-containing molecules parallel those of amines and many of the PGs are analogous acyl derivatives (thioesters, thiocarbonates, thiocarbamates) that will not be discussed separately.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast to the N-H bond in amines, the S-H bond is weak and alkyl thiols are markedly acidic (conjugating S-substituents raise this acidity). Accordingly, thiol protection is required to prevent deprotonation by basic reagents and, for this purpose, PGs based on those used in alcohol protection are applied.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>Carbonyl groups (R<sub>2</sub>C=O, RCHO)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ability of the carbonyl group to act both as an electrophile and as a nucleophile makes it of central importance in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The aldol reaction, effected with either basic or acidic catalysis, illustrates both aspects of carbonyl reactivity.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg6-3.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></figure>

<p class="sidebar">Carbonyl chemistry is characterised by nucleophilic attack at the C=O carbon and by enol(ate) formation followed by a-functionalisation.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Base-catalysed enolate formation &#x005B;or acid-catalysed enol formation&#x005D; transforms the inherently electrophilic carbonyl group into a nucleophilic enolate anion &#x005B;or enol&#x005D; which is manifested in its addition to free aldehyde &#x005B;or protonated aldehyde&#x005D; to form the &#x03B2;-hydroxy aldehyde (&#x2018;aldol&#x2019;) product. Because the aldol reaction proceeds readily in the presence of catalytic quantities of acid <i>or</i> base, its occurrence as a competing side-reaction is difficult to avoid and carbonyl protection is a central requirement for successful organic synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, there are plenty of PGs that remove both aspects of carbonyl reactivity simultaneously. Most are based on alcohol adducts (acetals) formed under dehydrating conditions in the presence of protic or Lewis acids. The generic reaction, to form 1,1-diethoxyethane (&#x2018;acetal&#x2019;), is shown:</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The term &#x2018;ketal&#x2019; to distinguish ketone acetals from aldehyde acetals has been discarded by IUPAC.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">The acetal carbon (to which the alkoxy groups are attached) is less electron deficient, more sterically crowded, and no longer bears a polarised and relatively easily broken &#x03C0;-bond; it is therefore not susceptible to direct attack by nucleophiles. The lack of a potentially conjugating &#x03C0;-system reduces the acidity of the ot-protons so effectively that only the very strongest bases will remove them. Thus acetals effectively shield the carbonyl group from both nucleophilic attack and base-induced enolate formation.</p>
<p class="indent">Acetal formation is, however, a reversible process with the equilibrium (usually) lying in favour of the carbonyl compound;<a id="nf3" href="#nrfn3">*</a> therefore, these PGs cannot be used reliably when acidic reagents are employed, especially if water is also present.</p>

<p class="indent">If the so-formed carboxylate leads to no undesirable secondary reactions and the organometallic reagent is readily available, then use of an excess of reagent can bypass this problem. Usually, neither of these requirements apply and suitable carboxyl PGs are needed. Furthermore, protection against enolisation or attack by nucleophiles may be necessary; few PGs meet all of these requirements. Ester and amide derivatives remove the problem of the carboxyl proton, and the latter provide good protection against many nucleophiles, but neither prevent enolisation by strong bases. A work-around is built on the reliable oxidation of phenyl groups by RuO<sub>4</sub> (prepared <i>in situ</i>) to generate carboxylic acids in the presence of diverse functionality.<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Alkenes are reasonable nucleophiles (unless conjugated with electron-withdrawing groups, see OCP &#x0023;17) that react with a wide range of electrophiles to give addition products. This property may interfere with the smooth course of a desired transformation but may also be used to advantage if the alkene can be regenerated from the adduct at a later stage. Thus 1,2-adducts form by far the widest class of alkene PGs and reagents have been developed to deprotect most of the adducts that can be envisaged, e.g.</p>

<p class="indent">Protection of alkenes as their Diels-Alder adducts (with, for example, cyclopentadiene) is only feasible if the alkene is sufficiently electron deficient to act as a dienophile at reasonable temperatures and this method is usually reserved for conjugated alkenes such as &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated ketones. Reversing the process normally requires high temperatures (often &#x003E;500&#x00B0;C) but flash vacuum pyrolysis&#x2014;in which the compound is sucked as an aerosol through a pre-heated tube in the space of a few seconds&#x2014;is a practical solution.</p>

In the following example diene protection is necessary because direct acylation of the imine with the dienyl acid chloride proceeds in very poor yield.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>Alkynes (RC=CR)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The mobility of the &#x03C0;-electrons in the carbon-carbon triple bond may lead to undesired reactions with electrophiles and, in general, alkynes are more reactive than alkenes towards hydroboration, acid-catalysed hydration, and redox processes. As a result of this reactivity difference, selective protection of the triple bond in eneynes is often necessary and, fortunately, feasible. The roughly tetrahedral complexes formed when alkynes are treated with Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub> are stable to many electrophiles but can be decomplexed easily by oxidation.<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<p class="indent">The example illustrates overall hydrogenation of an alkene in the presence of an alkyne which requires that the alkyne be protected. Because the cobalt complex poisons hydrogenation catalysts, the overall addition of hydrogen has to be carried out by diimide reduction or, as shown, by hydroboration and protonation:</p>

Silylation has the advantage that there is a wide range of available trialkylsilyl groups that differ in their ease of removal. The C&#x2261;C bond in silylated alkynes is resistant to attack by most nucleophiles but will still react with electrophiles (OCP &#x0023;1) and radicals (OCP &#x0023;8). Removal of the silyl PG may be achieved with F<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ion (<i>cf</i>. hydroxyl protection) or, under milder conditions, with AgNO<sub>3</sub> followed by KCN as in the example, which summarises part of a synthesis of an insect hormone:</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4 Protecting group devices</h2>
<p class="noindent">When choosing a PG, considerations of what the PG needs to achieve must be balanced against both PG stability and the compatibility of the molecular functionality with the deprotection step. This seems to be a complex decision because of the apparently endless choice of PGs; however, the task is made easier because just a few structural units are used to form the vast majority of PGs in routine use and these structural units define broad areas of cleavage conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall refer to these small structural units as <i>devices</i> that, alone or in combination, form weak-points (or Achilles&#x2019; heels) that allow reliable PG removal under specific conditions. Usually, the presence of a particular device in a range of PGs will impart similar deprotection requirements. Identification of a device within a given PG allows us to predict whether the PG will be labile (or stable) under specified reaction conditions. The chart below lists the most important PG devices with two or three examples of their occurrence.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Following on from point (3), a carboxylate group directly bound to a heteroatom (usually O or N) can collapse by decarboxylation to give the deprotected FG directly (as a salt). Alternatively, loss of CO<sub>2</sub> may take place <i>after</i> protonation either during the reaction itself or in the course of aqueous work-up.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5 Temporary protection</h2>
<p class="noindent">If protection is only needed for a single step, it may be possible to employ a <i>temporary</i> PG wherein the protected form of the molecule is never actually isolated; instead the PG is introduced as part of the experimental procedure, the desired transformation carried out, and the PG removed at the end of the experiment, normally during the work-up stage. This approach detracts very little from the overall efficiency of a synthesis.<a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Amines</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is usually impossible to effect peracid epoxidation of an alkene within a molecule that also contains an unprotected amine because most alkyl amines are more readily oxidised than are alkenes (to give the corresponding <i>N</i>-oxide leaving the alkene intact). Temporary protection, by protonation (first example below) or by complexation with a Lewis acid (second example) prior to adding the oxidising agent, offers a solution.</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly, methylation of nicotine with Mel is non-selective, a 1:1 mixture of the products of alkylation on the pyridine and pyrrolidine nitrogen atoms being obtained. However, since the pyrrolidine nitrogen is significantly more basic than the pyridine nitrogen, salt formation with HI can provide temporary protection of that nitrogen atom enabling methylation to take place solely on the pyridine nitrogen.</p>
<figure class="imgc"><img src="../images/pg14-7.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Carbonyl groups</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In molecules that possess two or more carbonyl groups it is usually possible to find reagents that add selectively to the more electrophilic one. Achieving selective additions to the less electrophilic carbonyl in, for example, a keto-aldehyde is more challenging. A nucleophile that adds to the (more electrophilic) aldehyde to form a temporary adduct prevents further attack at the aldehyde leaving the ketone free to react with other nucleophiles. If the <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>first nucleophile is chosen correctly, the aldehyde adduct may be decomposed at the end of the reaction to reveal the product of overall addition to the ketone.</p>
<p class="indent">An example of this strategy employs Me<sub>2</sub>S as the nucleophile in the presence of a Lewis acid (TMSOTf) to aid its addition to the aldehyde; this leaves the ketone free to be converted into an acetal (using the Noyori conditions, page 32); at the end of the reaction the aldehyde is liberated again by an alkaline work-up.</p>

<p class="sidebarc">trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane-sulfonate (TMSOTf)</p></aside>
<p class="indent">A similar idea has been used to achieve overall addition to the less reactive ketone in a diketone. In the example below, Ti(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> forms a temporary adduct with the more reactive cyclohexadiene carbonyl group, enolate addition to the cyclopentanone ketone follows, and an acidic work-up regenerates the ketone.</p>

<p class="sidebar">In steroids and other rigid cyclic molecules axial methyl substituents can effectively shield one face of the molecule; in this example addition occurs selectively on the &#x03B1;-face of the carbonyl group.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">Lithium amides (R<sub>2</sub>N-Li) also form temporary adducts with carbonyl groups to provide protection against reaction with organometallic reagents. At the end of the reaction a mildly acidic aqueous work-up decomposes the hemiaminal intermediate to regenerate the carbonyl group.

<p class="indent">This idea derives from studies on the preparation and alkylation of aryllithium reagents in molecules possessing an aldehyde function.

<p class="noindent">Carboxylic acids are reduced rapidly by borane and its derivatives in a synthetically useful method for converting carboxylic acids into l&#x00B0;-alcohols. This means that attempts to effect alkene hydroboration in molecules containing a -CO<sub>2</sub>H function often give complex mixtures of products. Alkene hydroboration can, however, be achieved in the presence of carboxylic <i>esters</i> because these are unable to form the reactive tri(acyloxy)borane &#x005B;(RCO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>B&#x005D; intermediate that is implicated in the rapid reduction of carboxylic acids. Temporary protection of the -CO<sub>2</sub>H group as a TMS-ester enables successful hydroboration and oxidation of unsaturated acids, the intermediate silyl esters being hydrolysed during the oxidation step (alkaline H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), e.g.</p>
