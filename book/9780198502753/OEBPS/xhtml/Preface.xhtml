<p class="fm-no" style="margin-top:1.5em;">Protecting groups are used to block the reactivity of specific functional groups within a molecule so that chemical transformations may be carried out elsewhere without ambiguity. For students approaching this subject for the first time there seems to be a vast array of seemingly unrelated protecting groups that are used in every conceivable combination for no apparent reason; it has been my aim in writing this book to try to convey the sense that, in fact, the vast majority of protecting groups may be divided into a mere handful of different categories and that members of each category can be removed under broadly similar experimental conditions.</p>
<p class="fm-in">The suitability of a particular protecting group in a given situation is dictated by the level of protection imparted and the conditions required to remove it when no longer required; this latter feature is, in turn, a function of the chemical reactivity of the components of the protecting group and the reaction pathways available to them. Therefore the coverage is organised not, as is more usual, around the functional groups themselves, but around the conditions that cause protecting group cleavage and the mechanistic principles that underlie this reactivity.</p>
<p class="fm-in">I would like to thank Caroline for her unending patience and support during the preparation of this book, Steve Davies for all the helpful comments on draft versions of the text, and the members of my research group who have had to endure my &#x2018;Primer&#x2019; preoccupation in recent months.</p>
