<p class="fm-no" style="margin-top:1em;">Protecting groups are not only one of the most useful features of the synthetic armoury but they also provide an excellent forum for the teaching and understanding of basic mechanistic chemistry. Only by understanding the fundamental chemistry associated with the functional groups of each protecting group can successful orthogonal protecting group strategies be elucidated. The whole area of protecting group chemistry therefore provides an ideal fertile teaching area for basic organic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fm-in">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. This present Primer by Jeremy Robertson presents the concepts, mechanisms and applications of protecting groups in a unique, very logical and student friendly fashion. This Primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
