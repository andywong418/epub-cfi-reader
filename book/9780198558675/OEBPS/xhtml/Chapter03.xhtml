<h1 class="main">3&#160;&#160;Organometallic compounds</h1>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This chapter covers the most useful organometallic compounds R&#x2013;M with M = Li, Mg or Cd. Although Zn compounds have been largely superseded, one of their reactions still merits inclusion here. Lithium cuprates are treated only very briefly. The dialkyl derivatives of magnesium, R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;R, are known, but the Grignard reagents, R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal, are the ones commonly used. In this chapter R&#x2013;M stands for R&#x2013;M compound(s) or reagent(s), thus obviating repetition of &#x2018;compound(s)&#x2019; or &#x2018;reagent(s)&#x2019;. Scheme <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03"><b>3Ge</b></a> portrays polarisation of the covalent R&#x2013;M bond leading to a C<sup>&#x03B4;&#x2013;</sup> centre; this dominates the chemistry of R&#x2013;M and is responsible for tendencies <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. Tendency <b>3</b>, a nuisance, is not so readily predicted</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-left:0em; margin-top:0em;">R&#x2013;M are decomposed by water (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re1"><b>3Re1</b></a>); they are also sensitive, in the order Li > Mg > Cd, to atmospheric moisture and oxygen. The general <a class="page" id="page_26">page 26, Organometallic compounds</a>procedure is to generate R&#x2013;M in an inert solvent such as Et<sub>2</sub>O (<i>ether</i>, ethoxyethane], hexane, or benzene, and then to add the reagent to this solution. In a few cases the R&#x2013;M solution is added to the reagent. Thus R&#x2013;M are not isolated unless required for studies such as X&#x2013;ray diffraction. R&#x2013;Li are prepared and used under N<sub>2</sub>. Solutions of the less sensitive R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal in ether, b.p. 35&#x00B0;, are sufficiently protected from atmospheric moisture and oxygen by the layer of ether vapour above the solution. With R&#x2013;Cd&#x2013;R the only requirement is exclusion of water. R&#x2013;Li have many advantages over the older R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal and solutions of R&#x2013;Li in hexane may be bought. This is a great convenience to busy chemists but an expensive luxury in large scale work. For comparable reactions with, say, 50g of Me<sub>2</sub>CO the costs would be ~&#x00A3;60 for Bu&#x2013;Li supplied commercially but only ~&#x00A3;7 for Bu&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Br generated in the laboratory. (A historical note: Viktor Grignard, 1871&#x2013;1935, developed the synthetic uses of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal in his Ph.D. research at the University of Nancy. The outstanding importance of this work led to the well merited award of a Nobel Prize in 1912. However the reagents were discovered by Philippe Barbier, Grignard&#x2019;s supervisor, who suggested the study of their reactions. There was no dispute about &#x2018;priority&#x2019;; with commendable generosity of spirit Barbier insisted that the reagents should bear only Grignard&#x2019;s name.)</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;">The structures of a few solid R&#x2013;M have been investigated by X&#x2013;ray diffraction. In solutions there are equilibria between various species, and the finer details remain obscure. Some of the results are summarised in scheme <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03"><b>3Ge</b></a>. For our purposes the simple representations R&#x2013;M and R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal are adequate.</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;">The wide range of general reactions exhibited by R&#x2013;M put them in the first rank of reagents used in synthesis. They are the C<sup>&#x03B4;-</sup> complement of the C<sup>&#x03B4;+</sup> in organic halides; the two groups have central positions in functional group chemistry. Although most of the reactions (in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03b"><b>3Re</b></a>, which comes after the preparations) are depicted as occurring with R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal, the treatment is intended to include all the R&#x2013;M covered here. In general, R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal and R&#x2013;Li are similar; many of the reactions discussed later occur with both. There are, however, important differences between them, and these are clearly identified. The Cd and Zn reagents, which differ markedly from R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal, have particular applications and these are slotted in at appropriate places. (<sup>#</sup>The lithium cuprates, LiCuR<sub>2</sub>, are very useful in certain reactions where R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal are unsatisfactory. The preparation is shown here, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3pr2a"><b>3Pr2a</b></a>(<b>ii</b>), and an application is given in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#a42pr2"><b>4.2Pr2</b></a>. Full treatment, later course on synthesis.)</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;">Scheme <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03a"><b>3Pr</b></a> covers the two main methods for preparing R&#x2013;M. All types of R&#x2013;Hal (primary, secondary, and tertiary; Cl, Br, I) react with Li and Mg (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03a"><b>Pr1</b></a>). With primary and secondary Cl the reactions are inconveniently slow; with tertiary Br they are very fast and difficult to control. The halides generally used are shown in the scheme. Mel, a liquid b.p.42&#x00B0;, is easier to handle than MeBr, a gas b.p.3&#x00B0;. Allyl and benzyl halides are so reactive that they undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions with the R&#x2013;M being formed,</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;">i.e R&#x2013;Hal + R&#x2013;M &#x2192; R&#x2013;R + M&#x2013;Hal.</p>
<a class="page" id="page_27" style="width:70%;">page 27, Organometallic compounds</a>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Conditions for reducing this tendency are shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03a"><b>Pr1</b></a>. Et<sub>2</sub>O or, in a few cases, THF (tetrahydrofuran) are the solvents used with R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal. R&#x2013;Li react with Et<sub>2</sub>O at 20&#x00B0;; Et<sub>2</sub>O may be employed at &#x2013;70&#x00B0; but hexane, which is inert, is generally preferred. Benzene is the standard solvent for R&#x2013;Cd&#x2013;R.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;">R&#x2013;M prepared by <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03a"><b>Pr1</b></a> are sources of other R&#x2013;M which cannot be generated efficiently from M + R&#x2013;Hal. Several variations of this approach are set out in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3pr2a"><b>Pr2</b></a>. As the electropositivity of a metal increases so does its tendency to assume the ionic state. This determines the direction of <b>2a</b>. In <b>2a(i)</b> Mg is more electropositive than Cd; in <b>2a(ii</b>) Li is more electropositive than Cu. The outcome is that a more reactive R&#x2013;M generates a less reactive R&#x2013;M. Features responsible for the directions of <b>2b</b> and <b>2c</b> are shown in the scheme. Some syntheses would be difficult if it was not possible to form R&#x2013;M from vinyl and phenyl halides. Despite the unreactivity of these halides in S<sub>N</sub> reactions (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#acon23"><b>2.3Ge</b></a>) the Mg and Li derivates of vinyl and aryl systems can be obtained as shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#acon03a"><b>Pr1</b></a> and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3pr2a"><b>2</b></a>.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">In <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re1"><b>3Re1</b></a> the &#x2018;free bonds&#x2019; go to C or H (Section 1.4). Thus H&#x2013;O&#x2013; denotes H&#x2013;O&#x2013;H and H&#x2013;O&#x2013;R. Although R-Mg-Hal are strong bases they do not abstract a proton from simple alkanes.</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re2a"><b>Re2</b></a> illustrate the main features of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal as reagents in synthetic work. These reactions produce, initially, Mg derivatives from which the products are liberated by &#x2018;work&#x2013;up&#x2019;, usually treatment with dilute acid. For products sensitive to acid, e.g. some tertiary ROH (see later), aqueous ammonium chloride is used. In representations of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal reactions this work&#x2013;up is generally omitted; it is regarded as included in the R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal specified. The simple mechanisms of the reactions in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re2a"><b>Re2</b></a> are satisfactory for our purposes, but in reality the reactions may be more complicated. For example, certain cases of <b>2a</b> are known to proceed <i>via</i> a 6&#x2013;membered transition state as shown. Reaction with esters(<b>2b</b>) gives ketones (or aldehydes) but these cannot be isolated under standard conditions; they react further to form alcohols, as explained in the scheme. The ethers Et<sub>2</sub>O and THF (5&#x2013;membered ring, not strained) solvate and thereby stabilise R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal. By contrast, oxiran (3&#x2013;membered ring, strained) reacts smoothly with R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal (<b>2c</b>), the strain being relieved by ring opening. This is the crucial step in a sequence for adding 2C atoms to a substrate. <b>2d&#x2013;h</b> are methods devised to circumvent the difficulty, already encountered(<b>2c</b>), of <a class="page" id="page_31">page 31, Organometallic compounds</a>producing aldehydes and ketones. In <b>2d</b> the first stage gives an acetal(<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#a10re2"> <b>10Re2</b></a>) which does not react with R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal. The mechanism of this reaction has not been established; that suggested here is speculative. The aldehyde is generated in a second separate stage, i.e. in the absence of any R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal. A different approach is adopted in <b>2e</b>. R<sub>2</sub>Cd and LiCuR<sub>2</sub> are much weaker nucleophiles than R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal; R<sup>1</sup>&#x2013;CO&#x2013;C1, an acid chloride, is more reactive than a ketone towards nucleophiles(<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#a81ge1"><b>8.1Ge1</b></a>). The upshot is that the Cd and Cu reagents do react with acid chlorides but not with ketones. Reaction <b>2f</b> calls for good experimental technique. The key features are that the R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal is, unusually, added slowly <i>to</i> the other reactant, and at low temperature. At &#x2013;70&#x00B0; the difference in reactivity between R<sup>1</sup>&#x2013;CO&#x2013;C1 and R&#x2013;CO&#x2013;R<sup>1</sup> is enhanced (see discussion of <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#a42re1c"><b>4.2Re1c</b></a>), and the reverse addition ensures that the concentration of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal at any moment is low. The divergence between R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal and R&#x2013;Li in <b>1g</b> exemplifies the general higher reactivity of R&#x2013;Li, and R&#x2013;Li is more effective than R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal in <b>1h</b>. (Prefixing the intermediates in <b>1g</b> and <b>1h</b> by 1,1&#x2013; means merely that the groups are attached to the same C.) The instability of these intermediates, which is not readily predicted by organic theory, stems from the decrease of free energy associated with their decomposition. (It does not follow that the reactions must be fast. Rates depend on activation energies, as illustrated in Section 1.5.) Both <b>1g</b> and <b>1h</b> embody the principle of <b>1d</b>, that the aldehyde or ketone is not generated in the presence of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal. Reaction <b>2i</b> provides an excellent preparation of carboxylic acids(<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#a82pr1"><b>8.2Pr1</b></a>).</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;">A limitation of both R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal and R&#x2013;Li is that the halide used in the preparation must not contain, elsewhere in the molecule, groups which react with R&#x2013;M such as CO double bonds, CN double and triple bonds, carboxylic and nitro groups. 1,1&#x2013;,1,2&#x2013;, and 1,3&#x2013;dihalides are also excluded: they undergo elimations with Mg and Li. The use of other R&#x2013;M may circumvent this difficulty. For example Zn organometallics (slightly more reactive than the Cd compounds) do not react with esters, and an ester group may be present in the<i></i> reagent as shown in <b>2j</b>.</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:0em;">Reactions of R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal as a nucleophile are blown off course by even moderate steric hindrance. In <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re3"><b>Re3</b></a> formation of product <b>U</b> requires approach of two C centres. Formation of <b>V</b> and <b>W</b> involving approach of a C centre and a H atom are less sterically demanding (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon112"><b>1.12Ge</b></a>) and are therefore favoured. The R<sub>2</sub>CO in the mixture of products does <i>not</i> arise from incompleteness of the R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal reaction. It is liberated in work&#x2013;up from the Mg enolate shown in the scheme. Thus, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#a3re3"><b>Re3</b></a> illustrates R&#x2013;Mg&#x2013;Hal acting as a nucleophile, a reducing agent, and a base. R&#x2013;Li are effectively smaller, possibly because they are not solvated (in hexane). The formation of the tertiary alcohol in high yield by R&#x2013;Li provides a sharp contrast, and exemplifies the modern trend towards the use of these reagents.</p>
