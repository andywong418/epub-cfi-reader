<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Although most of the material is for study in the first year at university, some of it belongs more appropriately to later years. Topics regarded as beyond the first year are clearly identified in the text by the superscript<sup>#</sup>. These will be covered in the second year, and it is hoped that the book as a whole will be useful for quick reference and revision at all stages. Some pages are shorter than the standard length; these end, irrespective of their length, at natural breaks between topics.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The aim is to cover the characteristic properties of functional groups and the methods for interconverting them in a <i>concise systematic</i> form. Only those properties and reactions regarded as general and important are included. A <i>concise</i> treatment requires a very economical presentation. The form adopted consists of schemes and diagrams, very short sentences and (in many places) a &#x2018;note form&#x2019; of key phrases. Grammatical correctness and style have thus been subordinated to brevity and clarity. The central feature of the attempted <i>systematic</i> treatment is the simple reference system described a little later.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Aliphatic compounds (those not containing rings of atoms, open-chain compounds) are the main subject but cyclic compounds (those containing a ring) are often used to give a clearer illustration of a point. A few aromatic compounds are included to illustrate similar behaviour of aliphatic and aromatic compounds arising from a common structural feature.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The rest of this chapter is concerned with the terms, representations and abbreviations which are to be used, and with some fundamental topics (e.g. electronic effects) involved in studying the functional groups. Although it is not necessary for us to delve too deeply into organic theory a knowledge of the main features is required. Most students will already have some familiarity with the material; helpful accounts, pitched deliberately at an elementary level, are given in another Primer (M. G. Hornby and J. M. Peach, &#x2018;Foundations of Organic Chemistry&#x2019;, abbreviated here to &#x2018;Foundations&#x2019;). In most departments the study of functional groups is preceded or accompanied by a course on theory and mechanism. However, this supplementation cannot be assumed, and to embark on the groups without some knowledge of certain fundamentals would be difficult and unsatisfactory. To fill such a possible gap, brief accounts of the topics germane to group chemistry are given in the following sections. For simplification the valence bond treatment is generally used, but simple molecular orbital theory is introduced at certain points.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.2">
<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The functional groups, and order of discussion</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The groups to be discussed are shown in scheme <b>1.2Ge</b>.</p>
<figure style="margin-left:0em;" id="acon12">
 <img src="../images/figc11.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The organic halides (<b>2</b>) involving the chemistry of C<sup>&#x03B4;+</sup> are discussed first. Next come the organometallic compounds (<b>3</b>) prepared from the halides; these exemplify the contrasting situation, the chemistry of C<sup>&#x03B4;-</sup>. Thus, the behaviour of two important states of C is encountered at an early stage. From these two central groups the chemical cycle, which embraces the others, is developed in chapters following the numerical order of the scheme. [There is no group (<b>1</b>); this number refers to the present chapter.] It is thought that a mechanistic understanding emerges more naturally from the order adopted here than from the traditional sequence starting with hydrocarbons.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Transformations, arrows in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon12">1.2Ge</a>, signify that while some conversions are largely restricted to one direction some pairs, e.g. acids and aldehydes, can be usefully interconverted. Systematic names (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>) are given, in plain (normal) type, for almost all the individual compounds. However, with some compounds the traditional names, given in <i>italic type</i>, are so well established that there is little hope of change. For groups of compounds the name most clearly reflecting their nature is used even if there is a systematic alternative. For example, the main compounds in the first group to be considered are called alkyl halides rather than halogenoalkanes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>You may like to skim through the rest of this chapter to get the gist of the material. Then start in earnest on <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. When you come to a point (such as a term, an abbreviation, an effect etc.) whose meaning is not clear turn back to the appropriate section here and study it in more detail</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Only <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">chapter 1</a> is divided into many (13) sections. Of the other chapters some are divided into sections but most are not divided. The chemistry is regarded as General (abbreviated <b>Ge</b>), Preparations (<b>Pr</b>) and Reactions (<b>Re</b>). Where necessary <b>Ge</b>, <b>Pr</b> and <b>Re</b> are further divided, as shown by the examples in the margin. <b>Ge</b> includes topics which apply generally, e.g. the inductive effect, and also the main tendencies of the individual functional groups (which are summarised at the start of each chapter or section). This simple system allows reference forward to material coming later and backwards to that already covered.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Many reactions are of the form:</p>
<figure style="margin-left:em;">
<img src="../images/figc15.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Terms used:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">&#x0394; = heat; usually 60&#x2013;80&#x00B0; (degrees&#x00B0; are &#x00B0;C throughout)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>sq</b> = small quantity of a reagent; &#x003E; catalytic amount, about 1&#x2013;5% by weight of substrate</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>ts</b> = transition state (see &#x2018;Foundations&#x2019;); used only when no ambiguity possible</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">(For the present don&#x2019;t try to distinguish between the next two; regard them as the <i>slow</i> step of a multi-step sequence)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>rds</b>= rate-determining step; the first step of a multi-step sequence which is slower than the subsequent steps</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><b>rls</b>= rate-limiting step; the later step of a multi-step sequence which is slower than the others</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>Kinetic and Thermodynamic control</i>: Consider a reaction which may give more than one product. If the main product is the one formed <i>faster</i> (of two products) the reaction is said to proceed under kinetic control. If the main product is the <i>more stable</i> (of two products), thermodynamic control. Generally there is no problem, the product formed faster is the more stable. Only <i>reversible</i> reactions can be subject to thermodynamic control.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In the following example the chemistry is difficult and need not be considered here; the crucial point is that a reaction gives different products at different temperatures. Product <b>P</b> (lower activation energy, higher rate constant) is formed irreversibly at 20&#x00B0;. At 80&#x00B0; sufficient thermal energy is available for equilibria to be set up between <b>P</b> and reactants, and between reactants and <b>Q</b>. <b>Q</b> gradually accumulates until the equilibrium position between <b>P</b> and <b>Q</b> governed by &#x0394;G<sub>0</sub> is reached.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Resonance in relation to benzene is discussed in &#x2018;Foundations&#x2019;. Representations of electronic distribution in terms of resonance and of the mesomeric effect (mesomerism) are alternatives; they arrive at the same result, as illustrated in the example later in this section.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1"><i>Inductive effect</i> (<b>I</b>): Sign and order, see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon16"><b>1.6Ge</b></a>. This arises from the difference in electronegativity of an atom or a group relative to H (hydrogen). It affects-electrons in a covalent bond, and is represented by an arrow on the bond. The effect results in a small separation of charges (polarisation). It falls off rapidly with distance (see &#x03B2;C atom).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;"><i>Resonance</i>: This is the concept invoked when the properties of a compound cannot be represented satisfactorily by one conventional formula. The structure is regarded as being somewhere between two or more formulae. For example dimethylformamide (see margin) does not behave as either a normal aldehyde or a normal amine. Formula P is therefore not a satisfactory representation. The structure is somewhere between P and Q, <i>hypothetical</i> extreme forms called <i>canonicals.</i> Canonicals differ in only electron distribution; the atomic centres are in the same places. The compound is termed a resonance hybrid, resonance being depicted by the double-headed arrow shown. The energy of the compound (its enthalpy) is lower than the energy calculated for any of the canonicals. Resonance is <i>not</i> a mechanical oscillation between real forms.</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;"><i>Mesomeric</i> (also termed Resonance or Conjugative) <i>effect</i> (<b>M</b>): Sign and order, see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon16"><b>1.6Ge</b></a>.This involves interactions of electrons, or of<i></i> electrons and unshared electron pairs (also termed nonbonded or lone pairs).It results in changes in covalency of two or more centres, and is represented by curly arrows. This effect does not fall off with distance (see aromatic example). Operation of the <b>M</b> effect with e.g. dimethylformamide suggests a structure between P and Q, the same outcome as reached on the resonance concept.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.7">
<h2 class="h2">1.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Acids and bases</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">There are two types of acids. The first type (Bronsted acids), e.g. MeCO<sub>2</sub>H, give an H<sup>+</sup> to the substrate. The second type (Lewis acids), e.g. BF<sub>3</sub>, coordinate with an unshared electron pair in the substrate. Similarly, Bronsted bases, e.g. NMe<sub>3</sub>, accept an H<sup>+</sup> from the substrate, and Lewis bases, e.g. Et<sub>2</sub>O, provide an unshared pair for coordination to the substrate. We shall be concerned mainly with the Bronsted type, represented <b>H&#x2013;A</b> (acids) and <b>B</b> (bases).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The strengths of H&#x2013;A are expressed on the <i>pK<sub>a</sub></i> scale</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:-.5em;">e.g. MeCO<sub>2</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>O(excess) <b>&#x21C4;</b> MeCO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></p>

<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0em;">p<i>K</i><sub>a </sub>= &#x2212;log<sub>10</sub><i>K</i><sub>a </sub>= 4.8</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0em;">([H<sub>2</sub>O] stays almost constant at 55.6 mol dm<sup>&#x2231;3</sup> and is incorporated into <i>K</i><sub>a</sub><i></i>)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0em;">In order to have a unified scale for H&#x2013;A and B strength, the acid strength of BH<sup>+</sup> rather than the base strength of B is listed. If required, the latter value is easily calculated from the former, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0em;">For <b>MeNH<sub>2</sub></b> acting as a base require p<i>K</i><sub>b</sub>. This is &#x2212;log<sub>10</sub><i>K</i><sub>b</sub> in the equilibrium</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0em;">MeNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O <b>&#x21C4;</b> MeNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+ </sup>+ OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0em;">The literature lists the acid strength of the <b>MeNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup></b>, the <i>conjugate</i> acid of <b>MeNH<sub>2</sub></b> (conjugate means related) in the equilibrium</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0m;">MeNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O <b>&#x21C4;</b> MeNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (MeNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) = 10.6</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0em;">In any aqueous solution [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] = 10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup>mol<sup>2</sup> dm<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> at 289K, and by writing out the expressions in full it can be shown (see &#x2018;Foundations&#x2019;) that</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:em;">p<i>K</i><sub>b</sub>(of<i></i> B) + p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>(of BH<sup>+</sup>) = 14</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1" style="margin-top:0em;">Thus p<i>K</i><sub>b</sub> (MeNH<sub>2</sub>) = 14 &#x2212; 10.6 = 3.4</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">As the acid strength of H&#x2013;A <i>increases K</i><sub>a</sub> increases and p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> <i>decreases</i>. As the base strength of B <i>increases K</i><sub>b</sub> increases and p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (of BH<sup>+</sup>) <i>increases</i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">A cautionary note: two values may be listed for what is, ostensibly, the same compound, e.g. 4.6 and &#x223C;27 (&#x223C; means &#x2018;about&#x2019;) for PhNH<sub>2</sub>. However</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 4.6 refers to PhNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O <b>&#x21C4;</b> PhNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> whereas</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x223C;27 refers to PhNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O <b>&#x21C4;</b> PhNH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The second process is a convenient fiction. PhNH<sub>2</sub> is a base not an acid; formation of PhNH? from PhNH<sub>2</sub> requires a very strong base.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Aid to thinking: p<i>K</i><sub>a<i></i> </sub>of<i></i> H&#x2013;A = pH of a solution in which [H&#x2013;A] = [A<sup>&#x2212;</sup>].</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0em;">Thus for MeCO<sub>2</sub>H [MeCO<sub>2</sub>H] = [MeCO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>] at pH 4.8</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">An electrophile (electron seeking), represented by <b>E<sup>+</sup></b>, has a centre (usually of low electron density) which forms a bond to the substrate using the substrate&#x2019;s electrons. A nucleophile (nucleus seeking), represented by Nu<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, has a pair of electrons (unshared or in a<i><span class="small-cap"></span></i> bond) which form a bond to a centre of low electron density in the substrate; for most organic reactions the centre is a C atom with some degree of positive charge. A radical, represented by <b>U&#x2022;</b>, has an unpaired electron and is usually very reactive.

<p class="indent3-ka1">To follow the stereochemistry of the reactions chiral substrates must be considered. (Chirality is discussed in &#x2018;Foundations&#x2019;.) Thus to illustrate primary substrates Me&#x2013;CHD&#x2013;L (rather than Me&#x2013;CH2&#x2013;L) is used because, by virtue of the D atom, this molecule has an asymmetric C. In the S<sub>N</sub>2 <i>(substition</i>) reaction the C has undergone an &#x2018;umbrella&#x2019; motion. The C&#x2013;Nu orbital is not the original C&#x2013;L orbital. The reaction involves <i>inversion of configuration</i>. In front-side approach Nu<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and L would &#x2018;get in each others way&#x2019;. Rear-side approach involves much less steric hindrance. (<sup>&#x0023;</sup>It is also strongly favoured by a stereoelectronic factor.) For comparison with the following tertiary case keep in mind that a carbocation Me&#x2013;CHD<sup>+</sup> would be very unstable. In the E2 <i>(elimination</i>) reaction removal of the H is concerted with (at the same time as) departure of L<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The chiral tertiary compound exemplifies S<sub>N</sub>1 and E1 reactions. S<sub>N</sub>2 and E2 are impeded by severe steric hindrance to approach of nucleophiles or bases from either side. A different pathway involving ionisation is followed. The carbocation formed is much more stable than that from a primary compound but still very reactive. (<sup>&#x0023;</sup>The first step is reversible but the backwards reaction is so much slower than the second step that it is usually not significant.) The carbocation common to S<sub>N</sub>1 and El is planar; the top and bottom faces are therefore equivalent. S<sub>N</sub>1 leads to <i>racemisation</i>.ln<i></i> E1 removal of the H occurs after the departure of L<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p>
<a class="page" id="page_10" style="width:70%;">page 10, The approach, and background topics</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In general, &#x2018;other things being equal&#x2019;, the most favoured reactions are S<sub>N</sub>2 for primary and E1 for tertiary. However many factors come into play and these tendencies must not be regarded as rules. For example by appropriate choice of reactants and conditions tertiary compounds may be induced to undergo S<sub>N</sub>1 or even S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions (<b><a href="Chapter02.xhtml#a21re3">2.1Re3b,c</a></b>).</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This section is based on S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions in a <i>protic</i> solvent (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.13">Section 1.13</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">The relative rates of series of the reactions give the tendency of an entity to act as L<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (good&#x2026;&#x2026;.poor) and as a nucleophile, Nu<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (strong&#x2026;&#x2026;..weak, termed its nucleophilicity). Several investigations, under different conditions, have given somewhat different sets of results. Although the <i>figures</i> for the relative rates in <b>1.11Ge</b>are not important, the <i>orders</i> of the L<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and nucleophile species are very useful.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The following tempting arguments suggest themselves. As the acid strength of H&#x2013;L increases the stability of L<sup>&#x2212;</sup> increases, so L<sup>&#x2212;</sup> should become a better leaving group. Thus leaving group tendency should parallel acid strength. Similarly, as the basicity of a species (tendency to accept H<sup>+</sup>) increases, its nucleophilicity (tendency to attack) should increase. Thus basicity should parallel nucleophilicity. <i>There are no such general correlations</i>. Several factors militate against the existence of such correlations. The main one is that acid and base strengths refer to <i>equilibria</i> (difference in free energy between ground states) whereas leaving group tendency and nucleophilicity represent <i>rates</i> (difference in free energy between a ground state and a transition state). [<sup>&#x0023;</sup>Full discussion, later course on &#x2018;Linear Free Energy Relationships&#x2019;.]</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">There are some useful correlations for species of similar structures (margin) but even these are not immutable. Fortunately, choosing an L<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or a Nu<sup>&#x2212;</sup> for a particular purpose is facilitated by the wealth of experimental results available in extended versions of <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon111"><b>1.11Ge</b></a>.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Preoccupation with electronic effects should not be allowed to result in neglect of steric effects; these are central to all branches of organic chemistry. A general consideration and some important manifestions are shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon112"><b>1.12Ge</b></a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In general, attack by a nucleophile is sterically more demanding than attack by a base (top part of scheme). The contrast between primary and tertiary alkoxides (middle of scheme) has significance in the preparative work of later chapters. More subtle features are exemplified in the material lower down the scheme.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Unfortunately many overlapping terms are used, and used in different ways! The meanings of <i>dipolar</i> and <i>nonpolar</i> as used here are explained in the following material. (Many compilations adopt a different approach, based on polar and nonpolar denoting solvents having and not having a dipole moment. An example of a dipole moment is in the sketch below.)</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">Three types of solvents are shown; they differ in their propensity for intermolecular bonding. The influence of a solvent on an organic reaction depends mainly on two features: its <i>dielectric constant</i> and its <i>ability to solvate ions</i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The definition of dielectric constant, a number, is not needed here: its significance is as follows. As a solvent&#x2019;s increases the electrostatic attraction between a solute&#x2019;s ions decreases. The stability of the ions therefore increases, and the solute has a greater tendency to ionise. is a macroscopic (&#x2018;bulk&#x2019;) property, not concerned with details of the ions&#x2019; state. Solvents with are termed <i>dipolar</i>, <i>nonpolar</i> (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#acon113"><b>1.13Ge)</b>.</a>In general, dipolar solvents have relatively high dipole moments, nonpolar solvents relatively low ones. (Exceptions, e.g. pyridine, nonpolar, but dipole moment 2.37 debyes.)</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In ability to solvate ions the main consideration is whether the solvent has an which bonds to a negative ion. If so the solvent is termed <i>protic</i>, if not <i>aprotic</i>. The terms do <i>not</i> mean having an H, no matter of what sort, and devoid of an H. The scheme below shows a metal bromide in two solvents. An important feature is that many salts are soluble in dipolar aprotic solvents; their <i>anions</i> are not solvated and are therefore <i>reactive</i>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.11">Section 1.11</a> refers to Hal<sup>&#x2212;</sup> as a nucleophile in protic solvents which bond to Hal<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The extent of solvation is determined by the tendency of the different Hal<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to form H bonds, I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003C; Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003C; Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003C; F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The solvent cage impedes, and must be removed during, reaction as a nucleophile. Thus F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> which is most solvated has the lowest nucleophilicity etc. In aprotic solvents Hal<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is not solvated. Nucleophilicity is determined by the energy (enthalpy) of the C&#x2013;Hal bond being formed. C&#x2013;F is the strongest bond (see<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#acon21a"> <b>2.1Ge2b</b>)</a>,hence F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> has the highest nucleophilicity etc. and the nucleophile order is F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p>
