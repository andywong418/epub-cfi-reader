<h2 class="h2">9.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General considerations</h2>
<p class="noindent">The most important types of rearrangement reactions which find use in stereoselective organic synthesis are 2,3- and 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangements, and the isomerization of alkenes. The sigmatropic rearrangements which we will cover are the Claisen rearrangement and its variants, and the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement. These rearrangements have been used for some time in organic synthesis, unlike the isomerization of alkenes. In this context, the latter has become important relatively recently owing to the discovery of very effective enantioselective catalysts.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Sigmatropic rearrangements</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Claisen rearrangement of allyl vinyl ethers (and related compounds) is probably the most widely used 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement in stereoselective organic synthesis. The transition state for this type of reaction has been discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, and is closely analogous to that of the aldol reaction (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). In many cases, analysis of the transition state as a chair conformation (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>) is appropriate, and will allow stereochemical predictions and correlations to be made.</p>

<p class="indent">Chiral substrates such as <b>9.1</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>) generally undergo rearrangement through a chair transition state in which the large group attached to the stereocentre is equatorial. The double bond substituent (a in <b>9.1</b>) is also equatorial. The absolute stereochemistry and the double bond geometry in the product should then be as shown in Fig 9.1. The original stereocentre has been destroyed, and a new one created, and this type of process is often referred to as &#x2018;chirality transfer&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">This analysis can be generalized as shown in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>. In effect the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the chirality of the original stereocentre and the geometry of both double bonds.</p>
<p class="indent">The Claisen rearrangement and some of the important variants from the point of view of stereoselective organic synthesis are shown in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.3">Fig. 9.3</a>. All involve the generation of an allyl vinyl ether or an analogous system. In all <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Chapter 9 Rearrangements</a>but the Ireland/Claisen rearrangement, formation of the vinyl ether unit in highly geometrical purity is usually difficult to achieve. Accordingly the Claisen, Johnson/Claisen, and Eschenmoser/Claisen rearrangements tend to be used in cases where this is not an issue, i.e. in cases where substituents c and d are both hydrogen (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent">The Claisen rearrangement itself usually requires rather high temperatures, but can still be very effective. In the rearrangement of <b>9.2</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.4">Fig. 9.4</a>) the allyl ether is conformationally mobile, and the product corresponds to rearrangement in the conformation in which A<sup>(1, 3)</sup> strain is minimized (i.e. with the C&#x2013;H<sup>*</sup> bond more or less coplanar with the allylic double bond), and with essentially complete chirality transfer.</p>

<p class="indent">The level of stereochemical control which can be achieved is often very high, and can be put to good use in organic synthesis. If the alcohol <b>9.3</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.5">Fig. 9.5</a>) is resolved, and the alkyne group in each enantiomer is reduced as outlined, the resulting allylic alcohols <b>9.4</b> and <b>9.5</b> will give the same <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 9 Rearrangements</a>enantiomer of the product of Eschenmoser/Claisen rearrangement. In this way, both enantiomers of our starting material have been converted into the same enantiomer of the product. Such a process is referred to as &#x2018;enantioconvergent&#x2019;, and can be used to make resolution a relatively efficient process.</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent">The Ireland/Claisen rearrangement, exemplified by the reactions of ester <b>9.6</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.6">Fig. 9.6</a>), usually involves formation of an enolate (<b>9.7</b> or <b>9.8</b>) which is trapped as the silyl ether (<b>9.9</b> or <b>9.10</b>). This provides the vinyl ether for the rearrangement. The enolate geometry determines the geometry of the vinyl ether, so control in the enolization step should result in control of the stereochemistry of the final product. In practice it is often possible to control enolate geometry simply by choice of enolization conditions. Use of THF alone as solvent usually produces the (<i>Z</i>) enolate, whereas in the presence of the dipolar aprotic solvent HMPA the (<i>E</i>) enolate tends to predominate (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.6">Fig. 9.6</a>). The consequence of this is that either diastereoisomeric product <b>9.11</b> or <b>9.12</b> can be formed simply by choice of enolization conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">It is possible to carry out highly enantioselective Claisen rearrangements of prochiral esters using the chiral boron reagent <b>9.13</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.7">Fig. 9.7</a>). This reagent has also been used in aldol reactions (Chapter 5). The geometry of enolization again depends on the reaction conditions, and the resulting boron <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Chapter 9 Rearrangements</a>enolates undergo rearrangement to give either of the acids <b>9.14</b> or <b>9.15</b> in high enantiomeric excess.</p>

<p class="indent">The other type of sigmatropic rearrangement which we will cover is the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement, as outlined in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.8">Fig. 9.8</a>. Usually, the substrate <b>9.16</b> contains a group X which stabilizes the anion <b>9.17</b>, but this is not necessary if the anion is formed by an alternative method (see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>). The rearrangement is driven by the formation of the relatively stable alkoxide <b>9.18</b>, and completed by protonation in the reaction work up.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 9.8</b> The 2,3-Wittig rearrangement.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">In the absence of an anion stabilizing group X, the required carbanion can be generated from the trialkylstannane by a lithium-tin exchange process, as in the rearrangement of <b>9.19</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>). This reaction also shows that as with 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangements, there can be a high level of chirality transfer in the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 9.9</b> 2,3-Wittig rearrangement in the absence of an anion stabilizing group.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">Usually an anion stabilizing group is present, and stereochemical issues then arise. The stereochemistry of the allyl ether double bond is important, as in the rearrangement of <b>9.20</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>). By analogy with 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangements, with a stereocentre present in the substrate (e.g. <b>9.21</b>) <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 9 Rearrangements</a>chirality transfer can be high. There are similarities to 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangements in the correlation of substrate stereochemistry (and geometry) with product geometry and stereochemistry. In contrast, there is some debate as to the most appropriate transition state model, but one of the most useful models is illustrated for the reactions of <b>9.20</b> and <b>9.21</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">As for the Claisen rearrangement, it is possible to carry out enantioselective 2,3-Wittig rearrangements with an appropriate chiral boron derivative. A version of that used for the Claisen rearrangement has been reported to give high enantiomeric excess in the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement of substrates such as <b>9.22</b> (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>). The proposed transition state involves co-ordination to the central boron to give a tetrahedral boron chelate, and rearrangement so that steric interactions are minimized.</p>

<p class="noindent">Rearrangement of alkenes by a 1,3 shift of an allylic hydrogen has become important as a result of the development and application of efficient enantioselective catalysts. The best substrates are prochiral allylic amines which can rearrange into chiral enamines (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.12">Fig. 9.12</a>). The catalysts which are used are closely related to those used for enantioselective homogeneous hydrogenation, and use either enantiomer of BINAP as the chiral ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanistic studies have revealed that the reaction is probably a concerted suprafacial 1,3-hydrogen shift, via a square planar transition state. As would be expected for such a process, chirality transfer is very high and the geometry of the double bond of the allylic amine will determine the absolute configuration of the enamine for a given enantiomer of BINAP (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#fig9.13">Fig. 9.13</a>).</p>
