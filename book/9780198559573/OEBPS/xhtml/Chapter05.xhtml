<p class="noindent">The aldol reaction (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>) occupies a particularly important position in organic synthesis. It is a very general method for forming a new C&#x2013;C bond, and at the same time two new stereocentres. Moreover, the aldol unit can be found in the structures of numerous natural products, many of which possess valuable and interesting biological activities, making them prime targets for the attentions of synthetic chemists. As a result much attention has been focused on the reaction, with some spectacular results. In this chapter we can only scratch the surface of this fascinating and invaluable synthetic reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Two new stereocenters are created from two prochiral carbon atoms,so there are four possible product diastereoisomers (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). In the simplest case, when neither enolate nor aldehyde are chiral (and there is no chiral catalyst or reagent present), the products are two racemic diastereoisomers. These are usually referred to as the <i>syn</i>-and the <i>anti-aldol</i> products (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). The <i>syn</i>-product has the substituents R<sup>2</sup> and OH on the same face of the molecule, when the &#x2018;main chain&#x2019; is drawn in an extended fashion. The <i>anti</i>-product has these substituents on opposite faces.</p>

<p class="indent">Many aldol reactions take place through a highly ordered transition state, which appears to possess a predictable stereochemistry. This is often called <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Chapter 5 Aldol reactions</a>the Zimmerman&#x2013;Traxler transition state (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>). In this, the counter ion of the enolate, usually a metal, is bonded to the oxygen of the enolate and coordinated to the oxygen of the aldehyde. Following this &#x2018;complexation&#x2019; the bond forming and bond breaking take place.</p>

<p class="indent">The Zimmerman&#x2013;Traxler transition state is analogous to that of the Claisen and Cope rearrangement, which was discussed in some detail <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>). As in these rearrangements, the aldol transition state is six membered, and can usefully be considered to be similar to a cyclohexane. In spite of the fact that it must be very far from being a cyclohexane, this analogy is very useful in understanding, and to some extent predicting, the stereochemical outcome of many aldol reactions.</p>

<p class="noindent">If we regard the Zimmerman&#x2013;Traxler transition state as possessing an overall geometry similar to a cyclohexane (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>), then we can make some predictions about the likely stereochemical outcome of a given reaction.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">In this discussion we will assume that O&#x2013;M (e.g. OLi) in an enolate is always higher priority than R<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">The most stable arrangement is likely to be that in which all the  substituents are equatorial. This is possible if we start from an (<i>E</i>)-enolate. It always possible for the larger R<sup>3</sup> group of the aldehyde to be equatorial, as there are no constraints on the aldehyde other than the C=O group becomes part of the six membered ring. A typical transition state for reaction of an (<i>E</i>)-enolate is illustrated in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. As can be seen, this results in an <i>anti</i>-aldol.</p>
<p class="indent">The same (<i>E</i>)-enolate can also react via a transition state enantiomeric to that shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. This gives the enantiomeric product, which must be formed at the same rate, leading to an equal amount of the enantiomeric <i>anti</i>-aldol (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>) (enolate and aldehyde are achiral, and no other chiral component is involved).</p>
<p class="indent">At first sight it might be thought that the two transition states leading to <b>5.3</b> and <b>5.4</b> are related by a &#x2018;ring flipping&#x2019; of the chair-like transition state. This is not the case. Such a ring flipping exchanges equatorial groups and axial groups. Ring flipping of either transition state would place R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 5 Aldol reactions</a>in axial positions, which clearly is not the case. What has happened is that the reactants have approached and reacted from the opposite face of each. There is no equilibrium between the two, as almost all highly stereoselective aldol reactions are under strict kinetic control.</p>

<b>Fig. 5.4</b> Reaction from the s/face of the aldehyde gives the enantiomeric anti-aldol (see <a href="#fig5.3">Fig.5.3</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">Given the above discussion, it follows that if we change the geometry of the enolate, then the stereochemistry of the aldol should be different. The enolate geometry is fixed under the reaction conditions, so by analogy with the above, the (Z)-enolate should result in substituent R<sup>2</sup> occupying an axial position (assuming the aldehyde substituent R<sup>3</sup> can always be equatorial). Thus, aldol reactions of (Z)-enolates generally give a <i>syn</i>-aldol (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>).</p>

<b>Fig. 5.5</b> Correlation of (Z)-enolates with syn-aldol</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">From the foregoing arguments, it would seem that we simply have to control the enolate geometry and high levels of diastereoselectivity will follow. In practice this is not always the case, the stereoselectivity can depend on many aspects of the reaction, including the nature of the metal ion, the structure of the enolate, and the reaction conditions. Nevertheless, methods have been developed which are reasonably predictable and highly stereoselective.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec5.3">
<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Control of enolate geometry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Some important aspects of enolate formation have been discussed previously in Chapter 4 (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.1">Section 4.1</a>). This is actually a rather complicated subject, and this section can only cover some of the more important trends (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>). If the carbonyl group lies within a ring, then the enolate geometry will be <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Chapter 5 Aldol reactions</a>fixed, provided the ring is not very large. The most common ring sizes (4&#x2013;7) can only easily accommodate (<i>E</i>)-enolates.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center">
<b>Fig. 5.6</b> Diastereoselective alkylation of a monocyclic enolate.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">If the carbonyl group is not part of a ring, then both enolate geometries are possible, and it is possible to favour one or the other by judicious choice of reagent, reaction conditions, and structure of the carbonyl compound.</p>
<p class="indent">Esters tend to give (<i>E</i>)-enolates on deprotonation with LDA, and esters of bulky phenols are particularly useful in aldol reactions. In contrast, bulky amides give (Z)-enolates, and although the lithium enolates of amides are not particularly useful in aldol reactions, other metal (<i>Z</i>)-enolates of amides and related systems can be very effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Enolization of acyclic ketones with bases such as LDA is rather more complicated, and not appropriate for detailed coverage in this book. However, the stereoselective formation of boron enolates of acyclic ketones is usually more straightforward. Stereoselective formation of boron enolates of esters, amides, and related derivatives is also rather predictable. Moreover, the aldol reactions of such enolates often take place with predictable stereoselectivity, as there tends to be a much stronger correlation between enolate geometry and aldol stereochemistry for boron enolates.</p>

<p class="indent">Boron enolates are usually generated by reaction of the carbonyl compound with a dialkylboron reagent possessing a leaving group, and a weak tertiary <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter 5 Aldol reactions</a>amine base. The boron reagent is a Lewis acid and co-ordinates to the carbonyl group, activating the &#x03B1; protons towards removal with a weak base. The geometry of the resulting enolate depends on the nature of the carbonyl compound, the leaving group, and to some extent on the base. A thorough discussion is beyond the scope of this book, but some representative examples are given in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>. In all cases shown, the selectivity is &#x003E; 95:5 for the enolate shown.</p>

<p class="noindent">This is the type of reaction which we used in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.1">Section 5.1</a> to demonstrate some of the stereochemical aspects of aldol reactions. It necessarily leads to racemic products, but is useful nevertheless as high levels of diastereoselectivity can be achieved in the best cases. Both lithium and boron enolates can be used with the appropriate substrate (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Boron enolates generally exhibit high diastereoselectivity, and good correlation of enolate geometry with the aldol stereochemistry (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>). One reason for this is undoubtedly that the maximum co-ordination number of boron is four. This means that once boron enolates such as those shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a> have co-ordinated to the aldehyde (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>), then no more ligands can be accommodated around the boron.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Diastereoselective reactions involving chiral enolates</h2>
<p class="noindent">Both aldehyde and enolate involved in an aldol reaction can be chiral, but we will limit our discussion to aldol reactions involving chiral enolates. In general these are likely to be used as single enantiomers. As usual, we can but scratch the surface of this important topic, but we will cover the most important aspects by considering examples of some of the more important types of reactions.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec5.5.1">
<h3 class="h3">Chiral ketones</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ketones which possess an oxygen substituent &#x03B1; or &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group have been studied most intensively, as the corresponding boron enolates often react with high diastereoselectivity. Ketone <b>5.5</b> and its enantiomer are readily available, and following conversion to the (<i>Z</i>)-enolates, undergo highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a wide range of aldehydes (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The original stereocentre and its associated substituents can be excised by removal of the silyl ether (with HF) and oxidation of the resulting &#x03B1; hydroxy acid (with NaIO<sub>4</sub>) as shown for the conversion of <b>5.6</b> into <b>5.7</b> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>). Effectively, the &#x2018;right hand side&#x2019; of ketone <b>5.5</b> is used as a chiral auxiliary. More &#x2018;normal&#x2019; types of chiral auxiliaries are discussed later.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 5.10</b> Aldol reactions involving chiral ketones with a single stereocentre</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">If the ketone has an oxygen substituent &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group, then the ketone itself could have been derived from an asymmetric aldol reaction. The ability to carry out a subsequent aldol reaction would then amount to an iterative process, in which the stereochemistry of the previous aldol reaction controls that of the next aldol reaction. Stereochemical control is possible in reactions involving such ketones, and an example is provided in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In both examples provided above, the enolate geometry (Z) results in a <i>syn</i>-aldol product. However, as there is a pre-existing stereocentre in the ketone, the two possible <i>syn</i>-aldol products are diastereoisomers.

<h3 class="h3">Chiral auxiliaries</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are many chiral auxiliaries available for controlling the stereochemistry of aldol reactions, two of which are shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>. Rather than attempt a comprehensive discussion of all chiral auxiliaries which have been used for the aldol reaction, we will restrict ourselves mainly to the oxazolidinones.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 5.13</b> Chiral auxiliaries for aldol reactions</figcaption>

<p class="indent">We have encountered such oxazolidinones before, as they are particularly important chiral auxiliaries for enolate &#x03B1;-substitution (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>). They are also very effective chiral auxiliaries for the aldol reaction. In particular, they are easily acylated and the acylated products form boron enolates which possess exclusively the (<i>Z</i>) geometry. These enolates react with high diastereoselectivity to give the corresponding <i>syn</i>-aldol products (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>). The diastereoselectivity is usually very high, and predictable in the sense shown. The auxiliary can be removed with a variety of reagents (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>). As shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>, the either enantiomeric product can be prepared depending on which oxazolidinone is used.</p>

<p class="indent">The facial selectivity of the enolate implicit in the reactions shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.14">Fig. 5.14</a> is consistent with a transition state model not dissimilar to that encountered previously in the reactions of chiral ketones (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>). Although the enolates themselves involve co-ordination of the boron, this must be broken for the boron to co-ordinate to the aldehyde, a requirement in <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Chapter 5 Aldol reactions</a>these aldol reactions. The chiral auxiliary is then free to adjust its position so that electronic and steric repulsions are minimized. These considerations form the basis for the transition state model illustrated in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>.</p>
