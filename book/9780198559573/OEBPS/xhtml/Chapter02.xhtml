<h3 class="h3">General considerations</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> we considered some important aspects and consequences of the stereochemistry of organic compounds. This included the stereochemistry of reactants, products, catalysts, and even transition states. We viewed these, even transition states, as being &#x2018;static&#x2019;. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that we viewed these as not changing with time, at least on the time scale which we were representing them for our purposes. A reaction is completely different. The system must necessarily change with time, so what can we say about the stereochemistry of a reaction? Obviously we can consider the stereochemistry of the reactants, products, catalysts, transition states, and how these influence each other. These are important, and we will deal with them later. Here we are concerned with the reactions themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">It might seem on the face of it that a reaction cannot &#x2018;have&#x2019; a stereochemistry, so first of all we must be clear what we mean. A reaction involves making and breaking of bonds, and this comes about by the interaction of one species with another, such as addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group. Bond formation occurs by the interaction of electrons and orbitals of both components. When two such components interact, in principle all the electrons and orbitals in each will interact to some extent, and at first sight it might be thought to be too complicated to analyse. Fortunately we can understand many important types of reactions using a very simple model, based on just one orbital from each component. Before discussing this model, we will consider the important types of orbitals involved. You might already be well acquainted with the following much simplified analysis, in which case you could proceed to <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>. If it is all new to you, then you are strongly advised to consult a text which contains a much more detailed treatment (see further reading, especially Primer 26).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals</h3>
<p class="noindent">The two most important types of orbitals which we need to analyse for reactions in organic chemistry are &#x03C3; bonds, <i>&#x03C0;</i> bonds, and their respective antibonding orbitals. We will consider briefly C&#x2013;C &#x03C3; bonding and antibonding orbitals (C&#x2013;C &#x03C3; orbitals and C&#x2013;C &#x03C3;* orbitals).</p>
<p class="indent">These orbitals can be understood by using an imaginary process in which we combine two carbon radicals (both &#x2018;sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized&#x2019;). In each radical, we imagine the unpaired electron to occupy an sp<sup>3</sup> orbital. The &#x03C3; bond is formed by bringing these two radicals together (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>).</p>

</aside>
<a id="page_14" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 14, Chapter 2 Stereochemistry of reactions</a>
<p class="indent">There are two possible ways in which these orbitals overlap. If they overlap with the same phase (&#x2018;in phase combination&#x2019;) then a bonding orbital is formed, the C&#x2013;C &#x03C3; orbital. The alternative &#x2018;out of phase combination&#x2019; has a nodal plane between the C atoms, and is the antibonding or C&#x2013;C &#x03C3;* orbital. Simple representations of these orbitals are shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> (the bonding electrons have been omitted).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In the preceding discussion we considered an &#x2018;end-on&#x2019; overlap of orbitals, which results in &#x03C3; and &#x03C3;* orbitals. A similar diagram can be constructed for the &#x2018;side-on&#x2019; overlap of p orbitals. This is illustrated in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, in which we imagine bringing two such p orbitals together to form two new molecular <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals, the bonding <i>&#x03C0;</i> and antibonding <i>&#x03C0;*</i> orbitals. This representation would correspond to a simple, symmetrical, alkene. Double bonds can, of course, form extended conjugated <i>&#x03C0;</i> systems when the double bonds are adjacent. The ideas which have been used so far can also be applied to such <i>&#x03C0;</i> systems.</p>

<p class="indent">Dienes in which the double bonds are conjugated have a total of four p orbitals which interact, and this results in four <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals, two bonding (&#x03C0;) and two antibonding (&#x03C0;*) orbitals (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). Each of the p orbitals contained one electron, so we have four electrons to place in the <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals. The lowest energy corresponds to pairs of electrons in the two bonding orbitals, and none in the antibonding orbitals.</p>

<p class="indent">By analogy, for a conjugated triene, in which six p orbitals interact, we might expect six <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals, three bonding and three antibonding. This is the case, and the six electrons occupy the three bonding <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals in pairs, and the antibonding orbitals are unfilled. The most important <i>&#x03C0;</i> orbitals from the point of view of reactivity are the highest bonding and the lowest antibonding orbitals. The <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals of alkenes, including those of conjugated systems, are of particular importance in understanding many cycloaddition reactions (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>) and sigmatropic rearrangements (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). These types of reactions are often highly stereoselective (or stereospecific) and are of great value in organic syntheses.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Orbital interactions and reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">section 2.1</a> we used a simple pictorial model to investigate bonding and antibonding orbitals of &#x03C3; and <i>&#x03C0;</i> bonds. Reactions involve (usually) the interaction between two neutral molecular species, or a neutral molecular species and a cation or anion. We can use a similar pictorial model to understand the stereochemical consequences of the electronic aspects of these types of reactions, often referred to as stereoelectronic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">When two molecules approach each other, the molecular orbitals interact. We need to identify those interactions which might be crucial in determining the outcome of the reaction. Filled orbitals of one molecule interacting with tilled orbitals in another leads to an increase in energy.</p>
<p class="indent">The interaction of two empty orbitals is usually irrelevant since they contain no electrons and so cannot affect the overall energy. The key orbitals will be the HOMO of one molecule (a filled orbital) and the LUMO of the other (an empty orbital).</p>

<p class="indent">Let us consider a hypothetical reaction between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. What we need are orbital interactions between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> which result in two new orbitals populated by only two electrons.

<p class="indent">We now have a very simple method for identification of the orbital interactions which are likely to be important in understanding stereoelectronic effects in reactions. This process can be summarized thus. Identify the LUMO and HOMO of each reactant and establish which pair of HOMO/LUMO interactions result in greatest stabilization (i.e. which are closest in energy). This approach to the analysis of reactivity is often referred to as the frontier molecular orbital or FMO approach.</p>

<h3 class="h3">S<sub>N</sub>2 displacements</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nucleophilic substitutions which follow the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism involve reaction of a nucleophilic species with a tetrahedral carbon atom carrying a leaving group. As we saw in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> the reaction takes place strictly with inversion of the stereochemistry of the carbon atom which is undergoing the reaction. It is stereospecific, and it might be thought that we have now said all that can be said about the reaction. However, we can ask a number of further interesting questions. For example, which orbitals are involved, what are their shapes, how is maximum overlap achieved, and are there any stereoelectronic requirements?</p>
<p class="indent">Take a typical S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>), that of a secondary mesylate <b>2.1</b> with azide. The new bond is formed by donation of an electron pair from the nucleophile (N<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>). In this case this is the filled orbital which we must consider. The nucleophile corresponds to reactant <b>A</b> in our earlier general analysis (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.2">Section 2.2</a>). Mesylate <b>2.1</b> must correspond to reagent <b>B</b>, but which empty orbital is involved? It is the antibonding &#x03C3; orbital (&#x03C3;*) of the bond which is breaking. Having identified the HOMO and LUMO which are interacting, we can now construct a simple FMO picture corresponding to an early stage of the bond forming process (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The best overlap will be achieved when the nucleophile and the two atoms comprising the a bond undergoing cleavage are colinear. The bond which is forming and that which is breaking will be at an angle of 180&#x00B0;. This is illustrated in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>, and can be generalized to include all S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Additions to simple alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Simple alkenes do not react readily with most nucleophiles, they are in fact slightly nucleophilic themselves, and as such their (ionic) reactions are dominated by electrophilic additions. The orbitals which we need to consider are again easy to determine. The alkene acts as the nucleophile so we need the HOMO of the alkene, and consequently the LUMO of the electrophile. Maximum overlap will occur when the electrophile approaches the alkene as shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig2.7">
<img src="../images/fig_2.7.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.7</b> Stereoelectronic requirements for electrophilic addition to and alkene</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">From this simple analysis, we expect that when an electrophilic species attacks a double bond, both new bonds will be formed from the same face of the alkene. Overall the reaction should be a <i>cis</i> addition. A typical example <a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Chapter 2 Stereochemistry of reactions</a>of such a reaction is the reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid to produce an epoxide, such as that shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. In this reaction, the epoxidation of <i>cis</i>-2-butene <b>2.2</b>, the stereochemistry of the alkene is reflected in the product epoxide <b>2.3</b>. The electrophile is effectively the oxygen of the peroxyacid (<b>2.4</b>) which is labelled O*, as this is the one which is transferred.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The electrophile LUMO can interact strongly with both p orbitals of the alkene HOMO.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.8</b> Epoxidation of an alkene</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">Other electrophilic reactions are slightly more complicated as they involve the addition of two atoms to the alkene. A typical example is the addition of bromine to an alkene. In this case the reaction is a two step process. The bromine molecule is the electrophile, and reacts initially to produce a cyclic bromonium ion, analogous to the epoxide produced by epoxidation of 2.2 (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>). This bromonium ion then reacts with the bromide ion which resulted from the initial electrophilic attack. This second reaction can be viewed as an S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement, with the Br<sup>+</sup> of the bromonium ion acting as the leaving group. Following the stereoelectronic requirement for S<sub>N</sub>2 displacements, this should take place so that the forming and breaking bonds are colinear, we can predict the overall stereochemical outcome of the addition of bromine to an alkene as for <i>cis</i>-2-butene <b>2.2</b> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig2.9">
<img src="../images/fig_2.9.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.9</b> Stereochemistry of addition of bromine to an alkene</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Inspection of the product <b>2.5</b> reveals that the stereochemistry of the alkene is &#x2018;preserved&#x2019; in the product and the bromine has added in a <i>trans</i> manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Some electrophilic additions (of two atoms) to alkenes take place with overall <i>cis</i> stereochemistry. In the case of hydroboration, one of the most widely used examples of this type, the first step in the reaction is formation of a <i>&#x03C0;</i> complex, which would be analogous to the bromonium ion in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>. This leads to a four-centre transition state as illustrated in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>, and ultimately to an overall <i>cis</i> addition.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.3.3">
<h3 class="h3">Additions to the carbonyl group</h3>
<p class="noindent">The carbon atom of a carbonyl group is electrophilic, and addition of a nucleophile is a particularly important reaction is organic synthesis. By <a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chapter 2 Stereochemistry of reactions</a>analogy with our simple FMO approach used in the foregoing sections we need to examine the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the carbonyl group. An orbital picture for addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl is shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>. It can be seen that the best angle of attack of the nucleophile is not ninety degrees, as might be imagined. Attack at ninety degrees would indeed result in maximum overlap between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the p orbital centred on the carbon atom of the carbonyl group. However there will be significant antibonding (out-of-phase) overlap with the other p orbital which makes up the LUMO (&#x03C0;*) of the carbonyl group. The best compromise between these two opposing effects is achieved if the nucleophile attacks at an angle of approximately 109.5&#x00B0;. This is maintained between the forming bond and the breaking bond throughout the reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The argument used to account for the approach direction of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group can be extended to those reactions which involve nucleophilic addition to C=C bonds. This reaction takes place when the C=C bond is electron deficient, usually when conjugated to a carbonyl group or other strongly electron withdrawing group. This will be discussed later (Chapter 6). Almost all the reactions dealt with so far have been ionic. Concerted processes, in which bonds are made and broken more or less simultaneously, are also of great value in stereoselective organic synthesis, and we will now see how our simple FMO picture can account for some of <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Chapter 2 Stereochemistry of reactions</a>the important aspects of Diels-Alder cycloadditions and Claisen/Cope rearrangements.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.3.4">
<h3 class="h3">Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloadditions</h3>
<p class="noindent">This reaction is one of the most powerful reactions in organic synthesis. It involves reaction of a diene and an alkene (known as the dienophile) to form a six membered ring. In the reaction four sp<sup>2</sup> centres, two each from the diene and dienophile, become tetrahedral (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig2.12">

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.12</b> Schematic Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloaddition</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">This means that there is the potential for the creation of four new stereocentres in the product. This reaction will be discussed in more detail in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, and here we will be concerned with illustrating the important aspects of the reaction and the orbitals involved.</p>
<p class="indent">The reaction clearly involves only <i>&#x03C0;</i> electrons, and is known to be a thermal, concerted process. To apply our simple FMO analysis, we need to decide which HOMO-LUMO pair to invoke. Normal Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloadditions involve electron deficient (and therefore electrophilic) dienophiles, so we will take the LUMO of the dienophile. We have of diene of dienophile encountered the HOMO of the diene earlier (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). The HOMO and LUMO which are involved are illustrated in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a> (the diene is drawn in the conformation which it must adopt for reaction).</p>

<p class="noindent">These two reactions are closely related, and also related to the Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloaddition. Like the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, these rearrangements are essentially concerted, thermal reactions which involve six electrons and a six-membered transition state (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">To apply our simple FMO picture to this problem, we need to adopt a somewhat different approach, as there is only one reactant. Inspection of the transition state (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>) shows that atoms 1, 2, and 3 remain attached to each other, as do atoms 4, 5, and 6. For our simple FMO approach, we can imagine these units each to be &#x2018;reactants&#x2019;. Furthermore we will imagine that one unit (atoms 1, 2, and 3) to be an anion, and the other to be a cation. This is <i>not</i> the mechanism, just an artificial device so that we can apply our simple model to understand the stereochemistry of the reaction. The reaction itself is concerted and not ionic.</p>
<p class="indent">We are taking the unit containing atoms 1, 2, and 3 to be an anion, so we would expect to use its HOMO, and therefore to use the LUMO of the other unit (atoms 4, 5, and 6). Both these units are allyl systems, and the <i>&#x03C0;</i> molecular orbitals for such systems are illustrated in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.16">Fig. 2.16</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The orbitals which we need are the HOMO of the allyl anion and the LUMO of the allyl cation. If we now use them to &#x2018;build&#x0027; an orbital picture corresponding to the transition state (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>), then we arrive at a transition state similar to 2.9 (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.17">Fig. 2.17</a>). A representation of this transition state with only the six-membered ring and the forming and breaking bonds (dashed lines) 2.10 indicates that the stereochemistry of this transition state in similar to that of a cyclohexane molecule in the chair conformation. The conventional representation of this is 2.11.</p>

<p class="indent">This is an important type of transition state (which is why we have spent some time on it!) which we will encounter when discussing additions to carbonyl compounds and aldol reactions (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">5</a> respectively), as well as Claisen rearrangements (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Detailed discussion of the stereochemical implications of this type of transition state will be delayed until the appropriate chapter, but we will consider here some aspects which are common to the various reaction types which involve such &#x2018;chair&#x0027; transition states. The atoms which started out as sp<sup>3</sup> centres, and those which are becoming sp<sup>3</sup> centres are treated as if they are tetrahedral. In our general structure this would correspond to atoms 1,3,4, and 6. The transition state is imagined to be like cyclohexane which means that each of these atoms could carry substituents which might be axial or equatorial. This analogy between cyclohexane 2.12 and the transition state 2.13 for Cope rearrangement of 1,5-hexadiene 2.14 is shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Further discussion will be deferred to the appropriate sections, but an <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Chapter no Stereochemistry of reactions</a> example of the power of this type of reaction is presented in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>. This involves the Claisen rearrangement of compound 2.15, as a single enantiomer. The group R is very bulky, and the lowest energy for the transition state will be when this group at C-4 is equatorial. The groups at C- 1 and C-6 can then also be equatorial in conformation 2.16. The product would then be expected to correspond to 2.17, which is found to be the case.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Eliminations to form C=C bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">All the reactions which we have covered so far have involved either the conversion of one stereocentre into another (e.g. S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions), or the creation of new stereocentres in the product. Although they will not be covered in much detail in this text, the formation of alkenes with a particular geometry often involves the conversion of tetrahedral centres into trigonal (sp<sup>2</sup>) carbon atoms. This process is typified by the elimination of H&#x2013;X from adjacent sp<sup>3</sup> centres in the presence of base (X = good leaving group).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two extreme mechanisms which are observed for this type of elimination. One involves two discrete steps (Elcb). The first step, which is not rate determining, is the removal of the proton to give an intermediate carbanion (still sp<sup>3</sup>). This is stable enough to allow conformational equilibria to be established. In the case of carbanion formed from <b>2.18</b> on treatment with base, there are three staggered conformations <b>2.19</b>, <b>2.20</b>, and <b>2.21</b>.</p>

<img src="../images/fig_2.20.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 2.20</b> Staggered conformations for an Elcb elimination</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we now consider the elimination to be similar to an &#x2018;internal&#x2019; S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement, the sp<sup>3</sup> &#x2018;anion&#x2019; becomes the nucleophile and the group X the leaving group. The orbitals we need to examine then become the HOMO of the &#x2018;anion&#x2019; (its a orbital) and the LUMO of the C&#x2013;X bond (its &#x03C3;* orbital). Maximum overlap will be achieved when these two orbitals are <i>syn</i> and coplanar (for obvious geometric reasons they can never become colinear as in a &#x2018;proper&#x2019; S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement). This places the C&#x2013;X bond antiperiplanar to the &#x2018;anion&#x2019; (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.21">Fig. 2.21</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For the anion from <b>2.18</b> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>) only one of the three staggered conformations satisfies this stereoelectronic requirement, conformation <b>2.19</b>. <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chapter no Stereochemistry of reactions</a> This leads to the expectation that the geometric isomer of the alkene produced should be <b>2.22</b>, which is in fact the experimental observation (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.22">Fig. 2.22</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The other extreme for this type of elimination involves a concerted removal of the proton and loss of the leaving group (E2). The C&#x2013;H and C&#x2013;X bonds are broken more or less simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">By analogy with the preceding discussion, the HOMO corresponds to the a orbital of the C&#x2013;H bond, and the LUMO to the &#x03C3;* orbital of the C&#x2013;X bond. The preferred conformation again has the C&#x2013;H and C&#x2013;X bonds antiperiplanar resulting in a <i>trans</i> elimination <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a>). As can be seen from <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.23">Fig. 2.23</a>, if we label the substituents on the two carbon atoms a, b, c, and d, then the alkene produced must have the geometry shown.</p>

<p class="indent">In this chapter, we have seen how we can use simple ideas relating to the orbitals which are involved in a wide range of reactions to predict or account for the stereochemical outcome of the reactions. This is a very important idea, which is why we have spent a considerable amount of time on the topic. In the following chapters we will be using these ideas, where appropriate, as an aid to understanding the stereochemistry of some of the most important types of reactions which are encountered in organic chemistry.</p>
