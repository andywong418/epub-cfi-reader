<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Why worry about stereochemistry?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Many properties of organic compounds are closely related to their precise three-dimensional structure. At a very basic level, an organic molecule can be viewed as an array of connected atoms, held together by bonding electrons, which presents to the &#x2018;outside world&#x2019; a surface of varying electron density. In this simplistic picture, the organic molecule could be thought to interact with the &#x2018;outside world&#x2019; by interaction of this surface with its surroundings or with other molecules. Inevitably, this surface extends into three dimensions, and this simple fact, that the molecules of an organic compound possess a defined three-dimensional structure, has profound consequences. These might include the rate of its reactions, its physical properties, and its biological properties such as taste, smell, and efficacy as a pharmaceutical. Given the importance of the three dimensional structure of organic compounds, and that all organic compounds arise as a result of a previous reaction or reaction sequence, it is not surprising that an area of chemistry which encompasses organic reactions and stereochemistry is central to organic chemistry. It is this area which is the subject of this introduction to stereoselectivity in organic synthesis.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>About this book</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is intended to provide an introduction to the area of stereoselective organic reactions, and to highlight their usefulness in organic synthesis where appropriate. In terms of stereochemistry, we will start with the basics, and also address the inevitable jargon which is associated with the topic. This jargon will be kept to a minimum. As for the reactions which are covered, we will look at the basic processes which are used to construct organic compounds. Of course, there is a dauntingly wide array of such reactions, but we will concentrate on commonly encountered fundamental types of reactions. Particular emphasis will be placed on carbonyl additions, enolate functionalization, aldol reactions, additions to C&#x2013;C double bonds, reduction, oxidation, rearrangements, and some enzyme catalysed reactions. Before considering these individual reaction types, an overview of the various approaches to stereoselective organic synthesis will be presented, and the relationships between them explored.</p>
<p class="indent">The principles which underlie stereoselective and stereospecific organic reactions, orbitals and their interactions, transition state structures, and mechanistic considerations will be treated together. Subsequently these principles will be applied when appropriate to the individual types of reaction.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">For most of the time, we will be concerned with reactions which involve the formation of tetrahedral, or sp<sup>3</sup>, carbon atoms within a molecular framework. Such reactions are widespread. The addition of a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde <b>1.1</b> is just such a reaction. When the nucleophilic group is different to the substituent attached to the carbonyl carbon, then two products <b>1.2</b> and <b>1.3</b> are formed which are enantiomers (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>). The products are chiral.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The term &#x2018;chiral&#x2019; is derived from the Greek for hand <i>&#x2019;cheir&#x2018;</i>, and was first used in 1884.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The carbon atom which is &#x2018;responsible&#x2019; for the chirality is often referred to as a chiral centre or stereocentre. Enantiomers have opposite absolute configurations, and these are given the descriptors <i>R</i> and <i>S</i>. The assignment of a stereocentre as either <i>R</i> or <i>S</i> follows from the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) convention. Details of this convention can be found in any major undergraduate text on organic chemistry.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Absolute configuration; the spatial arrangement of atoms in a chiral molecule, described as either <i>R</i> or <i>S</i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the nucleophilic addition of <b>1.1</b> which produces <b>1.2</b> and <b>1.3</b> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>) the enantiomers are formed in equal quantities, giving a racemic mixture. Enantiomer <b>1.2</b> would arise by addition from above the plane of the drawing, and <b>1.3</b> by addition from below. Stated another way, the two enantiomers arise by addition from the two faces of the carbonyl group. In order to avoid confusion as to which face is which (&#x2018;upper&#x2019; and &#x2018;lower&#x2019; face will not do, as this depends on how the structure is drawn). The faces can be assigned a descriptor using a procedure similar to that which is used to assign absolute configurations <i>(R</i> and <i>S</i>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The Latin words for right (<i>rectus</i>) and left (<i>sinistei</i>) give us the descriptors <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> respectively.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The carbonyl group is drawn in the plane of the paper, and the three groups attached are assigned a priority a, b, and c, using the same rules as for the assignment of absolute configuration. If the sequence a, b, c is anticlockwise it is the <i>si</i> face, and if it is clockwise it is the <i>re</i> face.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/2_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When the nucleophile attacks from the <i>si</i> face, enantiomer <b>1.2</b> is formed, whereas enantiomer <b>1.3</b> is formed when reaction takes place from the <i>re</i> face. These reactions take place at identical rates, because the transition states are equal in energy by virtue of them being enantiomers (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The mirror plane relationship between the products (<b>1.2</b> and <b>1.3</b>) is retained in the transition states, and in the reaction profiles. This means that the transition state energies must be equal by symmetry, and the reactions which produce <b>1.2</b> and <b>1.3</b> must be exactly equal in rate. It follows that an equal amount of <b>1.2</b> and <b>1.3</b>, a racemate, must be obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">When addition to opposite faces of a planar group produces enantiomers in this way, the faces are said to be enantiotopic. Atoms or groups within a molecule can also be enantiotopic. Consider the diester <b>1.4</b> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>). The two ester groups are enantiotopic because reaction at one (CO<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>X</sub>) gives enantiomer <b>1.5</b> whereas reaction at the other (Y) gives enantiomer <b>1.6</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">Enantiotopic ligands can be assigned descriptors, <i>pro-R</i> and <i>pro-S</i>, using a modification of the normal sequence rules. The groups attached to the stereocentre are assigned priorities as usual. By definition, two of these will be identical (the two ester groups in <b>1.4</b>). To assign the descriptor to one of these two groups, the group in question is arbitrarily assigned the higher priority. If this results in the <i>R</i> configuration, the group is said to be <i>pro-R</i>, and <i>pro-S</i> if it results in the <i>S</i> configuration. This process is outlined in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> for diester <b>1.4</b>.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">A carbon which possesses enantiotopic faces or enantiotopic groups is said to be prochiral.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">So far the discussion has been restricted to compounds which are prochiral, and reactions which give products containing only one stereocentre. When we consider reactions which involve a starting material which contains a <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Introduction</a> stereocentre (often referred to as a pre-existing stereocentre), and which result in formation of a new stereocentre, the situation is fundamentally different. A typical example of this type of reaction is shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">A single (S) enantiomer of ketone <b>1.7</b> reacts with phenylmagnesium iodide. As expected, reaction from the <i>re</i> and <i>si</i> faces of the carbonyl group gives products which are stereoisomeric. Unlike the previous reaction (<a href="#fig1.1">Figs. 1.1</a> and <a href="#fig1.3">1.3</a>) the two products are not enantiomers, as the original stereocentre is unchanged in the reaction and must still be <i>S</i>. In the enantiomer of <b>1.8</b> both stereocentres would possess the <i>R</i> configuration. The products <b>1.8</b> and <b>1.9</b> are diastereoisomers.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">See <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">Section 1.5</a> for a discussion of stereoselective and stereospecific reactions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Any reaction which could produce two (or more) possible stereoisomeric products is capable of producing one in excess. The most straightforward sort of reaction of this type is one in which a new stereocentre is created in a molecule which already contains (at least) one stereocentre. We have already met such a reaction in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>. This reaction will be used to illustrate some of the important aspects of this type of reaction.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0
em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Do not confuse the terms stereoselective and stereospecific. They have quite different meanings. See <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">Section 1.5</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The relative amounts of the diastereoisomeric products <b>1.8</b> and <b>1.9</b> will be determined by the difference in energy between the two transition states. As the products are diastereoisomeric, the transition states which lead to each of the products are themselves diastereoisomeric. This means that there is no reason for them to be of equal energy. In general, if transition states are diastereoisomeric for any reason then they can be of different energies, and the <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 1 Introduction</a> stereoisomeric products would then be formed in different amounts. This is illustrated by <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>. In this reaction of <b>1.7</b> addition from the <i>si</i> face has a lower transition state energy and the major product is <b>1.9.</b> Assuming that the reaction is effectively irreversible then the ratio of the two products is related directly to this difference in transition state energies. In the reaction shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a> this leads to <b>1.9</b> and <b>1.8</b> being formed in a ratio of 91.5:8.5. Reactions such as this, in which two or more diastereoisomeric products are possible, and in which the products are formed in unequal amounts, are described as stereoselective or diastereoselective. The extent of the diastereoselectivity of a reaction is sometimes described simply as the ratio of the products (as above), but more usually as the diastereoisomeric excess (abbreviated to d.e.), which is simply the excess of one diastereoisomeric product over the other.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Generalizing from the preceding discussion, whenever transition states are diastereoisomeric, we can expect to observe the selective formation of one stereoisomer assuming the reaction is irreversible (kinetic control). Whenever a stereocentre is being formed in a reaction, and another stereocentre is present in the transition state, the transition states are diastereoisomeric.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">This &#x2018;other&#x2019; stereocentre could be present in the substrate (as <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>), a reagent, ora catalyst.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the case of the reaction of <b>1.7</b> discussed above, with a pre-existing stereocentre, the stereoselectivity is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;internal stereocontror or &#x2018;simple diastereoselectivity&#x2019;. In effect the diastereoselectivity arises because the substrate (starting material) is chiral. This is not the only way in which transition states can be rendered diastereoisomeric. In addition to the substrate, there might be a reagent, catalyst, or solvent molecules involved in the transition state. Should any of these be chiral, then stereoselective reactions are possible. We will now consider the consequences of this in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.4">Section 1.4</a>.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">By &#x2018;normal&#x2019; we mean that there is no chirality associated with the transition state.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>, a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; reaction which gives enantiomeric products is required to produce each in equal amounts because of the enantiomeric relationship between the two transition states. If a component of the transition state other than the substrate is chiral, and present as a single enantiomer itself, then the enantiomeric products need no longer be formed in equal amounts. One of the enantiomers should be formed in excess. This is known as asymmetric synthesis, and the reaction is said to be enantioselective. There are several general methods for achieving asymmetric synthesis, and we will consider the principles behind them in this section.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec1.4.1">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chiral reagents</b></h3>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Consider the reaction of ketone <b>1.10</b> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>) with the chiral borane <b>1.11</b>. The transition states for the formation of the enantiomers of <b>1.12</b> are diastereoisomeric, and the reaction now produces the enantiomers in unequal quantities. In this case, the <i>R</i> enantiomer predominates. The extent of the selectivity is expressed as the enantiomeric excess (e.e.), and is the percentage of the major enantiomer minus that of the minor (<i>R</i>(%) &#x2013; <i>S</i>(%)).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">For reaction of <b>1.10</b> with <b>1.11</b> the e.e. is &#x003E;99 per cent.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec1.4.2">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chiral catalysts</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A catalyst, by definition, accelerates a reaction. This means that it must be involved in the transition state. It follows that if a particular catalyst can be made chiral, and a single enantiomer is used, then it should allow enantioselective reactions. A schematic representation of such a catalytic process is presented in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>. A catalyst&#x2013;substrate complex is formed initially. The reaction in which the stereocentre is created then takes place, under the influence of the chiral catalyst. This results in a catalyst&#x2013;product complex, which then dissociates to product and catalyst. The catalyst is then free to undergo another cycle.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">A single enantiomer of the catalyst is not always required. In some cases a catalyst of relatively low e.e. can be almost as effective as one of 100 per cent e.e. In other cases, a catalyst of tow e.e. will simply give a product of correspondingly low e.e.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The transition state for the reaction, somewhere between the catalyst&#x2013; <a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>substrate and the catalyst-product complex, must involve the single enantiomer of the catalyst and the &#x2018;developing&#x2019; product stereocentre. By analogy with the discussion above concerning enantioselective reactions of chiral reagents, this should result in one possible product enantiomer forming in excess. This process is known as asymmetric or enantioselective catalysis.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 1.10</b> Asymmetric catalysis of nucleophilic addition to a C=0 group</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A typical example of such asymmetric catalysis, which again involves addition to an aldehyde is shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>. Dialkylzinc reagents react very slowly with aldehydes, but catalytic amounts of 1,2-aminoalcohols will accelerate addition to the carbonyl. If this 1,2-aminoalcohol is chiral and used as a single enantiomer (<b>1.13</b>) then the reaction is enantioselective.</p>
<p class="indent">As can be seen from the reaction shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>, asymmetric catalysis can be an extraordinarily effective approach to enantioselective synthesis. Only 2 per cent of the chiral catalyst is needed to produce the alcohol <b>1.14</b> with an e.e. of 99 per cent. Moreover, as the catalyst is unchanged after reaction is complete, it could even be recovered and used again. However, there are relatively few types of reactions which are susceptible to such highly enantioselective catalysis.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative approach, which takes advantage of diastereoselective reactions (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.3">Section 1.3</a>) and the sequence of events which is involved in asymmetric catalysis (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>). This approach to asymmetric synthesis, the use of chiral auxiliaries, is outlined below.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec1.4.3">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chiral auxiliaries</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A chiral auxiliary is a compound which is attached to a prochiral starting material, thereby causing groups or faces which were enantiotopic to become diastereotopic (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>). A general representation of the overall process is provided in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>.</p>

<img src="../images/fig_1.11.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 1.11</b> Schematic representation of use of achiral auxiliary</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">While the overall scheme for using chiral auxiliaries resembles that for asymmetric catalysis (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>), there are some important differences. The <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 1 Introduction</a> catalysis process is dynamic, with the catalyst&#x2013;substrate and catalyst&#x2013;product complexes being intermediates in the reaction. When a chiral auxiliary is used the process is no longer dynamic.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 1.12</b> Use of a chiral auxiliary to control substitution a to a C=O group</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the first step, the chiral auxiliary is attached to the substrate to produce a new, discreet, and isolated compound (not an intermediate). The reaction is then carried out, and the product diastereoisomers may be separated and purified. Each of these is then subjected to a reaction which separates the chiral auxiliary and the desired product. An example of this approach is presented in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">At first sight the use of a chiral auxiliary might seem rather clumsy when compared to an asymmetric catalytic process, and undoubtedly this is true, provided that an efficient catalytic process exists. If a highly enantioselective catalytic reaction is not available, then use of a chiral auxiliary is often the method of choice.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, asymmetric catalysis is <i>enantioselective</i>, which means that the product is a mixture of enantiomers. If the e.e. is not very high then the minor enantiomer must be separated from the major, and enantiomer separation can be very difficult. If a chiral auxiliary is used, the process is <i>diastereoselective</i>, and as the products are diastereoisomers, separation is usually easily achieved by &#x2018;normal&#x2019; purification techniques such as column chromatography. Providing that the reaction yield is high and the diastereoisomer separation is easy, a chiral auxiliary which provides only a modest level of diastereoselectivity can be useful in practice.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stereospecific and stereoselective reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The terms &#x2018;stereospecific&#x2019; and &#x2018;stereoselective&#x2019; are often misused, and should not be confused. Although we have already encountered diastereoselective and enantioselective reactions (Sections 1.4 and 1.5), we will consider these terms again here in the context of selectivity and specificity.</p>
<a id="page_9" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 9, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>
<p class="indent">In a stereospecific reaction, the mechanism <i>requires</i> a specific product stereochemistry from a particular stereochemistry of the starting material. This implies that the reaction takes place by a mechanism which has a strict stereochemical requirement. In a stereospecific reaction there can be only one possible product stereoisomer, there can be no selectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">A typical example is substitution by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, which is discussed in some detail in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">Section 2.3</a>). Substitutions which take place by this mechanism must involve inversion of the configuration of the carbon atom which is reacting. A typical example of this is shown in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.13">Fig. 1.13</a>. The mesylate (&#x00B1;)-<b>1.15</b> undergoes S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement to give <i>only</i> (&#x00B1;)-<b>1.16</b>. The diastereoisomer (&#x00B1;)-<b>1.17</b> cannot be formed if the reaction is an S<sub>N</sub>2 process, as this would correspond to <i>retention</i> of configuration.</p>

<p class="indent">Reactions which take place by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism can also be said to be <i>enantiospecific</i>. An enantiospecific reaction is one in which the mechanism <i>requires</i> that a chiral substrate of a given enantiomeric purity reacts to give a product with the same enantiomeric purity. A simple example is the reaction of (<i>R</i>)-2-bromooctane <b>1.18</b> with sodium hydroxide (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>), the substitution follows the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism and the only substitution product which can be formed by this mechanism is (<i>S</i>)-2-octanol <b>1.19</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">The stereospecific S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions described above involve a starting material which is chiral. Stereospecific reactions are also possible with achiral compounds, a common type being stereospecific reactions of achiral alkenes. In all cases, as required by the definition of a stereospecific reaction, the mechanism requires that a given stereoisomer of the alkene gives rise to a particular diastereoisomer of the product. When the product is chiral, it is formed as a racemate (assuming the absence of a chiral reagent or catalyst), as the faces of the alkene are <i>enantiotopic</i> (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>). Some typical examples are provided in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.15">Fig. 1.15</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In contrast to the types of reactions discussed above, for a <i>stereoselective</i> reaction, the mechanism does not prevent the formation of two or more <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>stereoisomeric products. Three common types of stereoselective reaction are listed below.</p>

<p class="hanga">(a)<span class="space06">&#160;</span>Reactions which involve the formation of one or more new stereocentres in a chiral substrate.</p>
<p class="hanga">(b)<span class="space06">&#160;</span>Reactions in which two prochiral substrates react such that one new stereocentre originates from each, so that two new stereocentres are formed.</p>
<p class="hanga">(c)<span class="space06">&#160;</span>Reactions in which a prochiral substrate reacts with an enantiomerically enriched reagent or catalyst to give a chiral product which is also enantiomerically enriched.</p>
<p class="indent">A typical example of a reaction in category (a) is nucleophilic addition to a chiral ketone or aldehyde (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.16">Fig. 1.16</a>). As discussed earlier (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.3">Section 1.3</a>), one of the possible diastereoisomeric products is often formed in considerable excess, but this selectivity depends on the kinetics of the reaction, rather than the mechanism. In the example used in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>, reaction of <b>1.7</b> with phenyl magnesium bromide gives <b>1.9</b> with a d.e. of 83%. The mechanism does not dictate which face of the prochiral carbonyl group reacts, it is the difference in <i>rate</i> of addition to each face which results in the observed diastereoselectivity.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 1.16</b> Formation of one new stereocentres in a chiral substrate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Reactions in category (b), in which two prochiral substrates react to give a product containing one new stereocentre from each, are capable of producing two diastereoisomeric products (both racemic if no chiral reagent or catalyst is used). It might be thought that this is unduly complicated, but at least two very important reactions used in organic synthesis fall into this category, aldol reactions (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>) and Diels-Alder cycloadditions (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In a typical case, outlined in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.17">Fig. 1.17</a> for an aldol reaction, both reactants are prochiral. Each possesses enantiotopic faces (sp<sup>2</sup>) from which the two new stereocentres originate (sp<sup>3</sup>), and reactions involving all combination of <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>the faces are possible. This results in the possible formation of two racemic diastereoisomeric products in different amounts. The d.e. of the reaction is 76 per cent, but the e.e. of the two diastereoisomers must be zero.</p>

<p class="indent">Enantioselective reactions, corresponding to category (c), in which a chiral reagent or catalyst reacts with a prochiral substrate to produce a non-racemic chiral product, have been discussed at some length earlier in this chapter (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.4">Section 1.4</a>). Example which illustrate the relevant points can be found in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a> and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As you progress through this book you will meet numerous examples of these types of stereoselective reaction. Before we consider the individual reactions in detail, some important general features of reactivity and bond formation need to be covered. These are the substance of <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
