<h2 class="h2">10.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General considerations</h2>
<p class="noindent">The reactions with which we will be concerned in this chapter are enzyme catalysed hydrolysis of esters and esterification. From our point of view, we can regard enzymes simply as enantioselective catalysts. They are much larger and much more complicated than &#x2018;normal&#x2019; enantioselective catalysts, so a detailed understanding and prediction of both the sense and level of enantioselectivity is often rather difficult. In addition, many enzymes are selective about the structure of the substrates which they will accept. Nevertheless, there are some enzymes which are cheap, available in quantity, and which will accept a reasonably wide range of substrates. In general it is these which find significant application in stereoselective synthesis.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Enzyme catalysed kinetic resolutions are essentially a technique for racemate resolution, rather than stereoselective synthesis, and so will not be considered here.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">There are two basic processes which can be carried out by enzyme hydrolysis, resolution of a racemate by kinetic resolution, and conversion of a <i>meso</i>-compound into a chiral product (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.1">Fig. 10.1</a>). Idealized general examples of these processes are represented in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.1">Fig. 10.1</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">10.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Hydrolysis/esterification of <i>meso</i> compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most of the reactions in this area involve ester hydrolysis, and one of the most widely used enzymes is pig liver esterase. Typically, the <i>meso</i>-compound used as starting material possesses two enantiotopic ester groups (CO<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>A</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>B</sub>, <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.2">Fig. 10.2</a>), so hydrolysis of one of these will produce enantiomeric products. This is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;asymmetrization&#x2019; (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.2">Fig. 10.2</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent">Careful chemical manipulation of a single enantiomer produced by asymmetrization can give products in either enantiomeric form. This is often referred to as the <i>&#x2019;meso-</i>trick&#x2019;, and a typical example is shown in <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.3">Fig. 10.3</a>, <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Chapter 10 Hydrolysis and esterification</a>where a single enantiomer of <b>10.5</b> is used to produce both enantiomers of the lactone <b>10.6</b> by selective manipulation of the functional groups.</p>

</figure>


<p class="indent">The origin of the enantioselectivity of enzyme catalysed ester hydrolysis lies in the fact that enzymes are chiral, and present as a single enantiomer. They are proteins built up from a relatively large number of amino acids (which are usually (<i>S</i>)-amino acids). Many of the esterases possess a serine residue at the active site (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.4">Fig. 10.4</a>), which reacts with the ester of the substrate, to form an acylated enzyme intermediate. This is subsequently hydrolysed, releasing the acid and the enzyme for another catalytic cycle.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 10.4</b> Diastereoisomeric transition states in asymmetrization of a <i>meso</i>-diester</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">The ester groups of the <i>meso</i>-compound are enantiotopic, and the enzyme is chiral, so reaction of the serine with the esters will produce diastereoisomeric intermediates, via diastereoisomeric transition states (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.4">Fig. 10.4</a>). Thus the enzyme is capable of distinguishing the enantiotopic groups.</p>

<p class="indent">It is also possible to produce chiral alcohols in high enantiomeric excess, rather than chiral acids. Hydrolysis of the <i>meso</i>-cyclopentane diacetate <b>10.7</b> catalysed by acetyl cholinesterase which provides the monoacetate <b>10.8</b> by selective hydrolysis of ester &#x2018;A&#x2019; in <b>10.7</b>. Hydrolysis of the closely related diacetate <b>10.9</b> with the same enzyme also gives the monoacetate (<b>10.10</b>) in high enantiomeric excess, but hydrolyses other ester group (&#x2018;B&#x2019;)!</p>

<p class="indent">Esterase enzymes can also be used to catalyse the reaction of an ester with an alcohol to produce a new ester, a process known as transesterification. This process is reversible, which can lead to mixtures. However, if vinyl acetate (<b>10.11</b>) is used as the ester, transesterification will produce a mixture of the new ester (<b>10.13</b>) and vinyl alcohol (<b>10.14</b>, <a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.6">Fig. 10.6</a>). Vinyl alcohol is the enol tautomer of acetaldehyde (<b>10.15</b>), and the second equilibrium lies far to the right. As vinyl alcohol is produced, it converts to acetaldehyde, and the transesterification equilibrium is driven in favour of the new ester.</p>
<p class="indent">This transesterification approach can be very effective, and has been used in a synthesis of the natural enantiomer of aristeromycin (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#fig10.7">Fig. 10.7</a>). The <i>meso-</i>diol <b>10.16</b> undergoes transesterification with vinyl acetate to produce the monoacetate <b>10.17</b> in high enantiomeric excess, which was subsequently converted via a number of steps to aristeromycin.</p>
