<h2 class="h2"><b>7.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>General considerations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The two most commonly encountered types of reductions in stereoselective organic synthesis are the reduction of alkenes, and the reduction of carbonyl groups. Usually these are very different types of reaction (although occasionally the same reagent will do both), and each encompasses a very large area of chemistry. We will consider some of the more important aspects of these reactions from the point of view of stereoselective synthesis, along with a few examples of their application in organic synthesis.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reduction of C&#x2013;C double bonds</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The most widely used method of alkene reduction is catalytic hydrogenation, and the reaction is applicable to a very wide range of types of alkenes. In general terms, the alkene is exposed to an atmosphere of hydrogen gas (or an alternative source of hydrogen) in the presence of a metal catalyst, often palladium, platinum, nickel, rhodium, or ruthenium. In heterogeneous hydrogenation, the catalyst is either the finely dispersed metal itself, or the metal adsorbed onto a support. Alternatively, soluble metal complexes can be used, which leads to homogeneous hydrogenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Although heterogeneous hydrogenation has been known for much longer than the homogeneous version, the mechanistic details are still relatively unclear. Hydrogen molecules are adsorbed onto the metal, probably forming metal-hydrogen a bonds (Step 1, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). It is also known that the alkene is adsorbed onto the metal surface, presumably through interaction of its &#x03C0; and <i>&#x03C0;*</i> orbitals with appropriate orbitals on the metal surface (Step 2, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). A hydrogen atom is then transferred to the adsorbed alkene, to form an intermediate with a metal-carbon a bond (Step 3, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>). This can react with a further hydrogen atom to give the alkane (Step 4, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>), which then desorbs from the catalyst surface.</p>

<a id="page_63" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 63, Chapter 7 Reduction</a>	
<p class="indent">In most cases, both hydrogen atoms are transferred to the same face of the double bond, resulting in a <i>syn</i> addition. As the initial &#x2018;&#x03C0;&#x2019; bonding to the surface usually takes place from the less hindered face of the alkene (where applicable), the overall process amounts to <i>syn</i> addition of hydrogen to the less hindered face of the alkene.</p>
<p class="indent">Heterogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes is often stereoselective, giving the product of <i>syn</i> addition, as in the reduction of 7.1 (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). However, the situation can be rather more complicated, as in some cases substantial amounts of the product of <i>anti</i> addition can be formed, as is the case in the reduction of 7.2.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-right-60"><b>Fig 7.2</b> Heterogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Heterogeneous hydrogenation can be directed by hydroxyl groups in the substrate, and this effect can dominate the stereochemical outcome. Reduction of the alcohol 7.3 gives mainly the product of hydrogen addition from the same face as the hydroxyl group (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>). If the CH2OH group is changed to an ester, then reduction takes place from the opposite face. The hydroxyl group binds to the surface of the catalyst, so presenting the &#x2018;upper&#x2019; face of the alkene preferentially, but the ester group is not capable of such binding.</p>

<p class="indent">This type of hydroxyl direction is particularly evident in homogeneous hydrogenations. The metal is used in the form of a soluble complex, often involving phosphine ligands. The overall process is similar to that outlined for heterogeneous hydrogenation, in that it is thought to take place by reaction of H<sub>2</sub> with the metal to give M&#x2013;-H bonds, complexation of the alkene to the metal (by &#x03C0; bonding), followed by transfer of hydrogen from the metal to the alkene. One of the most commonly used catalysts is <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Chapter 7 Reduction</a>Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst <b>7.4</b> (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>), a cationic rhodium complex which usually results in <i>syn</i> addition of hydrogen from the less hindered face of the alkene (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hydroxyl directing effects are particularly evident when cationic complexes of iridium and rhodium are used. The complexes which we will consider include dienes as ligands initially, which are removed by hydrogenation under the reaction conditions, and play no part in the reaction. These dienes, 1,4-cyclooctadiene and norbomadiene are usually abbreviated to COD and nbd respectively. The structures of two such catalysts are shown in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.5">Fig. 7.5</a>.</p>

The metal is cationic, and co-ordination of the oxygen is much more likely to take place through one of its lone pairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Highly diastereoselective directed hydrogenation of acyclic alkenes such as <b>7.6</b> is also possible, and the observed diastereoselectivity has been rationalized on the basis of a complex in which the metal is bound to the alkene and the oxygen, in which allylic strain is minimized (<b>7.7</b>, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>).</p>

This overall reaction scheme embodies many of the important elements of homogeneous hydrogenation, <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 7 Reduction</a>directed or not. It could be modified to accommodate reduction of alkenes which do not contain an oxygen simply by replacing the M&#x2013;O bond with a M&#x2013;S (metal&#x2013;solvent) bond.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 7.8</b> Mechanistic scheme for directed homogeneous hydrogenation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">The mechanistic scheme shown in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.8">Fig. 7.8</a> is typical of homogeneous hydrogenation, and as can be seen, the ligands remain attached to the metal throughout the reaction. This means that if the alkene is prochiral, and the ligands are chiral, we have the possibility for an enantioselective catalytic procedure. This can be achieved in practice, and is a very powerful method for the asymmetric synthesis of a range of organic compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">A wide range of chiral phosphine ligands has been used in such enantioselective hydrogenation, but we will consider just two examples, DIPAMP (<b>7.8</b>) and BINAP (<b>7.9</b>) (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>). Both enantiomers are available, so that either enantiomeric hydrogenation product can be obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Cationic rhodium complexes of DIPAMP are particularly useful for the asymmetric synthesis of amino acids and their derivatives from &#x2018;dehydro-&#x03B1;-acylamino acids&#x2019; (such as <b>7.10</b>, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>). This approach finds use in a commercial synthesis of L-DOPA.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we have covered some of the important aspects and applications of catalytic reduction of alkenes, and the remaining part of this chapter is concerned with the other important type of reduction used in organic synthesis, reduction of carbonyl groups.</p>

<p class="noindent">The reductions which we will consider involve the addition of hydride, using complex hydrides, to ketones. These reactions can be viewed as nucleophilic addition of hydride, and there is much similarity between these reactions and the nucleophilic additions discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The reduction of chiral ketones is usually carried out using either NaBH<sub>4</sub> of LiAIH<sub>4</sub>, although there is quite a range of variants on these simple reagents. The reactivity and the bulk of the reducing agents of the various hydride reagents vary greatly, and can affect the diastereoselectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">As with other nucleophilic additions, steric effects tend to dominate, and in the absence of strong steric effects, electrostatic and dipole interactions can be important. The formalism which is used for acyclic chiral ketones is the Felkin&#x2013;Ahn model (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>), and is outlined in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.10">Fig. 7.10</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The reduction of cyclohexanones again follows the addition of nucleophiles (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>) and tends to take place by axial attack, as most complex hydrides are relatively small nucleophiles. Axial substituents in the 3 position with respect to the carbonyl group disfavour axial attack, and can result in the product of equatorial reduction (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.11">Fig. 7.11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the structure of the ketone allows for chelation of the metal cation of the hydride reagent, then very high levels of diastereoselectivity can be obtained. If zinc borohydride is used (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.12">Fig. 7.12</a>), the ketone acts as a bidentate chelating ligand for the zinc, and the hydride then reacts from the less hindered face of the carbonyl group.</p>

<p class="indent">The final type of reduction which we will cover is that of prochiral ketones to enantiomerically enriched secondary alcohols. Many chiral reagents have been developed and used, based on complex hydrides or boranes, and selected examples are provided in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.13">Fig. 7.13</a>. In these reactions, the chiral species is in effect &#x2018;attached&#x2019; to a &#x2018;standard&#x2019; reducing agent, and is required in at least stoichiometric quantities. Although it is often possible to achieve high enantiomeric excesses in some cases, these methods have largely been superseded by methods using enantioselective catalysis.</p>

<p class="indent">The catalyst brings the ketone and the borane together (<b>7.14</b>, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.15">Fig. 7.15</a>), with the borane and the ketone bound on the less hindered face, and with the larger of the substituents of the ketone directed away from the complex.</p>

<p class="indent">If the structure of the ketone is such that it is capable of acting as a bidentate chelating ligand, then enantioselective reduction is possible by hydrogenation in the presence of ruthenium(II) complexes of BINAP (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.9">Fig. 7.9</a> ). The oxygen of the ketone acts as one donor ligand, and the other group completes the chelation. As can be seen from the examples in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.17">Fig. 7.17</a> this &#x2018;other&#x2019; group can be either an amine, a hydroxyl, or a carbonyl group, and the chelate ring can be either live or six membered.</p>

<p class="indent">As a carbonyl group can act as the &#x2018;other&#x2019; ligand for chelation of the ketone, it is not surprising that diketones can be excellent substrates for this type of enantioselective reduction. The product of reduction of one carbonyl <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Chapter 7 Reduction</a>group in a diketone, a hydroxyl group, is itself capable of chelation, and so the reaction proceeds to give the diol. This process is both highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.18">Fig. 7.18</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The catalysts which we have discussed for the enantioselective reduction of  ketones act by binding both the substrate and the reagent in some way, and  this is similar to the way m which enzymes operate. As carbonyl reduction is a common reaction in Nature, it is not surprising that there are many enzymes which can be used for the enantioselective reduction of ketones. In practice, one of the easiest ways of achieving this is to use the enzymes present in actively fermenting yeast. In general, steric effects dominate, and a simple model accounts for the observed enantioselectivity in most reductions of this type (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.19">Fig. 7.19</a>).</p>

A &#x03B2;-keto ester which possesses a substituent between the two carbonyls is chiral, and the two enantiomers are in rapid equilibrium via the enol. If such a &#x03B2;-keto ester is subjected to yeast reduction, then often one of the enantiomers is reduced much more rapidly than the other. As this takes place, the keto&#x2013;enol equilibrium is continuously re-established, so the slow reacting enantiomer is converted into the fast reacting enantiomer, which of course is reduced. In this way, we can obtain greater than 50 per cent yield of essentially enantiomerically pure product starting from a racemate (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.20">Fig. 7.20</a>).</p>
