<p class="noindentswap" style="margin-top:-1.3em;">Synthesis is the central arena of modem organic chemistry providing specifically designed and precisely constructed materials on which many other sciences rely. The current high level of precision demanded of synthesis, including the provision of single enantiomers as well as single diastereoisomers, makes the understanding of the factors which allow control of the stereo- selectivity in organic synthesis an essential and fundamental topic for all students of chemistry.</p>
<p class="indentswap">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. The present primer by Garry Procter presents the basic concepts of stereo- selective organic synthesis in a very logical and readily understandable fashion. This primer will make essential reading for apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
