<p class="indent">Nucleophilic additions to carbonyl groups can be divided into those which give enantiomeric products, and those whose products are diastereoisomers. In the latter case, the carbonyl compound is often chiral, and we will consider this class of additions first.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2 Additions to chiral carbonyl compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">For simple, acyclic, carbonyl compounds such as <b>3.1</b> containing one stereocentre (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>), we would expect the two diastereoisomeric products <b>3.2</b> and <b>3.3</b> to be formed in different amounts. Given that there is &#x2018;free&#x2019; rotation about the C&#x2013;C bond which connects the stereocentre with the carbonyl group it might be expected that the diastereoselectivity would be low. This is not necessarily the case, and with the appropriate carbonyl compound and nucleophile the diastereoselectivity can be remarkably high.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">If one of the groups X, Y, or Z, is capable of being involved in chelation of a metal counter-ion, along with the oxygen of the carbonyl group, then the stereoselectivity and the model used to account for it changes. This type of reaction will be considered following our discussion of &#x2018;simple&#x2019; chiral carbonyl compounds.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Nucleophilic addition to simple carbonyl compounds</h3>
<p class="indent">There have been several models advanced to account for the trends observed in the diastereoselectivity of nucleophilic additions to ketones and aldehydes such as <b>3.1</b>. Such models need to take into account the various factors which might influence such additions. These include conformational effects, steric interactions, electronic factors, and stereoelectronic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">We will consider only the model commonly referred to as the &#x2018;Felkin- Ahn&#x2019; model. An important tenet of this model is that nucleophilic attack takes place antiperiplanar to a neighbouring a bond (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This conformation is thought to be favoured because of overlap of the neighbouring antibonding (&#x03C3;*) orbital of the &#x03C3; bond with the &#x03C0;* orbital of the carbonyl group. In the absence of the nucleophile both these orbitals are unfilled, and therefore their interaction will have no effect on the energy. However, as the nucleophile attacks, electron density is transferred from the electron rich nucleophile to the &#x03C0;* orbital of the carbonyl group. When there is a neighbouring &#x03C3;* orbital suitably aligned then the electron density which is building in the &#x03C0;* orbital of the carbonyl group can be &#x2018;delocalized&#x2019;, resulting in an overall lowering in energy (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nucleophilic attack is favoured when a neighbouring &#x03C3; bond is antiperiplanar. In our typical example <b>3.1</b> there are three such bonds, C&#x2013;X, C&#x2013;Y, and C&#x2013;Z, so which do we choose?</p>
<figure class="figure-center-100" id="fig3.3">
<img src="../images/fig_3.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 3.3</b> Antiperiplanarity of the new bond and an adjacent &#x03C3; bond in nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If we place the largest group (X, Y, or Z) antiperiplanar, then we will minimize steric repulsions. However, if there is an electronegative group amongst X, Y, and Z, which is incapable of chelation (see below) then it is placed antiperiplanar to the nucleophile. This helps to reduce electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, the corresponding &#x03C3;* orbital will be lower in energy and therefore will interact most strongly with the &#x2018;filling&#x2019; &#x03C0;* orbital. On the <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 3 Additions to carbonyl compounds</a>whole, we will be dealing with groups X, Y, and Z which are of similar electronegativity, and so usually we will be placing the largest substituent antiperiplanar to the incoming nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">It will be useful therefore to classify the three substituents X, Y, and Z, as small (S), medium (M), and, large (L). If we do this, then we narrow the choice of reacting conformations to two, <b>3.4</b> and <b>3.5</b> (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>). Nucleophilic attack on <b>3.4</b> is favoured over attack on <b>3.5</b>. In the latter, the nucleophile must pass close to the medium-sized group (M), whereas for <b>3.4</b> the nucleophile interacts with the smallest group.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Reactions on <b>3.4</b> and <b>3.5</b> take place on opposite faces of the carbonyl group, and so result in diastereoisomeric products <b>3.6</b> and <b>3.7</b>. If we assume that reaction takes place only on <b>3.4</b> and <b>3.5</b>, then the difference in energy between these will be reflected in the d.e. of the product (this also assumes that they are equally reactive).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In general, aldehydes react with lower stereoselectivity than ketones with the same reagent, and increasing the steric bulk of the reagent increases stereoselectivity. Choice of organometallic reagent can also have a dramatic effect, with titanium reagents offering excellent levels of stereoselectivity in some cases (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the carbonyl group is part of a ring, as in cyclohexanones, then this will clearly have a serious effect on the conformations which are accessible for <a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Chapter 3 Additions to carbonyl compounds</a>reaction. The stereochemistry of addition to chiral cyclohexanones is rather complicated, and a clear, simple model has yet to emerge.</p>
<p class="indent">For a conformationally locked cyclohexanone, the two possible directions for nucleophilic attack can be labelled as &#x2018;axial&#x2019; and &#x2018;equatorial&#x2019; (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>). Relatively small nucleophiles (such as complex hydrides and alkyne anions) generally prefer &#x2018;axial&#x2019; addition, but this preference can be overturned by the presence of axial groups at positions 3 and 5.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Nucleophilic addition to carbonyl compounds capable of chelation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nucleophilic reagents usually come associated with a metal counter-ion. If the carbonyl compound undergoing nucleophilic addition is capable of chelating this metal ion, then very high diastereoselectivity is possible. The chelation arises because one of the groups adjacent to the carbonyl group possesses a lone pair, usually either an oxygen or nitrogen substituent.</p>
<p class="indent">The carbonyl group also possesses lone pairs, so the carbonyl compound can act as a bidentate ligand for the metal ion. This has the effect of &#x2018;locking&#x2019; the conformation, so maximizing the steric effects of the other two substituents adjacent to the carbonyl group (small, S, and large, L, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3 Additions to prochiral carbonyl compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">If the carbonyl compound itself is prochiral, in most of the reactions of interest to us, another component of the reaction must be chiral. The most obvious candidate is the nucleophile. A simple example of this approach is the use of anions derived from chiral sulfoxides as nucleophiles.</p>
<p class="indent">Chiral sulfoxides are configurationally stable, and can be prepared in essentially enantiomerically pure form. The sulfoxide group stabilizes an adjacent negative charge, so they can be deprotonated relatively easily with amide bases such as lithium di/^opropylamide (LDA). The resulting chiral anions undergo stereoselective addition to prochiral carbonyl compounds, although the d.e. is often relatively low (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.9">Fig. 3.9</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Sulfoxides with two different groups attached to the sulfur atom are pyramidal, as there is also a lone pair on sulfur. They are configurationally stable up to ~200&#x00B0;C.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 3 .9</b> Addition of a chiral nucleophile to a prochiral ketone</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">An alternative approach to the use of chiral nucleophiles is to react a readily available achiral nucleophile with a chiral reagent, before carrying out the addition to the carbonyl compound. In effect, a &#x2018;standard&#x2019; nucleophile, such as a Grignard reagent or an alkyl lithium, is converted in the reaction flask to a new chiral nucleophile. After reaction, the chiral reagent (or its equivalent) is removed either in the work up of the reaction or by standard purification techniques (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a> for a discussion of the principles of using chiral reagents).</p>
<p class="indent">This approach is exemplified by the use of the titanium complex <b>3.8</b> (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>). Allylmagnesium chloride reacts with <b>3.8</b> to give the new chiral reagent <b>3.9</b>, and this reacts with benzaldehyde (and other aldehydes) with high enantioselectivity.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 3.10</b> Addition of a chiral allyltitanium reagent to benzaldehyde</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the above example, the nucleophile is an allyl group. This type of nucleophile often reacts through a cyclic transition state, analogous to those of Claisen and Cope rearrangements (Chapter 2). Most of these reactions use allylic groups attached to boron, and a number of chiral boron reagents have been developed to control the stereochemistry of this type of reaction. Some important aspects of this type of reaction are illustrated in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>, along<a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter 3 Additions to carbonyl compounds</a>with some examples of allylic boron reagents which react with aldehydes with high enantioselectivity.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">A feature of any chiral reagent, is that (at least) a mole of reagent is needed for each mole of carbonyl compound which reacts. As discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a>) in principle using an asymmetric catalyst is much more efficient than either a chiral reagent or auxiliary. Such catalytic methods can be very effective in nucleophilic additions to carbonyl compounds. A relatively well studied method involves the use of an organozinc nucleophile and a chiral, enantiomerically pure 1,2-aminoalcohol as catalyst. The example used in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.5">section 1.5</a>) and illustrated below is particularly effective. The catalyst, known as (+)- or (&#x2013;)-DAIB <b>3.10</b>, is prepared from camphor, both enantiomers of which are readily available.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The acronym DAIB is derived from the compound&#x0027;s name, (+)- or (&#x2013;)-3-exo-(dimethylamino)isobomeol.</p>

<figure class="figure-aside-left">
<img src="../images/31_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The reaction is particularly effective for aldehydes. Nucleophilic addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes is usually very slow, but the catalyst speeds up the addition.</p>
<p class="indent">Many types of aldehyde will react with organozinc reagents with catalysis by DAIB, and a selection of such reactions is presented in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.12">Fig. 3.12</a>. There are other types of catalyst which can be used for the enantioselective addition of achiral nucleophiles to achiral carbonyl compounds. The most successful types contain 1,2-aminoalcohol units analogous to that in DAIB.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Rate enhancement is important if high levels of enantioselectivity are to be achieved. The rate of the &#x2018;uncatalysec&#x2019; nucleophilic addition must be relatively slow</p>
