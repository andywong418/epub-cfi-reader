<h2 class="h2">4.1 The reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The reaction of enolates with electrophilic species, often referred to as &#x03B1;-substitution of carbonyl compounds, is a very important reaction in organic chemistry. One reason for this is that the carbonyl group can be converted easily into many other functional groups, indeed, the preceding chapter was concerned with just one such reaction of carbonyl compounds. The carbonyl group can even be removed completely by reduction to a methylene group (C=O to CH<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">This means that we can use &#x03B1;-substitution to a carbonyl group to introduce a new substituent, and then convert to carbonyl group into another functional group (or into CH<sub>2</sub>). This versatility makes the reaction particularly valuable in organic synthesis, and not surprisingly there has been much work carried out to devise methods to control the stereochemistry of substitution a to a carbonyl group.</p>

<p class="indent">A typical general reaction is illustrated in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>, and as can be seen two steps are involved. The carbonyl compound <b>4.1</b> reacts with a base to give an enolate <b>4.2</b>, which then reacts with an electrophilic species (El) to give the product of &#x03B1;-substitution. No matter which approach is used to control the stereochemistry of the new stereocentre, control is usually required in both steps. We need to control both the geometry of the enolate and the stereochemistry of its reaction with an electrophile.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.1.1">
<h3 class="h3">General considerations</h3>
<p class="noindent">The enolate has two faces which are either enantiotopic or diastereotopic depending on whether the enolate is prochiral or chiral. These are easily characterised as <i>re</i> or <i>si</i> by considering C-&#x03B1; of the enolate. The enolate possesses a double bond, so there is also the possibility of <i>E/Z</i> isomerism. These stereochemical relationships are shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Descriptors (<i>E</i>)- and (<i>Z</i>)- are derived from the German for &#x2018;opposite&#x2019; (<i>entgegeri</i>) and &#x2018;together&#x2019; (<i>zusammeri</i>). The two substituents at each end of the double bond are allocated priorities as in the CIP convention. The isomer which has the two higher priority groups opposite is the (<i>E</i>)-isomer, and the other is the (<i>Z</i>)-isomer.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Stereoelectronic restrictions apply to the deprotonation step to form the enolate and its reaction with an electrophile. Deprotonation is favoured when the C&#x2013;H bond which is broken is orthogonal to the plane of the carbonyl group. In such a conformation the &#x03C3; C&#x2013;H orbital is lined up with the &#x03C0; C=O <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 4 Reactions of enolates</a> orbital (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). This &#x03C3; C&#x2013;H orbital ultimately &#x2018;becomes&#x2019; the p orbital at C-&#x03B1; of the enolate &#x03C0; bond, so it will be advantageous if it is already lined up with the p orbital of the carbonyl carbon. In addition, the starting conformation <b>4.4</b> is similar to the transition state <b>4.5</b>, so steric and electronic effects present in <b>4.4</b> should be reflected in <b>4.5</b>.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The oxygen atom of the enolate which originates from the C=O group is often arbitrarily given priority over the other substituent R1 irrespective of the rules of the CIP convention.</p>

<p class="indent">Comparing the Newman projection <b>4.6</b> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>) with <b>4.4</b> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>), it is apparent that there is much greater steric interaction between R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> in the conformation which leads to the (<i>E</i>)-enolate. As stated above, such steric effects should also be reflected in the transition states <b>4.5</b> and <b>4.7</b>. This means that in cases where this interaction is large, we would expect the (<i>Z</i>)-enolate to be easier to form. Under kinetic control, the norm for most stereoselective reactions, the (<i>Z</i>)-enolate should predominate.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2 Reactions of chiral enolates</h2>
<p class="noindent">In some cases, the stereochemistry of enolate formation is unambiguous, in particular when the enolate forms part of a ring. The ring geometry allows only one enolate stereoisomer to be formed (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The facial selectivity of alkylation of chiral enolates is largely governed by steric effects, so it is important to be aware of the stereochemistry and conformation of the enolate, and the preferred direction for bond formation.</p>
<figure class="figure-center-100" id="fig4.6">
<img src="../images/fig_4.6.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig. 4.6</b> Alkylation of a cyclic enolate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In cases where the enolate is part of a ring, the conformation is rigid, and where large differences in steric hindrance on the two faces are present, the diastereoselectivity can be very high. The alkylation of <b>4.8</b> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>) falls into this category. Being a <i>trans</i> decalin, the rings cannot flip, and the reaction takes place on a rigid framework. In particular, the methyl group in <b>4.8</b> and the enolate is effectively fixed with respect to the rest of the <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 4 Reactions ofenolates</a>molecule. As the electrophile approaches from the same face of the enolate as this methyl group, large steric interactions build up. The corresponding transition state is disfavoured compared to attack on the other face, which is free of such severe steric interactions (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Such reactions are not confined to polycyclic systems. The five membered lactone <b>4.9</b> can give only one enolate, which reacts with electrophiles from the less hindered face, opposite to the bulky <i>tert</i>-butyl group (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x03B1;-Substitution of chiral acyclic enolates</h3>
<p class="noindent">The stereochemistry of the enolates which have so far been discussed has been determined by the structure of the ketone or ester, by virtue of it being part of a ring. When there is a stereocentre &#x03B2; to the carbonyl group in an acyclic ester, it is often possible to achieve high levels of diastereoselectivity. The general reaction is shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>. The simplest case is shown, in which two groups of very different steric demand are attached to the stereocentre. The most stable conformation is likely to be one in which the C&#x2013;H bond of the stereocentre is more or less coplanar with the plane of the enolate.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Electrophilic attack then takes place from the face of the enolate opposite to the larger group. The geometry of the enolate does not matter, as both OLi and OMe are both moderately sized groups. The key to this type of stereochemical control is the minimization of repulsive steric interactions between the groups attached to the stereocentre and the groups at the terminus of the enolate (OMe and OLi). If the difference in size between groups L and S is large enough, this type of reaction can take place with very high diastereoselectivity (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3 Chiral auxiliaries</h2>
<p class="noindent">Enolate geometry can be held rigidly in other ways. This, along with conformational control, is often a key aspect of efficient chiral auxiliaries for &#x03B1;-substitution. Initially we will consider systems derived from reaction of a chiral auxiliary with an activated carboxylic acid derivative.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Acyl derivatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">Oxazolidinone chiral auxiliaries <b>4.10</b> and <b>4.11</b> are particularly useful, and use strong chelation effects. They are easy to prepare from 1,2-amino alcohols, and to couple with a carbonyl compound (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.10">Fig. 4.10</a>).</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center">
<b>Fig. 4.10</b> Preparation, coupling, and enolization of acyl oxazolidinones</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Such acylated oxazolidinones can exist in two conformations, <b>4.12</b> and <b>4.13</b>, in which the nitrogen lone pair can delocalize into the carbonyl group of the acyl group. These will give the corresponding (Z)-enolate in two conformations <b>4.14</b> and <b>4.15.</b> Enolate <b>4.14</b> is much more stable due to chelation of the metal counter ion.</p>
<p class="indent">This chelation holds the enolate with respect to the chiral auxiliary, the oxazolidinone. In the reaction of such enolates, the electrophile is directed strongly by the stereochemistry at C-4. In <b>4.14</b> the lower face (C-&#x03B1; <i>re</i> face) is blocked by group at C-4, so the electrophile is directed to the upper (C-&#x03B1; <i>si)</i> face (Fig 4.9). Various metal enolates corresponding to <b>4.14</b> react with a range of electrophilic reagents in this way (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.11">Fig. 4.11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Many other types of chiral auxiliaries have been developed for enolate &#x03B1;-substitution, two particularly interesting examples are shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.13">Fig. 4.13</a>. In <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 4 Reactions ofenolates</a>both cases shown, a single enolate geometry is formed, it exists in one conformation, and part of the auxiliary effectively blocks one face of the enolate.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the chiral auxiliaries illustrated in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.13">Fig. 4.13</a> react with extremely high diastereoselectivity, and as with the oxazolidinones described above, are effectively chiral versions of a carboxylic acid or its derivatives. Although the method of chiral auxiliary removal is different for the iron acyl system, compared with the others, the overall effect is the same:- The formation of enantiomerically enriched acids, esters, amides, or alcohols. It is also possible to use chiral auxiliary methodology to achieve &#x03B1;-substitution of prochiral ketones, which is the subject of the next section.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">&#x03B1;-Substitution of prochiral ketones and aldehydes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most widely used type of chiral auxiliary for achieving &#x03B1;-substitution of prochiral ketones and aldehydes is based on conversion to an imine or a hydrazone, which carries a group capable of chelation. There are several such chiral auxiliaries, but we will concentrate on the most commonly encountered system, based on chiral hydrazines.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="figure-aside-left">
<img src="../images/page39_01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">These enantiomeric auxiliaries, commonly known as RAMP and SAMP, are prepared from readily available enantiomerically pure starting materials, and react readily with ketones and aldehydes to give the corresponding hydrazones (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.14">Fig. 4.14</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hydrazones derived from SAMP and RAMP react with strong base, usually butyllithium, to give a species analogous to an enolate. This &#x2018;enolate&#x2019; is thought to possess a rigid structure, which results in highly diastereoselective reaction with alkylating agents. The chiral auxiliary cannot be removed easily by simple hydrolysis. Ozonolysis of the C=N bond is efficient, and provides the corresponding carbonyl compound and the <i>N</i>- nitroso derivative, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of the chiral auxiliary (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.14">Fig. 4.14</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The electrophiles which have been used include a wide range of alkyl halides, and the diastereoselectivity in the alkylation step can be very high, typically in the range 80 to &#x2265;95 per cent. A typical example of this approach is shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.15">Fig. 4.15</a>, and demonstrates its simplicity and effectiveness. The SAMP hydrazone of <i>n</i>-butanal, following conversion to the &#x2018;enolate&#x2019; with LDA, reacts with the alkyl iodide <b>4.16</b> in high d.e. After removal of the chiral auxiliary, ketone <b>4.17</b> was used in a total synthesis of an ionophore antibiotic X-14547A.</p>
