<p class="noindent">The oxidation of alkenes can be a powerful method for stereoselective synthesis, and the reactions which we will consider in this chapter are oxidations of alkenes to give epoxides, 1, 2-diols, or 1, 2-amino alcohols.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Epoxidation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Epoxides are usually obtained by oxidation of an alkene, and are particularly useful as intermediates for organic synthesis, as they can undergo highly selective ring openings with nucleophilic reagents. The epoxidation process usually involves retention of configuration of the alkene, and the ring opening reaction is usually an S<sub>N</sub>2 process. This makes epoxidation followed by nucleophilic ring opening a sequence whose stereochemical outcome is highly predictable, as might be expected for two sequential stereospecific reactions. The overall process is outlined below (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">For the epoxidation of simple prochiral double bonds (i.e. those without strongly electron withdrawing substituents) to give racemic epoxides, the normal reagent is an organic peroxyacid, often meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (<i>m</i>CPBA, <b>8.1</b>, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>). The mechanism of this reaction has been discussed briefly in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>). As neither the reagent nor substrate is chiral, and no chiral catalyst is used, the epoxide <b>8.2</b> must be racemic.</p>
<p class="indent">If the alkene is chiral, then a diastereoselective reaction is possible. In general, the epoxidation will take place preferentially on the less hindered face of the alkene. If there is a hydroxyl group adjacent to the alkene, then this can &#x2018;direct&#x2019; the peroxyacid by hydrogen bonding. This was the first type of reaction to be recognized as being subject to such &#x2018;direction&#x2019;. A typical example of this type of reaction is shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">When the epoxide is attached to a six membered ring which itself has a rigid conformation, then reaction with a nucleophile is both stereospecific, and highly regioselective. The epoxide opens to give the product of <i>trans</i>-<i>diaxial</i> opening, in which the incoming nucleophile and the hydroxyl group are both axial (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Highly diastereoselective epoxidation of chiral acyclic alkenes is also possible, particularly if there is a hydroxyl group adjacent to the alkene. In this type of epoxidation (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>), the reacting conformation of the alkene is important, as is &#x2018;direction&#x2019; by hydrogen bonding.</p>

<p class="indent">When racemic ally lie alcohol <b>8.3</b> reacts with <i>m</i>CPBA the two diastereoisomeric epoxides <b>8.4</b> and <b>8.5</b> are formed with <b>8.4</b> being predominant (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>). This can be understood by considering representations of the two reacting conformations <b>8.6</b> and <b>8.7</b> which lead to the diastereoisomeric epoxides.

<p class="indent">Epoxidation is not confined to the use of <i>m</i>CPBA. In the presence of certain transition metal complexes as catalysts (Mo, V, W, or Ti), alkyl hydroperoxides such as <i>tert</i>-bulyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, <b>8.8</b>, <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>) will epoxidize alkenes. This approach is useful for allylic alcohols, as the hydroxyl group can &#x2018;direct&#x2019; the epoxidation by co-ordination to the catalyst. An added advantage of these catalysts is that the hydroxyl group can exert its directing effect even when it is rather remote from the alkene.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">So far, all the discussion of epoxidation reactions has concerned either prochiral or racemic substrates, so the product epoxides must be racemic. Great advances have been made in the development of methods for producing epoxides in high e.e., and this is an area of organic synthesis where enantioselective catalysis has made a major impact.</p>
<p class="indent">A method for the enantioselective catalytic epoxidation of prochiral allylic alcohols, known as Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>), uses catalytic amounts of an ester of tartaric acid such as diisopropyl tartrate <b>8.9</b> (DIPT), or diethyl tartrate <b>8.10</b> (DET), and titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti(OPr<sup><i>i</i></sup>)<sub>4</sub>), with TBHP (<b>8.8</b>) as the stoichiometric oxidizing agent.</p>

<img src="../images/fig_8.7.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 8.7</b> Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation of prochiral allylic alcohols</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reaction is very general, and a very wide range of prochiral allylic alcohols can be used as substrates, making an equally wide range of epoxides available in high e.e. Moreover, it is highly selective for allylic alcohols, other double bonds in the substrate are not epoxidized, as in the epoxidation of <b>8.11</b> (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A detailed discussion of the mechanism of this reaction is beyond the scope of this book, but a brief description follows. The catalyst is derived from the chelating tartrate ligand and Ti(OPr<sup><i>i</i></sup>)<sub>4</sub>), and epoxidation takes place when the catalyst is &#x2018;loaded&#x2019; with both the epoxidizing agent (TBHP) and the <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter 8 Oxidation</a>allylic alcohol. The product epoxide and <i>tert</i>-butanol (from the TBHP) are then replaced by more allylic alcohol and TBHP, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p class="indent">The catalytic complex delivers the epoxide oxygen from one face or the other of the double bond, depending on the chirality of the tartrate ligand, in a highly predictable manner, as illustrated in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 8.8</b> Facial selectivity of Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation using tartrate diesters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation conditions can also be applied to racemic allylic alcohols such as <b>8.12</b>. The catalyst is chiral, and only one enantiomer is present, so both enantiomers of the allylic alcohol should in principle be epoxidized from the same face, as illustrated in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.9">Fig. 8.9</a>. However, the <i>rates</i> of epoxidation of the two enantiomers will be different (the transition states are diastereoisomeric).</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 8.9</b> Sharpless kinetic resolution of racemic allylic alcohols</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the rates of epoxidation of the two enantiomers are sufficiently different, and this is very often the case, then using 0.5 mole of TBHP for each mole of racemic allylic alcohol should result in essentially complete consumption of the faster reacting enantiomer (there is 0.5 mole of it in the racemate). The reaction should stop (there being no oxidant left) at the point where almost all the epoxide product derives from the faster reacting enantiomer, and almost all the unreacted allylic alcohol is the slower reacting enantiomer. This results in kinetic resolution, which is generally very efficient with this type of epoxidation. An example of this so-called Sharpless Kinetic Resolution is shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.10">Fig. 8.10</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-right-60"><b>Fig. 8.10</b> Example of Sharpless Kinetic Resolution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation and Kinetic Resolution are particularly useful since all the reagents are commercially available and quite cheap, both enantiomers of the tartrate ligand are readily available, the reactions generally give good yields of products with high e.e., and the absolute and relative stereochemistry of the products are highly predictable. Not surprisingly, these reactions have found widespread use in organic synthesis. An example, which emphasizes the selectivity of the epoxidation step, and the regioselective and stereospecific opening of the epoxide produced, is illustrated in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.11">Fig. 8.11</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Sharpless Asymmetric EBoepoxidation of <b>8.14</b> takes place to give the epoxide <b>8.15</b> in high e.e., and with the expected stereoselectivity. The initially produced epoxide reacts further under the reaction conditions, undergoing cyclization by an intramolecular epoxide opening with the nucleophilic hydroxyl group to give <b>8.16</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation and Kinetic Resolution are extremely powerful and useful tools in organic synthesis, but they are both restricted to allylic alcohols. This selectivity can be put to good use, but is a restriction on the types of epoxide which can be prepared.</p>

The facial selectivity of these catalysts can be predicted using the simple steric model shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.13">Fig. 8.13</a>, along with some examples of the epoxides which can be prepared.</p>

<p class="indent">It is now possible to prepare a wide range of epoxides using enantioselective catalysis, and although all types of alkenes cannot yet be used as substrate, the range is sufficient for many synthetic purposes. A complementary type of alkene oxidation, dihydroxylation, is often highly diastereoselective, and is also possible using enantioselective catalysis. This, and aminohydroxylation of alkenes, constitute the rest of this chapter.</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Dihydroxylation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dihydroxylation of an alkene using osmium tetroxide <b>8.18</b> is a stereospecific reaction in which produces a <i>syn</i>-diol such as <b>8.19</b> (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.14">Fig. 8.14</a>). Osmium tetroxide is usually used in catalytic quantities, along with a stoichiometric oxidant to recycle the reduced osmium species represented as <b>8.20</b> following reaction with the alkene. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic osmate ester <b>8.21</b>, which is hydrolysed under the reaction conditions, to the diol and reduced osmium species. Oxidation of the latter allows the reaction cycle to continue (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.14">Fig. 8.14</a>). One advantage of dihydroxylation using osmium tetroxide is that it is a very general reaction, electron rich, electron deficient, and electronically &#x2018;neutral&#x2019; alkenes will all undergo reaction, as will heavily substituted alkenes.</p>

<p class="indent">Dihydroxylation of a chiral alkene is often reasonably diastereoselective. Steric effects can be important, with the <i>syn</i>-diol being introduced from the less hindered face of the chiral alkene (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.15">Fig. 8.15</a>), but the stereoselectivity varies greatly depending on the structure of the alkene.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 8.15</b> Diastereoselective dihydroxylation of chiral allylic alcohols and ethers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The dihydroxylation of chiral allylic alcohols and ethers often takes place with good diastereoselectivity, but unlike epoxidation, the neighbouring hydroxyl group does not direct by hydrogen bonding. One model proposed to account for the observed diastereoselectivity is shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.15">Fig. 8.15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Enantioselective dihydroxylation of prochiral alkenes is possible using catalytic conditions (again developed by Sharpless) which are very efficient, and under which many different types of alkene react with very high enantioselectivity. A variety of enantiomerically pure ligands have been developed, the most widely used, <b>8.22</b> and <b>8.23</b>, are shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.16">Fig. 8.16</a>. These ligands co-ordinate to the osmium, which can be osmium tetroxide or K<sub>2</sub>[OsO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>], with potassium ferricyanide as the stoichiometric oxidant, and potassium carbonate to control the pH. In many cases the efficiency of the process is increased by the use of methanesulfonamide.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the ligands may appear to be very complicated, in fact they are derived from either quinine or quinidine, which are readily available natural products, and the ligands are commercially available. Even more conveniently, mixtures of either ligand, K<sub>2</sub>[OsO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>], potassium ferricyanide, and potassium carbonate are available, making this type of Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation very simple to carry out in practice. Many types of alkene will undergo Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation, and a few examples are shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.17">Fig. 8.17</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The high levels of enantioselectivity, and the lack of interference from other functional groups in the alkene, combined with the ease of carrying out</p>
