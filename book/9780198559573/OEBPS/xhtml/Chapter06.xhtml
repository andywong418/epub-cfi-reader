<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:3em;"><b>6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two particularly important types of additions to C&#x2013;C double bonds. The reaction can be concerted, in which a new bond is formed to each end of the double bond more or less simultaneously. At the other extreme, the two bond forming events are effectively independent of each other, except that for mechanistic reasons one must precede the other. In this chapter we will consider a selection of some of the more important types of additions, including hydroboration, Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloaddition, electrophilic addition, and conjugate addition. Some basic aspects of the mechanism and stereoelectronic requirements of these reactions have been covered previously in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec6.2">
<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electrophilic addition</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">For the purpose of this chapter, this will be interpreted as electrophilic addition, followed by capture of the cationic species by a nucleophile (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). A simple example of this is the addition of bromine, and the mechanism and stereoelectronics of this process were covered in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">An important general type of electrophilic addition to which is useful in stereoselective organic synthesis involves cyclization (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>), in which the second step in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a> is intramolecular. There are two possible modes of cyclization, <i>endo</i> and <i>exo</i> ring closures (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>).</p>

<a id="page_53" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 53, Chapter 6 Additions to C&#x2013;C double bonds</a>	
<p class="indent">It is usually much easier for the nucleophile to react via an <i>exo-cyclization</i> than by the corresponding <i>endo</i>-cyclization. This is a result of the restrictions on the nucleophile as a result of its being tethered to the double bond, and the stereoelectronic requirements of the nucleophilic attack.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall stereochemistry of addition to the double bond is <i>trans.</i> For an achiral substrate undergoing this reaction, a single racemic stereoisomer should be formed, the relative stereochemistry of which will depend on the geometry of the alkene. A simple example of this process, known as iodolactonization, is shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a> and represents a valuable type of electrophile induced cyclization.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">If there is a pre-existing stereocentre in the substrate, then this can play an important part in controlling the diastereoselectivity of the reaction. Some examples of the iodolactonization of chiral substrates are shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">From the examples provided in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>, it can be seen that with the preexisting stereocentre close to the C&#x2013;C double bond, the diastereoselectivity can be very high. The reactions shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a> are probably under thermodynamic control, in each case the major diastereoisomer corresponds to the more stable product. These are examples of a highly diastereoselective reaction which is under thermodynamic control.</p>
<p class="indent">The reaction works with a range of nucleophiles and electrophilic reagents. Of particular interest are electrophile induced intramolecular cyclizations where the nucleophile is an alkene, which form C&#x2013;C bonds (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>).</p>

<a id="page_54" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 54, Chapter 6 Additions to C&#x2013;C double bonds</a>	
<p class="indent">This type of reaction is of special significance, as it is analogous to that used in Nature for the biosynthesis of polycyclic natural products of the terpene family. These systems often have <i>trans</i> fused rings, and the Stork- Eschenmoser hypothesis proposed that this stereochemical feature was related to the <i>trans</i> geometry of the alkene precursors. The suggested mechanism required the new bonds to be formed more or less simultaneously from opposite faces of the alkene. This amounts to a <i>trans</i> addition to the double bond (Fig, 6.5). The reaction shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a> was a demonstration that the proposed biosynthetic reaction, in which the alkene geometry is reflected in the ring fusion stereochemistry, could be carried out in the laboratory.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Hydroboration</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The mechanism and related stereoelectronic aspects of alkene hydroboration were discussed earlier in this book (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). Overall, it is a ris-addition, in which the boron is attached at the more nucleophilic end of the double bond. For an achiral alkene and borane, the reaction is stereospecific. The stereoelectronic requirement of the reaction and the alkene geometry determine which (racemic) diastereoisomeric product is formed (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>).</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-center-100"><b>Fig 6.6</b> Hydroboration of an alkene</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the alkene is prochiral and acyclic, then high levels of diastereoselectivity can only usually be obtained if the pre-existing stereocentre is sufficiently close to the alkene. The preferred conformation of alkenes with a stereocentre adjacent to the double bond is often that in which allylic A<sup>(1, 3)</sup> or strain is minimized (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>). This leads to the proposal that a reagent is likely to prefer to attack such an alkene from the face opposite to the larger group, assuming the absence of strong electronic or chelating effects due to substituents L and S. As might be anticipated from <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>, this idea is useful in accounting for the stereoselectivity in other reactions of alkenes, including hydroboration as shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conjugate additions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Nucleophilic attack on a C&#x2013;C double bond usually requires that it is electron deficient, and for our purposes we will consider only a,p-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The overall reaction is often referred to as conjugate addition (or 1,4-addition). In its most general form (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>), three components are involved, each of which could be chiral. The process involves two distinct reactions, addition of the nucleophile to generate an enolate, and &#x2018;trapping&#x2019; of this with an electrophilic reagent.</p>

<p class="indent">Nucleophiles and electrophiles which are not chiral or prochiral can give rise to two possible diastereoisomeric products, although one often predominates (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>). The trapping step corresponds to reaction of a <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 6 Additions to C&#x2013;C double bonds</a>chiral enolate with an electrophile, which usually takes place from the less hindered face of the enolate.</p>

<p class="indent">It is possible to control the stereochemistry of both the new stereocentres which are produced in a conjugate addition-trapping sequence using chiral auxiliaries. One of the most effective methods is shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>, and employs the sultam 6.2 chiral auxiliary which can also be used for enolate alkylation, aldol reaction, and Diels-Alder cycloadditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Enantioselective catalysts have been developed for conjugate addition reactions, but it is fair to say that there is not yet a catalyst which is capable of achieving very high enantioselectivity with a wide range of nucleophiles and a,p-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The nickel catalyst 6.3 will catalyse the conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to some acyclic &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;-unsaturated ketones with good e.e., as shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Diels-Alder cycloaddition</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The Diels-Alder cycloaddition is one of the most powerful general methods in organic synthesis. Two new C&#x2013;C bonds, up to four new stereocentres, one double bond, and a new six membered ring are all formed in the reaction. It is a concerted thermal 4+2 cycloaddition, and some aspects of the mechanism have been discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. When both components are prochiral, two diastereoisomers can be produced, known as the <i>endo-</i> and <i>exco</i>-adducts (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a>). Although an em/o-approach is usually more congested, and the <i>endo</i>- adduct is thermodynamically less stable (more hindered), this is often the kinetic product.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The transition state for <i>endo-</i> cydoaddition can be stabilized by overlap of &#x03C0;	 orbitals on group B in the dienophile with the diene HOMO. Such &#x2018;secondary orbital overlap&#x2019; is not possible in an <i>exo</i>-transition state.</p>

More accurately, these are described as the orbital coefficients. The most common type of Diels-Alder cycloadditions involves electron deficient dienophiles. The LUMO for such a system is distorted as shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>, with the larger coefficient at the end of the alkene remote from the electron withdrawing group. A similar analysis of the HOMO of a diene possessing an electron donating group at one terminus reveals the largest coefficient to be at the end remote from the group. Best overlap in the reaction is achieved by interaction of the ends of the reactants which possess the larger coefficients. This is illustrated in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Given the importance of the Diels-Alder cycloaddition in organic synthesis, it is not surprising that much effort has gone into developing efficient enantioselective methods. Many chiral auxiliaries are available, for example the oxazolidinones which we have encountered several times already can be very effective. In the presence of more than one mole equivalent of the Lewis acid dimethylaluminium chloride, a cationic complex is formed (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>. This dienophile is now extremely electron deficient, and held rigidly as the aluminium chelate. <i>enido</i>-Cycloaddition from the less hindered face then provides the major product in high d.e.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cyclopropanation of alkenes usually involves reaction with a carbene or its equivalent. In practice the carbene is often associated with a metal, and referred to as a carbenoid. In the reaction, the geometry of the alkene is usually conserved, but this is not always the case. There are many methods for the generation of carbenoids, but we will consider only a very limited selection. A typical, example (the Simmons-Smith reagent 6.6) is illustrated in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.22">Fig. 6.22</a>, and reactions of this reagent are strongly directed by hydroxyl groups in the substrate (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.22">Fig. 6.22</a>). In the absence of hydroxyl groups, as might be expected, carbenoids react with chiral alkenes from the less hindered face of the molecule.</p>

<p class="indent">As with the Simmons-Smith reagent, the alkene geometry is usually preserved, and reaction takes place from the less hindered face of the alkene where appropriate.
