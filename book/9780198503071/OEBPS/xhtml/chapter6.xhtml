<p class="noindent">Diimide reduction <b>1.25</b> on p. 6, with diimide generated by the oxidation of hydrazine and by other methods, is almost alone in involving the transfer of two groups. Diimide reduction works well with double and triple bonds that are not too hindered; diimide is not poisoned by sulfur-containing compounds as hydrogenation catalysts are; and it is highly selective for homonuclear double bonds, C&#x003D;C and N&#x003D;N, over heteronuclear double bonds like C&#x003D;O. The selectivity probably comes about because the pericyclic nature of the reaction sets a premium on symmetry. Its <i>syn</i> stereospecificity certainly does, since it corresponds to the allowed all-suprafacial pathway <b>6.1</b>. Its pericyclic nature, however, makes it unsuitable for reduction with deuterium, because the isotope effect for both C&#x2013;D bonds breaking in concert is too high.</p>

<p class="indent">Concerted delivery of two hydrogens from any other substrate than diimide is known in only a handful of cases, requiring, for example, the gain, twice over, of aromaticity in the reaction <b>6.2</b> (arrows), or the high degree of organization found in a few intramolecular reactions. The 10-electron bisvinylogue, in which 1,4-cyclohexadiene <b>6.3</b> reduces anthracene <b>6.4</b>, is also known. Although clearly allowed in the all-suprafacial mode, deuterium labels show that it is not stereospecifically a <i>syn</i> delivery of hydrogen; it is therefore not pericyclic. This is perhaps a timely reminder that not all reactions that appear to obey the rules can be assumed to be pericyclic.</p>
<p class="indent">The difficulty encountered in all these reactions is that two &#x03C3;-bonds must break at the same time, a heavy penalty very few organic reactions can overcome.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Ene reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">With only one &#x03C3;-bond to break, ene reactions are much easier, although not, of course, as easy as Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, which involve only &#x03C0;-bonds. Typically an ene reaction will require temperatures 100&#x00B0; or more higher than <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Chapter 6 Group transfer reactions</a>a comparable Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction. As with Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, electron-withdrawing groups on the enophile and electron-donating groups on the ene speed up the reaction. The regiochemistry with an unsymmetrical enophile <b>6.5</b> is such that the major product <b>6.6</b> has the alkene carbon attacking the &#x03B2;-position of the enone system and the hydrogen atom going to the &#x03B1;-position. Lewis acid catalysis <b>6.7</b> &#x2192; <b>6.8</b> has made the reaction much more amenable.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0085-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Some aspects of the stereochemistry of attack are revealed by the reaction <b>6.10</b> &#x002B; <b>6.11</b> &#x2192; <b>6.12</b>. The symmetry-allowed, 6-electron, all-suprafacial transition structure <b>6.9</b> has an envelope conformation, with the two new &#x03C3;-bonds developing overlap head on, and with the enophile oriented, just as in a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, so that the electron withdrawing group is <i>endo</i>&#x2014;lying over the fold of the envelope. The result is that if the enophile has an &#x03B1;-substituent and the alkene a substituent on C-3, it is possible to control a pair of 1,3-related stereocentres (<b>6.12</b> asterisks). Notice that this type of stereocontrol is not governed by the Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules themselves, but by secondary effects imposed on the all-suprafacial reaction. The presence of an alkyl group R on C-2, causes the geminai methyl group C-l to deliver the hydrogen atom rather than the vicinal methyl group C-4.</p>

<p class="indent">The ene reaction has proved to be particularly powerful in synthesis when carried out intramolecularly. The usual increase in rate for an intramolecular reaction allows relatively unreactive partners to combine. Thus the diene <b>6.13</b> gives largely (14:1) the <i>cis</i> disubstituted cyclopentane <b>6.15</b> by way of a transition structure <b>6.14</b>. It is important to recognize that the selective formation of the <i>cis</i>-disubstituted cyclopentane has nothing to do with the rules for pericyclic reactions. It is a consequence of the lower energy when the trimethylene chain spans the two double bonds in such a way as to leave the hydrogen atoms on the same side of the folded bicyclic structure. This <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Chapter 6 Group transfer reactions</a>constraint is similar to the way a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring is lower in energy if it is <i>cis-</i>fused.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0086-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The chain of atoms can include an oxygen atom. When the enophile is a carbonyl group, the reaction is a Prins reaction <b>6.16</b>, which is usually acid-catalysed and not pericyclic, except perhaps in gas phase reactions like the intramolecular example <b>6.17</b> &#x2192; <b>6.19</b> with a plausible transition structure <b>6.18</b>; the acid-catalysed reaction gives a completely different product.</p>

<p class="indent">There are other cases where the oxygen delivers the hydrogen atom <b>6.20</b>. The thermal reaction of an enol with an alkene to give a ketone is called a Conia reaction, and is usually most useful when intramolecular. Since the enol in an unsymmetrical system cannot usually be made specifically, this reaction cannot be controlled&#x2014;it depends upon one of the two or more possible enols&#x2019; reacting in the desired way. When that does happen, it is an effective synthetic method, giving, for example, camphor <b>6.23</b> from dihydrocarvone <b>6.21</b> in one operation, by way of the enol <b>6.22</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent">All-carbon ene reactions can go in reverse when ring-strain is released <b>6.24</b>. This reaction is curious, because it could also be considered as a homologue of a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement&#x2014;it is quite common to think of the chemistry of cyclopropanes as similar to that of alkenes. With heteroatoms in the chain it is possible to drive such reactions in reverse without having to release strain. Thus esters such as acetates and benzoates undergo a cyclic &#x03B2;-elimination on pyrolysis. This type of elimination is known to be <i>syn</i> <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Chapter 6 Group transfer reactions</a>stereospecific, as it must be to be all-suprafacial, and it is therefore fundamentally a retro-ene reaction. The temperatures needed are rather high, typically about 400&#x00B0;, and the reaction is best carried out by flash vacuum pyrolysis; but the Chugaev reaction <b>6.25</b> &#x2192; <b>6.26</b> &#x002B; <b>6.27</b>, using xanthate esters, is comparatively mild, requiring temperatures of 150-250&#x00B0;.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0087-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">An even milder cycloelimination uses a ring of five atoms <b>6.28</b> instead of six, but still involves six electrons. This is no longer a retro-ene reaction, but it is still a retro group transfer; and it is allowed in the all-suprafacial mode <b>6.29</b>. The pyrolysis of <i>N</i>-oxides <b>6.30</b> is called the Cope elimination, and typically takes place at 120&#x00B0;, the corresponding elimination of sulfoxides <b>6.31</b> (X&#x003D;S) typically takes place at 80&#x00B0;, and, even easier, the elimination of selenoxides takes place at room temperature or below. All these reactions are affected by functionality making these numbers only rough guides, but they are all reliably <i>syn</i> stereospecific.</p>
