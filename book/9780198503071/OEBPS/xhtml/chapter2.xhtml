<p class="noindent">Cycloadditions are the most useful of all pericyclic reactions in organic synthesis. This chapter describes the wide range of known cycloadditions, identifies the conditions under which they take place, draws attention to their regio- and stereochemistry, and gives the simple rules for which of them take place and which do not. The explanations for most of these features, based on the molecular orbitals involved, will then be covered in the following chapter.</p>

<p class="noindent">The most important type of cycloaddition is the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction. Stripped down to its essential components, it is the reaction between butadiene <b>2.1</b> and ethylene <b>2.2</b> to form cyclohexene <b>2.3</b>. The ethylenic component is called the dienophile. In practice this reaction is unbearably</p>

<p class="noindent">slow. It can be forced to take place: after 17 hours at 165&#x00B0; and 900 atmospheres, it does give a yield of 78%; but it is advisable, for reasons we shall see in <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, for the dienophile to have attached to it one or more electron-withdrawing groups like a carbonyl, nitrile, nitro or sulfonyl group. Thus, in the reaction with maleic anhydride illustrated on p. 2, the presence of the two carbonyl groups allows the reaction to take place at 20&#x00B0; in 24 h in quantitative yield. The presence of a carbonyl group does not change the core <i>components</i> of the reaction, which are the three double bonds affected by the three curly arrows. The carbonyl group is a substituent attached to the periphery, affecting the rate, but not changing the fundamental nature, of the reaction. Substituents on the diene also increase the rate, provided they are electron-donating, like methyl, alkoxy or amino groups. <a href="#fig_2.1">Figs. 2.1</a> &#x0026; <a href="#fig_2.2">2.2</a> illustrate these points, showing the times and temperatures that have been used in a representative range of Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, and giving some sense of which ones are easy and which need a bit of persuasion before they can be used in synthesis.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, if you look at the different dienophiles in <a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>, the dimerization of butadiene <b>2.1</b> is slower than its reaction with acrolein <b>2.4</b>. Methyl acrylate and methyl vinyl ketone have electron-withdrawing substituents Z of comparable power, and react at a similar rate, but cyclohexenone <b>2.5</b>, which has a &#x03b2;-alkyl substituent, is considerably less reactive. Nitroethylene has one of the most powerful electron-withdrawing groups, and is a very good <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>dienophile, as is any alkene with two electron-withdrawing groups, like the methylenemalonate <b>2.6</b>, benzoquinone, or the maleic anhydride we saw earlier. An acetylenic ketone is a little more reactive than its ethylenic counterpart, and benzyne is exceptionally powerful in spite of its not having an electron-withdrawing group. The weak &#x03C0;-bonds in the triazolinedione <b>2.7</b> and the thioketone <b>2.8</b> make them especially good dienophiles; the former is one of the most reactive dienophiles that can be kept in a bottle.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking at the effect of changing the structure of the dienes in <a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, we find that having an electron-donating substituent X on C-1 or on C-2, even as weak a one as the methyl group in piperylene <b>2.9</b> and isoprene <b>2.10</b>, makes these dienes more reactive than butadiene, and raises the possibility of forming two regioisomers. Both are indeed formed, but the regioisomer illustrated is the major product. A methoxy group or a silyloxy group on the dienes <b>2.11</b> and <b>2.12</b> makes them more reactive still.</p>

<p class="indent">Most impressive of all, cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene <b>2.13</b> are significantly more reactive than open-chain dienes. A diene can participate in a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction only when it is in the s<i>-cis</i> conformation. If it were to <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>react in the s<i>-trans</i> conformation, a <i>trans</i> double bond would have to be formed in the cyclohexene product, and a <i>trans</i> double bond in a cyclohexene is impossibly high in energy. The s<i>-trans</i> conformation in a diene is lower in energy than the s<i>-cis,</i> with butadiene itself having only about 1% of its molecules at room temperature in the s<i>-cis</i> conformation. Cyclic dienes are therefore more reactive, other things being equal, because they have all their molecules in the s<i>-cis</i> arrangement, and do not have to add the difference in energy between the <i>s-trans</i> and the s<i>-cis</i> to the activation energy for the reaction. This is especially true of cyclopentadiene <b>2.13</b>.</p>

When dienes or dienophiles have a heteroatom like nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the conjugated system, they are called heterodienes or heterodienophiles, and the reactions are called hetero-Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions. It is possible to have the electron-donating substituents X on the dienophile and the electron-withdrawing substituents Z on the diene; such reactions are said to have inverse electron demand. They are much less common, because having the substituents this way round is not, for some reason, as effective as having them the usual way round.</p>
<p class="indent">Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions are, of course, reversible, and the pathway followed for the reverse reaction (<b>2.3</b> arrows) can sometimes be as telling as the pathway for the forward reaction. The direction in which any pericyclic reaction takes place is determined by thermodynamics, with cycloadditions, like the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, usually taking place to <i>form</i> a ring because two &#x03C0;-bonds on the left are replaced by two &#x03C3;-bonds on the right. A Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction can be made to take place in reverse when the products do not react with each other rapidly, as in the pyrolysis of cyclohexene <b>2.3</b> at 600&#x00B0;. It helps if either the diene or the dienophile has some special stabilization not present in the starting material, as in the formation of the aromatic ring in anthracene <b>2.15</b> in the synthesis of diimide <b>2.16</b> from the adduct <b>2.14</b>, and in</p>

The kind of dipoles that feature in 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions are isoelectronic with an allyl anion, having a conjugated system of three p-orbitals on three atoms, X, Y, and Z, and four electrons in the conjugated system <b>2.21</b>. The range of possible structures is large; X, Y, and Z are commonly almost any combination of C, N, O and S, with a double or, in those combinations that can support it, a triple bond <b>2.22</b> between two of them.

As with dienes, they can have electron-donating or withdrawing substituents attached at any of the atoms with a hydrogen atom in the core structure, and these modify the reactivity and selectivity that the dipoles show for different dipolarophiles. Some of the dipoles are stable compounds like ozone and diazomethane, or, suitably substituted, like azides, nitrones, and nitrile oxides. Others, like the ylids, imines, and carbonyl oxides, are reactive intermediates that have to be made <i>in situ.</i> <a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a> shows some examples of some common 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, and <a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a> illustrates two of the many ways in which unstable dipoles can be prepared.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Several significant features of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions are illustrated in <a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. While diazopropane reacts with methyl methacrylate <b>2.27</b> straightforwardly to give the adduct <b>2.28</b>, the reaction with methyl acrylate <b>2.29</b> gives an adduct <b>2.30</b> that immediately loses the proton adjacent to the carbonyl group at C-3 and regains it at N-l to give a tautomer <b>2.31</b>, which is the product actually isolated. With unsymmetrical dipoles and dipolarophiles, the reactions can always give two regioisomers. This is illustrated by the same pair of reactions, where the adducts <b>2.28</b> and <b>2.30</b> have the ester substituent cleanly at C-3 of the pyrazoline products, and there is no trace of the regioisomer with the ester group at C-4. The &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated esters are unmistakably electrophilic at the &#x03b2;-position; evidently the diazoalkane is more nucleophilic at the carbon end than at the nitrogen end of the dipole, in spite of the way the curly arrows are drawn. It is important to remember that there is no sense of direction to the arrows&#x2014;they could equally be drawn the other way round using a canonical structure <b>2.40</b> of the diazoalkane. With aryl azides, the reactions with alkenes that have an electron-withdrawing substituent <b>2.32</b> or an electron-donating substituent <b>2.34</b> show opposite regioselectivity. The nitrogen attached to the benzene ring evidently has <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>nucleophilic character, bonding to the &#x03B2;-carbon of methyl acrylate, and the nitrogen at the terminus of the dipole has electrophilic character, bonding to the &#x03B2;-carbon of the ethyl vinyl ether. But a self-consistent picture like this is not carried over to all 1,3-dipoles. Nitrones, for example, react with methyl acrylate <b>2.36</b> and with a vinyl ether <b>2.38</b> with the same regiochemistry, with the substituent turning up on C-5 whether it is an acceptor or a donor.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_2.5">
<img src="../images/f0012-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.5</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Similarly, nitrile oxides react with methyl acrylate <b>2.42</b> to give the adduct <b>2.43</b> with the substituent on C-5; and terminal alkenes also react in this way to place the alkyl group on C-5. Many dipoles react well with electron-rich dipolarophiles, but not with electron-poor dipolarophiles. Other dipoles are the other way round. To make matters even more complex, the presence of substituents on the dipole can change these patterns and impart their own regioselectivity. Thus the carbonyl ylid reaction <b>2.45</b> has a well defined regiochemistry determined only by the substituents, since the core dipole is symmetrical. This reaction also illustrates the point that dipolarophiles do not have to be alkenes or alkynes&#x2014;they can also have heteroatoms.</p>

<p class="noindent">Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions are sometimes classified as [4&#x002B;2] cycloadditions, and 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions as [3&#x002B;2], where the numbers identify the number of <i>atoms</i> involved in the two chains. This classification is not as useful as the one used throughout this book, which is based on the number of <i>electrons</i> involved. In this classification, both Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions and 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions are [4&#x002B;2] cycloadditions&#x2014;4 electrons from the diene or</p>

<p class="noindent">dipole, and 2 from the dienophile or dipolarophile. These are not the only [4&#x002B;2] cycloadditions, but they are by far the most numerous and the most important. Conjugated ions like allyl cations, allyl anions and pentadienyl <a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>cations are all capable of cycloadditions. Thus, an allyl cation can be a 2-electron component in a [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition, as in the reaction of the methallyl cation <b>2.48</b> derived from its iodide <b>2.47</b>, with cyclopentadiene giving a seven-membered-ring cation <b>2.49</b>. The diene is the 4-electron component. The product eventually isolated is the alkene <b>2.50</b>, as the result of the loss of the neighbouring proton, the usual fate of a tertiary cation.</p>
<p class="indent">If both &#x03C3;-bonds form at the same time, the reaction is pericyclic, but carbocations are capable of reacting with alkenes, and so the first bond may form to give the cyclopentenyl cation <b>2.51</b> in one step, with the second bond formed in a separate step <b>2.51</b> (arrows). The reaction remains a cycloaddition whether both bonds are formed at the same time or not, but it is pericyclic only if they are both formed in the same step, as is probable in this case. <a href="#fig_2.6">Fig. 2.6</a> shows a small selection of other reactions that may similarly be pericyclic.</p>

<p class="indent">The conjugated system of the allyl cation contracts to the unconjugated empty p-orbital of a simple carbocation; so this type of reaction is apt to be favourable only when the cationic centre in the product carries a substituent to stabilize it&#x2014;the nitrogen lone pair in <b>2.52</b>, the oxygen lone pair in <b>2.55</b>, or the &#x03b2;-silyl group in <b>2.58</b> stabilize the cationic centres in the products <b>2.53</b>, <b>2.56</b> and <b>2.57</b>, and <b>2.59</b>, respectively. As in Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, dienes must be in the s<i>-cis</i> conformation for pericyclic cycloaddition to take place, but allyl cations, unlike most dienophiles, are reactive intermediates, rarely surviving long enough to meet a diene in the s<i>-cis</i> conformation. Open-chain dienes are therefore apt to give low yields, as in the formation of the bicyclic ketone <b>2.54</b>, whereas cyclic dienes are better, as in the formation of the tricyclic ketone <b>2.61</b>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">An allyl anion has two more electrons, but the complication with anions is that they are often ill defined, usually being organometallic species with a <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>carbon&#x2013;metal bond of substantial covalent character. It is not usually legitimate to picture conjugated anions, let alone draw them, simply as symmetrical conjugated systems of p-orbitals. Nevertheless, there does appear to be an element of concertedness in the reaction of an allyl anion-like species, drawn as the 2-phenylallyl anion <b>2.63</b>, and prepared in an unfavourable equilibrium by treating &#x03b1;-methylstyrene with base.

A stepwise pathway for this reaction is less plausible than it was for the corresponding cationic reactions in the previous section&#x2014;carbanions, whatever their actual nature, do not easily add to simple alkenes. The pericyclic pathway has the energetic benefit of forming both new &#x03C3;-bonds in the same step, and so this type of reaction is quite plausibly pericyclic. Again, the anionic product <b>2.64</b>, having lost the allyl conjugated system, needs an anion-stabilizing group to make the reaction favourable. This type of reaction is rare, maybe because allyl anions are not usually simple conjugated systems of p-orbitals; this makes it difficult for the overlap to develop at both ends simultaneously.

Ionization of the acetal gives the cationic quinone system <b>2.66</b>. That this is a pentadienyl cation can be seen in the drawing of a canonical structure on the left, with the components of the pericyclic cycloaddition emphasized in bold. Intramolecular [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition takes place, with the pentadienyl cation as the 4-electron component and the cyclopentene as the 2-electron component.

<p class="noindent">So far, we have seen [4&#x002B;2], [8&#x002B;2], and [6&#x002B;4] cycloadditions, but they are not the only possibilities. Thus butadiene dimerizes in a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, but there are equally plausible looking reactions, a [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition and a [4&#x002B;4] cycloaddition, which it could have undergone and did not. One might simply answer, in this case, that forming a 6-membered ring is always easier than forming a 4- or 8-membered ring, for reasons of ring strain and because of the high probability of the two ends&#x2019; being close. But this argument does not explain why ethylene and maleic anhydride, or many other combinations of alkenes, do not give a cyclobutane when heated together.</p>

<p class="indent">This is a deeply important point, and it is just as well that it is true&#x2014;if alkenes and other double-bonded compounds could readily dimerize to form 4-membered rings, there would be few stable organic molecules, and life would be impossible. It is not that the dimerization is energetically unprofitable&#x2014;the four membered ring is lower in energy than the two alkenes&#x2014;so there must be a high kinetic barrier to the cycloaddition of one alkene to another. <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> explains where this barrier comes from.</p>
<p class="indent">Crudely, but adequately for now, we may state a rule governing which cycloadditions can take place and which not. A thermal pericyclic cycloaddition is allowed if the total number of electrons involved can be expressed in the form (4n&#x002B;2), where n is an integer. If the total number of electrons can be expressed in the form 4n it is forbidden. Another way of saying the same thing is that reactions with an odd number of curly arrows are allowed and those with an even number are forbidden. This rule needs to be qualified, as we shall see shortly, and in due course in <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> made more precise, along with the rules for all the other kinds of pericyclic reaction, in one all-encompassing rule. For now, we need to introduce the rule for photochemical pericyclic cycloadditions.</p>

Thus alkenes do give four-membered rings in photocycloadditions, either by self-coupling, or by cross-coupling.

<p class="indent">However, photo-activation puts so much energy into the molecule, that many pathways become available to the first electronically excited state in addition to the relatively simple pericyclic change. For this reason, none of the photochemical reactions above can be guaranteed to be pericyclic, and all that one should take from these results is the very strong and suggestive contrast with the rules for thermal cycloadditions. This contrast is accentuated by the observation that photochemical Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions are very rare, in spite of the ease with which 6-membered rings are normally formed.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the course of a pericyclic cycloaddition, the p-orbitals at the ends of the conjugated system of each component form &#x03C3;-bonds to the p-orbitals at the ends of the conjugated system of the other component. The p-orbitals must therefore approach each other head on, as in the transition structure for a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction <b>2.84</b> with the new <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds forming between C-1 and C-1&#x2032; and between C-4 and C-2&#x2032;. At the same time, a new &#x03C0;-bond forms between C-2 and C-3 of the diene. It is important to have this picture always in mind, since the usual flat drawings with curly arrows, like the one on p. 2, disguise the geometry of approach. The two new bonds forming at C-1 and C-4 of the diene are both forming on the bottom surface of the conjugated system. <a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>Reactions in which the new bonds are being formed on the same surface are described as being <i>suprafacial</i> on that component (<a href="#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7a</a>).

<p class="indent">The preliminary rules, thermal and photochemical, given on p. 16, need now to be qualified&#x2014;they apply only to cycloadditions that are <i>suprafacial on both components.</i> Nevertheless, almost all pericyclic cycloadditions are suprafacial on both components. It is physically difficult for one conjugated system to suffer antarafacial attack from another, since it implies that one or another of the components can reach round from one surface to the other <b>2.85</b>. Only if at least one of the components has a long conjugated system can it twist enough to make this even remotely reasonable. Straightforward antarafacial attack in cycloadditions is therefore very rare indeed. Keep in mind, however, that these rules only apply to pericyclic cycloadditions&#x2014;there are other kinds of cycloaddition, in which the two bonds are formed one at a time, and to which none of these rules applies.</p>

<p class="indent">Since both the diene and the dienophile in Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions <b>2.84</b> react suprafacially, there are synthetically useful structural consequences, which incidentally prove that the stereochemistry of approach is suprafacial.

</aside>
<p class="indent">All the other kinds of pericyclic cycloaddition discussed so far, not just Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, are also suprafacial on both components. Thus, 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions involve suprafacial attack on the dipolarophile, as in</p>

Azomethine ylids, however, do have the possibility of demonstrable stereochemistry at both ends, and they do react stereospecifically and suprafacially, as in the reaction of the dipoles <b>2.98</b> and <b>2.100</b>, which give the diastereoisomeric adducts <b>2.99</b> and <b>2.101</b> with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate.

Thus the <i>trans</i> phenyl groups on the cyclopentene <b>2.65</b> show that the two new bonds were formed suprafacially on the <i>trans</i>-stilbene.

Nevertheless, the fact that they have undergone cycloaddition is important, for it is the failure of thermal [2&#x002B;2], [4&#x002B;4] and [6&#x002B;6], and photochemical [4&#x002B;2], [8&#x002B;2] and [6&#x002B;4] pericyclic cycloadditions to take place, even when all-suprafacial options are open to them, that is significant.</p>

<p class="indent">There are other stereochemical features which have nothing to do with the symmetry of the orbitals, and are much less powerfully controlled. In many cycloadditions, there are two possible all-suprafacial approaches: one having what is called the extended transition structure <b>2.102</b>, in which the conjugated systems keep well apart, and the other called the compressed <b>2.103</b>, where they lie one above the other. Both are equally allowed by the rules that we shall see in <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, but one will usually be faster than the other. This type of stereochemistry applies only when the conjugated systems have at least three atoms in each component; it is therefore only rarely a consideration. It shows up in the cycloadditions of allyl cations to dienes, where the two adducts <b>2.56</b> and <b>2.57</b> on p. 13 are the result of the compressed transition structure <b>2.104</b> and the extended <b>2.105</b>, respectively, with the former evidently lower in energy.</p>

This area is not well enough understood for anyone to be dogmatic about what the underlying preferences ought to be in these comparatively rare cycloadditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of substituents is usually more important, because it can apply to all conjugated systems, not just those with more than two atoms. When a conjugated system carries a substituent Z on one side, as it often does, that substituent may sit pointing away from the conjugated system of the other component <b>2.108</b>, or it may sit under it <b>2.109</b>. The former is called the <i>exo</i> mode of attack, and the latter is called <i>endo.</i> The <i>endo</i> approach suffers from a steric repulsion between the group Z and the orbitals of the conjugated system. For this reason, the <i>exo</i> approach can be expected to lead to the major isomer, and in many cases it does.</p>

We also saw that some dipoles like phenyl azide are consistent, reacting to give opposite regioisomers <b>2.33</b> and <b>2.35</b> with dipolarophiles that have electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents. Other dipoles, however are inconsistent, with a nitrone reacting with both kinds of dipolarophile with the same regiochemistry placing the substituent on C-5 in both adducts <b>2.37</b> and <b>2.39</b>.

For the present it is enough for you to recognize a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition when you see it, and to appreciate the nature of some of the problems that exist.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.9</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Intramolecular cycloadditions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Intramolecular reactions are obliged to obey the powerful rules that govern which cycloadditions are allowed and which forbidden, but they can override the weaker forces controlling regio- and stereoselectivity, and it is important to remember this opportunity for synthetic design, when the trends outlined above are in conflict with the aims of the synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, the electrocyclic opening of the benzcyclobutene <b>2.146</b> gives a diene unit, which is trapped intramolecularly by the pendant vinyl group in <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>an <i>exo</i> transition structure <b>2.147</b>. An intermolecular version of this reaction would, in the first place, be too slow, because of the absence of activating substituents. In the second place, it would have an <i>endo</i> transition structure. Finally, there would be little regiocontrol, since the electron-donating power of the substituents is feeble, and, if anything, probably in favour the regioisomer. The presence of the chair-like connecting chain forces the stereochemistry and the regiochemistry into that required for a beautifully simple steroid synthesis at a high but now practical temperature.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0025-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the nitrone dipole <b>2.151</b> spontaneously adds obediently and suprafacially to the alkene, but with regiocontrol stemming from the intramolecular nature of the reaction, rather than from any substituent effects, since the double bond is essentially symmetrical. Bond formation for 1,3- dipolar cycloadditions is inherently asynchronous, with the C&#x2013;C bond in this case forming ahead of the O&#x2013;C bond (asynchronicity is discussed again on p. 53 in <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). Since the C&#x2013;C bond is the more strongly developed, it is easier if it starts to form a 6-membered ring <b>2.149</b> than if it starts to form a 7- membered ring <b>2.150</b>. Again the intramolecularity completely controls the regiochemistry, and contributes to the success of a very short synthesis of luciduline <b>2.153</b>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.10</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Not all cycloadditions are pericyclic</b></h2>
<p class="indent">We have already seen in the reactions of an allyl cation with a diene, that cycloadditions may take place stepwise, with one bond forming in a separate step from the second, in which case, although they are still cycloadditions, they are no longer pericyclic. It is not absolutely certain that all the cycloadditions illustrated above are pericyclic. All that is required for a stepwise reaction to be plausible is that the intermediate produced when one bond forms ahead of the other should have substituents powerful enough to stabilize the charges.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the examples in this chapter so far probably do not have this feature, with the possible exception of the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand <b>2.117</b> &#x2192; <b>2.118</b>, and are therefore likely to be pericyclic <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 2 Cycloaddition reactions</a>cycloadditions. But it is not difficult to set up a system in which one bond can form before the other&#x2014;it is merely necessary to equip one component with a powerful electron-donating group to make it nucleophilic, and the other with a powerful electron withdrawing group to make it electrophilic. Thus the enamine <b>2.154</b> readily reacts with methyl vinyl ketone <b>2.155</b> to give the hetero Diels&#x2013;Alder adduct <b>2.157</b>. However, this reaction is not pericyclic,</p>

Indeed, in the corresponding reaction with methyl acrylate <b>2.158</b>, a six-membered ring is not formed, and the product is a cyclobutane <b>2.160</b> in a two-step process by way of the zwitterionic intermediate <b>2.159</b> analogous to the intermediate <b>2.156</b>.

For the first step in a stepwise pathway, the diene does not need to be in the s<i>-cis</i> conformation&#x2014;as long as the substituents stabilize the radicals well enough, as they do here, the first bond can form the diradicai <b>2.162</b>, redrawn below as <b>2.164</b>, while the diene is still in its s<i>-trans</i> conformation. The allyl radical <b>2.164</b> produced from the s-<i>trans</i> diene has itself a fixed configuration, in which rotation about the bond between C-2 and C-3 is more restricted than it was in the diene. The chlorine-stabilized radical does not attack this radical at C-l (<b>2.164</b>, arrows), where there is an equal probability of finding the unpaired electron, because, were it to do so, it would have to give a <i>trans</i>-cyclohexene <b>2.165</b>.
