<p class="noindent">Every organic reaction can be classified into one of three, more or less exclusive categories&#x2014;ionic, radical and pericyclic. Ionic reactions involve pairs of electrons moving in one direction. In a unimolecular reaction, like the ionization of a tertiary alkyl halide, the carbon-halogen bond cleaves with</p>

<p class="noindent2">In ionic reactions, curly arrows have two functions: they identify where the electrons come from and where they are going, and hence identify which component is the nucleophile and which the electrophile; simultaneously they identify which bonds are broken and which new bonds are made. If the tail of an arrow is from a bond, then that bond is breaking, and if the head of the arrow falls between two atoms it shows where the new bond is being made.</p>

<p class="noindent">both electrons going to the chloride ion, leaving an electron deficiency behind on the carbocation. In a bimolecular ionic reaction, one component, called the nucleophile, provides both electrons for a new bond, and the other, called the electrophile, receives them, as in the aldol reaction between the enolate of acetone and acetone itself. Ionic reactions are by far the most numerous of organic reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Radical reactions involve the correlated movement of single electrons. In a unimolecular reaction like the photolytic cleavage of chlorine, one electron moves to one atom and the other electron moves to the other. In bimolecular</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-8.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Fishhook arrows have the same functions of identifying simultaneously where the electrons come from and go to, and which bonds have been broken and which made. However, since each component provides one electron for each new bond, there is strictly no nucleophile and electrophile.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">reactions, a new bond is formed when one electron from one component pairs up with an electron from the other component, as with the removal of a hydrogen atom from toluene by a chlorine atom to give the benzyl radical and hydrogen chloride. This type of reaction is illustrated with fishhook arrows. A useful short cut when illustrating radical reactions is to draw only <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 The nature of pericyclic reactions</a>the alternate arrows, since each implies the existence of its partner in the making or breaking of a bond; but the full complement of fishhook arrows is used here, in order to emphasize the symmetrical separation in the breaking of the Cl&#x2013;Cl bond, and the equal contribution of electrons from each component in the making of the &#x0397;&#x2013;Cl bond, in contrast to ionic reactions, where there is a definite sense of direction to the movement of the electrons, and both electrons for the new bond are provided by the nucleophile.</p>
<p class="indent">Pericyclic reactions are the third distinct class. They have cyclic transition structures in which all bond-forming and bond-breaking takes place in concert, without the formation of an intermediate. The Diels-Alder reaction and the Alder &#x2018;ene&#x2019; reaction are venerable examples. The curly arrows can be drawn in either direction&#x2014;clockwise, as here, but equally well anticlockwise. They could even be drawn with fishhook arrows, and would still</p>

<p class="noindent2">The curly arrows in a pericyclic reaction share the capacity that they have in ionic reactions to show which bonds are breaking and where new bonds are forming, but they do not show the direction of electron flow.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">describe the same reaction. There is no absolute sense in which the electrons flow from one component to the other. Similarly, there is no absolute sense in which the hydrogen atom that moves from one carbon atom to the other in the ene reaction is a hydride shift, as seems to be implied by the curly arrows here, or a proton shift, as it would seem to be if the arrows were to have been drawn in the opposite direction. In other words, neither component can be associated with the supply of electrons to any of the new bonds. The curly arrows therefore have a somewhat different meaning from those used in ionic reactions.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The double headed arrow showing the relationship between canonical structures should only be used for resonance, and never for an equilibrium reaction.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In this they somewhat resemble the curly arrows used to show resonance in benzene, where the arrows show where to draw the new bonds, and which ones not to draw in the canonical structure; but in this case there is neither a sense of direction nor even an actual movement. The analogy between the resonance of benzene and the electron shift in the Diels-Alder reaction is not far fetched, but it is as well to be clear that one is a reaction, with starting materials and a product, and the other is not.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The four classes of pericyclic reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">All pericyclic reactions share the feature of having a cyclic transition structure, with a concerted movement of electrons simultaneously breaking bonds and making bonds. Within that overall category, it is convenient to divide pericyclic reactions into four main classes. These are <i>cycloadditions</i>, <i>electrocyclic reactions</i>, <i>sigmatropic rearrangements</i>, and <i>group transfer reactions</i>, each of which possesses special features not shared by the others, and some of which employ a terminology that cannot be used without confusion in the other classes. It is a good idea to be clear which class of <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 1 The nature of pericyclic reactions</a>reactions you are talking about, in order to avoid using inappropriate terminology. We shall begin by illustrating the identifying features of each of the classes in this chapter. Cycloadditions are the largest class. The range of reactions, the stereochemistry they show, the regioselectivity when unsymmetrical components are used, and the patterns of which cycloadditions occur and which do not&#x2014;these are all discussed in <a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. The theoretical basis for the patterns of reactivity is then explained in <a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. We return to the other three classes of pericyclic reaction in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapters 4-</a><a href="chapter6.xhtml">6</a>, armed, by then, with a theoretical framework with which to discuss them. For now we shall look at them all briefly, simply to establish what they are.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Cycloadditions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Cycloadditions are characterized by two components&#x2019; coming together to form two new <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds, at the ends of both components, joining them together to form a ring, with a reduction in the length of the conjugated system of orbitals in each component. Cycloadditions are by far tfye most abundant, featureful, and useful of all pericyclic reactions.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Diels-Alder reactions like the one illustrated opposite are cycloadditions mobilising six electrons. The dimerization of cyclopentadiene <b>1.1</b> is another Diels-Alder reaction, but also illustrates its inherent reversibility&#x2014;cracking the dimer <b>1.2</b> on heating is called a retro-cycloaddition or a cycloreversion.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0003-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions are another important family, with the impressive sequence of reactions involved when ozone reacts with an alkene as an example here. At &#x2013;78&#x00B0;, ozone adds <b>1.3</b> (arrows) to give the molozonide <b>1.4</b>. On warming, this undergoes a 1 ,3-dipolar cycloreversion (<b>1.4</b> arrows),</p>

<p class="noindent">and then another 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (<b>1.5</b> &#x002B; <b>1.6</b>, arrows) with the opposite regiochemistry, to give the ozonide <b>1.7</b>, which is normally the only product that can be isolated.</p>
<p class="indent">Cheletropic reactions are a special group of cycloadditions or cy clore versions in which two <i>&#x03C3;</i> bonds are made or broken to the <i>same</i> atom. <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 The nature of pericyclic reactions</a>Thus sulfur dioxide adds to butadiene to give an adduct <b>1.8</b> for which the sulfur has provided a lone pair to one of the <i>&#x03C3;</i> bonds and has received electrons in the formation of the other. The reaction is readily reversible on heating, and so sulfur dioxide can be used to protect dienes, and likewise the adduct <b>1.8</b> can be heated in the presence of dienophiles as a convenient (liquid) source of butadiene.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Electrocyclic reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Whereas cycloadditions are characterized by two components coming together to form two new <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds, electrocyclic reactions are invariably unimolecular. They are characterized by the creation of a ring from an open-chain conjugated system, with a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond forming across the ends of the conjugated system, and with the conjugated system becomes shorter by one p-orbital at each end.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Representative reactions in this class are the ring-opening of cyclobutene <b>1.9</b> on heating to give butadiene <b>1.10</b>, and the ring-closing of hexatriene <b>1.11</b> to give cyclohexadiene <b>1.12</b>. Notice that the reactions are inherently reversible, and that the directions they take are determined by thermodynamics. Most electrocyclic reactions are ring-closings, since a <i>&#x03C3;</i>- bond is created at the expense of a &#x03C0;-bond, but a few are ring-openings, because of ring strain.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Sigmatropic rearrangements</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">These reactions are often the most difficult to identify. They are unimolecular isomerizations, and formally involve overall the movement of a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond from one position to another, with a concomitant movement of the conjugated systems to accommodate the new bond and fill in the vacancy left behind. The oldest known example <b>1.13</b> &#x2192; <b>1.14</b> is the first step in the Claisen rearrangement, when a phenyl allyl ether is heated. What makes it a sigmatropic rearrangement is the movement of the single bond in <b>1.13</b>, drawn in bold, to its new position in <b>1.14</b>. It has effectively moved three atoms along the carbon chain (from C-l to C-3), and three atoms along the chain of the oxygen atom and two carbon atoms (O-1&#x2032; to C-3&#x2032;). This type of rearrangement is called a [3,3] shift, with the numbers identifying the number of atoms along the chain that each end of the bond has moved. The second step, forming the phenol <b>1.15</b>, is an ordinary ionic reaction&#x2014;the enolisation <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 1 The nature of pericyclic reactions</a>of a ketone. It is perhaps a timely reminder that ionic reactions can often precede or follow a pericyclic reaction, sometimes disguising the pericyclic event.</p>

<p class="indent">A quite different-looking rearrangement is the hydride shift <b>1.16</b> &#x2192; <b>1.17</b>, also long known from the chemistry of vitamin D. In this case, the end of the H-C bond attached to the hydrogen atom (&#x0397;-1&#x2032;) remains attached to the hydrogen, but the other end moves seven atoms (C-l to C-7) along the conjugated carbon chain. This reactions is therefore called a [1, 7] shift.</p>

Here, one end of the C-S bond moves from the sulfur (S-1&#x2032;) to the oxygen atom (O-2') and the other end moves from C-l to C-3. This is therefore called a [2,3] shift, the bond marked in bold moving two atoms at one end and three at the other.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are only a few reactions in this class, ene reactions like that on p. 2 being the most common. Stripped to their essence, ene reactions have the form <b>1.20</b> &#x002B; <b>1.21</b> &#x2192; <b>1.22</b>. They usually take place from left to right, since overall a &#x03C0;-bond is replaced by a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond, but they are, of course, reversible. They resemble [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangements, since a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond moves, and they also resemble cycloadditions like Diels-Alder reactions, with one of the &#x03C0;-bonds of the diene replaced by a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond.

Thus if the atom carrying the hydrogen is an oxygen atom and the atom to which it is moving is also an oxygen atom, it becomes an aldol reaction. Such reactions are usually carried out with acid- or base-catalysis, and are rarely pericyclic in nature; but one reaction that probably is pericyclic is the thermal decarboxylation of a &#x03B2;-keto acid <b>1.24</b>, which also demonstrates that the fundamental reaction can take place from right to left.</p>
