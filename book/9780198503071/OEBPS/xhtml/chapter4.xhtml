<p class="noindent">Electrocyclic reactions are characterized by the creation of a ring from an open-chain conjugated system, with a &#x03C3;-bond forming across the ends of a conjugated system, or, of course, the reverse of this reaction. Unfortunately, the word electrocyclic is sometimes used wrongly by the unwary when they really mean pericyclic. This mistake has come about because the word electrocyclic was introduced before there was any word to describe the whole class of pericyclic reactions, and some people have never caught up.</p>

The strained ring of the cyclobutene <b>4.2</b> makes this reaction take place in the ring-opening sense, while the hexatriene and octatetraene reactions are ring closures. It is not difficult to change the thermodynamic balance, for the <i>o</i>-quinodimethane <b>4.7</b> is higher in energy than the benzocyclobutene <b>4.8</b>, and the cycloheptatriene <b>4.9</b> is lower in energy than the bicycloheptadiene <b>4.10</b>.</p>

We shall see shortly that it is the stereochemistry that changes, depending upon whether the total number of electrons is (4n&#x002B;2) or (4n).</p>

<p class="indent">These reactions are rarely seen in their unadorned state, and the direction in which they go is nearly always determined by the substituents or heteroatoms stabilizing one side of the equilibrium or the other. But in all of them, the pathway between the open-chain and the cyclic isomers is the same, and the rules for stereochemistry are not dependent upon the direction in which the reaction actually takes place.</p>
<p class="indent">The equilibria between the allyl and the cyclopropyl cations and the corresponding equilibria of the anions, are not seen as such, but they are found in disguise. Thus the cationic reaction is seen when cyclopropyl halides are heated or treated with silver ions.

In the reverse direction, the cyclization of an allyl cation is seen as a step in the Favorskii rearrangement, where the enolate <b>4.26</b> of an &#x03B1;-haloketone cyclizes to a <a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a>cyclopropanone <b>4.27</b>, with the bromide leaving in concert with the electrocyclic reaction.

The final step of the Favorskii reaction, the ring opening to give the ester <b>4.28</b>, is not, of course, a pericyclic reaction.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Stereochemistry</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two possible stereochemistries for the ring-closing and ring-opening reactions. They are called <i>conrotatory</i> and <i>disrotatory</i>, and are illustrated for the general cases in <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. Looking at the ring-closing disrotatory reaction <b>4.32</b>, the two outer substituents R move upwards, so that the top lobes of the p-orbitals turn towards each other to form the new &#x03C3;- bond. The word disrotatory reflects the fact that the rotation about the terminal double bonds is taking place clockwise at one end but anticlockwise at the other. In the corresponding ring-opening <b>4.33</b>, there is similarly a clockwise and anticlockwise rotation as the &#x03C3;-bond breaks, and the two substituents that start off <i>cis</i> to each other move apart to become the outer substituents in the open-chain conjugated system. There is an equally probable disrotatory ring closure, in which both R groups fall, with the lower lobes of the p-orbitals forming the new &#x03C3;-bond, and there is a possible alternative disrotatory ring opening, in which both R groups move towards <a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a>each other, although whether this happens depends upon the size of the R groups and the extent to which they meet steric hindrance by moving inwards.</p>

<p class="indent">In contrast, in conrotatory ring-closing <b>4.34</b> &#x2192; <b>4.35</b>, one of the outer substituents and one of the inner substituents, both labelled R, rise to become <i>cis</i>, so that the bottom lobe of the p-orbital at one end forms a &#x03C3;-bond by overlap with the top lobe of the p-orbital at the other end. The rotations are now in the same sense, either both clockwise or both anticlockwise. It follows that the outer substituents become <i>trans</i> to each other on cyclization. In the ring-opening, <b>4.35</b> &#x2192; <b>4.34</b>, the two substituents that are <i>cis</i> to each other move in the same direction, one to an outer position and the other to an inner position by clockwise rotations, as drawn here. Alternatively, of course, they could both move by anticlockwise rotations. The rules for which stereochemistry is followed by which system are these:</p>

<p class="indent">These rules look difficult to absorb all at once, but a simplification makes them easy to learn&#x2014;all thermal reactions involving a total number of electrons that can be expressed in the form (4n&#x002B;2) are disrotatory, and the others, in which the total number of electrons can be expressed in the form 4n, are conrotatory. The rules for the corresponding reactions in the first electronically excited state are simply the opposite.</p>
<p class="indent">The only electrons that count in the open-chain component are those in the continuous linear array of p-orbitals. Substituents, whether at the ends of the conjugated system or anywhere else along its length, do not affect the stereochemistry, although they often affect the rate or the position of equilibrium, as we saw in the effect of the oxyanion substituent in the cyclization <b>4.26</b> &#x2192; <b>4.27</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent">As a first example of an electrocyclic reaction illustrating stereochemistry, let us take the pair of conrotatory cyclobutene openings, showing that the reactions are stereospecific.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0061-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The fact that the reactions take place in the direction of ring-opening is determined by thermodynamics, but the stereochemistry is most certainly not, for the cyclobutene <b>4.36</b> gives the thermodynamically more strained product <b>4.37</b> with one of the double bonds <i>cis.</i> Thermodynamics affects the stereochemistry only with the opening of the cyclobutene <b>4.38</b>, which shows a preference for one of the conrotatory modes, that giving the <i>trans,trans</i> diene <b>4.39</b>, where the rules could have led to the <i>cis,cis</i> diene equally well. This type of selectivity is called <i>torqueoselectivity.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Frontier orbital theory treats the &#x03C3;-bond and the &#x03C0;-bond in the ring opening as separate entities, but it does not matter which of them one takes for the HOMO and which for the LUMO&#x2014;they both work <b>4.40</b> and <b>4.41</b>. There is a problem with ring-closure, for it is not possible to have a HOMO and LUMO when the diene is treated as only one component. Although the choice of the HOMO appears arbitrary, it was the observation that the signs of its coefficients <b>4.42</b> matched the conrotatory stereochemistry for the cyclobutene-butadiene reaction (and that they also matched for the disrotatory cyclohexadiene-hexatriene reaction) that first led Woodward to turn to molecular orbital theory for an explanation of the starkly contrasting stereochemistry of these reactions. The outcome, independently developed by Hoffmann and by Abrahamson and Longuet-Higgins, was the correlation diagram which we have already seen applied to cycloaddition reactions&#x2014;they were in fact first developed for these electrocyclic reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">We shall look only at the correlation diagram for cyclobutene opening (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>). Conrotatory cyclobutene opening preserves an axis of symmetry running through the centres of both the &#x03C3;- and the &#x03C0;-bond. Taking the &#x03C0;- bonding orbital <b>4.43</b> as an example, note how the symmetry classification works: the filled lobe is reflected (dashed line) through the axis (the dot) by an unfilled lobe, making it antisymmetric, whereas it would be symmetric with respect to the plane of symmetry maintained in a disrotatory opening. If you try a correlation diagram with a plane of symmetry, you will find that the orbitals of the ground state in the starting material do not correlate with the orbitals of the ground state in the product, and disrotatory opening meets the same high symmetry-imposed barrier as a [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the last correlation diagram we shall see&#x2014;from now on we shall accept that they explain pericyclic stereochemistry convincingly, and shall simply use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules that developed from them. Cyclobutene opening uses 4 electrons, a 4n number, which means that one antarafacial component is needed. Using the interconversion of the cyclobutene <b>4.36</b> and the butadiene <b>4.37</b> as an example, the forward reaction is essentially treated as the cycloaddition of the &#x03C3;-bond to the &#x03C0;-bond, in which either the &#x03C3;- or the &#x03C0;-bond can take up the role of antarafacial component, <b>4.44</b> or <b>4.45</b>, and still be the same reaction. It is called [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>&#x03B1;</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] in one and [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] in the other, emphasizing the fact that these descriptions apply to the drawings, and do not uniquely describe the reaction. In the backwards direction <b>4.46</b>, all that is needed is to treat the diene as the one antarafacial component, with the top lobe on the right tilting over as the bottom lobe on the left tilts up to meet it in a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>a</sub>] reaction. Notice how the dashed lines correspond to the developing overlap that tilts the substituents down and to the right in <b>4.44</b> and <b>4.45</b>, and up and to the left in <b>4.46</b>, leading to the correct isomer in each direction by a conrotatory movement.</p>

The former opens with the two methyl groups moving outwards, in what must be the thermodynamically preferred direction, but the latter evidently eschews thermodynamics, and opens to give the U-shaped ion.

It appears that thermodynamics is less important than the strong torqueoselectivity combined with orbital symmetry.</p>

<p class="indent">A simple explanation for this selectivity is to think of the bond between C-2 and C-3 in the chloride <b>4.65</b> bending downwards, moving its electrons in behind C-l, from which the chloride ion is leaving, as though they were carrying out an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction on it. It follows that, if the bond is moving downwards the substituents must be moving upwards and towards each other to give the U-shaped allyl cation <b>4.68</b>. To see how this conforms to the Woodward-Hoffmann rule, one simply counts the breaking C&#x2013;Cl bond, with the electron pair moving towards the chlorine, as an empty p-orbital <b>4.70</b>. The disrotatory reaction is then the allowed combination [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>0<sub>s</sub>], suprafacial on both components. The small sum that has accompanied all the drawings so far will be left out from now on&#x2014;readers can check for themselves that they all fit the rule.</p>

<p class="indent">The same reaction in the opposite direction&#x2014;the ring closure of an allyl cation&#x2014;is also known. The remarkable formation of the thermodynamically less favoured <i>cis</i>-di-t-butylcyclopropanone <b>4.72</b> from the zwitterion <b>4.71</b>, which probably has the W configuration, is evidence of its being disrotatory.</p>

<p class="indent">This result contrasts nicely with a similar system with two more electrons. The heterocycle <b>4.73</b> loses nitrogen to give the thiocarbonyl ylid <b>4.74</b>, which has the sickle-shaped configuration, because the 1,3-dipolar cycloreversion is the reverse of a suprafacial addition. This ylid, with 4 electrons in the conjugated system, undergoes conrotatory cyclization to give the di-t-butylthietan <b>4.75</b>, which again has the two large groups <i>cis</i> to each other. In the Woodward-Hoffmann scheme <b>4.76</b> the conrotatory closure will be a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>a</sub>] reaction.</p>

The proof of the <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a>stereochemistry of the intermediates <b>4.78</b> and <b>4.80</b> comes from the subsequent, suprafacial cycloaddition, drawn on p. 19, that traps the ylids before they lose their W- and sickle-shaped configurations.

<p class="indent">A pentadienyl cation has the same number of &#x03C0;-electrons as the allyl anion, and its electrocyclic reactions will be conrotatory. In terms of the Woodward-Hoffmann rule, it can be drawn <b>4.82</b> as an allowed [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>a</sub>] process. It has been shown to be fully stereospecific, with the stereoisomeric pentadienyl cations <b>4.83</b> and <b>4.85</b> giving the stereoisomeric cyclopentenyl cations <b>4.84</b> and <b>4.86</b> in conrotatory reactions, followed in their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this reaction is that a bond has formed between C-l and C-5, both of which are positively charged. Any attempt to think of this reaction as the combination of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic carbon would not make proper sense, yet the reaction occurs easily. Pericyclic reactions really are a distinctly different class of reactions from ionic and radical reactions. Since this reaction is also 5<i>-endo-trig</i> at both ends, it would appear to be also deeply forbidden by Baldwin&#x2019;s rules&#x2014;which evidently do not apply with any great force to electrocyclic reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">The synthetically most useful reaction of this type is the Nazarov cyclization, in which a cross-conjugated dienone like <b>4.89</b> forms a cyclopentenone <b>4.92</b> when treated with acid, in this case a Lewis acid.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0066-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Coordination to the ketone makes it more of a carbocation, and hence the conjugated system more of a pentadienyl cation <b>4.90</b>. The cyclization takes place to give the cyclopentenyl cation <b>4.91</b>, which loses the silyl group and picks up a proton to give the ketone <b>4.92</b>. The relative stereochemistry at C-l and C-5 has the two hydrogen atoms <i>trans</i>, proving that the cyclization has <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a>been conrotatory. The silyl group is not necessary for this reaction, but in its absence the proton is lost mainly from C-l, losing the stereochemical information.</p>
<p class="indent">A remarkable feature of this reaction is that the side of the ring on which the silyl group is placed (the upper surface here) determines which of the two equally allowed conrotatory ring closures actually takes place, in other words its torqueoselectivity. If the ketone <b>4.89</b> is enantiomerically enriched, the ketone <b>4.92</b> is formed enantiomerically enriched to the same extent, and in the sense which corresponds to the specific anticlockwise conrotatory movement <b>4.93</b>, with the lower lobe on C-1 turning upwards, presumably because it is <i>anti</i> to the silyl group, which is a large donor substituent.</p>

<p class="indent">Pentadienyl anions ought to close in a disrotatory fashion, since they can be drawn as an allowed [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>6<sub>s</sub>] processes <b>4.94</b>. The anion <b>4.96</b> generated from hydrobenzamide <b>4.95</b> gives amarine <b>4.97</b>, in which the two phenyl groups are <i>cis.</i> This reaction, first observed in 1844, is probably the oldest known pericyclic reaction (the composer Borodin published a paper about it). The fact that it gives the thermodynamically less favoured product, with the two large substituents <i>cis</i>, is good evidence that it must have been disrotatory, although the full stereospecificity has not been proved. Further circumstantial evidence for rule-obeying behaviour in these reactions comes from the observation that irradiation of the anion <b>4.96</b> gives the <i>trans</i> isomer of <b>4.97</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">A ring-opening has also been seen, when the relief of strain in a cyclopropane makes it thermodynamically favourable&#x2014;the cyclopentenyl anion <b>4.100</b> opens to the pentadienyl anion <b>4.101</b>.

<p class="noindent">As with cycloadditions, photochemical reactions that look pericyclic may not always be pericyclic, but several do seem to obey the rules. The 4-electron photochemical reaction <b>4.102</b> &#x2192; <b>4.103</b> is disrotatory and the 6-electron reaction <b>4.104</b> &#x2192; <b>4.105</b> is conrotatory, and in both cases the reaction is counter-thermodynamic.<a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a></p>

<p class="indent">When the products of these two reactions are heated, they give back isomers of the starting materials, the <i>trans,cis</i> diene <b>4.106</b> in place of <b>4.102</b>, and the <i>trans</i>-dimethylcyclohexadiene <b>4.107</b> in place of <b>4.104</b>. In more constrained systems, one of the consequences of the photochemical and thermal rules&#x2019; being opposite is that a photochemical reaction can easily lead to a product thermodynamically much higher in energy than the starting material, but nevertheless thermally stable. The photochemical reactions <b>4.108</b> &#x2192; <b>4.109</b> and <b>4.110</b> &#x2192; <b>4.111</b> illustrate this point. The bicyclic ketone <b>4.109</b> is not only strained, but has also lost both the partial aromaticity of the tropone <b>4.108</b> and the conjugation between the methoxy group and the ketone. The dihydroanthracene <b>4.111</b> has lost the aromaticity of both benzene rings present in <i>cis</i>-stilbene <b>4.110</b>. The bicyclic ketone <b>4.109</b> and the dihydroanthracene <b>4.111</b> meet high symmetry-imposed kinetic barriers in trying to return thermally to their precursors, and the rule-obeying processes are impossible because they would produce <i>trans</i> double bonds in the rings of the starting materials.</p>

<p class="indent">The restraints imposed by rings are especially well demonstrated by some of the oldest known electrocyclic reactions (<a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>), puzzling in their day, but now beautiful illustrations of the rules of electrocyclic reactions. The full structure is ergosterol <b>4.112</b>, abbreviated to <b>4.113</b> in <a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, and the remaining structures share the same core. We saw the product <b>4.114</b> from the photochemical conrotatory opening of ergosterol as <b>1.17</b> in <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, and we shall see its analogue <b>5.9</b> in <a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. It is in photochemical equilibrium with its starting material, but it is also in photochemical equilibrium with the product <b>4.115</b> of the alternative conrotatory ring closure. Thermally, however, it gives a mixture of the other two cyclohexadienes <b>4.116</b> and <b>4.117</b> in disrotatory cyclizations. When these compounds, with the methyl and hydrogen groups on C-10 and C-9 <i>cis</i> to each other, are irradiated, the allowed conrotatory opening would put a <i>trans</i> double bond either into ring A or into ring C. To avoid this calamity, a different allowed photochemical reaction takes place, namely the disrotatory closures to the cyclobutenes <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Chapter 4 Electrocyclic reactions</a><b>4.118</b> and <b>4.119</b>. These compounds in turn are thermally comparatively stable, because the allowed thermal ring-openings would have to put a <i>trans</i> double bond into ring B.</p>
