<p class="noindent">Pericyclic [1, n] sigmatropic rearrangements are frequently shifts of hydrogen atoms, with examples known for n &#x003D; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and longer, some of which have a total of (4n&#x002B;2) electrons involved and some (4n). As with electrocyclic reactions, the stereochemistry changes from one series to the other. If the hydrogen leaves one surface of the conjugated system, and arrives at the other end on the same surface, the reaction is described as suprafacial, and this is the allowed pathway when the total number of electrons is (4n&#x002B;2). Alternatively, if it leaves one surface and arrives on the opposite surface, it is called antarafacial, and this is the allowed pathway when the total number of electrons is (4n). This is apt to be confusing, because these reactions may or may not be described in Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann terms as having suprafacial or antarafacial <i>components</i>, so the words do not mean exactly the same as they did before. The connection, however, will become clear with use.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The label [1,n] comes from the symbols in bold. The n is obvious&#x2014; the migrating bond moves from C-1 to C-n along the conjugated system&#x2014;but the 1 comes from the fact that the bond remains attached to the same atom, without migrating along any conjugated system in the R group; it does not come from the fact that the bond starts off from C-1, which is C-1 by definition.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Take the most common of all these reactions, the [1,5] hydrogen shift, which illustrates a suprafacial shift, in which the hydrogen leaves the upper surface at C-l, and arrives on the upper surface at C-5. This can be drawn <b>5.1</b> as a [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>&#x03B4;</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>s</sub>] process, rather as though it were a cycloaddition of the</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#x03C3;-bond to the diene, and the connection between the two usages of the word suprafacial is evident. On the other hand, it could equally well have been drawn <b>5.2</b> as a [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>a</sub> &#x002B; <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>a</sub>] process; yet it is still the same reaction. It is <i>structurally</i> a suprafacial shift, but the developing overlap that happens to be <i>illustrated</i> in <b>5.2</b> has been described, perfectly correctly, as antarafacial on <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>both components. In both cases, of course, the reaction is allowed by the Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rule for thermal reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">In a [1,7] hydrogen shift, the allowed pathway is an antarafacial shift, in which the hydrogen atom leaves the upper surface at C-l, and arrives on the lower surface at C-7. This can be drawn <b>5.3</b> as a [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>6<sub>a</sub>] process or <b>5.4</b> as a [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>6<sub>s</sub>] process. This time it is <i>structurally</i> an antarafacial shift, but the developing overlap that happens to be <i>illustrated</i> can be described with one suprafacial and one antarafacial component either way round. It is helpful to draw as many suprafacial components as possible, i.e. preferring <b>5.1</b> to <b>5.2</b>, since the structurally suprafacial reaction is then also described with suprafacial overlap developing. Similarly it is helpful to draw <b>5.3</b> rather than <b>5.4</b>, since that makes the antarafacial component the triene system, from one side of which to the other the antarafacial shift of the hydrogen is taking place.</p>
<p class="indent">The stereochemistry has been proved to follow the allowed pathways. Heating the diene <b>5.5</b> induces a suprafacial hydrogen shift to give the diene <b>5.6</b>, a suprafacial deuterium shift then converts this diene into the diene <b>5.7</b>, and another suprafacial deuterium shift converts it into a fourth isomer <b>5.8</b>. The major components at equilibrium are the isomers <b>5.6</b>, with an <i>E</i> trisubstituted double bond and <i>S</i> at the stereogenic centre, and <b>5.8</b>, with a Z trisubstituted double bond and <i>R</i> at the stereogenic centre. Neither of the other possible isomers is evident, showing that no [1,5] antarafacial shifts had occurred.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0072-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The antarafacial nature of the [1,7] shift was first inferred from the observation that they were known only in open-chain systems like that shown in <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> as <b>1.16</b> &#x2192; <b>1.17</b>. More recently it has been proved by equilibrating the triene <b>5.10</b> with the two products of [1,7] shifts, <b>5.9</b> and <b>5.11</b>, the former from antarafacial shift of the hydrogen atom and the latter from antarafacial shift of the deuterium. There is no trace of either of the alternative isomers in which hydrogen has shifted to the top surface or deuterium to the bottom of C-7 (C-10 in steroid numbering).</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most common [1,5] hydrogen shifts takes place in cyclopentadienes, where it is constrained to be suprafacial. Because the atoms C-1 and C-5 are held close together by a &#x03C3;-bond, the reactions <b>5.12</b> &#x2192; <b>5.13</b> &#x2192; <b>5.14</b> take place even at room temperature. It is important to recognize <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>that mechanistically this is a [1,5] and not a [1,2] shift. The hydrogen atom does indeed move to the adjacent atom, so that it is structurally a 1,2-shift, but the rearrangement is possible only because the migrating &#x03C3;-bond is conjugated through the &#x03C0;-system to C-5. The presence of the &#x03C3;-bond between C-1 and C-5 is not essential&#x2014;it merely serves to bring the reaction centres close together, speeding up the reaction, but not changing its fundamental nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The forbiddenness of a suprafacial [1,7] shift is shown by the absence of the same type of reaction in cycloheptatrienes <b>5.15</b>. Heating these compounds, when a substituent is present to reveal the presence of a reaction, interconverts all the mono-substituted isomers, just as it did with the</p>
<figure class="fig" style="margin-left:0em;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/f0073-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">cyclopentadienes, but the order in which the isomers appear shows that the pathway is a series of allowed suprafacial [1,5] shifts <b>5.15</b> &#x2192; <b>5.16</b> &#x2192; <b>5.17</b> &#x2192; <b>5.18</b>. Since the hydrogen atom is not held close to C-5, these reactions are noticeably slower than the [1,5] shifts in cyclopentadienes. Photochemically, [1,5] hydrogen shifts occur only in open-chain systems, where they can be antarafacial. Photochemical [1,7] shifts can be suprafacial, and this is the preferred path in cycloheptatrienes, with the isomer <b>5.15</b> giving <b>5.17</b> as the first product in the series, followed by <b>5.18</b> and <b>5.16</b>, in contrast to the [1,5] suprafacial thermal reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Photochemically, a [1,3] suprafacial shift of hydrogen is allowed, and has been observed with several 1,3-dienes rearranging to the unconjugated 1,4- <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>dienes on irradiation, but the possibility of finding a thermal [1,3] shift of hydrogen is remote. It is clear from the orbitals that the suprafacial shift <b>5.19</b> is forbidden. In principle, an antarafacial shift is thermally allowed <b>5.20</b>, but it is exceedingly unlikely ever to be found, because of the difficulty of maintaining &#x03C0;-overlap between C-1 and C-2 at the same time as the hydrogen atom reaches round to bond to the lower surface of C-3.</p>

<p class="indent">With elements other than hydrogen, two new possibilities arise. First, metals and halogens show a capacity to undergo sigmatropic rearrangements, but the mechanism with metals and halogens, although it may be pericyclic in some cases, is probably more often than not ionic, with ionization and recapture as the pathway by which the halogen or metal shifts from one end of a conjugated system to the other. Secondly and more interestingly, especially with carbon, there is the possibility of sigmatropic shift with inversion of configuration in the migrating group. To see what this means, let us begin with the [1,3] shift of a carbon atom.</p>

<p class="indent">As with the [1,3] shift of a hydrogen atom <b>5.20</b>, the antarafacial shift of carbon <b>5.21</b> is symmetry-allowed, with the double bond taking up the role of antarafacial component; but it is just as unreasonable. The new possibility is the suprafacial shift <b>5.22</b> with inversion of configuration on carbon, with the &#x03C3;-bond taking up the role of antarafacial component. This was impossible with a hydrogen atom, which has only an s orbital. This possibility, however, remains fairly remote, since the developing overlap shown in <b>5.22</b> by the long dashed line is not very plausible. Nevertheless, it appears to be the pathway taken in the [1,3] suprafacial shift <b>5.23</b> of a silyl group at 500&#x00B0;, with the long Si&#x2013;C bonds making it that bit more reasonable. It might also be the pathway, or at least an influence on the pathway, followed in a rather constrained thermal [1,3] shift of a carbon group <b>5.24</b> &#x2192; <b>5.25</b>. The deuterium atom, placed as a stereochemical marker, changes from being <i>trans</i> to the acetoxy group in the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptene <b>5.24</b> to being <i>cis</i> to it in</p>

<p class="noindent">the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene <b>5.25</b>, showing that a remarkable inversion of configuration had taken place, in conformity to the rules. A full discussion of whether this reaction really is pericyclic is beyond the scope of this book, but we can say that, given the difficulties of achieving effective overlap in [1,3] shifts using either the &#x03C3;-bond or the &#x03C0;-bond as an antarafacial component, [1,3] migration of carbon groups with inversion of configuration is likely to be very rare. Photochemically, of course, a suprafacial shift with retention of configuration in the migrating group is allowed, and there are many examples of this reaction, such as the reversible 1,3 shift in verbenone <b>5.26</b>, but not all such reactions can be assumed to be pericyclic.</p>
<p class="indent">However, inversion of configuration is not unknown even for carbon&#x2014;all that is needed is a longer conjugated system to make it easier for a reasonable <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>transition structure to be reached. A [1,5] suprafacial shift will be allowed with retention of configuration, but a [1,7] suprafacial shift will only be allowed if there is inversion of configuration <b>5.27</b>. For example, the front C&#x2013;C bond of the cyclopropane in the bicyclo[6.1.0]nonatriene <b>5.28</b> migrates to C<i>-</i>7 to give the C&#x2013;C bond (starred) at the rear in the isomeric bicyclo[6.1.0]nonatriene <b>5.29</b>. The two substituents on the migrating carbon remain with the cyano group <i>exo</i> in the bicyclic system and the methyl group <i>endo.</i> This can be easily misunderstood as corresponding to retention of configuration, but the new bond in the product (starred) is on the back side of the migrating carbon atom, whereas the bond that broke was on the front side. This is therefore inversion as far as the migrating atom is concerned. Counter-intuitively, perhaps, it is retention of configuration that would cause the two substituents to change places.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not necessary to learn a table like this&#x2014;it can be summarized with the simplified rule for thermal reactions that, if the total number of electrons <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>is (4n&#x002B;2), a suprafacial shift with retention of configuration in the migrating centre is symmetry-allowed&#x2014;as is, formally (but impossible in practice) an antarafacial shift with inversion of configuration. Reactions with (4n) electrons are the opposite, and photochemical reactions follow the reverse of the thermal rule. It is wise always to check any case you may come across by using the concise Woodward-Hoffmann rules on pp. 40 and 44, which cover everything, including longer conjugated systems than those listed here.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a> shows some ionic conjugated systems. The most simple and the best known is the [1,2] shift in cations <b>5.30</b>. When the migration terminus, the migration origin, and the migrating group are all carbon atoms, it is known as a Wagner&#x2013;Meerwein rearrangement; when the migration terminus is a nitrogen atom it is a Curtius, Beckmann, or Lossen rearrangement; and when it is oxygen its most characteristic manifestation is the Baeyer&#x2013;Villiger reaction. All of these reactions are well known to take place with retention of</p>

<p class="noindent">configuration in the migrating group, and we can now see that a [1,2] sigmatropic rearrangement with retention in the migrating group <b>5.31</b> is a symmetry-allowed [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>0<sub>s</sub>] process. In contrast, [1,2] shifts in anions <b>5.32</b> are rare, and we can now see that that is because the straightforward looking [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub> &#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] process <b>5.33</b> is symmetry-forbidden. They would have to follow unattainable [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub> &#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] or [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] geometries to be symmetry-allowed.</p>
<p class="indent">However, [1,2] shifts in anions, although rare, are known, and for some time they presented a puzzle. A stepwise ionic reaction did not seem reasonable, because the separated ions were not well enough stabilized. It is</p>

<p class="noindent">now clear that most such reactions, typified by the 1,2-Stevens rearrangement <b>5.34</b> &#x2192; <b>5.36</b>, do take place stepwise, but by <i>homolytic</i> cleavage <b>5.34</b> &#x2192; <b>5.35</b> and recombination <b>5.35</b> &#x2192; <b>5.36</b>.<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a></p>

This comparison was thoughtfully arranged for the distance the hydrogen atom has to move to be approximately the same in the two cases, making it more plausible that the rules make the crucial difference.</p>

<p class="indent">Sigmatropic rearrangements in anions are more rare, but the isomerization of the conjugated anion <b>5.42</b> to the conjugated anion <b>5.45</b> probably takes place by a [1,6] shift <b>5.43</b> &#x2192; <b>5.44</b>. It is known to be intramolecular, but the stereochemistry (antarafacial is allowed) could not be checked. In order for the reaction to take place at all, it is necessary for the stereochemistry within <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>the conjugated system to change to the all-<i>Z</i> <b>5.43</b>, which can easily take place by the lithium counterion&#x2019;s reversibly forming a &#x03C3;-bond to remove the contiguous overlap present in the anion itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the stereochemistry could not be seen in the last example, it is evident in the migration of the hydrogen atom in the zwitterion intermediate <b>5.46</b>, which is symmetry-allowed as a suprafacial [1,4] shift.

This rearrangement also serves to show how different the starting material <b>5.59</b> and the product <b>5.61</b> can look. It is often difficult to work out what the product of a Cope rearrangement will look like in cyclic systems. A helpful device is to draw the product first <b>5.60</b>, putting in only the changes dictated by the curly arrows&#x2014;it is then easier to see how the reaction (<b>5.59</b> arrows) gives the product <b>5.61</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">A Cope rearrangement leading to a <i>para</i>-substituted phenol <b>5.64</b> takes place when aromatization is not possible after the Claisen step <b>5.62</b> &#x2192; <b>5.63</b>. A longer conjugated system <b>5.65</b> allows a more direct delivery to the <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a><i>para</i> position, giving the phenol <b>5.67</b> as the major product along with some of the product of a normal Claisen rearrangement. The terminal methyl group in <b>5.62</b> acts as a label, showing that a somersault of two [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangements is taking place, and not a direct [3,5] reaction. Similarly, the terminal methyl group in <b>5.65</b> shows that this is a [5,5] rearrangement <b>5.65</b> &#x2192; <b>5.66</b> rather than two successive [3,3] rearrangements. The [5,5] rearrangement is allowed if it is all-suprafacial, a geometry <b>5.68</b> that is not difficult to achieve. The <i>para</i>-benzidine rearrangement is also a [5,5] process.</p>

<p class="indent">[2,3]-Sigmatropic rearrangements <b>5.71</b>, like the Mislow racemization of sulfoxides <b>1.18</b> on p. 5, have many variants, depending upon which atoms are present in the chain of five atoms. There is an all-carbon example, but most have Y &#x003D; O, and there are well known families of reactions with X &#x003D; O, N and S. With X &#x003D; O and Y &#x003D; C, it is called a [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement, as in the reaction of the bisallylic ether <b>5.72</b> with strong base. The base <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>selectively deprotonates the ally lie ether <b>5.72</b> at the less substituted of the allyl carbons next to the oxygen, and the anion <b>5.73</b>, rearranges to give largely the alcohol <b>5.74</b> with the two substituents <i>anti</i> on the carbon chain.</p>
<figure class="imgc">

<p class="indent">This rearrangement obeys the Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rule, illustrated as an allowed [<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C9;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] reaction <b>5.75</b>. The likely transition structure has an envelope conformation, allowing the &#x03C3;-overlap to develop properly head on and the &#x03C0;-overlap sideways on. One of the dashed lines in <b>5.75</b>, the one between the oxygen atom and the carbanion centre, is a bit different from those we have seen before&#x2014;it identifies the carbanion centre as conjugated to the &#x03C3;-bond in the starting material. This means that all the orbitals are conjugated in the cyclic transition structure, making the reaction pericyclic, even though the curly arrows in <b>5.71</b> and <b>5.73</b> do not appear to complete a circle.</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly, with X &#x003D; N or S, the quaternary ammonium salt <b>5.76</b> is deprotonated adjacent to the ester group to give the ammonium ylid <b>5.77</b>, which rearranges with ring expansion to give a 9-membered ring with a <i>trans</i> double bond <b>5.78</b>. Intramolecular alkylation of the sulfide <b>5.79</b> followed by deprotonation gives a sulfonium ylid <b>5.80</b>, which rearranges with ring expansion to give a cyclodecanone with a sulfide bridge <b>5.81</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">The transition structure <b>5.75</b> also shows some of the constraints that make these reactions useful methods for controlling stereochemistry. Although not true of every [2.3]-Wittig rearrangement, the preferred envelope conformation places the isopropyl group in a pseudo-equatorial position, and the anion-stabilizing vinyl group <i>exo</i>, away from the fold in the envelope. The result <b>5.74</b> is a <i>trans</i> double bond with the methyl and hydroxyl groups <i>anti</i> on the carbon backbone, but if the double bond had been <i>cis,</i> it would <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a>have led to the methyl and hydroxyl groups being <i>syn,</i> with both groups behind the chain. The reaction of the ammonium ylid <b>5.77</b> is already a slightly different case, because the anion-stabilizing group is <i>endo</i> in the transition structure, but it then appears in a pseudo-equatorial position in the product <b>5.78</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Mislow&#x2019;s [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxides is more than a mechanistic curiosity, because the intermediate sulfenate <b>5.83</b> can be intercepted by a suitably thiophilic reagent, converting an enantiomerically enriched sulfoxide <b>5.82</b> into a comparably enriched rearranged allyl alcohol <b>5.84</b>, with suprafacial shift <b>5.85</b> of the functionality.</p>

<p class="indent">There are many variants on these reactions, including the [3,4] shift in the cation <b>5.87</b> created by protonating the ketone <b>5.86</b>. The allylic shift is proved by labelling the carbon marked with an asterisk using deuterium and showing that the deuterium in the product <b>5.88</b> is at the benzylic position.</p>
<figure class="imgc">

<p class="indent">There are also vinylogues of the [2,3] rearrangement like the [4,5] shift in the ammonium ylid <b>5.90</b>. This intermediate had available a [2,3] shift just</p>

<p class="noindent">like that in the ylid <b>5.75</b>; but the sigmatropic shift takes place predominantly through the longer system. The other possibilities, a [2,5] or a [3,4] shift, are forbidden to be suprafacial on both components. A transition structure with one antarafacial component might be accessible, given the length of the conjugated systems, but it does not compete with the all-suprafacial pathway.<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Chapter 5 Sigmatropic rearrangements</a></p>
<p class="indent">It is frequent but not invariable that where a longer conjugated system has a geometrically accessible and symmetry-allowed transition structure like that in <b>5.90</b>, the longer system is used. Thus, the [8&#x002B;2] and [6&#x002B;4] cycloadditions on pp. 15 &#x0026; 16, and the [14&#x002B;2] cycloaddition on p. 44 take place rather than perfectly reasonable Diels Alder reactions, and the 8-electron electrocyclic reactions of <b>4.51</b> and <b>4.54</b> takes place rather than disrotatory hexatriene-to-cyclohexadiene reactions. This kind of selectivity is called periselectivity.</p>
