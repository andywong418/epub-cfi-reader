<h2 class="h2"><b>3.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Evidence for the concertedness of bond making and breaking</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The characteristic feature of all pericyclic reactions is the concertedness of all the bond making and bond breaking, and hence the absence of any intermediates. Naturally, organic chemists have worked hard, and devised many ingenious experiments, to prove that this is true, concentrating especially on the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction. The following is an oversimplified description of some of the most telling experiments.</p>
<p class="indent">The Arrhenius parameters for Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions show that there is an exceptionally high negative entropy of activation, typically in the range &#x2013;150 to &#x2013;200 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, with a low enthalpy of activation reflecting the exothermic nature of the reaction. Bimolecular reactions inherently have high negative entropies of activation, but this is exceptionally high. The extra organization necessary for the two components to approach favourably aligned for both bonds to form at the same time accounts for the high value in cycloadditions. The compact transition structure is also in agreement with the negative volumes of activation measured by carrying out the reaction under pressure.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Arrhenius parameters</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The rates of Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions are little affected by the polarity of the solvent. If a zwitterionic intermediate were involved, the intermediate would be more polar than either of the starting materials, and polar solvents would solvate it more thoroughly. Typically, a large change of solvent dipole moment, from 2.3 to 39, causes an increase in rate by a factor of only 10. In contrast, stepwise ionic cycloadditions take place with increases in rate of several orders of magnitude in polar solvents. This single piece of evidence rules out stepwise ionic pathways for most Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, and the only stepwise mechanism left is that involving a diradical.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Deuterium substitution on the four carbon atoms changing from trigonal to tetrahedral as the reaction proceeds, gives rise to inverse secondary kinetic isotope effects, small but measurable, both for the diene and the dienophile <b>3.1</b>. If both bonds are forming at the same time, the isotope effect when both ends are deuterated is geometrically related to the isotope effects at each end. If the bonds are being formed one at a time, the isotope effects are arithmetically related. It is a close call, but the experimental results, both for cycloadditions and for cycloreversions, suggest that they are concerted.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Another way of testing how one end of the dienophile affects the other end is to load up the dienophile with up to four electron-withdrawing groups and <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>see how each additional group affects the rate. A stepwise reaction for tetracyanoethylene ought not to take place much more than statistically faster than with 1,1-dicyanoacrylate, but a concerted reaction ought to take place much faster. Furthermore the relative rates can be compared with the rate of nucleophilic attack on the dienophile as a model for a stepwise reaction. Experiments based on this approach support a concerted mechanism.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">High level molecular orbital calculations have been carried out, with ever increasing levels of sophistication. Most, but not quite all, suggest that the concerted pericyclic pathway gives the lowest energy transition structure. Calculations even more strongly support the evidence for concertedness from the isotope effect studies. A diradicai intermediate would have an ally lie radical at one end of the diene and the configuration would not have changed from trigonal to tetrahedral. The two isotope effects, at the end undergoing bonding and at the end carrying the odd electron, should therefore be very different. Since they are not different, but more than arithmetically reinforce each other, the reaction is most probably concerted.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Finally the single most impressive piece of evidence comes from the very fact that pericyclic reactions obey the rules that we have seen already in the last chapter, and are about to expand upon. These rules only apply if the reactions are concerted. To have a few reactions accidentally obeying the rules would be reasonable, but to have a very large number of reactions seemingly falling over themselves to obey strict stereochemical rules, sometimes in the most improbable circumstances, is overwhelmingly strong evidence about the general picture. Of course, no single reaction can be proved to be pericyclic just because it obeys the rules&#x2014;obedience to the rules is merely a necessary condition for a reaction to be accepted as pericyclic. In the case of cycloadditions, the suprafacial nature of the reaction on both components in a very high proportion of reactions at least says that the second bond, if it is not formed at the same time as the first, is formed very quickly after the first, before any rotations about single bonds can take place. It seems more than likely that most reactions thought to be pericyclic actually are.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The aromatic transition state</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The first and the most simple is the observation that the common thermally induced reactions have transition structures involving a total of (4n&#x002B;2) electrons. We saw in the last chapter that [4&#x002B;2], [8&#x002B;2], and [6&#x002B;4] thermal cycloadditions are common, and that [2&#x002B;2], [4&#x002B;4], and [6&#x002B;6] cycloadditions are almost only found in photochemically induced reactions. The total number of electrons in the former group are (4n&#x002B;2) numbers, analogous to the number of electrons in aromatic rings.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Aromatic transition states are stabilized just as aromatic rings are:</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/f0032-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A problem with this explanation is that it is a bit more difficult to explain those pericyclic reactions that we shall come to in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, which smoothly take place in spite of their having a total of 4n electrons. We shall find that these all show stereochemistry involving an antarafacial component. It is possible to include this feature in the aromatic transition state model&#x2014;if the <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>p-orbitals that make up a cyclic conjugated system have a single twist, like a M&#x00F6;bius strip, then the appropriate number of electrons for an aromatic system becomes 4n rather than (4n&#x002B;2). An antarafacial component in a transition structure is equivalent to a M&#x00F6;bius conjugated system (see <b>2.85</b> on p. 18 for a hypothetical example, and <b>2.184</b> on p. 29 for a real example).</p>
<p class="indent">Although wonderfully simple, this explanation is not very revealing.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.3">
<h2 class="h2"><b>3.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Frontier orbitals</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The easiest explanation is based on the frontier orbitals&#x2014;the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one component and the lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO) of the other. These orbitals are the closest in energy and make a disproportionate contribution to lowering the transition state energy as they interact. Thus if we compare a [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition <b>3.2</b> with a [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition <b>3.3</b> and <b>3.4</b>, we see that the former has frontier</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0033-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">orbitals that do not match in sign at both ends, whereas the latter do, whichever way round, <b>3.3</b> or <b>3.4</b>, we take the frontier orbitals. The signs of the atomic wave functions are given by the shading in the lobes of the p-orbitals throughout this book, to avoid any confusion with charge. In the [2&#x002B;2] reaction <b>3.2</b>, the lobes on C-1 and C-1&#x2032; are opposite in sign and represent a repulsion&#x2014;an antibonding interaction. There is no barrier to formation of the bond between C-2 and C-2', making stepwise reactions possible; the barrier is only there if both bonds are trying to form at the same time. The [4&#x002B;4] and [6&#x002B;6] cycloadditions have the same problem, and the [8&#x002B;2] and [6&#x002B;4] do not. Try it for yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">If we look again at the frontier orbitals for the [2&#x002B;2] reaction, we see that there is another possibility&#x2014;the upper lobe on C-1' might reach round to the upper lobe on C-1 <b>3.5</b>. This would clearly be a bonding interaction, and would allow concerted formation of both bonds. The problem, at least with molecules like ethylene, is that it is physically impossible for this overlap to develop at the same time as the overlap between C-2 and C-2' is maintained The system is not flexible enough, and it only becomes flexible enough if one of the conjugated systems is long enough to allow a substantial amount of twisting (as drawn for the hypothetical case <b>2.85</b> on p. 18). We shall see later, on p. 42, one example where this might actually happen.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Frontier orbitals also explain why the rules change so completely for photochemical reactions. In a photochemical cycloaddition, one molecule has had one electron promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO, and this excited-state molecule reacts with a molecule in the ground state. The interacting orbitals that most effectively lower the energy of the transition structure are <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>now the LUMO of the ground-state molecule and the orbital that had been the LUMO of the excited molecule, here called the &#x2018;LUMO&#x2019;. The interaction of the HOMO with the &#x2018;HOMO&#x2019; is likewise energy-lowering. LUMO/&#x2018;LUMO&#x2019; <b>3.6</b> and HOMO/&#x2018;HOMO&#x2019; <b>3.7</b> interactions are bonding at both ends in a [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition, and the two molecules can combine. This frontier orbital interaction is between orbitals close, or even identical, in energy, and so the two molecules are positively attracted to each other, giving an intermediate called an exciplex, instead of being minimally repelled, as in thermal cycloadditions. The interactions in a photochemical [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition <b>3.8</b> and <b>3.9</b> are antibonding at one end, and this type of cycloaddition cannot be concerted.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In contrast, applying frontier orbital theory to unimolecular reactions like electrocyclic reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements is inherently contrived, since we have artificially to treat a single molecule as having separate components, in order to have any frontier orbitals at all. Furthermore, frontier orbital theory does not explain why the barrier to forbidden reactions is so high&#x2014;whenever it has been measured, the transition structure for the forbidden pathway has been 40 kJ mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> or more above that for the allowed pathway. Frontier orbital theory is much better at dealing with small differences in reactivity.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall return to frontier orbital theory to explain the much weaker elements of selectivity, like the effect of substituents on the rates and regioselectivity, and the <i>endo</i> rule, but we must look for something better to explain why interacting molecules conform to the rules with such dedication.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Correlation diagrams</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Correlation diagrams provide a compelling explanation, at least for those reactions that have well defined elements of symmetry preserved throughout the reaction. The idea is to identify the symmetry elements, classify the orbitals undergoing change with respect to those symmetry elements, and then see how the orbitals of the starting materials connect with those of the product. The assumption is that an orbital in the starting material must feed into an orbital of the same symmetry in the product. Substituents, whether they technically break the symmetry or not, are treated as insignificant perturbations on the orbitals actually undergoing change. We shall now go through the sequence of steps involved in setting up a correlation diagram. It may be some comfort to know that it will not prove to be necessary to go to this much trouble for every new reaction you come across&#x2014;it is a revealing <a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>exercise, and good practice in handling molecular orbitals, but you will be able to dispense with it as a day-to-day tool when you learn the Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules that came out of it.</p>
<p class="indent">We shall begin with an allowed reaction, the ubiquitous Diels&#x2013;Alder.</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0035-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 1.</i> Draw the bare bones of the reaction <b>3.10</b>, and put in the curly arrows for the forward and backward reactions. Remember that any substituents, even if they make the diene or dienophile unsymmetrical, do not fundamentally disturb the symmetry of the orbitals directly involved.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 2.</i> Identify the orbitals undergoing change&#x2014;the curly arrows help you to focus on what they are. For the starting materials, they are the &#x03C0;-orbitals <small>(<i>&#x03A8;</i><sub>1</sub>-<i>&#x03A8;</i><sub>4</sub>&#x002A;)</small> of the diene unit and the &#x03C0;-orbitals (<i>&#x03C0;</i> and &#x03C0;&#x002A;) of the C&#x003D;C double bond of the dienophile. For the product, they are the &#x03C0;-bond and the two newly formed <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 3.</i> Identify any symmetry elements maintained throughout the course of the reaction. There may be more than one. For a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, which we know to be suprafacial on both components <b>3.11</b>, there is only the one, a plane of symmetry bisecting the bond between C-2 and C-3 of the diene and the &#x03C0;-bond of the dienophile.</p>

<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/f0035-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 4.</i> Rank the orbitals approximately by their energy, and draw them as energy levels, one above the other, with the starting material on the left and the product on the right (<a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 5.</i> Beside each energy level, draw the orbitals, showing the signs of the coefficients of the atomic orbitals. All the &#x03C0;-bonds are straightforward, but we meet a problem with the two <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds in the product, which appear at first sight to be independent entities. In the next step we are going to have to identify the symmetry these orbitals have with respect to the plane of symmetry maintained through the reaction, and it is not obvious how to do this for a pair of independent-seeming orbitals. The answer is to combine them. They are, after all, held one bond apart, and they must interact quite strongly in a &#x03C0; sense. The interaction of the two bonding <i>&#x03C3;</i> and the two antibonding <i>&#x03C3;</i>&#x002A; orbitals leads to a new set of four molecular orbitals <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;, and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>4</sub>&#x002A;, one pair (<i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;) lowered in energy because of the extra &#x03C0;-bonding, and the other pair (<i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>4</sub>&#x002A;) raised in energy because of the extra &#x03C0;-antibonding. The interaction is overall mildly energy raising, as usual with the interaction of filled orbitals with filled orbitals, and should be familiar as the energetic penalty in conformational analysis when two substituents eclipse each other.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 6.</i> Classify each of the orbitals with respect to the symmetry element. Starting at the bottom left of <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, the lowest energy orbital is <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub> of the diene, with all-positive coefficients in the atomic orbitals, in other words with unshaded orbitals across the top surface of the conjugated system. The atomic orbitals on C-1 and C-2 are reflected in the mirror plane, intersecting <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>the page at the dashed line, by the atomic orbitals on C-3 and C-4, and <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub> is therefore classified as symmetric (S). Moving up the left hand column, the next orbital is the &#x03C0;-bond of the dienophile, which is also symmetric with respect to reflection in the plane. The next orbital is <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>2</sub> of the diene, in which the atomic orbitals on C-1 and C-2 have positive coefficients, and those on C-3 and C-4 have negative coefficients, because of the node half way between C-2 and C-3. The atomic orbitals on C-1 and C-2 are not reflected by the orbitals on C-3 and C-4, and this orbital is antisymmetric (A) with respect to the mirror plane. It is unnecessary to be any more sophisticated in the description of symmetry than this. The remaining orbitals can all be classified similarly as symmetric or antisymmetric. Likewise with the orbitals of the product on the right, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> is symmetric, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> antisymmetric, and so on.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Step 7.</i> Construct an orbital correlation diagram (<a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>). Following the assumption that an orbital in the starting material must feed into an orbital of the same symmetry in the product, draw lines connecting the orbitals of the starting materials to those of the products nearest in energy and of the same symmetry. Thus, <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub> (S) connects to <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub> (S), <i>&#x03C0;</i>(S) connects to <i>&#x03C0;</i>(S), and <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>2</sub> (A) connects to <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> (A), and similarly, with the unoccupied orbitals, <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A; (S) connects to <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;, &#x03C0;&#x002A; (A) connects to <i>&#x03C0;</i>&#x002A; (A), and <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>4</sub>&#x002A; (A) connects to <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>4</sub>&#x002A; (A).<a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Step 8.</i> Construct a state correlation diagram. The orbitals of the ground state in the starting material move smoothly into the orbitals of the ground state in the product. The ground state of the starting materials is designated (<i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C0;</i><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)<i>.</i> Because all the terms are squared (each of the orbitals is doubly occupied), it is also described as overall symmetric (S). Similarly the ground state of the product is (<i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x03C0;<sup>2</sup>), and it too is symmetric. The state correlation diagram is correspondingly easy, at least as far as we need to take it. Because the individual orbitals of the ground state in the starting material correlate with the individual orbitals of the ground state of the product, the state correlation diagram consists simply of a line joining the ground state with the ground state (<a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In the state correlation diagram (<a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>), the ground state of the starting materials, <i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, is overall symmetric, because both terms are squared. Following the lines across <a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>, we see that this state feeds into a doubly excited state, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;<sup>2</sup>, in the product, which is also symmetric because both terms are squared. If we now start at the ground state of the product, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, and follow the lines (SS and AS) in <a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> back to the orbitals of the starting material, we find another doubly excited state <i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;<sup>2</sup>. Both of these states, with both terms squared, are again symmetric.</p>
<p class="indent">Any hypothetical attempt by the molecules to follow these paths in either direction, supposing they had the very large amounts of energy necessary to do so, would be thwarted, because states of the same symmetry cannot cross. The hypothetical reaction would in fact lead from ground state to ground state, but it would have to traverse a very substantial barrier, represented on <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a><a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a> by the line <i>E.</i> This barrier provides, at last, a convincing explanation of why the forbidden [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition is so difficult&#x2014;the energy needed to surmount it is of the order of electronic excitation energies, far above that available in most thermal reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">We look now at the first excited state, <i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x03C0;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;, which is produced by promoting one electron from &#x03C0;<sub>2</sub> to &#x03C0;<sub>3</sub>&#x002A;. Following the lines in <a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> from the occupied and the two half-occupied orbitals on the left (SS, SA and AS), we are led to the orbitals of the first excited state on the right, <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A;. In the state correlation diagram, <a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>, both of these states are antisymmetric, and there is a line joining them, passing close to the avoided crossing in the ground state correlation. The value of <i>E</i> is evidently high, because it is approaching the energy of electronic excitation. It also explains why the photochemical [2&#x002B;2] reaction is allowed&#x2014;the electrons in the orbitals of the first excited state move smoothly over into the orbitals of the first excited state of the product. This does not mean that the reaction ends there, for the electron in <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A; must somehow drop into <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>2</sub> to give the ground state, disposing of a large amount of energy&#x2014;by no means a simple event. All we need to understand in the present context is that the photochemical reaction does not meet a symmetry-imposed barrier like that for the ground-state reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Correlation diagrams have given us a convincing sense of where the barriers come from for those reactions that we have been calling forbidden. In principle, of course, no reaction is forbidden&#x2014;what these reactions have is a formidable symmetry-imposed barrier, and something very unusual is needed if barriers of this magnitude are to be crossed. However, correlation diagrams take quite a bit of thought, and there are some pitfalls in their construction&#x2014;however satisfying they may be, they are not for everyday use.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fortunately, all the conclusions that can be drawn laboriously from correlation diagrams can be drawn more easily from a pair of rules, known as the Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules, which distil the essence of the idea into two statements governing all pericyclic reactions, one rule for thermal reactions <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>and its opposite for photochemical reactions. Correlation diagrams explain why they work, but we are no longer dependent upon having to construct such diagrams. We shall examine the rules in this chapter with application to the cycloadditions that we have already seen in the last chapter, and then we shall see how they work for the other kinds of pericyclic reaction in the remaining chapters. The rule for thermal reactions is:</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>components</i> of a cycloaddition are obvious enough&#x2014;we have been using the word already in this chapter to refer to the core electronic systems undergoing change. For a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction the components are the <i>&#x03C0;-</i> orbitals of the diene, containing 4 electrons, and the &#x03C0;-bond of the dienophile, containing 2. As usual, we ignore all substituents not directly involved. What we have to do is to ask ourselves two questions: (1) which of these components is acting in a suprafacial manner and which in an antarafacial manner, and (2) in which of these components can the number of electrons be expressed in the form (4q&#x002B;2) and in which in the form (4r), where q and r are integers&#x003F; For the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction, as we know, both components are undergoing bond formation in a suprafacial sense, as shown by the dashed lines in <b>3.15</b>, and so the answer to the first question is: both components.</p>

<p class="indent">The diene has 4 electrons, a number that can be expressed in the form (4r), with r &#x003D; 1. Since the new bonds are forming on the diene in a suprafacial manner, both lines coming to the lower surface, the diene is a (4r)<sub>s</sub> component. The dienophile has 2 electrons, a number that can be expressed in the form (4q&#x002B;2), with q &#x003D; 0. Since the new bonds are forming on the dienophile in a suprafacial manner, both lines coming to the upper surface, the dienophile is a (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> component. Thus, we have put the answers to the two questions together, by asking ourselves: how many of the (4q&#x002B;2) components are suprafacial, and how many of the (4r) components are antarafacial&#x003F; In the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction there is one (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> component and no (4r)<sub>a</sub> components. We ignore (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>a</sub> and (4r)<sub>s</sub> components, when there are any. The total number of (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> and (4r)<sub>a</sub> components is therefore 1, and, since this is an odd number, the reaction is symmetry-allowed.</p>
<p class="indent">The Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction <b>3.15</b> is, as we have been calling it all along, a [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition. Since it takes place suprafacially on both components, it is more informatively described as a [4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;2<sub>S</sub>] cycloaddition, and finally, because both components are &#x03C0;-systems, it is fully described as a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>] cycloaddition. The labels <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>s</sub> and <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub> can be placed beside the appropriate component in the drawing, as in <b>3.15</b>, to help to identify what is going on, and the sum can conveniently be placed near the drawing, to show that the full check on the allowedness of the reaction has been completed.</p>

<p class="indent">The description [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>] for a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction does not supplant the older name&#x2014;it is not the only reaction that is [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>], and so the name Diels&#x2013;Alder is still needed to describe the reaction. 1,3-Dipolar cyclo-additions <b>3.16</b> are equally [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>], and so are the combinations: allyl anion <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>and alkene, allyl cation and diene, and pentadienyl cation and alkene. Furthermore, [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>] is not the only way of describing a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction. It would be easy to overlook the fact that the diene can be treated as one component, and to see it instead as two independent &#x03C0;-bonds. Although it makes extra work to see it this way, it does not cause the rule to break down. For example, the drawing <b>3.17</b> might have been used. The dashed line representing the developing overlap for the formation of the &#x03C0;-bond is from the lower lobe on C-2 to the lower lobe on C-3. This makes all three components suprafacial&#x2014;the &#x03C0;-bond between C-1 and C-2 has both dashed lines to the lower lobes, and the &#x03C0;-bond between C-3 and C-4 also has both dashed lines to the lower lobes. In other words both are suffering suprafacial development of overlap. The same is true for the &#x03C0;-bond of the dienophile. Overall the little sum is changed to having three (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> components, which is still an odd number, and so the reaction remains allowed. It is now described as a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>] cycloaddition.</p>

<p class="indent">Another drawing <b>3.18</b>, still representing exactly the same reaction, places the dashed line between the upper lobes on C-2 and C-3. This changes each of the &#x03C0;-bonds of the diene to suffering notional antarafacial development of overlap. It is just as valid a representation as either of the earlier versions, and the sum still comes out with an odd number of (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> components and no (4r)<sub>a</sub> components. The two <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub> components have 2 electrons each, which is a (4q&#x002B;2) number and (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>a</sub> components do not have to be counted. The reaction is now a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>]. cycloaddition. Clearly, the three designations [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>], [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>], and [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>S</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] are all the same reaction, and none of them defines a Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction. The three designations, in fact, define where the dashed lines have been drawn in the three drawings <b>3.15</b>, <b>3.17</b>, and <b>3.18</b>, and no reaction should be described in this way in the absence of a drawing like these. We might note here that the words suprafacial and antarafacial are being used in the same sense as that in which they were defined in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a> on p. 18, but to refer to a drawing rather than a reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">A fourth of many possible drawings, <b>3.19</b>, is a different reaction, with the dashed line on the left at the back indicating that the upper lobe on C-2 is turning downwards to overlap with the lower lobe on C-3. This is not what happens&#x2014;if it were to happen, it would produce a <i>trans</i> double bond in the cyclohexene product. Not only is that impossible for steric reasons, it is also forbidden, as the sum shows&#x2014;there are two (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> components. We see from the three drawings <b>3.15</b>, <b>3.17</b>, and <b>3.18</b> that there is considerable latitude in how to place the dashed lines to identify developing overlap, but they must identify the overlap that is actually developing, just as all three <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>drawings correctly have the suprafacial attack on the &#x03C0;-bonds where the two <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds are forming, and a &#x03C0;-bond forming between C-2 and C-3 without twisting.</p>

<p class="indent">A few words of warning about some other common confusions:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; The labels <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>s</sub> and <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>, apply to the <i>components</i>; be sure to focus on them, and not just on adjacent p-orbitals, before you check whether the dashed lines coming to the lobes at each end identify them as suprafacial or antarafacial. It is a common mistake to look at each end of a dashed <i>line</i>, such as the line between the upper lobes on C-2 and C-3 in the drawing <b>3.18</b> (repeated on the left), and call it suprafacial. If this is where you are looking, you need to recognize that the connection between C-2 and C-3 is not a component. The components are the &#x03C0;-bonds between C-1 and C-2 and between C-3 and C-4. Placing the labels close to the components they refer to, and using the longest conjugated system as one component, help to avoid this confusion.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; The numbers of electrons in the components of a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>4<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] reaction are the key to getting the right answer; the 4 and the 2 are printed full size, and on the line. The s and the a, identifying whether they are suprafacial or antarafacial, and the &#x03C0; and <i>&#x03C3;</i>, which we shall come to shortly, are qualifiers, which are printed as small subscripts There is a tendency for the qualifiers to grow orthographically, and you will find in your reading designations like (&#x03C0;<sub>4s</sub>&#x002B;&#x03C0;<sub>2s</sub>], with many variants, perversely emphasizing the least important feature. Remember that it is first and foremost a [4&#x002B;2] cycloaddition.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; When working out whether or not a reaction is obeying the rule, it is inappropriate to shade the orbitals&#x2014;this is not a frontier orbital treatment, and no particular orbital is being considered when an analysis like <b>3.15</b> is carried out. There is no real need to draw the lobes at all, as long as the dashed lines clearly identify on which side of the atoms the new bonds are developing</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; It is more than half the battle if you make a good drawing, realistically representing a transition structure, and showing overlap that looks as though it could actually develop into a bond.</p>
<p class="indent">So far we have only defined what suprafacial and antarafacial mean on &#x03C0;<i>-</i>systems (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig_2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>), but we need to see how <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds are treated by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. Just as a suprafacial event on a &#x03C0;-bond has overlap developing to the two upper lobes that contribute to the bond, so with <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds (<a href="#fig_3.5">Fig. 3.5a</a>), overlap that develops to the two large lobes of the sp<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="noindent2">A short-cut role, to be applied with caution</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">It is generally a good idea to try to draw the dashed lines to make as many suprafacial components as you can, for it is possible to simplify the rule further when you do. If the <i>total</i> number of electrons involved is a (4n&#x002B;2) number, the all-suprafacial reaction will be allowed, as in <b>3.21</b>. This can be caution made to apply to a high proportion of the pericyclic reactions you will ever come across, and especially to cycloadditions, as we saw with a preliminary <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>version of this rule in the last chapter. On the other hand, if the total number of electrons is a 4n number, the reaction will be allowed if one, and only one, component is antarafacial. By choosing to place the dashed lines to make as many suprafacial components as you can, this rule can be made to apply to very nearly all the remaining pericyclic reactions. These versions of the general rule allow one to come quickly to a conclusion about whether a particular reaction will prove to be allowed or not. Then, if the reaction is at all complicated, it can be checked against the full rule. Most of the reactions analysed in the rest of this book will use suprafacial components wherever that is possible, so that the antarafacial components will stand out.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps it stands out best in this, one of the most spectacular achievements of the theory of pericyclic reactions. Tetracyanoethylene adds to heptafulvalene in a [14&#x002B;2] cycloaddition <b>3.25</b>. Because the number of electrons involved is 16 (8 curly arrows), this reaction appears at first sight to be forbidden&#x2014;16 is an antiaromatic number, since it can be expressed in the form 4n. We can now see that it will be allowed if one of the two components can react in an antarafacial manner, and the heptafulvalene is evidently flexible enough not to loose the conjugation through the seven double bonds. The two hydrogen atoms in the adduct <b>3.27</b> prove to be <i>trans</i> to each other, showing that the heptafulvalene has suffered antarafacial attack <b>3.26</b>: the dashed lines show the overlap developing, one to a lower lobe and one to an upper, making the heptafulvalene a <sub>&#x03C0;</sub>14<sub>a</sub> component, and the reaction an allowed [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>14<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] cycloaddition.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not clear how many photochemical reactions are in fact pericyclic, and it is not easy to use the usual methods of physical organic chemistry to prove it. What is clear is that a great many photochemical reactions do obey the photochemical rule, and it therefore seems likely that some of them have pericyclic character at a critical stage.

The first <b>3.28</b> is a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>] cycloaddition with an even number of (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> components and no (4r)<sub>a</sub> <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>components. It is symmetry-forbidden as a thermal reaction, but symmetry-allowed photochemically. The second <b>3.29</b> is a [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] cycloaddition, with one (4q&#x002B;2)<sub>s</sub> component making it thermally allowed; but its orbitals cannot reach each other.</p>

<p class="indent">One group of anomalous reactions is that of ketenes with alkenes. These reactions appear to have some of the characteristics of pericyclic cycloadditions, such as being stereospecifically <i>syn</i> with respect to the double</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, stereospecificity is not always complete, and many ketene cycloadditions take place only when there is a strong donor substituent on the alkene. An ionic stepwise pathway by way of an intermediate zwitterion <b>3.34</b> is therefore entirely reasonable in accounting for many ketene cycloadditions. It seems likely that some of these reactions are pericyclic and some not, with the possibility of there being a rather blurred borderline between the two mechanisms, with one bond forming so far ahead of the other that any symmetry in the orbitals is essentially lost. But when it is pericyclic, how does it overcome the symmetry-imposed barrier&#x003F;</p>

<p class="indent">One suggestion is that the two molecules approach each other at right angles, with overlap developing <b>3.35</b> in an antarafacial sense on the ketene, making the reaction the allowed [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] cycloaddition that we have dismissed as being unreasonable. This is the most simple explanation, but it is unsatisfactory, because other alkenes and alkynes might be able to achieve a transition structure with about the same degree of steric hindrance in the approach of the two &#x03C0;-bonds as this, yet such cycloadditions do not occur.</p>

<p class="indent">The probability of some [2&#x002B;2] cycloadditions of ketenes&#x2019; being concerted is more likely to be a consequence of the fact that ketenes have two sets of &#x03C0;-orbitals at right angles to each other. Overlap can develop to orthogonal orbitals <b>3.36</b> (dashed lines), and in addition there is transmission of information from one orbital to its orthogonal neighbour (heavy line). This is a legitimate but somewhat contrived way of making the electronic connection cyclic and hence pericyclic. This version identifies the reaction as an allowed [<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>s</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>2<sub>a</sub>] cycloaddition. In essence the ketene is able to take up the role of antarafacial component by using an orbital that has turned through 90&#x00B0; towards the alkene component. A variant of this approach, perhaps the easiest way of thinking about these reactions, is to omit the overlap drawn with a heavy line in <b>3.36</b>, and to concentrate on the key, <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond-forming events. This removes the symmetry-imposed barrier, because the reaction is no longer being thought of as strictly pericyclic. The two bonds are still being formed more or less in concert, but independently, without having to worry about symmetry information being transmitted from one orbital to the other.</p>

<p class="indent">There are also several reactions in organometallic chemistry which at first sight appear to contravene the rule, but which can be explained in a somewhat similar way. Hydrometallation, carbometallation, metallo-metallation, and olefin metathesis reactions all have the feature of being stereospecifically suprafacial additions to an alkene or alkyne. We can take hydroboration <b>3.42</b> as an example, where the curly arrows show it as a [2&#x002B;2] cycloaddition of a <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond to a &#x03C0;-bond, for which the all-suprafacial pathway is forbidden. It is known not to be stepwise, beginning with electrophilic attack by the boron atom, because electron-donating substituents on the alkene do not speed up the reaction anything like as much as they do when alkenes are attacked by electrophiles&#x2014;there must be some component of <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>hydride addition more or less concerted with the electrophilic attack. The empty p-orbital on the boron is the electrophilic site and the s-orbital of the hydrogen atom in the B&#x2013;H bond is the nucleophilic site. These orbitals are orthogonal, and so the cycloaddition is not properly pericyclic. The frontier orbital pictures <b>3.43</b> and <b>3.44</b> reinforce the perception that the two bonds are formed independently, with the former illustrating the electrophilic attack by the borane, and the latter the nucleophilic attack by the borane.</p>

<p class="indent">Another anomalous cycloaddition is the insertion of a carbene into an alkene. 6-Electron cheletropic reactions (p. 28) are straightforward allowed pericyclic reactions, which we can now classify with the drawings <b>3.47</b> for the suprafacial addition of sulfur dioxide to the diene <b>2.179</b> and its reverse. Similarly, we can draw <b>3.48</b> for the antarafacial addition of sulfur dioxide to the triene <b>2.180</b> and its reverse. The new feature here is that one of the orbitals is a lone pair, which is given the letter &#x03C9; to distinguish it from <i>&#x03C3;</i>- and &#x03C0;-bonds, with suprafacial and antarafacial defined by the drawings <b>3.45</b> and <b>3.46</b> which apply to all sp<sup>3</sup> hybrids and p orbitals, filled or unfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">The problem comes with the insertion of a carbene into a double bond, which is well known to be stereospecifically suprafacial with singlet carbenes like dichlorocarbene (p. 28). This is clearly a forbidden pericyclic reaction, if it takes place in the sense <b>3.49</b> &#x2192; <b>3.50</b>. This is known as the linear approach, in which the carbene, with its two substituents already lined up where they will be in the product, comes straight down into the middle of the double bond. The two reactions above, <b>3.47</b> and <b>3.48</b>, are also linear approaches, but these are both allowed, the former because the total number of electrons (6) <a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>is a (4n&#x002B;2) number, and the latter because the triene is flexible enough to take up the role of antarafacial component. The alternative is the non-linear approach, in which the carbene approaches the double bond on its side, and</p>
<figure class="imgc">
<img src="../images/f0048-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">then has the two substituents tilt upwards as the reaction proceeds, in order to arrive in their proper orientation in the product <b>3.50</b>. This is best understood using the frontier orbitals <b>3.51a</b> and <b>3.51b</b>, where the HOMO of the carbene is the lone pair and the LUMO is the empty p orbital. Each of these orbitals, when presented to the double bond with the carbene on its side, matches the signs of the appropriate atomic orbitals on the double bond (dashed lines). Once again, by separating the formation of the two <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds into overlap developing independently to orthogonal orbitals on the carbene, we no longer need to see the reaction as strictly pericyclic. As with ketenes, however, it is possible to connect up the orthogonal orbitals, as in <b>3.52</b>, to make the nonlinear approach classifiably pericyclic and allowed. This avoids any problem there might be with reactions like <b>3.47</b> and <b>3.48</b> being pericyclic and the clearly related reaction <b>3.51</b> seeming not to be.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.7</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Secondary effects</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Although they are much less powerfully controlling than the constraints of orbital symmetry, there are some important secondary effects determining stereoselectivity, reaction rate, and regioselectivity. They are discussed here for cycloadditions, where they are most important and most easily explained.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Stereoselectivity in cycloadditions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most challenging stereochemical findings is Alder&#x2019;s <i>endo</i> rule for Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions (p. 21). The favoured transition structures <b>2.110</b> and <b>2.113</b>, with the electron-withdrawing substituent in the more hindered environment, give the thermodynamically less favourable products <b>2.111</b> and <b>2.114</b>.

<p class="indent">The simplest explanation comes from the frontier orbitals. As we shall see, they are the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile. The former is <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>2</sub> of butadiene, and the latter, using acrolein with 4 conjugated p-orbitals as a model, has a nodal pattern similar to that of the LUMO <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>3</sub>&#x002A; of butadiene. If we place these orbitals in the appropriate places for the <i>endo</i> <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>reaction <b>3.53</b>, we see that there is the usual primary interaction (dashed lines), consistent with the rules, as we saw in the drawing <b>3.3</b> on p. 33, but there is an additional bonding interaction (bold line) between the orbitals on C-2 of the diene and the carbonyl carbon of the dienophile. This interaction, known as a secondary orbital interaction, does not lead to a bond, but it does make a contribution to lowering the energy of this transition structure relative to that of the <i>exo</i> reaction, where it must be absent. It is equally compatible <b>3.54</b> with the reaction showing inverse electron demand <b>2.117</b> &#x2192; <b>2.118</b> on p. 22, although there is some doubt whether that is actually pericyclic.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">A secondary orbital interaction has been used to explain other puzzling features of selectivity, but, like frontier orbital theory itself, it has not stood the test of higher levels of theoretical investigation. Although still much cited, it does not appear to be the whole story, yet it remains the only simple explanation. It works for several other cycloadditions too, with the cyclopentadiene&#x002B;tropone reaction favouring the extended transition structure <b>2.106</b> because the frontier orbitals have a repulsive interaction (wavy lines) between C-3, C-4 , C-5 and C-6 on the tropone and C-2 and C-3 on the diene in the compressed transition structure <b>3.55</b>. Similarly, the allyl anion&#x002B;alkene interaction <b>3.56</b> is a model for a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, which has no secondary orbital interaction between the HOMO of the anion, with a node on C-2, and the LUMO of the dipolarophile, and only has a favourable interaction between the LUMO of the anion and the HOMO of the dipolarophile <b>3.57</b>, which might explain the low level or absence of <i>endo</i> selectivity that dipolar cycloadditions show.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Substituent effects on rates of cycloadditions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The point was made early in the last chapter that Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions take place faster if the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups on it, and that electron-donating groups on the diene help too. Again the explanation comes most readily from the frontier orbitals. Put briefly, a donor substituent on the diene raises the energy of its HOMO, and an electron-withdrawing substituent on the dienophile lowers the energy of its LUMO, bringing the two orbitals closer together in energy. Because orbitals close in energy interact more strongly than those far apart, the energy of the transition state is lower than it was without the substituents.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to do better than just accept that the effects of electron-donating and withdrawing substituents will be this way round. A simple argument based on the molecular orbitals of conjugated systems allows us to deduce that donors raise the energy of molecular orbitals and that withdrawing groups lower them. Let us recall the energies of the molecular orbitals of the first six conjugated systems, starting with a p-orbital on carbon (1 p orbital), which is used as a reference, and working up to hexatriene (6 conjugated p orbitals), with two entries for each of the ions, one for the cation and one for the anion, <a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>. We see immediately how the upper energy levels steadily rise and the lower steadily fall as more and more orbitals are brought into conjugation.</p>
<p class="indent">To estimate how the energies of the frontier orbitals change when an electron-donating or withdrawing substituent is added to a conjugated system <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>we construct a diagram (<a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>) with the energy levels lifted from <a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>. The unsubstituted diene is on the far left of <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7a</a> and the unsubstituted dienophile is on the far right of <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7b</a>. To assess the effect of having an electron-donating group X on C-1 of the diene, we start with the best possible electron donating group, which is a carbanion. Using the pentadienyl anion as a model for a 1-X-substituted diene, we place its energy levels on the right in <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7a</a>. We then assume that a less effective electron-donating substituent will make the orbitals of the conjugated system fall in between those of the unsubstituted diene and of the pentadienyl anion. The energy levels of its frontier orbitals will then come between the corresponding energy levels for the two extreme versions, and we place these compromise levels in between the extremes as the middle column of <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7a</a>. We see immediately that the HOMO is higher in energy for the X-substituted diene than for the unsubstituted diene.</p>

<p class="indent">Estimating the effect of an electron-withdrawing group Z on an alkene is only a little more complicated. The argument begins with the idea that the best possible electron-withdrawing group would be a carbocation. Hence the allyl cation is the model for that extreme, and its energy levels can be placed on the left of <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7b</a>. Most electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyl, nitrile and nitro, are not only electron-withdrawing, but also add further conjugation. The extreme version for such a group with no electron-withdrawing properties is best modelled by butadiene rather than by the unsubstituted alkene. Thus acrolein <b>3.59</b> can be regarded as having properties somewhere between those of an allyl cation <b>3.58</b>, in which we disregard the oxyanion substituent completely, and butadiene <b>3.60</b>, in which we <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>overestimate its contribution by disregarding the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. We therefore place the orbitals of butadiene as the third column in <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7b</a>, and predict, as before, that the frontier orbitals of a Z-substituted alkene will fall somewhere between the corresponding energy levels for the allyl cation and butadiene. We see that the energy of the LUMO of a Z-substituted alkene is very substantially lower than that of the unsubstituted alkene on the far right&#x2014;some of the lowering in energy comes from the conjugation, with <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>3</sub><i>&#x002A;</i> of butadiene already lower than <i>&#x03C0;</i>&#x002A;, and even more comes from its resemblance to the allyl cation. We can now see that the energy of the HOMO of the diene has indeed been raised and that of the LUMO of the dienophile lowered, and we no longer take it simply on faith.</p>

<p class="indent">Different electron-donating groups will make different contributions, with the more powerful, like oxyanions, increasing the proportion of pentadienyl anion character, and raising the energy of the HOMO even more. Different electron-withdrawing groups will also make different contributions, with the more powerful or more numerous increasing the proportion of allyl cation character and further lowering the LUMO energy. Lewis acid coordination to a carbonyl group will likewise decrease the influence of the oxygen lone pairs on the &#x03C0;-bond of the carbonyl group and make acrolein more like an allyl cation. This will lower the LUMO energy even more and explain the large rate accelerations found for Lewis acid-catalysed Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions, such as that in the reaction of anthracene <b>3.61</b> with dimethyl fumarate <b>3.62</b>.<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a></p>

Both orbitals contribute to the &#x03B2; carbon of the alkene having the larger coefficient, just as they both contributed to making it lower in energy. The last step in the argument is to recognize that better overlap develops if the two larger lobes approach each other than if the larger lobe of one component approaches the smaller lobe of the other. Thus C-4 of the diene bonds to the &#x03B2; carbon of the dienophile <b>3.64</b>. This picture is useful in representing something that was mentioned on p. 25&#x2014;pericyclic cycloadditions have two bonds forming at the same time, but that does not mean that they are formed to the same extent in the transition structure. The bond between C-4 of the diene and the &#x03B2; carbon of the dienophile forms ahead of the bond between C-1 of the diene and the a carbon of the dienophile, but the overlap leading to the latter is beginning. Asymmetry in the starting materials introduces a level of asymmetry in the transition structure, without necessarily making the reaction fully stepwise. In a highly unsymmetrical case, the benefit of having overlap develop between C-1 of the diene and the a carbon of the dienophile can become too small to be energetically profitable. When that happens, a stepwise pathway will be followed, even for a symmetry-allowed reaction, because a stepwise pathway does not suffer from the high entropy of activation associated with forming two bonds at the same time.</p>

The real challenge is to explain the formation (p. 24) of the &#x2018;ortho&#x2019; adduct <b>2.144</b> from the combination of pentadienoic acid <b>2.142</b>, a 1-Z-substituted diene, with acrylic acid <b>2.143</b>. The argument based on the total charge distribution does not work in this case, but the frontier orbital argument does. The LUMO of the dienophile is the same&#x2014;it is repeated from <a href="#fig_3.9">Fig. 3.9b</a> in <a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10b</a>. What we need is to estimate how the HOMO of a 1-Z-substituted diene will be polarized. The extreme versions which we combine are the HOMO of hexatriene, <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>3</sub> shown on the left of <a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10a</a>, and the HOMO of the pentadienyl cation, <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>2</sub>, shown on the right. The latter is not polarized&#x2014;its coefficients have the same absolute magnitude both on C-1 and on C-4. It is the element of conjugation from the hexatriene-like character that introduces a small polarization, with the coefficient on C-4 in <i>&#x03C8;</i><sub>3</sub> marginally larger than that on C-1. The HOMO of the 1-Z-substituted diene is therefore polarized in the same sense as a 1-X-substituted diene, but to a much smaller degree, and the regiochemistry of its Diels-Alder reaction is explained.</p>

<p class="indent">The regioselectivity of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions is not as simple to explain. The best explanation yet advanced is still based on frontier orbitals, but unfortunately it is no longer possible to deduce what they look like from first principles. Calculations have given representative sets of the energies and coefficients for the frontier orbitals of all the major dipoles. The coefficients have to be modified to take account of the fact that many dipoles have heteroatoms at their extremities, and bond-formation to heteroatoms requires a resonance integral different from the resonance integral for C&#x2013;C bond-formation. From the energies it is possible to deduce whether the separation between the energy of the HOMO of the dipole and the LUMO of the dipolarophile is lower than that between the HOMO of the dipolarophile <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 3 The Woodward&#x2013;Hoffmann rules and molecular orbitals</a>and the LUMO of the dipole. The former are called HO-dipole controlled, and the latter LU-dipole controlled.</p>
<p class="indent">The pattern that emerges is that dipoles calculated to have a high energy HOMO are the ones that react faster (or only) with dipolarophiles that have Z-substituents, and dipoles calculated to have a low energy LUMO are those that react faster (or only) with dipolarophiles that have X-substituents. In addition, the polarization deduced for the frontier orbitals matches to a large extent the regioselectivity observed in their reactions. The large number of dipoles, and the extended range created by the addition of Z- and/or X-substituents, make the subject too large to be covered any more fully here. It is enough to know that information is available if you ever need it.</p>
