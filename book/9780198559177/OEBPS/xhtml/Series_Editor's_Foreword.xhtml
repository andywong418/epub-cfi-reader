<p class="noindentf">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of the current understanding of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="indentf">Robin Whyman has great experience in the field of applied organometallic chemistry and catalysis, having worked in the chemical industry prior to his current appointment at the University of Liverpool. This experience is reflected in this Primer, which provides a remarkable overall perspective of this important field within a single volume. Accordingly, this book will be a great interest to under-graduate, postgraduate, and applied industrial chemists to equal measure. I expect that this Primer will provide an excellent background to Level 3, Level 4, and post-graduate courses in both inorganic, organic, and catalytic chemistry.</p>
