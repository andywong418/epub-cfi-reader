<p class="noindentf">The phenomenal growth and interest in organometallic chemistry since the discovery of ferrocene in the early 1950s exhibits close parallels with applications in homogeneously catalysed chemical processes for the manufacture of both commodity and fine chemicals. The aim of this Primer is to provide a perspective on these developments over the past half century, with particular emphasis on, first, the influence of organometallic chemistry on our understanding of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and, second, the principal commercial applications of homogeneous catalysis that have been developed during this period. The content of the Primer has its origins in a Masters degree course presented during my tenure of a visiting professorship at the University of Toronto in the early 1980s. Since then it has been continually developed and updated, and given for several years to Honours chemistry undergraduates at various universities in the UK, most recently at Liverpool. Here, it forms an integral component of the MSc course in surface science and catalysis at the Leverhulme Centre for Innovative Catalysis.</p>
<p class="indentf">It gives me great pleasure to dedicate this Primer to scientists from the former ICI Corporate Laboratory, Runcorn, in particular Drs J. P. Candlin, W. Hewertson, and D. T. Thompson, who first stimulated my interest in homogeneous catalysis. Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the (considerable!) patience and support of my wife, Pat, during the preparation of the manuscript.</p>
