<p class="noindent">Hydroformylation, or the OXO (oxonation) reaction, is the name used to describe the addition of CO and H2 to the C=C bond of an olefin, or other unsaturated compound, with the formation of aldehydes containing one more carbon atom than the olefin (<a href="#eqn_3.1">Eqn 3.1</a>).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The reaction was discovered in 1938 by Roelen at Ruhrchemie while investigating the recycling of olefins in the heterogeneously catalysed Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Since that time, the reaction has been developed to form the basis of an industry which, worldwide, accounts for <i>ca</i>. 6 million tonnes per year of products. The aldehydes which are produced in the reaction are not normally used as such, but are reduced to alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts for three principal applications, namely solvents, plasticizers, and detergents (<a href="#tab_3.1">Table 3.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">The hydroformylation of propylene merits particular mention because this comprises the principal route to <i>n</i>-butyraldehyde, an important intermediate in the manufacture of 2-ethylhexanol. Base-catalysed aldol condensation, followed by dehydration and hydrogenation yields 2-ethylhexanol, which, after conversion to its phthalate ester, has particularly desirable properties as a plasticizer for PVC.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Production of the plasticizer alcohol 2-ethylhexanol from n-butyraldehyde is a particularly important application of the hydroformylation of propylene.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Other important applications include the synthesis of fatty alcohols from terminal olefins such as hept-l-ene. Linear alcohols prepared by hydroformylation of, for example, mixtures of C12 olefins obtained by controlled oligomerization of propylene, are used in the synthesis of biodegradable detergents.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the bulk of production via hydroformylation involves relatively simple olefins, the reaction may also be applied to a great variety of substituted olefins, both simple and complex, including unsaturated oils, fats and polymers, as well as unsaturated cyclic compounds such as terpenes, pyrans, carbohydrates and steroids. The reaction is utilized commercially in the synthesis of fine chemicals such as vitamin A (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Hydroformylation is applicable to a wide range of unsaturated substrates.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec3.2">
<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2 Hydroformylation processes</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The basic hydroformylation reaction is exothermic, with a heat of reaction for propylene of 125 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and 115&#x2013;145 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for other olefins, depending upon olefin structure and molecular weight, and is thermodynamically favourable at ambient pressures and low temperatures. However, it required over 35 years after the discovery of the reaction before these mild conditions were realized in practice. The reaction proceeds only in the presence of metal carbonyl catalysts and is the most important industrial synthesis to use these. Although heterogeneous catalysts [Co(30%)/SiO<sub>2</sub>(66%)/ThO<sub>2</sub>(2%)MgO(2%)] were used initially, the reaction is in fact homogeneously catalysed.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Hydroformylation was the first homogeneously catalysed process to find industrial use, although this was neither realized nor established until a number of years after its discovery.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In spite of many attempts, success at the development of commercially viable heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts has been elusive. This is because of slow leaching of catalyst from the support under process conditions, as a consequence of the equilibrium between supported metal and CO being displaced strongly in favour of the free metal carbonyl.</p>
<p class="indent">There are essentially four variations of olefin hydroformylation processes that have been commercialized, namely:</p>
<ul class="uls">
<li>the Co-catalysed process</li>
<li>the phosphine-modified Co process</li>
<li>the phosphine-modified Rh process, and</li>
<li>a biphasic version of the latter using water-soluble phosphines.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The reaction conditions and essential process parameters for each of these are summarized in <a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a>.</p>
<a id="page_21" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 21, chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a>
<p class="indent">The discovery and development of these largely complementary  processes, each of which has its own niche, with inherent advantages and disadvantages, exhibit striking parallels with progress in organometallic chemistry.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-3.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">it should be emphasized that the first-generation cobalt carbonyl catalysts are still used for major proportion of C<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>n</i>&#x003E;4)aldehyde manufacuture.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Several key points that apply to each of the entries of process conditions and parameters in <a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a> require amplification. As is apparent from <a href="#eqn_3.1">Eqn 3.1</a>, with the exception of <b>R</b> = <b>H</b>, an isomeric mixture of straight- and branched-chain aldehydes, dependent on the extent of <i>anti</i>-Markovnikov vs. Markovnikov addition, is produced during hydroformylation. The composition of this mixture, which is commonly defined as the <i>n/iso</i> ratio, is one of the most important features of a hydroformylation process. As a general rule, maximum selectivities to straight-chain products are preferred.</p>
<a id="page_22" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 22, chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a>

<p class="indent">This is particularly important if one of the products is of higher value, as is the case with the hydroformylation of propylene to <i>n</i>- and <i>iso</i>-butyraldehyde. It is not as important if the mixtures are converted together and are equivalent in the final products, as is the situation with, for example, the conversion of di-<i>iso</i>-butylene or tri-propylene to plasticizer alcohols. Another important feature to emerge from <a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a> concerns undesirable competing side-reactions such as the hydrogenation of the starting olefins (and aldehydes) to paraffin hydrocarbons (and alcohols) and the formation of high boiling products (termed &#x2018;heavy ends&#x2019;) from condensation reactions of the product aldehydes. Aldehyde hydrogenation is not important if the total mixture of isomers is subsequently hydrogenated to alcohols but if aldehydes are the primary requirement, as with w-butyraldehyde for subsequent conversion into 2-ethylhexanol, then minimal alcohol formation is required in the primary hydroformylation step.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-17.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">A key feature of hydroformylation is that high selectivities to straight- chain(<i>n</i>) rather than branched-chain (<i>iso</i>) aldehydes are generally preferred.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Co-catalysed process</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the classical Co-catalysed process many forms of cobalt may be used as catalyst precursor, e.g. the carbonyl, metal, hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, sulphate, fatty acid salt, and Raney Co, all of which are believed to be converted into common Co carbonyls and hydridocarbonyls under operating conditions. The reaction conditions are rather severe, particularly in respect of the high pressure requirement which in turn has, until relatively recently, considerably inhibited accurate kinetic and mechanistic studies. Adequate <i>n/iso</i> ratios are typical and the extent of by-product formation is limited.</p>
<p class="indent">Whereas the <i>n/iso</i> product ratio appears to be relatively independent of catalyst concentration and solvent, it does exhibit some dependence on temperature and partial pressures of CO, the use of lower temperatures and higher <i>P</i><sub>CO</sub> favouring the formation of the straight- chain isomer, although with a concomitant decrease in overall conversion. These effects are probably caused by shifts in the equilibria between straight- and branched-chain alkyl and acyl Co carbonyls (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.3">Section 3.3</a>). By making use of these variables it was possible to exercise some control over the <i>n/iso</i> ratio, within certain limits, and to operate the process successfully for <i>ca</i>. 20 years without the necessity for technical innovation and improvement. However, one significant problem did prove difficult to overcome, and this is a direct consequence of the thermal instability of Co carbonyls and their tendency to deposit from solution onto reactor walls as either metal or metal oxides, thus exemplifying one of the principal problems associated with the commercial operation of homogeneous catalysts (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>). In addition to loss of catalytic activity, this also resulted <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a>in significant problems with catalyst re-use and necessitated the inclusion of a capital intensive catalyst recycle stage in the process. Overall, therefore, a number of incentives to improve the original Cobased process became apparent, namely:</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-29.4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The Co-catalysed process provides adequate <i>n/iso</i> ratios and some flexibility to fine-tune by variation of reaction conditions.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The problem of thermal Instability of Co carbonyls and deposition on reactor walls over time, leading to loss of catalytic activity and costly regeneration, provided a major incentive to develop alternative process options.</p>
</aside>
<ul class="uls">
<li>operation at lower pressures, thus reducing the high inherent capital costs associated with compressors,</li>
<li>improvement of the <i>n/iso</i> aldehyde product ratio,</li>
<li>enhancement of catalyst stability under operating conditions,</li>
<li>improvement of catalyst recovery, and</li>
<li>reduction of competing side-reactions to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="indent">As a first step in this direction a very obvious possibility was to consider the catalytic activity of metal carbonyls other than cobalt. The outcome of such a comparative study (<a href="#tab_3.3">Table 3.3</a>), with activities normalized against a value of 1 for Co, shows that Co and Rh are the metals of choice for hydroformylation.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, in spite of the catalytic activity advantages associated with Rh, there are two major disadvantages, namely cost and an <i>n/iso</i> aldehyde product ratio of only 1:1, compared to 4:1 in the case of Co. Other metal carbonyls are considerably less active and it is at first sight surprising, considering the origins of hydroformylation, that the other traditional Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, Fe and Ni, are so much less active than Co. Thus no commercially viable alternative to Co emerged directly from this comparative study.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Although Rh is by far the most active metal, the <i>n/iso</i> product ratio is only 1:1.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In parallel with the development of organometallic chemistry during the late 1950s and early 1960s it became apparent that replacement of some of the carbonyl groups of metal carbonyls by, in particular, tertiary phosphine and arsine ligands, resulted in the formation of complexes of higher thermal stability. This provided a fundamental advance, which has been subsequently applied to many homogeneously catalysed reactions, by providing the capability to fine-tune and tailormake catalysts by variation of both the electronic and steric properties of the attached ligands (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Sections 1.2</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">2.1</a>).The ready availability of a <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a>wide range of such ligands led to the next generation of hydroformylation catalysts, as exemplified by the development of the Shell phosphine-modified cobalt and the Union Carbide/Johnson Matthey/Davy McKee phosphine-modified rhodium processes, commercialized in 1966 and 1976 respectively.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The recognition of the enhanced thermal stability displayed by phosphine-substituted metal carbonyls, and the ability to fine-tune catalytic activity and selectivity by variation of functional groups on the ligands, led to the development of a second generation of hydroformylation processes.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The phosphine-modified Co process</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A comparison between the key features of the classical Co and phosphine-modified Co processes (<a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a>) clearly demonstrates the attendant advantages and disadvantages. The addition of a tertiary phosphine has provided a catalyst with increased thermal stability which, in turn, facilitates operation at lower pressures and higher temperatures. The relatively high thermal stability of the catalyst also facilitates the separation of products from the catalyst by distillation. In addition, product linearity is significantly enhanced even when the feedstock comprises <i>internal</i> linear olefins. However, these advantages are offset by both a considerable reduction in reaction rate (at 180&#x00B0;C the rate is only 20% of that of conventional Co-catalysed processes at 145&#x00B0; C) and the fact that the hydrogenation capacity of the system has been enhanced to such an extent that paraffin formation becomes a significant side-reaction. If alcohols rather than aldehydes are the required products, this can be a very useful process. Indeed, Shell commercialized the process specifically for the conversion of medium chain length C<sub>7</sub>&#x2013;C<sub>14</sub> terminal olefins into linear alcohols sold under the tradename &#x2018;Dobanol&#x2019;.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Characteristics of the phosphine-modified process include lower operating pressures, improved <i>n/iso</i> ratios, but lower activities; the presence of the phosphine ligand partially poisons the Co catalyst.</p>

<p class="indent">In addition, propylene can be directly converted into 2-ethylhexanol when the hydroformylation is carried out in an alkaline reaction medium, by the addition of KOH or a tertiary alkylamine.

<h3 class="h3"><b>The phosphine-modified Rh process</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A comparison of the essential features of this process with those of the Co predecessors (<a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a>) exemplifies the continued trend towards milder reaction conditions and increased linearity of products. Indeed, this catalyst is effective at ambient pressure although, as a consequence of chemical engineering requirements, the commercial process is operated at <i>ca</i>. 20 bar total pressure. The <i>n/iso</i> ratio is dependent upon the amount of added phosphine but can be as high as 16:1, corresponding to a 94% selectivity to linear products. As a consequence of the mild reaction conditions only small amounts of high boiling products are generated, although olefin hydrogenation is a significant side-reaction. The catalyst concentration is low compared to <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a>both Co processes but against this has to be set the cost and availability of Rh, together with maintenance of Rh losses to an absolute minimum (&#x003C;0.01%).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The phosphine-modified Rh process is effective under very mild reaction conditions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This process, although excellent for the hydroformylation of lower olefins such as propylene, is of extremely limited use for the hydroformylation of higher olefins because of thermal instability of the catalyst at the high temperatures required for removal of the product aldehydes by distillation (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section 1.2</a>). Thus, at this stage of development the process is less versatile than either of the Co-based processes. Nevertheless the mild reaction conditions under which this catalyst operates make the phosphine-modified rhodium system particularly attractive for the production, on a (relatively) small scale, of high-added-value fine chemicals.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<h3 class="h3"><b>The biphasic phosphine-modified Rh process</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In attempts to redress difficulties in the application of the phosphine-modified Rh process to higher olefins, the most recent development in hydroformylation technology concerns the use of a water-soluble phosphine such as P(<i>m</i>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>S0<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>3</sub>, obtained by sulphonation of PPh3, as ligand. This effectively facilitates hydroformylation in the aqueous phase; the product aldehydes are immiscible and can therefore be readily separated. The concept was commercialized by Rhone Poulenc-Ruhrchemie in 1984 and is now operated in four plants with a production capacity of 450,000 te y<sup>_1</sup>. Reaction conditions are similar to those used in the initial version of the phosphine-modified Rh process (<a href="#tab_3.2">Table 3.2</a>). An unresolved difficulty with this process is the fact that higher olefins exhibit limited miscibility with the aqueous phase containing the catalyst, resulting in low rates of reaction.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Hydroformylation occurs in the aqueous phase and product separation is therefore facile, thus allowing the hydroformylation of higher C<sub><i>n</i></sub> olefins than propylene.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the kinetic behaviour is open to interpretation in terms of an &#x2018;associative&#x2019; rather than a &#x2018;dissociative&#x2019; mechanistic pathway, it is generallyaccepted that the latter is operative under process conditions. Mechanistic details of the biphasic phosphine-modified Rh process are less well understood. Nevertheless, a generally unified overall picture of the reaction has emerged and it has been claimed that the hydroformylation reaction is now reasonably well understood in mechanistic terms. Even so, more than 60 years after its discovery, there are still aspects of the reaction mechanism that have not been clarified in detail.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.4 Factors governing the choice of hydroformylation process</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It will be evident from the previous commentary that in many respects the commercial processes are complementary rather than competitive, and the principal factor governing the choice of a particular process concerns the versatility required in terms of substrate carbon chain length. Thus, if &#x201C;-butyraldehyde is the required primary product, as an intermediate in the manufacture of 2-ethylhexanol, then the phosphine- modified Rh system is the clear process of choice. However, this process is of limited versatility and, if the requirement is for hydroformylation of a range of higher carbon number olefins to mixed aldehydes, then the original non-liganded Co process is satisfactory. If mixtures of alcohols are the desired products then the phosphine- modified Co process is appropriate, providing that some loss of olefin by hydrogenation to alkane can be tolerated.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The four principal processes for the hydroformylation of olefins are in many respects complementary and each has its own niche.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Thus no process is ideal for all possible olefin conversions and, as is common in commercial processing, compromises have to be reached. Although the advantages of the phosphine-modified Rh processes in terms of mild operating conditions and high selectivities have led to their domination in the hydroformylation of propylene to <i>n-</i> butyraldehyde, it is significant that, for higher C<sup><i>n</i></sup> alkenes, the use of Co-based processes currently outnumbers that of Rh by a factor of 9:1. Clearly, there is a trade-off, and a significant factor in this is no doubt the longevity of capital equipment installed many years ago for Cobased processes. This ratio is therefore set to decrease as new capacity comes on stream and the future trend will, where economically viable, be directed towards Rh-based catalysts and mild operating conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">The stepwise methoxycarbonylation involves the reaction of buta-1,3-diene and methanol with CO at <i>ca.</i> 600 bar and 120&#x2013;140&#x00B0;C in the presence of relatively high concentrations of pre-formed HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> and N-containing base such as pyridine to yield methyl-3-pentenoate in 90% selectivity (<a href="#eqn_3.12">Eqn 3.12</a>). The use of high catalyst concentrations ensures rapid carbonylation and minimizes typical side-reactions such as dimerization and oligomerization of buta-1,3-diene. In the second step (<a href="#eqn_3.13">Eqn 3.13</a>), some of the base is removed because it inhibits the methoxycarbonylation. Prior isomerization of 3- to 4-pentenoic acid ester is a prerequisite for the subsequent carbonylation to generate dimethyl adipate. To ensure internal double bond rearrangement, the reaction conditions are adjusted to 150 bar and 150&#x2013;170&#x00B0;C to give the adipic ester in 80% selectivity. After hydrolysis of the ester, adipic acid is obtained with an overall selectivity of <i>ca.</i> 70%. Mechanistic details of the reaction are not clear and could involve either hydridocarbonyl (see <a href="#eqn_3.4">Eqns 3.4</a>&#x2013;<a href="#eqn_3.10">3.10</a>) or methoxycarbonyl pathways (or both) (<a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>).

The former reacts with buta-l,3-diene to give the methoxycarbonylbutenyl complex which, in turn, reacts with HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> to give methyl-3-pentenoate. It seems likely that the high <a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a> CO pressures used in the process are not directly related to the catalytic cycle but are required to stabilize the cobalt carbonyl intermediates in the liquid phase (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Methoxycarbonylation of methylacetylene to methyl methacrylate and of ethylene to methyl propionate</h3>
<p class="noindent">(Meth)acrylic acid and esters are large-volume industrial chemical intermediates used for the production of co- and homo-polymers. Of the methacrylics, methyl methacrylate (MMA) is by far the most important intermediate, used mainly in the manufacture of Perspex, with a production of <i>ca.</i> 1.5 mte y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Conventional manufacture is by the stoichiometric Acetone Cyano Hydrin (ACH) process which, as a consequence of the production of <i>ca.</i> 2.4 tonnes of ammonium bisulphate/sulphuric acid waste per tonne of MMA, is faced with increasing environmental costs, and is therefore a prime candidate for the development of alternative production routes.</p>
<p class="indent">The carbonylation of alkynes has been known since the pioneering work of Reppe in the 1930s but, until recently, commercially viable routes to methacrylate derivatives have been hindered by insufficiently high catalytic activities and selectivities. A recent development in this <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a> area has been the discovery, by Shell, of a new class of highly efficient homogeneous Pd catalysts for the carbonylation of alkynes. These catalysts allow the selective and rapid carbonylation not only of acetylene but also of homologues such as methylacetylene (propyne) (<a href="#eqn_3.15">Eqn 3.15</a>), and do so with extremely high activity and selectivity to the <i>branched</i> unsaturated products, as required for the formation of methyl methacrylate. Thus, for the first time, they allow the development of a cost-effective MMA process based on carbonylation technology.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">A new range of Pd catalysts has been developed for the selective methoxycarbonylation of methylacetylene to methyl methacrylate.</p>
</aside>

<p class="equation" id="eqn_3.15"><img src="../images/eq_3.15.jpg" alt="images"/></p>

<p class="indent">The essential feature of the catalyst systems is that they are formed from the combination of a Pd(II) species with (i) a ligand (L) containing a 2-pyridyl-phosphine moiety and (ii) a proton source containing counterions of weak coordination capacity.</p>
<p class="indent">Such catalysts are very efficient for the conversion of methylacetylene as the alkyne and methanol as the nucleophilic coreagent. Typical product formation rates of <i>ca.</i> 20,000&#x2013;50,000 mol mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> Pd h<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> are observed under mild reaction conditions (10&#x2013;60 bar and 45&#x2013;60&#x00B0;C). Highest reaction rates are observed at a L:Pd ratio of <i>ca.</i> 20 and selectivities are reported to approach 99.95%. Although details of the chemistry are currently open to debate, it has been proposed that the 2-pyridylphosphine ligand plays an essential role both as a bidentate chelating P<sup>&#x2229;</sup>N ligand in the <i>selectivity</i>-determining step and as a unidentate ligand in the <i>rate</i>-determining step of the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">Although this new range of catalytic systems has not yet been commercialized for methyl methacrylate manufacture, partly because of uncertainties in relation to the availability of the methylacetylene feedstock and required production capacities for MMA, this type of exciting new chemistry is of practical interest for at least two additional reasons. First, closely related cationic Pd-tertiary phosphine complexes containing weakly coordinating anions have been found to provide efficient catalysts for the methoxycarbonylation of ethylene to methyl propionate (<a href="#eqn_3.16">Eqn 3.16</a>), which itself comprises a useful</p>

Second, when <i>monodentate</i> tertiary phosphine ligands are replaced by <i>bidentate</i> phosphines, there is a dramatic switch of selectivity in favour of the formation of polyketone &#x2013; a regular 1:1 co-polymer of carbon monoxide and ethylene. A process for the production of polyketone based entirely on this new development in Pd chemistry has recently <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 3 Hydroformylation and related reactions</a> been commercialized by Shell (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.3">Section 6.3</a>).

<h3 class="h3">Synthesis of fine chemicals</h3>
<p class="noindent">During the past 50 years the hydroformylation reaction has evolved from one which required relatively severe reaction conditions, effectively limiting the reaction to the manufacture of commodity chemicals, to one which can be operated under ambient conditions, thus bringing the reaction within the capability of the synthetic organic chemist. It seems likely therefore that new developments are most likely to appear in the fine chemicals industry. In feet it has already been used for a number of years in facilitating key steps in the BASF and Hoffinann-LaRoche syntheses of Vitamin A (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.2">Section 7.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An aspect of particular importance is asymmetric hydroformylation, which has been the subject of continuing research effort during the past 15&#x2013;20 years. To date only moderate enantioselective excesses have been observed, probably as a consequence of the many reversible steps, outlined in <a href="#eqn_3.4">Eqns 3.4</a>&#x2013;<a href="#eqn_3.10">3.10</a> and <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, that can lead to isomerization and racemization. Refinement in the selection of ligands may enable these difficulties to be overcome.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Attempts to heterogenize hydroformylation catalysts</h3>
<p class="noindent">Finally, there has been considerable interest over the years in the development of surface-supported or &#x2018;anchored&#x2019; hydroformylation catalysts, with the twin aims of facilitating product separation from catalyst and reactants and of minimizing the problems of catalyst deposition onto reactor walls (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Sections 1.2</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.5">2.5</a>). These attempts have, <i>in practice</i>, been singularly unsuccessful, in spite of numerous <i>claims</i> to the contrary, because of slow (ppm quantities) leaching of catalyst from the support into the liquid phase. Successful application of the biphasic approach to product separation has been demonstrated for both phosphine-modified Rh hydroformylation catalysts and Ni-catalysed oligomerization of ethylene to <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.2">Section 6.2</a>), and this approach appears to provide a more convenient and promising solution to the problem of product separation in such processes. Other emerging techniques such as fluorous biphase catalysis in combination with supercritical fluid processing <i>may</i> provide viable solutions to the problem of hydroformylation of higher C<sub><i>n</i></sub> olefins with phosphine-modified Rh catalysts.</p>
