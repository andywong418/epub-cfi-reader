<p class="sidebar-left">Olefin polymerization provides the principal industrial application of organometallic catalysis, with <i>ca</i>. 60% of production capacity accounted for by heterogeneous Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The main industrial use for organometallic catalysts &#x2013; but <i>not necessarily</i> homogeneous catalysts &#x2013; is the polymerization of olefins. About 60 million tonnes of polyolefins are produced annually, 60% of this total with <i>heterogeneous</i> Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts and their derivatives. A considerably smaller, but none the less significant (1 mte y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), application which requires the use of homogeneous catalysts is the the Shell Higher Olefins Process (SHOP), which now accounts for <i>ca</i>. 50% of all <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins production. The key stage in this is the homogeneous Ni-catalysed oligomerization of ethylene to linear <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins. Polyketones, which can be produced by the co-polymerization of olefins with carbon monoxide, are of particular interest as speciality polymers, in the context of their superior materials performance properties relative to more conventional polyolefins. A new and highly selective process which utilizes soluble Pd catalyst precursors for the manufacture of alternating ethylene/CO co-polymers has recently been commercialized, also by the Shell group. The two processes are described in this chapter together with some exciting new advances in what was, until recently, believed to be the relatively mature field of olefin polymerization. These include two types of high-activity polymerization catalysts, capable of tunable regio- and stereo-selectivities, based on (i) metallocene complexes of the <i>early</i> transition metals and (ii) complexes of the <i>later</i> transition metals with multidentate N&#x2013; and N<sup>&#x2229;</sup>O ligands containing sterically bulky substituents; both are close to achieving significant commercial status.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Important applications of homogeneous catalysts include the production of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins and polyketones, using Ni and Pd catalysts respectively.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Hitherto in this primer, almost all the homogeneously catalysed transformations that have been described involve reactions in which the addition of reactants, for example, CO and H<sub>2</sub>, to a substrate, such as propylene, result in its <i>selective</i> conversion into a desired product, in one of two isomeric forms, e.g. <i>n</i>- and <i>iso</i>-butyraldehyde (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). In commercial operation this individual step may then be integrated into a more complex reaction sequence as part of a total chemical process, e.g. aldol condensation, dehydration, and hydrogenation, as <a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, Chapter 6 Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a>required in the production of 2-ethylhexanol. With transformations such as dimerization, oligomerization, and polymerization, however, the term <i>selectivity</i> takes on a rather different meaning, because these classes of reaction comprise growth processes in which it is not generally possible to apply the principles of catalyst tuning, described previously, to provide a specific chain length according to particular requirements. Thus, the olefin growth reactions involved in oligomerization and polymerization are governed by a sequence of initiation, propagation, and termination steps (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.1">Eqn 6.1</a>), and a <i>distribution</i> of oligomer/polymer chain lengths is produced. Only in special circumstances, such as dimerization and the formation of very high molecular weight polymers, can high selectivities be achieved.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Oligomerization and polymerization reactions are growth processes, which are characterized by a sequence of initiation, propagation, and termination steps. Similar selectivities to those typical of many homogeneously catalysed reactions are not generally realized.</p></aside>
<p class="equation" id="eq6.1"><img src="../images/eq6.1.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">The distribution of chain lengths for the growth reaction can be derived mathematically from the Schulz&#x2013;Flory distribution according to <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.2">Eqn 6.2</a></p>
<p class="equation"><img src="../images/eq6.2.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent">where <i>W<sub>n</sub></i> represents the weight fraction, and <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> are the rate constants for the propagation and termination steps respectively. A plot of ln<i>W<sub>n</sub></i>/<i>n</i> vs. C<sub><i>n</i></sub> is linear, with a slope of ln<i>&#x03B1;</i>. Thus the <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> ratio, which is of diagnostic value, can be obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Qualitatively, three extreme situations may be recognized:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li> <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> <img src="../images/in28_1.jpg" alt="images"/> <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>: &#x2013; propagation dominates over termination and high molecular weight polymer is the result.</li>
<li> <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> <img src="../images/in28_2.jpg" alt="images"/> <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>: &#x2013; termination is much more rapid than propagation and selective dimerization can be achieved.</li>
<li> <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> &#x2248; <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>: &#x2013; representative of the more typical intermediate situation, the rate constants are of comparable value, and one in which the Schulz&#x2013;Flory distribution of C<sub><i>n</i></sub> products is obtained.</li>
</ul>
<a id="page_60" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 60, Chapter 6 Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a>
<p class="indent">Many attempts have been made to overcome this limitation in product selectivity, with little success. The first process for the industrial oligomerization of ethylene was developed by Ziegler in the early 1950s and comprised a chain growth reaction catalysed by A1 alkyls. Reaction conditions were severe, typically 130&#x2013;250 bar pressure and 200&#x2013;250&#x00B0;C. The predominance of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-hydrogen elimination (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">Section <b>2.1</b></a>) gave linear olefins with C<sub><i>n</i></sub> = 4&#x2013;8 as the major products. Although a number of commercial olefin oligomerization processes involve alkyl aluminium growth reactions, by using a combination of homogeneous Ni-catalysed olefin oligomerization in tandem with other catalytic reactions, subsequent developments by Shell have been more successful in circumventing the limitations imposed by the Schulz&#x2013;Flory product distribution.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">With the possible exception of reaction and confinement of product within, e.g. the cavities of zeolites, the majority of attempts to overcome the intrinsic limitation in product selectivity have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="noindent">This provides a very elegant example of how it has proved possible to work within the limitations of a polymerization reaction but still optimize on the higher value products by using a combination of oligomerization, isomerization, and metathesis stages. In this case the highest value products are detergent-range alcohols in the C<sub><i>n</i></sub> range 12&#x2013;15. SHOP was commercialized in 1977 when a 115,000 te y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> capacity plant came into operation at Giesmar, Louisiana, and a second plant of 117,000 te y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> capacity was brought on stream at Stanlow, UK, in 1981. Subsequent expansions, and extension of the technology, have now led to a current total capacity of <i>ca</i>. 1.0 mte y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> For example, application of the metathesis technology inherent in SHOP was extended in 1986, under the acronym FEAST (Further Exploitation of Advanced Shell Technology), to the production of monomers and intermediates for a range of applications in speciality chemicals manufacture. Thus, co-metathesis of cyclic dienes ( e.g. cycloocta-1,5-diene) and ethylene produces high-value linear <i>&#x03B1;</i>, <i>&#x03A9;</i>-dienes such as 1,9-decadiene.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">SHOP comprises a three-stage process involving ethylene oligomerization, followed by isomerization and metathesis, for the production of detergent-range C<sub>11&#x2013;</sub>C<sub>14</sub> olefins.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The Shell Higher Olefins Process operates in three steps, namely a homogeneously catalysed ethylene growth reaction, followed by isomerization and metathesis stages, both of which use heterogeneous catalysts. The products are optimized to give olefins in the C<sub>11</sub>&#x2013;C<sub>14</sub> range which are subsequently converted into detergent-range alcohols by hydroformylation (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). Not only is the chemistry of the homogeneous catalyst system of considerable interest in the context of organometallic chemistry but the integration of the separate stages into the overall process also illustrates some important principles.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Ethylene oligomerization</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the first step of the process ethylene is selectively oligomerized (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.3">Eqn 6.3</a>) to give, in a geometric Schulz&#x2013;Flory distribution, <i>even</i> carbon number <i>linear</i> (&#x003E;99%) <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins (93&#x2013;99%) using Ni-based homogeneous catalysts obtained from the reaction of <i>bis</i>(cyclo-octadienyl) nickel with chelating P<sup>&#x2229;</sup>O ligands of the general type R<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> (R = phenyl or cyclohexyl), and <i>o</i>-R&#x2032;R&#x2033;PC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> (R&#x2032;, R&#x2033; = alkyl and/or phenyl).</p>

<p class="indent">This combination of phosphorus- <i>and</i> oxygen-chelating functionalities, which is essential to the successful operation of the catalyst, gives high activities &#x2013; values of the order of 0.6 mol ethylene mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> Ni s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> have been quoted, enabling low metal concentrations (0.001&#x2013;0.005 mol %) to be used. It also ensures solubility in the polar solvent (1,4-butanediol), which is largely immiscible with the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefin product, thus allowing facile separation from catalyst and reactants (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section <b>1.2</b></a>). An additional advantage of this method of operation is that the formation of branched olefins by secondary reactions, e.g. isomerization, is minimal because of the very low concentrations of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins in the catalyst/solvent phase.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The immiscibility of the ethylene oligomer product with the catalyst-containing phase allows easy and continuous product separation and is believed to be the key contributary factor to successful commercial operation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The reacting mixture thus comprises <i>three</i> phases, namely, solvent containing the catalyst, oligomer product, and ethylene gas. As hydrocarbon product is formed it separates from the catalyst-containing solvent phase as a separate layer. After reaction, ethylene is stripped, and the oligomer product phase is readily separated from the catalyst/solvent phase, which is in turn recycled directly to the oligomerization reactor.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The process represents the first industrial application of a biphasic liquid/liquid system in catalysis.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">High partial pressures of ethylene are required for good rates of reaction and high linearity of the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins product. The latter is characterized by a geometric growth factor <i>K</i> (<i>cf</i>. <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.1">Eqn 6.1</a>), which is normally independent of alkyl chain length, and defined by <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.4">Eqn 6.4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Control of <i>K</i> is the key to success of the process since it determines both the composition of the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefin product and the average carbon number of the overall process (see Fig. 6.1). <i>K</i> may be maintained within the range 0.75&#x2013;0.80 by variation in the nature of the catalyst. A <a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Chapter 6 Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a>value of 0.80 represents an 80% probability of adding C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> with consequent chain propagation, and 20% probability of elimination/termination with regeneration of the catalyst.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Mechanism of Ni-catalysed oligomerization</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is widely accepted that the active catalyst in ethylene oligomerization is a Ni&#x2013;H species, generated in situ under reaction conditions as indicated in Fig. 6.3. Supporting evidence for the existence of a nickel hydride has been obtained from in situ NMR spectroscopic studies in some cases. Formal insertion of ethylene into the Ni&#x2013;H bond yields a Ni&#x2013;ethyl complex which can either undergo additional multiple insertions of ethylene, and hence propagate the oligomerization, or the intermediate Ni-alkyls may <i>&#x03B2;</i>-eliminate to release the corresponding <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefin. The specific importance of the chelating <img src="../images/in52_1.jpg" alt="images"/> functionality appears to be related, at least in part, to controlling the selectivity of the reaction, the additional ligands simply serving to stabilize the complexes.</p>

As a consequence, they had poor physical properties and were highly soluble in common organic solvents.

<p class="indent">Details of co-polymerization and, in particular, the cross-over between co-polymerization and methoxycarbonylation, pose some intriguing mechanistic questions. A conceptually reasonable picture of the key steps including initiation, propagation, and termination, together with a basic understanding of the respective roles of the bidentate ligands, and anions, in controlling the alternation between CO and ethylene insertion, has been proposed. In considering mechanistic aspects, it is important to emphasize the close relationship, which is not perhaps immediately obvious, between methyl propionate formation and co-polymer production. The principal difference between the two is simply the inclusion of a propagation step in the latter mechanistic pathway, the course of the reaction being determined by the competition between propagation and termination (<i>cf</i>. <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.1">Section <b>6.1</b></a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Initiation</h3>
<p class="noindent">End-group analyses of the co-polymers, by <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, have shown the presence of 50&#x0025; ester (&#x2013;COOCH<sub>3</sub>) and 50&#x0025; ketone (&#x2013;COCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) groups, in accordance with the average product composition. However, analysis of co-formed oligomer by-products obtained with some catalysts has revealed the formation of both diester and diketone products, i.e. crossover products, in addition to the simple keto-ester. This requires the operation of two initiation and two termination mechanisms for polyketone formation. These are most simply explained in terms of the chemistry of methoxycarbonylation, in which the operation of <i>both</i> methoxycarbonyl- and hydride-based catalytic cycles has been proposed (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.5">Section <b>3.5</b></a>). <i>Two</i> equivalent initiation pathways seem viable, namely via Pd-methoxycarbonyl or Pd-hydride species. The first produces ester end-groups and starts from a Pd-methoxycarbonyl species which can be formed either by CO insertion into a Pd methoxide or by direct attack of methanol on coordinated CO (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter <b>3</b></a>, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>). Alternatively, a polymer chain can start by &#x2018;insertion&#x2019; of ethylene into a Pd hydride, ultimately producing a ketone end-group. Migratory insertions of ethylene into the Pd hydride and of CO into the resulting ethyl complex are both rapid and <i>reversible;</i> it is believed that the second ethylene insertion (into the Pd acyl) is irreversible and &#x2018;traps&#x2019; the acyl to start the chain (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#eq6.9">Eqn 6.9</a>).</p>

Olefin insertion into a Pd&#x2013;C bond, although known, is less common but does appear to be facile, particularly into Pd&#x2013;acyl bonds.

<h3 class="h3">Role of ligands and counter ions</h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of <i>cis</i> chelating bidentate phosphine ligands appears to be a prerequisite for the selective production of polyketone (although there is <i>at least</i> one exception to this generalization). This may be a consequence of the constraint, to a mutually <i>cis</i> orientation, of the growing polymer chain and &#x2018;vacant&#x2019; fourth coordination site around Pd imposed by the bidentate ligand, which provides a preference for insertion over elimination. It also ensures that the growing polymer chain-end and incoming monomers will be in the <i>cis</i> configuration required for chain propagation. In contrast, with monodentate phosphine ligands, <i>cis&#x2013;trans</i> isomerization is possible, and <i>trans</i> geometries are actually preferred on electronic grounds, thus allowing ready methanolysis of alkyl or acyl intermediates in preference to insertion of CO/ethylene. The weakly coordinating anions are also key components of the catalyst composition and their role has been <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 6 Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a>interpreted in terms of enhancement of the overall electrophilicity of the cationic Pd centre by ion-pairing effects, mediated to some degree by the polarity of the reaction solvent, which is usually methanol.</p>

<p class="indent">The explanation for the perfect 1:1 alternation by CO and ethylene in chain propagation is not entirely clear, particularly since, in the absence of CO, the same catalysts can show even higher activity for the dimerization of ethylene to butenes, as a consequence of which double insertion of ethylene might be considered to be highly probable. Nevertheless, this particular process for the production of an ethylene/CO co-polymer constitutes an example of transition metal-catalysed polymerization with almost perfect control over selectivity (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.1">Section <b>6.1</b></a>). These catalysts have also been demonstrated to catalyse the alternating <i>co</i>- or <i>ter</i>-polymerization of higher olefins, including propylene, styrene, and dicyclopentadiene, thus providing considerable scope for farther development and refinement of this new range of engineering thermoplastic polymers.</p>

Currently two principal varieties are produced, by coordination, rather than free radical polymerization. These comprise high-density (0.97) polyethylene (HDPE), which is a linear polymer with a m.p. of about 136&#x00B0;C, and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which represents a family of polyethylenes intermediate between high- and low-density materials.

<h3 class="h3">Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts</h3>
<p class="noindent">Classical Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts, for the discovery of which the Nobel prize was awarded to the inventors in 1963, are <i>heterogeneous</i> materials formed by interaction of TiCl<sub>3</sub> and Al alkyls, or TiCl<sub>4</sub> supported on MgCl<sub>2</sub>, with AlEt<sub>3</sub> as co-catalyst, and account for about 60&#x0025; of the worldwide production capacity of polyolefins. They are active at 25&#x00B0;C and 1 bar, in sharp contrast to the severe conditions required for the original thermal, radical-initiated, polymerization of ethylene. Such heterogeneous catalysts are complex systems, with different active sites, and the polymer structure can be influenced only to a limited degree. In addition, non-uniformity of the active sites in these heterogeneous catalysts renders mechanistic study and rational design of modified catalysts extremely difficult. Notwithstanding the fact that heterogeneous catalysts are preferred, largely because of chemical engineering requirements (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section <b>1.2</b></a>), among the great number of Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts, those that comprise <i>nominally</i> homogeneous systems have been preferentially studied in the past in order to attempt to understand the elementary steps of polymerization. Nevertheless, even these are not necessarily soluble under reaction conditions, and many questions remain unanswered concerning the mechanistic details of coordination polymerization. For example, basic <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Chapter 6 Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a>facts such as the oxidation state and structure of the catalytically active metal site, and the nature of the insertion mechanism, are not well established in many cases.

<p class="indent">Alternatives to Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts, specifically for the manufacture of polyethylene (they are inactive towards propylene), are the chromium-based catalysts, e.g. Cr/silica, developed by Phillips. These are less active than Ziegler&#x2013;Natta catalysts and give high molecular weight rigid polymethylene-type polymers. One preparative route to the Phillips catalysts involves the anchoring of metallocenes such as <i>bis</i>(<i>&#x03C0;</i>-cyclopentadienyl)Cr to silica by interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups, and provides an illustration of one of the first industrial applications of the concept of surface organometallic chemistry (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.5">Section <b>2.5</b></a>) &#x2013; and indeed pre-dated the terminology by at least two decades!</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps of more direct relevance to applications of <i>homogeneous</i> catalysis, the most recent developments in polymerization chemistry concern (i) the use of methylaluminoxanes (MAOs) as activators to provide a range of highly active metallocene catalysts and (ii) the unprecedented (in the light of prior knowledge of polymerization catalysts) discovery of highly active complexes of the <i>later</i> transition metals, particularly Fe, Co, and Ni, containing multidentate N&#x2013; and <img src="../images/in52_9.jpg" alt="images"/> ligands bearing bulky substituents. Some of the most recent do not even require activation by MAO and may therefore be described as truly &#x2018;single-site&#x2019; catalysts. Both these developments are beginning to have an impact on commercially produced polymers.</p>

In addition, because of their highly oxophilic nature, a practical disadvantage is their susceptibility to deactivation by a range of poisons. These include traces of O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO, which in turn requires that the monomer, solvents, and co-catalysts must be scrupulously purified before use.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Later transition metals are less susceptible to poisoning than earlier transition metal polymerization catalysts, but susceptibility to <i>&#x03B2;</i>-elimination has hitherto restricted their applications to olefin oligomerization.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The later, more typical, transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni are considerably less oxophilic, and therefore much more resistant to such deactivation processes. They also display much greater functional group tolerance, thus offering the possibility of polar co-monomer incorporation, e.g. acrylates. However, their ready susceptibility to chain termination by <i>&#x03B2;</i>-elimination (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.1">Section <b>2.1</b></a>) has hitherto largely precluded commercial applications in polymerization and restricted it to olefin oligomerization (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.1">Section <b>6.1</b></a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A recent, and largely unprecedented, advance is the demonstration that, with appropriate attention to the surrounding ligand environment, later transition metals can indeed provide extremely active catalysts for olefin polymerization. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the Fe complexes (<b>6.3</b>), and their Co, Ni, and Pd(II) analogues, containing tridentate bis(imino)pyridyl ligands of the type {[(2,6-ArN=CMe)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N]MX<sub>2</sub>}, where Ar = 2,6-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(Pr<sup>i</sup>)<sub>2</sub> prepared by Schiff base condensation, are, after activation with MAO (at considerably lower MAO:M ratios than those required by the zirconocene-based systems) capable of polymerizing ethylene to high molecular weight polymers. The key to high polymer production using these aryl-substituted <i>&#x03B1;</i>-di-imine systems is believed to be the incorporation, on the aryl rings, of bulky <i>ortho</i> substituents which greatly retard the rate of chain transfer and <i>&#x03B2;</i>-elimination.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The key to the generation of polymerization rather than oligomerization catalysts is the use of bulky substituents on the ligands which have the effect of inhibiting termination by <i>&#x03B2;</i>-elimination.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The report of the use of Fe-based catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene for the first time is particularly notable. They are highly active and selective, giving products ranging from liquid <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins to high molecular weight polyethylene depending on the nature of the aryl substitution pattern.</p>

<p class="indent">The idea that late transition metal chelating complexes could polymerize <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins has stimulated a search for other ligand systems. Another significant development in this area concerns a report, in <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Olefin oligomerization and polymerization</a> January 2000, of the design of a family of highly active late transition metal catalysts that are tolerant of both heteroatoms and reagents which have not been subject to stringent purification procedures. Furthermore, they are claimed <i>not</i> to require activation by MAO, and thus represent the first example of <i>truly</i> one-component polymerization catalysts. A typical ethylene polymerization catalyst precursor (<b>6.4</b>) contains a functionalized bidentate salicylaldimine <img src="../images/in42_3.jpg" alt="images"/> chelating ligand, with PPh<sub>3</sub> and phenyl groups as ancillary ligands coordinated to the Ni centre. The resulting polyethylene is of high molecular weight and exhibits a low degree of branching in the polymer chain. Most importantly, functionalized olefins may be polymerized. Typical catalytic activities of these one-component polymerization catalysts, at 7 bar C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and ambient temperature, are compared with the MAO activated systems in <a href="#tab_6.2">Table 6.2.</a></p>

<p class="indent">In conclusion, these new developments with catalysts containing the later transition metals have highlighted some attractive advantages over both the existing Ziegler&#x2013;Natta and metallocene catalyst ranges. In addition to tolerance of functional groups on the substrate, they also offer considerable scope for tailoring/fine-tuning of activity and stereospecificity by controlled variation of functional groups attached to the salicylaldimine ligands. However, a specific issue that requires resolution concerns the poor thermal stability of these new catalysts in relation to the typical operating temperatures of 120&#x00B0;-140&#x00B0;C required by polyolefin manufacturers. Probably the most attractive commercial option at present is the use of iron-based catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene to long chain <i>&#x03B1;</i>-olefins (<i>cf</i>. <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec6.2">Section <b>6.2</b></a>).</p>
