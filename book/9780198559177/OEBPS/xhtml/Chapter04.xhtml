<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:3em;">4.1 Background to manufacturing routes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The acetyl chemicals family includes acetic acid, acetaldehyde, methyl acetate, acetic anhydride and vinyl acetate, and the current capacity for their manufacture is <i>ca.</i> 7 mte y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> worldwide.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Acetic acid is second only to methanol as a C<sub>1</sub> -derived chemical.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="sidebar-left">The principal applications of acetyl chemicals are as solvents (particularly for <i>p</i>-xylene oxidation) and vinyl acetate monomer for polymer manufacture.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Acetic acid has been manufactured in large quantities for 150 years and is second only to methanol as a C<sub>1</sub> -derived organic chemical. It is used in a wide range of end-products, e.g. vinyl acetate (50%), acetate esters (15%) (solvents), as a solvent specifically for the oxidation of <i>p</i>-xylene to terephthalic acid (10%), and in food and pharmaceutical applications. Vinyl acetate represents the largest and fastest growing outlet for acetic acid as a monomer or co-monomer in a variety of polymers that are major components of emulsion paints, adhesives and textiles. Acetic anhydride may be produced by the carbonylation of methyl acetate, the energy-intensive and relatively inefficient &#x2018;ketene&#x2019; route, or by the oxidation of acetaldehyde. It is used mainly as an acetylating agent and in cellulose acetate manufacture (films and packaging materials).</p>
<p class="indent">Step changes in the processes used for the production of acetic acid and the acetyl chemicals, most of which involve homogeneous catalysis, or at least initiation, by transition metal ions or complexes, during this 150-year period reflect some of the underlying general trends in the chemical industry. These include the shift towards more energy-efficient processes, inherently safer routes (reductive vs. oxidative processes) and, as they have become readily available, more economic feedstocks. Currently, methanol carbonylation accounts for more than 60% of the world production of acetic acid.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec4.1.1">
<h3 class="h3">Early production routes</h3>
<p class="noindent">In common with many other organic chemicals in the early days of the chemical industry, acetic acid was initially produced (in the 1850s) mainly by fermentation, together with the bacterial souring of wine. The distillation of wood was found to yield more concentrated solutions of acetic acid (15 to over 90%) and 10,000 te y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> was still produced in the USA using this route in the mid-1960s.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The original production route (1850&#x2013;1930) to acetic acid was based on fermentation.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Acetylene</h3>

<p class="noindent">The first major synthetic process was based on the hydration, or hydrolysis, of acetylene to acetaldehyde catalysed by Hg<sup>2+</sup>, followed by oxidation to either acetic acid or acetic anhydride, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.1">Eqns 4.1</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.2">4.2</a>.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The use of acetylene as feedstock for the manufacture of acetyl chemicals proved to be energy-intensive and hazardous, and was environmentally unacceptable.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Further reaction of acetaldehyde with acetic anhydride affords ethylidene diacetate which can be thermally de-acetylated to form vinyl acetate with the elimination of acetic acid (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.3">Eqn 4.3</a>).</p>

<p class="equation" id="eq4.3"><img src="../images/eq_4.3.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Acetylene itself was manufactured from coke via the calcium carbide route, a highly energy-intensive process. Notwithstanding the disadvantages, namely that acetylene is hazardous and difficult to handle, and that Hg was lost in product recovery, thus making it environmentally unacceptable (certainly by present-day standards), this process was used extensively in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative production route, particularly in the USA, was based on the oxidation of ethanol catalysed by Co and Cr acetates. In this process metal ions are involved in the initiation step, namely radical generation (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.3">Section <b>1.3</b></a>), but the oxidation reaction itself is believed to involve a radical chain mechanism. These two routes were the predominant processes used for the production of acetic acid for over 30 years, until the period 1955&#x2013;1960, when two new major step-changes occurred, largely in parallel with the increased availability of oil-based feedstocks and the development of the petrochemical industry.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Paraffin oxidation</h3>

<p class="noindent">The first step-change involved the discovery of two alkane oxidation processes, namely the short-chain, e.g. butane, oxidation developed by Celanese in the USA, and the naphtha oxidation process discovered by BP in Europe. In the former a metal salt, usually Co acetate, is used as initiator to direct the cleavage of the alkane chain to give maximum yields of acetic acid (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.4">Eqn 4.4</a>).</p>

Paraffin hydrocarbon oxidation processes are still operated today, and are competitive in situations where co-products can be marketed successfully, but in general have fallen out of favour relative to other newly developed technologies.</p>

These homogeneously catalysed processes include a high-pressure version, using halide-promoted Co catalysts, developed by BASF in 1966, and the much lower pressure halide-promoted Rh- and Ir-based processes, introduced by Monsanto and BP Chemicals in 1970 and 1996, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Important subsequent extensions to Rh-based carbonylation technology have included a process for the carbonylation of methyl acetate to acetic anhydride (Tennessee Eastman/Halcon), which also comprises the first totally synthesis gas-based route to this important intermediate, and a co-carbonylation process for the conversion of methanol and methyl acetate to acetic acid and acetic anhydride respectively, developed by BP Chemicals in 1988.</p>

<p class="noindent">The overall trends in the production of acetic acid and acetyl chemicals reflect a shift away from high-energy (and therefore usually expensive) intermediates such as acetylene, towards lower-energy materials (and successively more economic feedstocks) such as paraffins, olefins, methanol and synthesis gas.</p>
<p class="indent">Particularly important features in this context have been the Wacker process, which proved to be a major step in the displacement of acetylene as a starting material for the manufacture of organic chemicals, and the subsequent displacement of ethylene oxidation by C<sub>1</sub> feedstocks such as CH<sub>3</sub>OH and the use of carbonylation-based technology. In common with hydroformylation (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter <b>3</b></a>) many of the recent developments have parallels with discoveries in the use of soluble metal complexes as catalysts, as illustrated in the following discussion of the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde, the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid, and of methyl acetate to acetic anhydride.</p>

<p class="indent">However, it was not until 1956 that it was discovered (by Wacker Chemie) that the reaction could be made catalytic (in Pd) by linking it to a Cu-based redox system, i.e. (i) re-oxidizing Pd(0) with CuCl<sub>2</sub>, and (ii) subsequently re-oxidizing the resultant Cu(I) with molecular oxygen, Eqns <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.8">4.8</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.9">4.9</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In commercial practice, two methods of operation have been developed. In the original two-stage Wacker process, ethylene is stoichiometrically oxidized to acetaldehyde by a solution containing PdCl<sub>2</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub> in dilute HCl at 10 bar total pressure and 100&#x2013;110&#x00B0;C. After separation of acetaldehyde the aqueous solution containing PdCl<sub>2</sub> and CuCl is continuously circulated through a second reactor, in which the catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air under similar reaction conditions, after which it is then recycled to the first stage.</p>
<p class="indent">In the single-stage variant developed by Hoechst the catalyst is regenerated in situ. An O<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> mixture is fed to an aqueous solution of PdCl<sub>2</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub> at 3 bar pressure and 100&#x2013;120&#x00B0;C. In both cases the heat produced by the reaction is used to remove the volatile acetaldehyde by fractionation without catalyst decomposition. Although the two-stage process is more capital intensive, it allows the use of air rather than oxygen, thus avoiding explosion hazards inherent in the mixing of oxygen and ethylene.</p>

Although Ni catalysts have been demonstrated to provide high selectivities to acetic acid, the extent of side-reactions such as hydrocarbon formation has proved prohibitively significant. Hence, although the original BASF process remains in operation today, all subsequent developments and process improvements in methanol carbonylation have been based on Monsanto-type technology which clearly has significant process advantages, dominates all production capacity, and now accounts for approximately 60% of acetic acid manufacture.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The &#x2018;low water&#x2019; variation was introduced to reduce the requirement for relatively high levels of water in the original Monsanto process. Operation under such conditions entails a difficult and expensive distillation step.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="sidebar-left">The &#x2018;low water&#x2019; process variant uses LiI as an additional, ionic, iodide promoter of the reaction.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The first significant modification, the &#x2018;low water&#x2019; process introduced by Hoechst Celanese, directly addressed one of the problems inherent in the original process, namely the requirement for a relatively high water content (typically 15 wt%) in the reacting system. This was necessary to maintain catalyst activity, to achieve economically viable production rates, and to maintain good catalyst stability. Because of the high water content in the reactor, the separation of acetic acid represents both a major energy usage and a capital cost penalty in the process. As a consequence much research effort has been directed towards devising modifications which allow operation at low water <i>(ca.</i> 5 wt%) concentrations, and which, at the same time, compensate for both the inherent decrease in reaction rate and catalyst stability under typical Monsanto reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hoechst Celanese modification addressed this problem by the incorporation of an inorganic iodide promoter, LiI, at relatively high concentrations and above an I<sup>&#x2013;</sup> level not previously thought to be effective as a catalyst stabilizer and promoter. This has enabled the development of a &#x2018;low water&#x2019; variant of the original Monsanto technology. Benefits of the use of LiI include (i) stabilization of the Rh catalyst at low water concentrations by preventing precipitation as insoluble RhI<sub>3</sub> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section <b>4.3</b></a>), (ii) acting as an additional promoter of catalytic activity, and (iii) effectively optimizing [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> concentrations at low water levels. It has been proposed that the additional promotional role of inorganic iodide is associated with the <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 4 Acetic acid and acetyl chemicals</a> formation of an as yet unidentified highly nucleophilic five-coordinate dianionic intermediate [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>L]<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> (L = CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>) which is more active towards oxidative addition of methyl iodide than [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup>.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">This process for acetic anhydride manufacture represents the first example of an integrated synthesis gas process based entirely on coal as feedstock.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The second significant modification was the development, by Tennessee Eastman, of the carbonylation of methyl acetate to acetic anhydride, which also comprised the first example of a totally integrated synthesis gas-based process for such chemistry, dependent entirely on coal as feedstock (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.29">Eqn 4.29</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">This 227,000 te y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> capacity process came on stream at Kingsport, Tennessee, in October 1983 and a closely related process was completed by Hoechst in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p class="indent">The Tennessee Eastman plant is built on the site of a coal mine. Good-quality coal is gasified to CO/H<sub>2</sub> which in turn is converted into methanol. The process then operates in two stages, namely the reaction of methanol with acetic acid to give methyl acetate, followed by carbonylation to acetic anhydride. Both processes are highly selective and the overall selectivity is believed to be in excess of 96%, based on methanol. The acetic anhydride produced is used internally and is converted, with cellulose, into cellulose acetate for applications as photographic film bases, textile fibres, and cigarette filters. A by-product of the cellulose esterification is acetic acid, which is utilized in the esterification of methanol produced separately from CO/H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">As with the Monsanto system an iodide-promoted Rh catalyst is used at operating conditions of 50 bar (CO containing some H<sub>2</sub>) and 190&#x00B0;C. The presence of H<sub>2</sub> is required primarily to reduce [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> to [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and to maintain to a minimum the presence of unreactive Rh(III) species which otherwise accumulate at the low water conditions required for acetic anhydride production (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section 4.3</a>). In order to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity, which is lower than under typical Monsanto conditions, catalytic promoters such as LiI are also employed together with co-catalysts such as quaternary phosphonium iodides.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">In the presence of additional co-promoters equivalent rates of methyl acetate carbonylation to those of methanol carbonylation are achieved.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The organometallic chemistry of methyl acetate carbonylation is closely related to that previously described for the carbonylation of methanol with a rate-determining oxidative addition of CH<sub>3</sub>I to Rh and rapid migratory insertion comprising the key steps (see <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>). For methyl acetate carbonylation, methanol is replaced by methyl acetate (or dimethyl ether) in the organic part of the reaction cycle and acetate is the leaving group rather than hydroxyl.</p>

<p class="indent">The role of Li is thought to be related to promotion of the ionic portion of the organic cycle. Here, Lil rather than HI reacts with methyl acetate to yield methyl iodide which is carbonylated. Lithium acetate then reacts rapidly with the acetyl iodide to give the anhydride. This effectively decreases the steady-state concentration of acetyl iodide, the presence of which can partially poison the Rh catalyst through the formation of molecular iodine. In contrast to methanol carbonylation, therefore, generation of methyl iodide via HI constitutes the minor reaction pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain economic factors particular to Tennessee Eastman, for example substantial local deposits of high-grade coal, internal use of product acetic anhydride, recycling of acetic acid, etc., make the process particularly favourable to these operators, and the production of acetic anhydride by the carbonylation of methyl acetate provides another example of the trend away from oil-based feedstocks towards coal and/or natural gas.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">This development, which is claimed to be the most significant breakthrough in the industry in 25 years, represents the first commercial use of iridium as a carbonylation catalyst. The technology has been incorporated into two existing plants, in the USA and Korea, and in a new 500,000 te y<sup>-1</sup> capacity plant currently under construction in Malaysia.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Finally, as referred to briefly in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.3">Section <b>4.3</b></a>, a remarkable step-change to existing technology has been the introduction, in 1996, of the &#x2018;Cativa&#x2019; technology by BP Chemicals (now BP Amoco), incorporating the first commercial use of Ir, rather than Rh, as a catalyst for methanol carbonylation. The process gives improvements via much higher reactivity coupled with lower by-product formation and lower energy requirements for the purification of the product acid.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the catalytic activity of Ir in methanol carbonylation has been known for many years, it is characterized by both lower activity and selectivity than Rh <i>under typical Monsanto process conditions</i>. This is partly a consequence of the operation of a more complex catalytic cycle which involves both neutral and anionic iridium carbonyl halides as intermediates. However, under <i>modified</i> reaction conditions, particularly the &#x2018;low water&#x2019; conditions preferred in the more recent technology, Ir catalysts have proved not only <i>significantly more stable</i> than their Rh counterparts but also <i>more active</i>.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Ir catalysts are considerably more stable than Rh under the preferred &#x2018;low water&#x2019; operating conditions and are also more active.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">At operating pressures and temperatures similar to those of the original Rh-catalysed process, a particularly significant feature of the new development is the high stability of the Ir catalyst at water levels as low as 0.5 wt%, which, by reducing distillation requirements, provides a highly desirable operating process advantage (see Hoechst Celanese development above). Significant kinetic differences between Rh and Ir catalysts have also emerged (Table 4.2). Oxidative addition of CH<sub>3</sub>I is very rapid with Ir and the subsequent migratory insertion reaction now becomes rate determining, in complete contradistinction to the corresponding Rh chemistry. Another fundamental difference is that whereas high levels of CH<sub>3</sub>I are required to give the highest reaction rates in Rh systems, with Ir the rate is largely independent of [CH<sub>3</sub>I]. The inverse dependence on ionic iodide concentration suggests that very high reaction rates should be attainable by operating at low total iodide concentrations. It also implies that the inclusion of a species capable of assisting iodide abstraction could enhance the new rate-limiting step. Catalyst promoters containing Ru, Os, and Re have been found to be effective in this respect. In addition, they have been shown to act as CO donors, which has the <i>net</i> effect of decreasing the <i>P</i><sub>CO</sub> dependency of the unpromoted system.</p>

Also, in commercial operation, the formation of by-products such as propionic acid (via acetaldehyde), is substantially reduced.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Promoters</h3>
<p class="noindent">The role(s) of a range of promoters/co-catalysts of these Rh- and Ir- catalysed carbonylation reactions, although as yet incompletely understood, has allowed the development of several important process variations of the pioneering Monsanto technology. Further process improvements, incorporating other co-promoters, must be considered highly likely.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Heterogenization</h3>
<p class="noindent">Attempts at the &#x2018;heterogenization&#x2019; of methanol carbonylation catalysts have been uniformly unsuccessful, despite many initial claims to the contrary (<i>cf</i>. hydroformylation, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) and the prospects for a successful solution to this problem must be considered remote.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Feedstocks</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we have seen the progression of step-changes in both the processes and feedstocks used for the manufacture of acetic acid and the acetyl chemicals during the past 150 years. What of the future?<br/>The next step-change in the acetic acid saga seems most likely to emerge in the form of a direct route from either CH<sub>4</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, e.g. the oxidative carbonylation of methane to methanol and acetic acid (Eqns <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.37">4.37</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.38">4.38</a>), which has been recently demonstrated over Rh catalysts (at extremely low conversions!), or the selective oxidation of ethane (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#eq4.39">Eqn 4.39</a>).</p>
