<p class="sidebar-left">Co-monomers for Nylon 6,6&#x2032; production are adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine (HMD), both of which are traditionally derived from benzene.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Benzene has been used traditionally as the primary hydrocarbon source for the manufacture of Nylon, a polyamide, via the intermediates adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine (HMD). Adipic acid is manufactured first, a portion retained for incorporation into the final polyamide and the remainder converted to HMD, the amine comonomer. Condensation polymerization (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.1">Eqn 5.1</a>) of these comonomers gives Nylon 6,6&#x2032;, the most common form of Nylon. The numbering scheme is derived from the number of carbon atoms in each of the acid and amine components.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Both adipic acid and HMD production routes are multistage processes.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The production route involves a complex sequence of steps in which benzene is first reduced to cyclohexane, oxidized to a cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol mixture (called KA, <i>K</i>etone <i>A</i>lcohol), which is then oxidized further to adipic acid. The oxidation of cyclohexane to KA is carried out in the liquid phase with Co or Mn naphthenate catalysts. Oxidation occurs by a radical ion process in which the transition metal ions act as radical initiators (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.3">Section <b>1.3</b></a>). Conversions are limited to &#x003C;10% in order to maximize selectivity to KA. The unseparated KA mixture is then further oxidized with nitric acid over a V/Cu catalyst to give adipic acid in 96% selectivity. An alternative to the corrosive acid oxidant, utilizing Cu and Mn acetate catalysts, has also been commercialized. Part of the purified adipic acid is set aside for nylon manufacture as acid co-monomer, and the remainder is converted, first into adiponitrile, and then HMD. This involves four process stages, namely amination of adipic acid to diammonium adipate, catalysed by boron phosphate in the vapour phase at 350&#x00B0;C, followed by two sequential dehydration steps, giving adipic acid diamide and finally adiponitrile. Overall selectivities of up to 90% adiponitrile are feasible.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The conversion of adipic acid into HMD involves four stages.</p>
</aside>
<a id="page_51" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 51, Chapter 5 Nylon intermediates: buta-1,3-diene hydrocyanation</a>
<p class="indent">Adiponitrile is then purified before final conversion, by hydrogenation, to HMD (95%) over a heterogeneous Fe catalyst at 300 bar pressure and 150&#x00B0;C. Adipic acid and HMD are combined in water or methanol solution, from which a pure 1:1 adduct (Nylon salt) may be crystallized. The condensation polymerization is then carried out by heating the salt to 250&#x2013;270&#x00B0;C, with continual removal of the water formed, to give Nylon 6,6&#x2032;.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Alternative feedstocks for Nylon manufacture</h3>
<p class="noindent">The multi-step sequence of reactions required for the manufacture of Nylon from benzene has provided a commercial incentive to introduce step changes by the development of simpler routes based on alternative feedstocks, particularly for the production of adiponitrile. The C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbons propylene and buta-l,3-diene comprise the most obvious alternative building blocks. Indeed, recent developments at BASF have demonstrated a viable alternative production route to adipic acid via the selective dicarbonylation of buta-l,3-diene (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.5">Section <b>3.5</b></a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<h3 class="h3">Buta-l,3-diene</h3>
<p class="noindent">Buta-l,3-diene also provides a viable feedstock for adiponitrile manufacture. The original three-stage indirect hydrocyanation process, developed by DuPont, involved chlorination of buta-l,3-diene to a mixture of chlorobutenes, followed by hydrocyanation to adiponitrile. However, overall reaction selectivity was poor, the process required the disposal of large quantities of NaCl, and improved technology was required.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>direct</i> hydrocyanation of butadiene to adiponitrile, subsequently developed by DuPont, is based on the Ni-catalysed double <i>anti</i>-Markovnikov addition of HCN to butadiene (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.4">Eqn 5.4</a>).</p>
<p class="equation" id="eq5.4"><img src="../images/eq5.4.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">The process was developed during the 1960s and first commercialized in 1971. It is now operated at three locations, Orange (Texas), Victoria (Texas) &#x2013; the latter a conversion in 1983 from a plant which used the indirect hydrocyanation route via chlorobutenes &#x2013; and in France in a Rhone Poulenc/DuPont joint venture, representing a total world capacity approaching 1.0 mte y<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Ni-catalysed hydrocyanation is a three-stage homogeneously catalysed process for which there is no heterogeneous counterpart.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This homogeneously catalysed process, for which there is no known heterogeneous counterpart (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.2">Section <b>1.2</b></a>), is carried out in three stages:</p>
<ul class="uls">
<li>addition of the first equivalent of HCN,</li>
<li>double-bond isomerization, and</li>
<li>concurrent further isomerization and addition of the second equivalent of HCN.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">An important feature of the process is the mild operating conditions which are used.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Each of these is operated under mild conditions of pressure and temperature, relative to those detailed in Chapters <a href="Chapter03.xhtml"><b>3</b></a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml"><b>4</b></a>, and involves catalysis by air- and moisture-sensitive nickel phosphite complexes of the type NiL<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">First stage</h3>
<p class="noindent">This involves the production of mononitriles by the addition of one molecule of HCN to buta-l,3-diene catalysed by a Ni&#x2013;aryl phosphite complex, in the presence of excess ligand, and produces a 70:30 mixture of C<sub>5</sub> mononitriles (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.5">Eqn 5.5</a>). These comprise the desired linear 1,4-addition product, 3-pentenenitrile (containing a minor amount of 4-pentenenitrile), and the undesired branched product of 1,2-addition, 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The reaction is operated above 70&#x00B0;C and at a modest pressure sufficient to ensure that unreacted buta-l,3-diene remains condensed. The isomers are separated by distillation and the branched product circulated to the second stage.</p>
<a id="page_53" class="page" style="width:65%;">Page 53, Chapter 5 Nylon intermediates: buta-1,3-diene hydrocyanation</a>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Second stage</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this stage the undesired 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile is isomerized into predominantly 3-pentenenitrile using a similar Ni catalyst, to which has been added a Lewis acid promoter such as ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.6">Eqn 5.6</a>).</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">Favourable thermodynamics prevail for the isomerization of the undesired isomer to 3-pentenenitrile.</p>

</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Third stage</h3>
<p class="noindent">The third and final stage involves both internal double-bond migration to the more reactive 4-pentenenitrile and selective <i>anti</i>-Markovnikov addition of the second molecule of HCN with a similar catalyst system (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.7">Eqn 5.7</a>).</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">A combination of isomerization to terminal pentenenitrile and addition of a second molecule of HCN is also promoted by the presence of Lewis acids.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">At this point it is fortuitous that 3-pentenenitrile isomerizes to 4-pentenenitrile more rapidly than to the thermodynamically preferred 2-pentenenitrile (by a factor as high as 70), since the conjugated isomer is believed to be a catalyst inhibitor. This provides a good example of <i>kinetic</i> reaction control. Temperatures required for the second addition of HCN are lower than for the first and practical conversion rates can in fact be achieved under ambient conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">The use of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> as the Lewis acid is reported to give adiponitrile in <i>ca</i>. 83% overall selectivity at 80&#x00B0;C. The subsequent replacement of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> by BPh<sub>3</sub>, a Lewis acid of greater steric bulk, has provided a significant improvement in selectivity (to &#x003E;95% at 99% conversion) in the third stage at lower operating temperatures (40&#x2013;50&#x00B0;C). The only major by-product of the process is 2-methylglutaronitrile (15%), together with a small amount of ethylsuccinonitrile (2%).</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Because of the mild operating conditions and the use of P-containing ligands, this process has proved particularly amenable to kinetic and mechanistic studies.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The chemical nature of this catalyst sytem, and the relatively mild reaction conditions under which it is effective, have made the process particularly amenable to detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies. As a consequence, a number of the postulated intermediate species involved in the individual steps of the process have been unequivocally identified from a combination of kinetic and <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopic measurements on either the actual or closely related organonickel complexes which comprise intermediates in the catalytic cycle.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Role of the ligand</h3>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The role of the ligand is critical. Phosphites are essential for high catalytic activity, and phosphites containing bulky substituents are essential for high selectivity to linear products. The use of phosphines rather than phosphites results in oxidation of Ni(O) to Ni(II) with catalyst deactivation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In these transformations the nature and role of the phosphorus ligands are very important and the hydrocyanation process is a classic example in which the catalyst has been fine-tuned, by changing the substituents attached to phosphorus, to meet selectivity requirements. Among phosphorus compounds, only phosphites produce catalysts of sustained activity. If, for example, the more commonly available range of phosphine ligands is utilized (<i>cf</i>. hydroformylation chemistry, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>), the outcome is oxidation of the nickel centre with the formation of Ni(II) cyanide complexes of the type L<sub>2</sub>Ni(CN)<sub>2</sub>, and consequent catalyst deactivation. Aryl phosphites are in fact necessary to maintain Ni in the zerovalent state during key stages of the catalytic cycle. Among the phosphites, only the relatively bulky triaryl phosphites with strongly electron-withdrawing character, e.g. P(O-<i>o</i>-tolyl)<sub>3</sub>, give highest selectivities.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of sterically bulky ligands is an effective way to enhance dissociative substitution reactions. For example, the ligand dissociation constant <i>K</i><sub>1</sub> for the reaction in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.8">Eqn 5.8</a> increases by a factor of</p>
<p class="equation" id="eq5.8"><img src="../images/eq5.8.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent">10<sup>8</sup> (from 6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;10</sup> to 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>) on replacing L = P(O-<i>p</i>-tolyl)<sub>3</sub> by P(O-<i>o</i>-tolyl)<sub>3</sub>, with a corresponding increase in the ligand cone angle (&#x03B8;) from only 128 to 141&#x00B0;; there are also minor electronic effects associated with this equilibrium constant. As a consequence, in the case of L = P(O-<i>o</i>-tolyl)<sub>3</sub>, the fourth ligand is only very weakly held, leading to relatively high concentrations of the reactive 16e complex in solution, from which it has proved possible to both isolate and characterize the discrete coordinatively unsaturated complexes NiL<sub>3</sub> and Ni(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

Spectroscopic studies in which ethylene is substituted for buta-1,3-diene have provided further support for these reaction schemes by the detection of the discrete complexes <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 5 Nylon intermediates: buta-1,3-diene hydrocyanation</a>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NiL(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)CN, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)NiL<sub>2</sub>, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)NiL<sub>3</sub>, NiL<sub>3</sub>, NiL<sub>4</sub> and HNiL<sub>3</sub>CN, where L = P(O-<i>o</i>-tolyl)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Second stage</h3>
<p class="noindent">The key role of Lewis acids in accelerating the isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile to 3-pentenenitrile has been interpreted in terms of their ability to enhance the concentration of the cationic Ni hydride species which acts as the isomerization catalyst. NMR spectroscopic studies have confirmed that the Lewis acid co-catalysts (A) coordinate strongly to the nitrogen lone electron pair of the hydrido-cyanide intermediates, with the formation of adducts of the type HNiL<sub>3</sub>CN<img src="../images/in28_dot.jpg" alt="images"/>A. Lewis acid-assisted removal of cyanide generates the cationic nickel hydride [HNiL<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#eq5.9">Eqn 5.9</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The rate of isomerization is enhanced by Lewis acid co-catalysts which increase the effective concentration of cationic Ni hydride [HNiL<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> in the system.</p>
</aside>
<p class="equation" id="eq5.9"><img src="../images/eq5.9.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the rate of isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile to the more highly thermodynamically favoured (by a factor of 9) 3-pentenenitrile is enhanced. The mechanism of isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile is believed to occur via a relatively rare C&#x2013;C cleavage reaction.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Third stage</h3>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The rate of isomerization is again enhanced by the Lewis acid. In this case however steric effects assume additional importance in influencing the selectivity to linear products; BPh<sub>3</sub> is among the most effective.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This involves a combination of isomerization of 3-pentenenitrile to 4-pentenenitrile and migratory insertion of the more highly activated C=C bond in 4-pentenenitrile into the Ni&#x2013;H bond, followed by reductive elimination of adiponitrile from the resulting &#x03C0;-allylnickel cyanide complex. The Lewis acid binds to the Ni&#x2013;CN moiety and in this case the size of the Lewis acid has a direct bearing on product selectivity &#x2013; bulkier Lewis acids favour the production of linear nitriles (<i>cf</i>. ZnCl<sub>2</sub> vs. BPh<sub>3</sub>). The exact nature of the complex from which final reductive elimination occurs is still subject to speculation. However, based on model chemistry, it seems most probable that a five-coordinate Ni hydride of the type L<sub>2</sub>NiH(CN<img src="../images/in28_dot.jpg" alt="images"/>A)(R) is involved.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, it is believed that the <i>net</i> effect of the Lewis acids on hydrocyanation is to increase the effective concentration of Ni in the catalytic loop, thereby accelerating the rate of C&#x2013;C coupling, and the rate of formation of alkenenitriles from &#x03C0;-allylnickel cyanide complexes. An additional effect, contributed by bulky Lewis acids such as BPh<sub>3</sub>, complements the steric effect of the bulky phosphite ligands in directing the second HCN addition in favour of the desired linear rather than branched products. This is presumably a consequence of destabilization of bulky branched alkyl intermediates relative to less crowded linear ones. In this way the addition of HCN <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 5 Nylon intermediates: buta-1,3-diene hydrocyanation</a>to the non-conjugated double bond in an <i>anti</i>-Markovnikov manner is facilitated.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The development of new process routes to adiponitrile has expanded the range of feedstock options available for the manufacture of Nylon since it can provide an intermediate for the manufacture of both adipic acid and HMD.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Finally, to return to the present situation concerning the production of intermediates for the manufacture of Nylon, from the foregoing commentary it will be evident that the production of adiponitrile, via either propylene or buta-1,3-diene as feedstock can represent economically viable alternative options to the multistep routes based on benzene. Adiponitrile may be either hydrogenated to HMD or hydrolysed to adipic acid to provide both intermediates for the manufacture of Nylon.</p>
<p class="indent">As in all multistage chemical processes, the economics depend on the balance of a number of factors including, in this case, the relative (and fluctuating) world prices of benzene, buta-1,3-diene, and propylene. In addition, geographical considerations, such as those countries where cheap electricity is available (<i>not</i> the UK and the majority of Europe!), can provide a significant commercial advantage for the electrohydrodimerization of acrylonitrile. In general, however, cyclohexane remains the preferred intermediate for adipic acid manufacture, but the position is less clear for adiponitrile/HMD where all three alternative feedstocks can provide commercially viable process options.</p>
