<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The potential of enzyme-like selectivities inherent in homogeneous catalysts may be realized to the full in the synthesis of fine chemicals. Heterogeneous catalysts are conspicuous by their absence in this area of chemistry.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">As is evident in previous chapters, one of the great advantages to be derived from the use of homogeneous catalysts concerns the high selectivities that may be achieved in a wide range of chemical transformations. As mechanistic understanding of homogeneous catalysis has developed to an increasingly sophisticated level, a natural progression has been to extend successful applications in the manufacture of commodity chemicals and polymer intermediates to the production of fine chemicals. Economic and regulatory issues, together with environmental factors, have provided possibly greater stimuli for this change of direction. In the context of the environment, it is worth noting that the most polluting (per tonne of product) segment of the chemical industry is <i>not</i> the commodity chemicals but the pharmaceutical sector, which produces roughly 10<sup>3</sup> times as much waste as heavy chemicals, largely as a consequence of the use of stoichiometric reactions of poor selectivity.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Global trends: commodity chemicals vs. f&#x00ED;ne chemicals</h3>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Driven by demands for increased and sustained profitability there has been a shift in emphasis, by many of the world&#x2019;s chemical manufacturers, away from traditional commodity chemicals towards &#x2018;high added value&#x2019; fine chemicals production.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Since the early 1980s there has been a shift in the emphasis of many of the world&#x2019;s major chemical industries away from commodity chemicals and polymers towards anticipated high-growth markets in smaller-volume, high-added-value products. This approach has been seen as one means of maintaining profitability in the face of increased competition in commodity chemicals. A classic example of this trend was the sale by Monsanto of its highly successful methanol carbonylation business (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter <b>4</b></a>) in order to focus its assets on opportunities offered by life sciences markets.</p>
<p class="indent">Fine or &#x2018;speciality&#x2019; chemicals include specialized polymers for electronics applications, intermediates for high-performance structural materials, and many biologically active compounds. The latter, which include pharmaceuticals, crop protection chemicals, flavours, fragrances, and food additives, have provided a particularly strong driving force for the use of homogeneous catalysts. This has been reinforced as a consequence of the eventual recognition, particularly by the pharmaceutical industry, that the application of organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis can lead to economically viable<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> alternative process routes that eliminate steps in the traditional and costly multi-stage procedures, based on conventional synthetic organic chemistry, that dominate drugs manufacture.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Economic factors: commodity vs. fine chemicals</h3>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Different economic factors dominate the production of fine chemicals relative to those prevailing in commodity chemicals manufacture.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Fine, effect, or speciality chemicals, unlike the traditional commodity products, have complex chemical structures and properties that justify a high selling price. In high added value situations such as these, where relatively small quantities of products are manufactured, factors such as catalyst costs, separation of product from catalyst and reactants, recycling/regeneration of catalysts, etc., assume reduced significance relative to that in the manufacture of commodity chemicals. This is simply because these costs can be more readily absorbed in the relatively high value of the products. Also, these are generally small-scale processes and the reaction steps tend to be carried out in a batch fashion rather than the continuous, and integrated, operation typical of the production of commodity chemicals and intermediates. The relative balance of economic factors is therefore rather different.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec7.1.3">
<h3 class="h3">Asymmetric catalysis: regulatory factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">The ultimate application of high selectivities concerns the development of catalysts for the synthesis of chiral compounds with high degrees of enantioselectivity. The need for chiral specificity in bioactive products reflects the fact that most enzymes have inherent chirality (&#x2018;handedness&#x2019;). As a consequence, attempts to manipulate biological systems through therapeutic drugs or aroma enhancers often involve use of chemicals containing chiral centres. The desired biological activity is usually associated with only one of the two stereoisomers of a chiral compound. In the extreme case, exemplified by thalidomide, one optical isomer is therapeutic and the other has serious undesired biological consequences (teratogenicity). To improve product safety, the pharmaceutical industry is producing an increasing number of products in enantiomerically pure form and it is only a matter of time before legislation will demand this as a routine requirement.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Food and drug legislation to demand the production of single enantiomers as a routine requirement in developed countries is imminent.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec7.1.4">
<h3 class="h3">Chemical advances</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the past many attempts to effect, for example, asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation led to products with disappointingly low enantiomeric excesses. This was undoubtedly a consequence of the complex nature of the surfaces of the <i>heterogeneous</i> catalysts, containing many types of reactive sites (<i>cf</i>. <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter <b>1</b></a>), that were used initially. Developments in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis have been instrumental in improving this situation beyond recognition. The discovery in the mid-1960s that L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> was effective in the treatment of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease created a sudden demand for this rather rare amino acid. This coincided with the discovery of Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst, RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which opened up the possibility of selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons under mild reaction conditions. These developments, coupled with interest in the development of synthetic routes to organophosphines containing an increasingly wide range of substituents, enabled access to the possibility of catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation, simply by the substitution of PPh<sub>3</sub> with a chiral phosphine ligand. These factors led to the development of what are arguably the most elegant applications of homogeneous catalysis, namely the synthesis of optically active organic compounds from non-chiral starting materials.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">More detailed mechanistic understanding, particularly of ligand effects in homogeneous catalysis, coupled with sophisticated ligand design, has facilitated the discovery and development of an increasing number of new homogeneous catalyst systems for the production of specific molecules in high enantiomeric excess.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Asymmetric induction can be achieved in many reactions catalysed by transition metal complexes but the first commercial application, introduced in 1974, was in fact the Monsanto synthesis of L-dopa. This represented not only a landmark in industrial asymmetric synthesis, but also provided a great incentive for research into additional applications of homogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Even so, relatively few homogeneous enantioselective catalysts have been commercialized to date. Representative examples of applications in fine chemicals manufacture are summarized in (<a href="#tab_7.1">Table 7.1</a>)</p>

<p class="noindent">The essential feature for selective synthesis of one optical isomer of a chiral substance is an asymmetric site that will bind a prochiral olefin preferentially in one conformation. The recognition of the preferred conformation can be accomplished by the use of a chiral ligand coordinated to the metal, the ligand creating what is effectively a chiral hole within the coordination sphere. An important factor in the successful application of homogeneous asymmetric catalysts has been the design and development of a range of chiral, usually <i>bidentate</i>, phosphine ligands, especially those having <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry, for use with different metal centres.

<h2 class="h2">7.2 Vitamin A</h2>
<p class="noindent">The application of homogeneous catalysis in the synthesis of fine chemicals is of course not new. One of the earliest examples involves the use of hydroformylation as a key step in the synthesis of vitamin A, developed at BASF in the late 1950s; a 600 te y<sup>-1</sup> plant has been operational since 1971. The synthesis involves a Wittig-type coupling between a vinyl-<i>&#x03B2;</i>-ionone (C<sub>15</sub>) and <i>&#x03B3;</i>-formylcrotyl acetate (C<sub>5</sub>). The former is derived from linalool which itself is obtained from petrochemical feedstocks (<i>iso</i>-butene, formaldehyde, acetone and acetylene). The production of the C<sub>5</sub> fragment requires a key <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> hydroformylation step (Fig. 7.1), in which 1-vinylethylenediacetate is converted into the corresponding <i>branched</i> aldehyde with regioselectivities of up to 80%, using a rhodium catalyst under high pressure conditions (600 bar CO/H<sub>2</sub>, 80&#x00B0;C). Thermal elimination of acetic acid yields 4-acetoxy-2-methyl crotonaldehyde, which is then coupled with the C<sub>15</sub>-ylide building block to form the C<sub>20</sub>-vitamin A acetate. An alternative process developed by Hofmann&#x2013;La Roche also includes a hydroformylation step and together these share most of the vitamin A world capacity of approximately 3000 te y<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

The catalyst remains in the mother liquor from which the rhodium can be extracted and isolated for re-use. It is reported that one pound of catalyst yields one tonne of L-dopa. In systems of this type it is evident that the catalyst costs are high, not only because they contain Rh, but also because they contain chiral phosphines which are not only difficult and expensive to synthesize but are also difficult to recover and re-use. However, in high added value situations such as these, high catalyst costs can clearly be tolerated (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.1">Section <b>7.1</b></a>).

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">An in-depth mechanistic understanding of this reaction has been developed only after many years of effort.</p>
</aside>

<p class="noindent">An in-depth understanding of the enzyme-like specificity of enantioselective hydrogenation posed a formidable scientific challenge and led to intensive study, particularly of Rh(I) catalysts bearing chelating diphosphine ligands. Recourse has been taken to previous detailed kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the role of RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> in the homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of simple olefins (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter <b>2</b></a>). Nevertheless, some unexpected lessons have been learned from this exercise.</p>
<p class="indent">It is believed that the acetamidocinnamic acid substrate coordinates to Rh through both its C=C bond and the C=0 function of the acetamide grouping, a rigid arrangement which constrains the substrate to present one face preferentially to the metal atom. The transfer of hydrogen to the bound face of the olefin generates one optical isomer specifically. However, because oxidative addition of H<sub>2</sub> to the Rh(I) complex is usually rate-limiting, detectable quantities of the more stable olefinic complexes have been found to accumulate in solution. Perhaps the most surprising and significant conclusion from this mechanistic work, which provides an important take-home message to <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> <i>all</i> practitioners of catalysis, is that the <i>major</i> product arises from the <i>less-stable</i> initial olefin complex which, in solution, is undetectable by spectroscopic methods. The rate-limiting reaction of the weaker complex with H<sub>2</sub> is clearly sufficiently faster than that of the stronger complex and dominates the kinetics of the overall process. It therefore determines the chirality of the product, since the oxidative addition of H<sub>2</sub> and subsequent steps appear to be irreversible.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">The Largest-scale application of homogeneous asymmetric catalysis includes a key isomerization step in the synthetic route to L-menthol.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">A very significant example in the development of asymmetric homogeneous catalysis concerns the isomerization of olefins. A synthetic route to enantiomerically pure menthol, one of the most ubiquitous fragrances and food additives (spearmint), which requires a key enantioselective isomerization step, has been developed by Takasago Int. Corp., Japan. It is operated on a 1500 te y<sup>-1</sup> scale, and represents the world&#x2019;s largest application of asymmetric catalysis.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The isomerization reaction of an allylic amine to an enamine represents the first commercial application of the BINAP ligand, discovered and developed by Noyori.</p>
<p class="sidebar-left" style="margin-top:3em;">The key reaction in the process appears to be the generation of the first chiral centre by this enantioselective isomerization step.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">As observed with catalytic hydrogenation in the manufacture of L-dopa, a metal centre, to which one face of a prochiral olefin preferentially coordinates, should also be able to effect a stereoselective 1,3-hydrogen shift to produce specifically one of the two optical isomers of the product olefin. This possibility has been realized commercially for the isomerization of an allylic amine to an enamine. The key to success has been the use, once again, of Rh-based catalysts, in this case in combination with the BINAP ligand (<b>7.3</b>), one which has also proved useful in the enantioselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones. The sequence of reactions involved in the production of L-menthol is summarized in Fig. 7.4. <i>&#x03B2;</i>-Pinene, a natural terpene, is first pyrolysed to form myrcene. Addition of Et<sub>2</sub>NH catalysed by Bu<sup>n</sup>Li yields diethylgeranylamine and its <i>Z</i>-isomer, diethylnerylamine. Either of these allylic amines may be isomerized to (<i>R</i>)-citronellal (<i>E</i>)-enamine, but the &#x2018;handedness&#x2019; of the product depends on the chirality of the BINAP ligand present in the catalytic Rh precursor, [Rh(&#x00B1;)-(BINAP)(COD)]ClO<sub>4</sub>. The reaction is operated on a 7 tonne batch basis at substrate:catalyst ratios of 8000&#x2013;10,000:1. Complete conversion to the enamine (in 98% enantiomer excess), at turnover numbers (TON) of >400,000 occurs after 15 h at 100&#x00B0;C. The product is distilled directly from the reaction mixture at low pressure and the active catalytic residue can be re-used directly. In commercial practice the <i>p</i>-tolyl analogue of BINAP is preferred since it enhances catalyst stability and solubility, thus improving the degree of recycling. Hydrolysis of the enamine with cold aqueous acetic acid gives synthetic <i>R</i>(+)-citronellal, in an optical purity of 96&#x2013;99%, which is much greater than the highest value of the natural compound (82%). As a consequence the complex multistep synthesis shown in <a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a> is <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Fine chemicals manufacture</a>economically competitive with production of menthol from natural sources. The key appears to lie in the creation of the first chiral centre by the enantioselective isomerization reaction. The subsequent Lewis acid-catalysed ring closure is fortuitously stereospecific and gives a single diastereomer with the desired configuration. Reduction of the remaining alkene double bond over a conventional heterogeneous Raney Ni catalyst completes the menthol synthesis.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">Enantioselective epoxidation has the merit that itcreates two chiral centres simultaneously.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Together with hydrogenation and isomerization, epoxidation completes the trio of commercially significant applications of enantioselective homogeneously catalysed reactions. Stereospecific olefin epoxidation is distinctive in that it creates two chiral centres simultaneously; it is also useful for kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of chiral olefinic compounds.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Enantioselective Ti epoxidation catalysts offer selectivity advantages over V and Mo, but are limited to allylic alcohols as substrates.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The discovery that Ti complexes containing asymmetric ligands can catalyse the enantioselective oxidation of allylic alcohols to the corresponding epoxyalcohols has been of considerable impact. Such catalysts are both highly selective and convenient to use, offer advantages over the chiral complexes of V and Mo discovered previously, and as a consequence are used commercially in the synthesis of several speciality products in which biological activity is confined to a particular isomer. The Sharpless oxidation employs a catalyst prepared by treating a Ti(IV) alkoxide with a tartrate ester such as the natural (+) isomer of diethyl tartrate. Although they are <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> rather sluggish catalysts (and are in fact used almost in reagent quantities in some transformations), and require the handling of organic peroxides on a large scale, they have the advantage of giving exceptionally clean, selective reactions. Restriction to the oxidation of allylic alcohols represents a major limitation of these systems; homoallylic alcohols are oxidized less cleanly and the oxidation of simple olefins shows little enantioselectivity.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Sharpless chemistry is utilized in a key asymmetric epoxidation step in the manufacture of (+)-disparlure, the gypsy moth pheromone.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Probably the best known of the applications of Sharpless chemistry is the synthesis of a chiral epoxide as an intermediate to (+)-disparlure, the pheromone for the gypsy moth, commercialized by J. T. Baker in 1981. The synthesis of (+)-disparlure employs the enantioselective epoxidation of Z-2-tridecan-1-ol with <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide at &#x2013;40&#x00B0;C for 4 days in the presence of a complex derived from Ti(OPr<sup>i</sup>)<sub>4</sub> and (S,S)-diethyl tartrate as catalyst. The resulting epoxyalcohol is formed in 80% yield and 90&#x2013;95% enantiomeric purity before recrystallization. Further conversion to (+)-disparlure requires three subsequent conventional reaction steps via an intermediate aldehyde. The introduction of this asymmetric epoxidation route on the multi-kilogram scale reduced the price of disparlure by an order of magnitude. The very high activity of disparlure suggests that a production capacity of only a few kg y<sup>-1</sup> is required to satisfy demand.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">(+)-disparlure is used by the US government for insect control and it is notable that the federal revenues saved in just two years exceeded that expended on research grant funding the 10 year search for the method!</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">A derivative of Sharpless chemistry is also used commercially for the manufacture of C<sub>8</sub>-epoxyalcohols and both enantiomers of glycidol.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A significant breakthrough, and the basis for a truly economical use of enantioselective epoxidation on a larger scale, came with the recognition (1984) that the addition of molecular sieves to the reaction mixture allows the use of 5 mol% Ti/tartrate complex in a truly catalytic and highly reproducible manner. Upjohn (1985) and ARCO (1988) have both utilized this development as the basis of commercial routes for the production of C<sub>8</sub>-epoxyalcohols in &#x003E; 98% (Fig. 7.5) and for up to 10 te y<sup>-1</sup> of (<i>S</i>)- and (<i>R</i>)-glycidoI, in 88 &#x00B1; 2% enantiomer excesses respectively. The latter molecules are used as basic building blocks for many highly functionalized chiral molecules; (<i>S</i>)- and (<i>R</i>)- methylglycidol are also produced by this route.</p>
<p class="indent">A more recent alternative approach, developed by Jacobsen and coworkers, concerns the catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of <i>un</i>functionalized olefins using (cheap) NaOCl as oxidant in the presence of Mn complexes of chiral Schiff bases (<b>7.8</b>) as catalysts.</p>

<p class="sidebar-left">In principle, the Jacobsen route provides greater flexibility over Sharpless chemistry by offering the possibility of catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Optical yields of up to >97%, depending upon the nature and positions of the substituents, have been reported. The asymmetric epoxidation of some <i>cis</i>-olefins which lead to enantiomerically pure aminoalcohols for the synthesis of K<sup>+</sup> channel activators, HIV protease inhibitors, and anticancer drugs has reportedly been scaled up to operate in a 6000 litre reactor. Potential problems to full-scale commercialization include the synthesis and availability of the olefins, the availability of the Schiff base (salen) ligands on a large scale, and the activity and stability of the catalyst.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.7 Cilastatin</h2>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">Asymmetric cyclopropanation represents one of the earliest examples of highly enantioselective transformations.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">One of the earliest asymmetric syntheses to be shown to proceed in very high enantiomeric excess is cyclopropanation, from the reaction of olefins with alkyl diazoacetates in the presence of Cu complexes containing chiral ligands. Even here the lead time to industrial exploitation was almost 20 years. A key step in the Sumitomo process for the production of cilastatin (Fig. 7.6), incorporates such chemistry. Cilastatin is used in conjunction with imipenem (a broad-spectrum antibiotic) to suppress hydrolysis of the latter by renal enzymes. An efficient reversible inhibitor of this enzyme is cilastatin, and a combination of imipenem and cilastatin now provides a very useful pharmaceutical.</p>
<p class="indent">The precursor to cilastatin, ethyl (<i>S</i>)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylate is prepared, in 92% enantiomeric excess, by the decomposition of ethyl diazoacetate with <i>iso</i>-butene using a dimeric<a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Fine chemicals manufacture</a> chiral Cu catalyst (<b>7.9</b>) containing a SchifFbase ligand. The distinctive feature of this reaction is that the catalyst creates a carbenoid fragment from the diazoester and then adds it selectively to one face of the olefin. Several types of catalyst are effective for this sort of cyclopropane formation, but the enantioselective character of the Cu-catalysed reaction is remarkable. Clearly, access to many other chiral cyclopropane derivatives is available using this technology, particularly attractive candidates being analogues of the naturally occurring pyrethroid insecticides. As yet, however, no further commercialization has been reported.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.8 Future prospects</h2>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-left">The potential for commercial applications of asymmetric homogeneous catalysis is enormous, and it is fitting to note that the achievements of pioneers in this area, Knowles (Monsanto, L-dopa), Noyori and Sharpless, have been recognized by the award of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">It seems likely that the principal reactions discussed in the preceding section, namely asymmetric hydrogenation, isomerization, and epoxidation, will ultimately find extensive use in the production of pharmaceuticals, given the regulatory trend towards the treatment of enantiomers of the same compound as distinct therapeutic agents. This may also create commercial applications for the enantioselective osmium catalysed vicinal hydroxylation reaction. Clearly the complex chemistry in this area comprises a relatively young discipline, but there can be no doubt that commercial applications of enantioselective homogeneous catalysis are set to increase rapidly.</p>
