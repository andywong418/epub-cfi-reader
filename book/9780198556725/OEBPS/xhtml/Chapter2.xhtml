<p class="noindent">For many years the chemistry of free radicals was very much the province of mechanistic and physical organic chemists and applications to synthesis did not extend much beyond the occasional use of Kolbe electrolysis or oxidative coupling of phenols. More recently the situation has changed, and the realisation that radical methods are often compatible with a range of functional groups, without further protection, has led to an increased interest in the use of radicals in synthesis. The appearance of a book by B.Giese devoted to the subject and some valuable review articles, (cited at the end of this chapter), have also led to an increased awareness of the potential of radical based synthetic procedures.</p>

<p class="indent">In this chapter we shall use the term &#x2018;radical&#x2019; rather than the older term &#x2018;free radical&#x2019;, meaning an atom or molecule which possesses one or more unpaired electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">The fundamental principles of homolytic reactions and radical chemistry are dealt with in basic textbooks and they will not be repeated in detail here. Since our prime consideration is to emphasise synthetic aspects, we shall not be concerned particularly with stable or persistent radicals, such as triphenylmethyl <a href="#fig2.1">(1)</a> and the substituted phenoxy radical <a href="#fig2.2">(2)</a>. For similar reasons, we shall devote relatively little attention to the chemistry of very reactive radicals, such as chlorine atoms, since their highly exothermic reactions lead to poor selectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall intention of this chapter is to concentrate on those reactions where preparatively useful yields can be obtained using radical processes in solution.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Methods of initiation of radical reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Since, as we shall see, most of the important radical reactions proceed by a chain mechanism, the crucial initiation step requires generation of radicals from an appropriate precursor. This section deals with the main types of reaction leading to the production of radicals, i.e. thermal cleavage of compounds with weak bonds, photochemical cleavage of compounds with weak bonds, and electron transfer processes.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Thermal cleavage of compounds with weak bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of compounds that contain relatively weak bonds, i.e. with bond dissociation energies (BDE) less than about 160kJmol<sup>-l</sup>, that undergo homolysis at a convenient rate at temperatures below 150&#x00B0;C.</p>
<a id="page_5" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 5, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>
<p class="indent">An important group of such compounds is the diacylperoxides <a href="#equ2.1">(3)</a>, where the already weak bond of a simple peroxide (for example the O&#x2013;O bond of MeO&#x2013;OMe has a BDE of 155 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>) is further weakened by resonance stabilisation of the acyloxy radical <a href="#equ2.1">(4)</a> produced on homolysis (<a href="#equ2.1">equation 2.1</a>). Thus the BDE of the O&#x2013;O bond in diacetyl peroxide (3,R = Me) is 126 kJmol<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.1">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0007.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Decarboxylation of the acyloxy radical <a href="#equ2.1">(4)</a> may or may not occur readily depending on the nature of R. For R = alkyl the rate of loss of carbon dioxide is relatively fast and the only important products are those derived from the alkyl radicals thereby produced. With R = aryl, decarboxylation is slower and products derived either from ArCO<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7; or from Ar&#x00B7; or from both can be obtained depending on the rates of the subsequent product determining reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, diacyl peroxides <a href="#equ2.1">(3)</a> with R = aryl, e.g. dibenzoyl peroxide (3, R = Ph), are often used as initiators for radical reactions since they dissociate at a convenient rate (half life about 1 h at 90&#x00B0;C) while the alkyl analogues tend to be avoided owing to their explosive nature.</p>
<p class="indent">Of the simpler dialkylperoxides, di-<i>t</i>-butylperoxide <a href="#equ2.2">(6)</a> (O&#x2013;O BDE &#x007E; 155 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>; half life &#x007E;lh at 150&#x00B0;Q is occasionally used as an initiator. Again a complicating feature arises: the derived <i>t-</i>butoxy radicals <a href="#equ2.2">(7)</a> can either react directly or undergo fragmentation to methyl radicals and acetone depending on the rates of the subsequent reactions (<a href="#equ2.2">equation 2.2</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.2">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0008.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Another important group of compounds often used as precursors of radicals are the azo-compounds <a href="#equ2.3">(8)</a>; these dissociate on heating, with loss of nitrogen, to give radicals at temperatures which depend upon the nature of R. In general the more stable the radical R&#x00B7; the more readily dissociation occurs (<a href="#equ2.3">equation 2.3</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Azomethane (8, R = Me) decomposes to nitrogen and methyl radicals in a reaction with an activation energy (<i>E</i><sub>a</sub>) of about 210 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> while (8, R = Ph<sub>2</sub>CH), which leads to resonance stabilised diphenylmethyl radicals, has an activation energy for decomposition of 110kJmol<sup>-1</sup>. One of the most commonly used radical precursors is azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) <a href="#equ2.4">(9)</a>. The ease of decomposition of AIBN (half life &#x007E; 1&#x00B7;0 h at 80&#x00B0;C) reflects the fact that the resulting radicals are both tertiary and resonance stabilised as shown.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Other examples of the thermal dissociation of appropriately constituted radical precursors will be encountered later. They all have in common the homolytic cleavage to give stabilised radicals, often accompanied by the formation of small spin-paired molecules such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, which helps to favour the overall decomposition on entropy grounds as in the case of the azoalkanes <a href="#equ2.3">(8)</a>.</p>

</aside>
<h3 class="h3">Photochemical cleavage of compounds with weak bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">If it is desirable to effect the dissociation of an initiator into radicals at room temperature or below, e.g. because the reaction products are thermally unstable, it is often practicable to use photolysis rather than thermolysis provided the compound used absorbs light of an appropriate wavelength. Since a quantum of light of wavelength 300 nm corresponds to about 400 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> it is energetically feasible to cleave weak covalent bonds by irradiation with visible or UV light.</p>
<p class="indent">Well known examples include the halogens, e.g. bromine (BDE = 193 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>) is a source of bromine atoms (<a href="#equ2.5">equation 2.5</a>). The azoalkanes and dialkyl- and diarylperoxides discussed above as thermal radical precursors, also absorb light above 300nm and give good radical yields on irradiation.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.5">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0012.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">There is another type of photoinitiated radical process which occurs when the electronically excited state of a molecule undergoes an inter- or intramolecular atom transfer. By way of an example, the excited (triplet) state of benzophenone <a href="#equ2.6">(10)</a>, which can be considered as a sort of alkoxy radical since one of the lone pair electrons on oxygen has been promoted to the antibonding <b>&#x03C0;*</b>-orbital, can react with the secondary alcohol benzhydrol <a href="#equ2.6">(11)</a> by abstraction of the hydrogen atom &#x03B1; to OH. The resulting so-called ketyl radicals <a href="#equ2.6">(12)</a>, being stabilised and relatively long lived, can build up to a sufficiently high concentration to allow the product of radical combination, benzpinacol <a href="#equ2.6">(13)</a>, to be formed in good yield (<a href="#equ2.6">equation 2.6</a>). Ketyl radicals such as <a href="#equ2.6">(12)</a> are important intermediates in the photochemistry of carbonyl compounds but reactions of the type shown will not be emphasised in this chapter since they are not relevant to the main theme.</p>

<a id="page_7" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 7, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>
<h3 class="h3">Electron transfer processes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Reactions of this type involve one electron oxidation or reduction leading to the generation of radicals from spin-paired precursors. Examples include (i) the electrochemical (anodic) oxidation of carboxylate anions <a href="#equ2.7">(14)</a> leading to acyloxy radicals, which as indicated in <a href="#equ2.1">equation 2.1</a> can undergo decarboxylation to give alkyl radicals, the basis of the Kolbe reaction (<a href="#equ2.7">equation 2.7</a>), and (ii) the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by Fe(II) to give hydroxy radicals (<a href="#equ2.8">equation 2.8</a>), and the analogous reduction of alkyl hydroperoxides to alkoxy radicals.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.2">
<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Main types of radical reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is convenient at this stage to list and briefly discuss the main types of elementary reactions of radicals that commonly occur. Some indication of the rates at which such reactions proceed in solution will be given since it can help in synthetic planning to have an idea of the relative rates of processes that may be in competition.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Radical combination</h3>
<p class="noindent">The combination of two radicals to give a covalent molecule is an important termination step for chain reactions since it destroys radicals. It does not often play a significant preparative role. The rate of reaction is proportional to the product of the concentration of two species if the radicals are different (or the square of the concentration of one if they are the same). Since the radicals are usually transient and present in very low concentration the overall rate of reaction can be low. However, for relatively stable, long lived, radicals, and for cases where relatively high local concentrations of radicals occur, e.g. at the anode in the anodic oxidation of carboxylate ions (the Kolbe reaction, <a href="#equ2.7">equation 2.7</a>) or for radical pairs generated within a solvent cage, it can become a viable pathway. Rate <i>constants</i> are often high, reflecting the low activation energy for spin-pairing, and with reactive radicals these rate constants are close to the expected value for diffusion controlled reactions (C.10<sup>9</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>). For example a value of 5&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup> is found for combination of two Cl<sub>3</sub>C&#x00B7; radicals at 24&#x00B0;C.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Radical abstraction (displacement)</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a common and important step in many chain reactions and often involves attack on a hydrogen atom, e.g. the hydrogen abstraction step in the chlorination of methane (<a href="#equ2.9">equation 2.9</a>), or on a halogen atom, e.g. the reaction of tributyltin radicals with an alkyl halide (<a href="#equ2.10">equation 2.10</a>).</p>
<a id="page_8" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 8, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>

<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.10">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0016a.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Radical reactions of this type can be considered as displacement reactions, in which the radical effects back side attack on the atom undergoing displacement, with formation of a new radical. Sometimes the symbol S<sub>H</sub>2 is applied to such reactions, meaning &#x2018;substitution, homolytic, bimolecular&#x2019; by analogy with the time honoured terminology for nucleophilic substitution. In general a radical displacement will be favourable if the bond being formed is stronger than the bond broken, and rate constants can be quite high, e.g. l0<sup>4</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup> for hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group of toluene by <i>t</i>-butoxy radicals (<a href="#equ2.11">equation 2.11</a>). In the latter example, attack at the weakest C&#x2013;H bond leading to the resonance stabilised benzyl radical rather than at one of the aromatic C&#x2013;H bonds should be noted.</p>
<p class="indent">Atom abstraction reactions may occur intramolecularly if a sterically favourable transition state can be attained. This turns out to be true for 1,5-hydrogen atom transfers where a six-membered transition state is involved, as shown schematically in <a href="#equ2.12">equation 2.12</a> for the rearrangement of an alkoxy radical of appropriate chain length.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">One electron arrows or &#x2018;fish-hooks&#x2019; as used in <a href="#equ2.12">equation 2.12</a> are a convenient way of showing the movement of unpaired electrons akin to the use of normal arrows to show electron pair movements</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0018.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Radical displacement reactions in which attack occurs at a carbon atom rather than at a halogen or hydrogen atom are not generally observed. This is presumably because the transition state would suffer far more steric strain than, for example, the transition state for a competing hydrogen abstraction.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Radical addition to multiple bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">The addition of a radical to a double or a triple bond is a common elementary step in radical-chain addition to multiple bonds, such as the long known peroxide catalysed &#x2018;anti Markownikow&#x2019; addition of HBr to alkenes. Here the key step is the addition of a bromine atom to the double bond and the orientation found in addition to an unsymmetrically substituted alkene is governed by attack at the more sterically available site. Although early explanations of this regiochemical control tended to emphasise the relative stability of the two possible radicals formed; current views tend to favour an early transition state with steric factors being the main reason for attack at the less substituted end of the double bond. In addition, as we shall see later, there may also be a favourable polar effect influencing this mode of addition with electrophilic radicals such as bromine atoms (<a href="#ch2.4">Section 2.4</a>)</p>
<p class="indent">Rate constants for addition of radicals to double bonds are often of the order of l0<sup>5</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>, reflecting a preparatively useful process, although they <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a> vary over quite a range depending on the nature of the attacking radical and the alkene. Some additions are reversible, e.g. addition of thiyl radicals to alkenes (<a href="#equ2.13">equation 2.13</a>), and the reaction has been used preparatively for isomerisation of 1,2-disubstituted (<i>Z</i>)-alkenes to a thermodynamic equilibrium mixture containing a predominance of the (<i>E</i>)-isomer.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.13">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0019.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Addition is also the key step in homolytic aromatic substitution, but in general this process is not particularly useful synthetically, since substituted aromatics tend to give mixtures of isomers. However in some intramolecular cases, where the site of attack is pre-determined by the ring size of the particular intermediate, the reaction has some synthetic potential.</p>
<p class="indent">Radical polymerisation is an important process initiated by radical addition to alkenes. It will only feature incidentally in this chapter since the emphasis is on the synthesis of relatively small molecules.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fragmentation (&#x03B2;-elimination)</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
<p class="noindent2" style="width:130%;">Decarboxylation of acyloxy radicals</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Fragmentation is the microscopic reverse of radical addition, as just mentioned. Some examples have already been encountered in the decarboxylation of acyloxy radicals (<a href="#equ2.1">equation 2.1</a>) and the (3-elimination of <i>t</i>-alkoxy radicals to carbonyl compounds and alkyl radicals (<a href="#equ2.2">equation 2.2</a>). On the whole such fragmentations will be favoured when the multiple bond formed has a high bond energy (e.g. C=O) in the case of <i>t</i>-alkoxy radicals, or where the starting radical is strained, e.g. the ring opening of cyclopropyl methyl radicals (<a href="#equ2.14">equation 2.14</a>). The rate constant for the latter reaction is high, 1.0&#x00D7;l0<sup>8</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> at 25&#x00B0;C, and the reaction has been proposed as a &#x2018;radical clock&#x2019;, i.e. a standard fast reaction of known rate constant against which rates of other competing reactions of the precursor radical or product radical can be measured.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0021.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Rearrangements</h3>
<p class="noindent">Intramolecular versions of atom abstraction reactions, already mentioned, intramolecular addition reactions leading to cyclisation and intramolecular fragmentations, again briefly mentioned above, constitute pathways for rearrangement of suitably constituted radicals. Several examples of each of these processes will be encountered later in <a href="#ch2.5">section 2.5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">There are also certain rearrangements involving 1,2-shifts of the generalised type leading from <a href="#equ2.7">(14)</a> to <a href="#equ2.15">(15)</a> (<a href="#equ2.15">equation 2.15</a>) . In contrast to carbonium ion chemistry, where 1,2-alkyl (and hydride) shifts are common, 1,2-alkyl shifts in radicals (<a href="#equ2.15">equation 2.15</a>, X = alkyl) are rare. The few apparent cases are likely to be examples of (3-elimination followed by re-addition the other way round. However, in cases where X is a multiply bonded group such as an aryl, vinyl, or carbonyl group, rearrangements corresponding to <a href="#equ2.15">equation 2.15</a><a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a> are well known. An intramolecular addition-elimination pathway is likely to be operative, as shown for the case of phenyl migration in <a href="#equ2.16">equation 2.16</a>. Similarly, groups such as halogen with relatively low lying empty atomic orbitals have been found to undergo a 1,2-shift; again some sort of bridged intermediate is likely (<a href="#equ2.17">equation 2.17</a>)</p>

<h3 class="h3">Disproportionation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Radical combination has already been mentioned. The other main radical- radical reaction is disproportionation in which atom transfer between two radicals occurs leading to two spin paired molecules. Again, as for combination, this is one of the ways of terminating a chain process and it is only preparatively important when high local concentrations of radicals can be generated. An example is the disproportionation of aliphatic ketyl radicals <a href="#equ2.18">(16)</a> obtained in relatively high concentration by flash photolysis, e.g. from acetone and isopropanol (<a href="#equ2.18">equation 2.18</a>). This is a neat way of generating non-stabilised enols in solution.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.3">
<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Chain reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">For reasons already mentioned, only a small number of the free-radical reactions used in synthesis involve radical coupling as the product forming step and the majority of synthetically useful radical reactions in solution are chain processes. It is thus instructive to summarise the main features which characterise successful chain reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">A typical example is the much exploited reduction of alkyl bromides (or iodides) by tributyltin hydride (tributylstannane) which can be induced, for example, on heating with the initiator AIBN <a href="#equ2.4">(9)</a> in benzene solution. The mechanism shown in <a href="#equ2.19">equations 2.19</a>&#x2013;<a href="#equ2.23">2.25</a> is proposed. The three main reaction types are typical of radical chain reactions in general: the initiation stage, leading to formation of the reactive radicals; the propagation stage, <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>accounting for the main overall reaction; and the termination stage, in which radicals are consumed to give spin paired molecules. In the case under discussion initation consists of thermal dissociation of AIBN to isobutyronitrile radicals which then abstract hydrogen from the weak Sn&#x2013;H bond to give the key Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn&#x00B7; radicals (<a href="#equ2.19">equations 2.19</a> and <a href="#equ2.19">2.20</a>). Reaction of Bu<sub>3</sub>sn&#x00B7; radicals with the alkyl bromide to give alkyl radicals is favoured by the relatively high Sn&#x2013;Br bond energy (<a href="#equ2.21">equation 2.21</a>), the second propagation step (<a href="#equ2.21">equation 2.22</a>) is favoured by the relatively weak Sn&#x2013;H bond broken, coupled with the relatively strong C&#x2013;H bond formed. Note that other possible atom abstraction reactions involving Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn&#x00B7; + Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH and R&#x00B7; + RBr are irrelevant since they lead merely to regeneration of starting radicals. The crucial product forming steps are thus reactions 2.21 and 2.22 and the cyclic nature of the propagation sequence is emphasised by the representation in <a href="#equ2.26">equation 2.26</a>. The three possible combination reactions leading to comsumption of Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn&#x00B7; and R&#x00B7; radicals constitute the possible termination reactions (reactions 2.23 to 2.25).</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the salient kinetic features of viable radical chain reactions are (i) rate constants for primary initiation steps, e.g. <a href="#equ2.19">equation 2.19</a>, are relatively low (e.g. for <a href="#equ2.19">equation 2.19</a> k<sub>i</sub>&#x223C; 10<sup>-5</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>); (ii) rate constants for propagation steps are relatively high (k &#x003E; 10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>); (iii) rate constants for radical&#x2013;radical termination steps are very high, approaching diffusion control (k &#x223C; 10<sup>9</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>); (iv) the overall rate of reaction is proportional to the square root of the rate of the primary initiation step; and (v) the overall activation energy is dominated by the activation energy of this latter step. The consequences are that typical radical concentrations during reaction are of the order of 10<sup>-7</sup>M, thus the actual rates of the bimolecular termination steps are low despite the high rate constants. Also, chain lengths, i.e. the ratio of the number of propagation steps to termination steps, are often of the order of tens of thousands. Clearly there are important limitations to the types of radical reactions that can participate in chain sequences and these requirements are more stringent where a more complex series of propagation steps, with more <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>than two stages in the cycle, is involved. As we shall see later, an important case relevant to the above example (<a href="#equ2.26">equation 2.26</a>) is that where the first formed radical R&#x00B7; can rearrange to a new radical R&#x2019; The concentration of Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH then becomes critical to the overall outcome of the reaction.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Polar effects in radical reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">One other general feature of radical reactions that cannot be too strongly emphasised is their marked susceptibility to polar effects in both reactants and reagents. This aspect of reactions between nominally uncharged species, which is at first sight surprising, has far reaching consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">Clear indications of the operation of polar effects can be found in certain hydrogen abstraction reactions. For example, propanoic acid <a href="#fig2.17">(17)</a> could undergo reaction by hydrogen abstraction from either the &#x03B1; or the &#x03B2; position (the O&#x2013;H bond is not involved owing to its significantly higher bond energy compared to C&#x2013;H).</p>

<p class="indent">In the reaction of propanoic acid with chlorine atoms (Cl&#x00B7;) the relative rate constants for attack at C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub>H versus C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub>H, per hydrogen atom, are in the ratio <i>k<sub>&#x03B1;</sub></i> / k<sub>&#x03B2;</sub>= 0&#x00B7;03. The carboxyl group is electron withdrawing and the electronegative chlorine atom (electrophilic radical) preferentially attacks the more electron-rich C&#x2013;H bond of the methyl group even though the a radical might be expected to be the more stable owing to resonance stabilisation. In contrast, for the reaction of propanoic acid with the more electron rich methyl radicals (Me&#x00B7;), selective attack at the more electron deficient bond &#x03B1; to the carboxyl group occurs <i>(k<sub>&#x03B1;</sub></i> / <i>k</i><sub>&#x03B2;</sub> = 7.8). Apparently, in the transition state for chlorine atom attack there is significant electron transfer towards the electronegative chlorine leaving the carbon atom relatively positively charged, which might be described in resonance terms as a contribution from canonical <a href="#fig2.18">(18)</a> to the transition state. In the case of methyl radical attack there is some electron transfer towards the carbon of the C&#x2013;H bond being attacked, which could be expressed as a contribution by canonical <a href="#fig2.19">(19)</a> to the/transition state.</p>
<p class="indent">Typical electrophilic radicals include Hal&#x00B7;, RO&#x00B7;, RS&#x00B7;, RSO<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;, Cl<sub>3</sub>C&#x00B7;, R&#x00B7;CO&#x00B7;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;, RO<sub>2</sub>C&#x00B7;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;, and RSO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;; typical nucleophilic radicals are R<sub>3</sub>C&#x00B7;, ArCH<sub>2</sub>&#x00B7;, R<sub>2</sub>(R&#x2019;O)C&#x00B7;, and RCO&#x00B7; .</p>
<p class="indent">A further illustration of polar effects is provided by the effect of substituents on the rate of addition of radicals to substituted alkenes. Relative rate constants (<i>k</i><sub>rel</sub>) for addition of cyclohexyl radicals, which are nucleophilic, (<a href="#equ2.27">equation 2.27</a>) vary with the substituents (X) as follows: CHO, 34; CO<sub>2</sub>Me, 6&#x00B7;7; Ph, 1&#x00B7;0; OAc, 0&#x00B7;016; <i>n</i>-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>, 0&#x00B7;004. Clearly the more powerfully electron withdrawing X is, the faster is the addition, with rates spanning a range of nearly 10<sup>4</sup>. Conversely it is found that electrophilic radicals add preferentially to electron-rich olefins substituted with electron donating substituents.</p>

<p class="indent">Polar effects such as these have important consequences in polymer chemistry leading to a strong tendency for formation of an alternating polymer chain when, for example, styrene and acrylonitrile are copolymerised. In the growing polymer the nucleophilic benzylic radical <a href="#equ2.28">(20)</a> tends to add preferentially to acrylonitrile, as the electron deficient monomer, leading to the electrophilic radical <a href="#equ2.28">(21)</a>.

<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Examples of radical reactions in synthesis</h2>
<p class="noindent">We shall now examine a number of examples of radical reactions in a synthetic context, trying to illustrate the general points already made. Inevitably the choice will be highly selective and more specialist books and reviews should be consulted for a comprehensive treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">A particular feature of radical reactions in synthesis is their inherent compatibility with certain functional groups. In carbanion chemistry it is nearly always necessary to protect hydroxy and other acidic groups to prevent formation of alkoxides, etc. In free radical chemistry O&#x2013;H cleavage is not usually a problem, owing to the high O&#x2013;H bond energy, and protection is rarely necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">As already indicated,the main problem in the development of radical based syntheses is the selection of appropriate reactions so that the elementary steps proceed at sufficiently fast rates to sustain chain reactions. Sometimes the relevant rate constants are known or can be estimated by analogy, but successful procedures are often the result of considerable experimentation in varying reagent concentrations and reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Radical anion and radical cation reactions will not be emphasised in this survey since they are more appropriately dealt with in the context of reduction and oxidation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Intermolecular radical additions to multiple bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">A typical example is the tributyltin hydride promoted addition of alkyl radicals, generated from alkyl halides, to alkenes (<a href="#equ2.29">equation 2.29</a>, where W represents an electron withdrawing group).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">This reaction is fairly general for primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides and iodides. One illustration is shown in <a href="#equ2.30">equation 2.30</a>.</p>
<a id="page_14" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 14, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">In comparison with the tributyltin hydride reduction of alkyl halides discussed earlier (<a href="#ch2.3">Section 2.3</a>), there is now an extra link in the chain mechanism (<a href="#equ2.31">equation 2.31</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The overall propagation sequence has now been expanded from that shown in <a href="#equ2.26">equation 2.26</a> to the one summarised below (<a href="#equ2.32">equation 2.32</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.32">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0038.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly a number of conditions must be fulfilled for the process to be efficient. The radical R&#x00B7; must add to the activated alkene <a href="#equ2.31">(23)</a> faster than it reacts (by hydrogen transfer resulting in overall reduction) with Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH, but the adduct radical <a href="#equ2.31">(24)</a> must react with Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH faster than <a href="#equ2.31">(24)</a> reacts with another molecule of activated olefin <a href="#equ2.31">(23)</a> leading to polymerisation. These conditions are favoured when R&#x00B7; is a nucleophilic radical and the alkene is electron deficient (with W a powerfully electron withdrawing group) thereby making the adduct radical <a href="#equ2.31">(24)</a> an electrophilic radical. The reaction is also favoured if a high concentration of the activated alkene <a href="#equ2.31">(23)</a> is maintained, e.g. by working in excess, and the Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH concentration is kept low, e.g. by slow addition during the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative way of generating alkyl radicals for intermolecular addition reactions is by sodium borohydride reduction of alkyl mercurials. Many compounds of the type RHgX give alkyl radicals via radical chain decomposition of RHgH produced <i>in situ</i> by borohydride reduction and these radicals can be trapped by activated alkenes. An example is shown in <a href="#equ2.33">equation 2.33</a> where the mercurial used was obtained by acetoxymercuration of a terminal alkene.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.33">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0039.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">In some ways the mercurial approach is complementary to the RHal/Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH procedure but where direct comparisons are available, e.g. with alkyl radicals derived from RHgHal/NaBH<sub>4</sub>, the Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH route is preferable, in terms of yields and availability of starting materials.</p>
<a id="page_15" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 15, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>
<p class="indent">An important type of radical precursor, which has recently been developed by Barton and shown to have wide applicability, is a thiohydroxamic ester <a href="#equ2.34">(26)</a>. These compounds, readily prepared from the sodium salt of the thiohydroxamic acid <a href="#equ2.34">(25)</a> and the appropriate acid chloride, undergo radical chain decarboxylative rearrangement on heating or irradiation via the propagation sequence shown in <a href="#equ2.34">equation 2.34</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Alkyl radicals (R&#x00B7;) formed by photolysis of <a href="#equ2.34">(26)</a> can be trapped by electron deficient alkenes leading, for example, to formation of the adduct <a href="#equ2.35">(28)</a> starting from the thiohydroxamic ester <a href="#equ2.35">(27)</a> (<a href="#equ2.35">equation 2.35</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Adducts of this type <a href="#equ2.35">(28)</a> can be further transformed via the manipulations of organosulphur chemistry leading, for example, to &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-unsaturated esters via oxidation to sulphoxide followed by thermal elimination, or to saturated esters by reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">Addition of electron deficient radicals to electron rich alkenes is also possible and some of the above methods have been used to this end. Many of the longest known radical chain additions to alkenes are of this polarity type, e.g. the peroxide catalysed anti-Markownikow addition of HBr and the addition of halogenated hydrocarbons such as CCl<sub>4</sub> and BrCCl<sub>3</sub>. A more recent example is shown in <a href="#equ2.36">equation 2.36</a>.

<p class="indent">Oxidative coupling of phenols, a reaction long considered to involve radical&#x2013;radical coupling, may also be a radical addition leading to overall aromatic substitution.

A subsequent electron transfer (to Fe<sup>III</sup>) followed by aromatisation and intramolecular ionic addition to the &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;&#x2013;unsaturated ketone gives <a href="#equ2.39">(31)</a>, equation (<a href="#equ2.39">2.39</a>).</p>

In general, however, intermolecular homolytic aromatic substitution is not a very useful process synthetically owing to the absence of strong substituent directing effects.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important type of intermolecular radical addition to multiple bonds is found for suitable allylically substituted alkenes. Here the basic mode of reaction is an addition&#x2013;elimination leading to overall allylic substitution, often designated S<sub>H</sub>2&#x2019; by analogy with the corresponding nucleophilic reaction (<a href="#equ2.40">equation 2.40</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Intramolecular radical addition to multiple bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">The intramolecular analogues of the intermolecular additions just described are particularly favoured, being subject to fewer limitations in terms of the required substitution pattern of the multiple bond, etc. This is a consequence of the well known proximity effect which leads to more positive entropies of activation than for the intermolecular analogue. In consequence, rates of such exothermic cyclisations, where a &#x03C3;&#x2013;bond is formed at the expense of a &#x03C0;&#x2013;bond, are fast and they can compete efficiently with bimolecular chain transfer steps.</p>
<p class="indent">An important prototype is the cyclisation of the hex-5-enyl radical <a href="#equ2.45">(39)</a> to the cyclopentyl methyl radical <a href="#equ2.45">(40)</a>, which occurs with a rate constant of about 10<sup>6</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> at 20&#x00B0;C (<a href="#equ2.45">equation 2.45</a>). Noteworthy is the preferred <i>5-exo</i> mode of cyclisation to give <a href="#equ2.45">(40)</a> compared to the alternative 6<i>-endo</i> one giving cyclohexyl radical <a href="#equ2.45">(41)</a>. The latter would be expected to be the more stable, being a secondary radical and having an unstrained cyclohexane ring. This synthetically important result is explained in terms of an early transition state having little product character. Thus stereoelectronic factors govern the cyclisation and optimum overlap between the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical and the &#x03C0;*-orbital of the double bond is achieved for the five-membered ring transition state.</p>

<p class="indent">Another example of radical generation via cobalt chemistry is shown in <a href="#equ2.53">equation 2.53</a>. Here the CO&#x2013;Co homolysis is followed by <i>5-exo</i> cyclisation, trapping by Co, and elimination to give the unsaturated ketone shown. The salophen ligand in this example is closely related to the salen ligand involved in the previous case. The two examples together show how functionality is maintained in the cyclisation product in contrast to the trialkyltin hydride reductions of unsaturated halides.</p>
<p class="indent">In suitably substituted precursors, where the first formed hex-5-enyl radical is stabilised, reversible intramolecular addition&#x2013;elimination is feasible thereby affording products derived from the thermodynamically more stable six-membered ring. The cyclisation shown in <a href="#equ2.54">equation 2.54</a> is considered to be an example. Hydrogen abstraction from starting material to give radical <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a><a href="#equ2.54">(44)</a>, followed by kinetically favoured but reversible 5-<i>exo</i>cyclisation to <a href="#equ2.54">(43)</a>, allows the more stable 6-<i>endo</i>cyclised radical <a href="#equ2.54">(45)</a> to be formed.

<p class="indent">An interesting example (<a href="#equ2.55">equation 2.55</a>) shows the result of intramolecular competition between 5-<i>exo</i>cyclisation onto C=C and <i>6-exo</i> addition to C=O. It is likely that the predominance of the latter process is the result of reversible addition to both multiple bonds but faster capture by the alkoxy radical of hydrogen from tributyltin hydride, another consequence of polarity effects.</p>

<p class="indent">In favourable cases, the cyclised radical obtained by intramolecular addition can be captured by intermolecular reaction with a suitable trapping agent.

They include simple addition leading to compound <a href="#equ2.56">(46)</a>; addition, followed by Bu<sup>3</sup>Sn&#x00B7; elimination giving the enone <a href="#equ2.56">(47)</a>; and addition to an isonitrile followed by Bu<sup>t</sup> radical elimination with formation of the cyanide <a href="#equ2.56">(48)</a>.

<h3 class="h3">Functional group transformations</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although we have so far concentrated on carbon&#x2013;carbon bond forming reactions there are a number of useful functional group transformations, particularly reductions, that can be conveniently carried out by free radical chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent">The conversion of alkylmercurials to alkanes by sodium borohydride and the reduction of alkyl halides to alkanes by tributyltin hydride have already been described.</p>
<p class="indent">Useful methods for deoxygenation of alcohols via xanthates <a href="#equ2.58">(49)</a>, or other thiocarbonyl derivatives, using tributyltin hydride, have been developed (<a href="#equ2.58">equation 2.58</a>). A chain mechanism along the lines shown is likely. The reaction is general for the xanthates from secondary alcohols at or below toluene reflux temperature and for those from primary alcohols under more vigourous conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;" id="equ2.58">
<img src="../images/he_9780198556725_0067.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Because of problems in preparing the appropriate thiocarbonyl intermediates, tertiary alcohols are best deoxygenated using Barton&#x2019;s thiohydroxamic ester chemistry (<a href="#equ2.34">equation 2.34</a>) via their half oxalates (<a href="#equ2.59">equation 2.59</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Radical deoxygenations of the above types in general give satisfactory yields except for systems where good radical leaving groups are &#x03B2; to the radical centre, when elimination leading to alkene formation supervenes (<a href="#equ2.60">equation 2.60</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Tributyltin hydride chemistry can also be used to reduce tertiary and activated secondary nitrocompounds (e.g. <a href="#equ2.61">equation 2.61</a>). Even primary amines have been converted to the corresponding R&#x2013;H compounds via the intermediacy of isonitriles (<a href="#equ2.61">equation 2.62</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">There are also a number of useful transformations of carboxylic acids, based on their thiohydroxamic esters, which are exemplified in <a href="#equ2.63">equation 2.63</a>. Thus RCO<sub>2</sub>H is readily converted to RH, ROOH (and by reduction ROH), and RBr, the latter reaction being a modern variant of the Hunsdiecker reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Functionalisation of unactivated C&#x2013;H</h3>
<p class="noindent">A number of free radical reactions which are particularly useful from a preparative point of view involve intramolecular hydrogen abstraction from a specific site governed by proximity effects.</p>
<p class="indent">One group of such reactions involves alkoxy radicals (cf. <a href="#equ2.12">equation 2.12</a>) where the conversion of C&#x2013;H to O&#x2013;H is exothermic, and the site of hydrogen abstraction is dominated by a strong requirement for a six-membered ring transition state.</p>
<p class="indent">Many applications to steroid chemistry are known where the rigid geometry of the steroid skeleton imparts close proximity betwen the alkoxy radical and an angular methyl group (e.g. <a href="#equ2.64">equation 2.64</a>). A chain mechanism is likely, involving H-abstraction from the angular methyl group by the alkoxy radical, cf. <a href="#equ2.64">(51)</a>, followed by chlorine abstraction from another molecule of the starting hypochlorite <a href="#equ2.64">(50)</a>, etc. As in the example shown, the <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, 2 Radical reactions in synthesis</a>chloroalcohol formed can often be cyclised on base treatment to form a tetrahydrofuran.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="indent">Related reactions are shown in <a href="#equ2.65">equations 2.65</a> and <a href="#equ2.66">2.66</a>. In the former an alkyl hypoiodite is generated <i>in situ</i> and converted, as before, to an iodoalcohol which undergoes further oxidation to the masked aldehyde <a href="#equ2.65">(52)</a>. In the latter, (<a href="#equ2.66">equation 2.66</a>), the first formed hydroxy lead derivative suffers <i>in situ</i> cyclisation.</p>

<p class="indent">An important reaction of this type is the Barton reaction of nitrite esters, exemplified by the key step in the synthesis of aldosterone (<a href="#equ2.67">equation 2.67</a>). A non-chain process is postulated.</p>

Again the key hydrogen abstraction step in the chain reaction is likely to involve a six-membered transition state.</p>

<p class="indent">More recently Breslow has achieved &#x2018;remote functionalisation&#x2019; of C&#x2013;H groups in steroids by attaching suitable appendages containing groupings which will temporarily trap a halogen atom and thereby direct H abstraction to a precise position (<a href="#equ2.69">equation 2.69</a>).
