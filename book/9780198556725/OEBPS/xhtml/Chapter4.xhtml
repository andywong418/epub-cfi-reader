<h1 class="main">4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Nitrenes</h1>
<p class="noindent">Nitrenes are six-electron neutral, monovalent, highly reactive nitrogen intermediates, the nitrogen atom having four non-bonded electrons (two being the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; lone pair associated with nitrogen) indicated by the four dots in the drawn structure. Such monovalent short-lived species were first suggested by Tiemann in 1891 as intermediates in the Lossen rearrangement (see <a href="#ch4.5">Section 4.5</a>), and were also adopted by Curtius to explain various reactions of azides. Although various names for these intermediates such as imidogen (once favoured by <i>Chemical Abstracts</i>), imenes, azenes, have been used in the past, the word nitrene is now in almost universal use, the nomenclature following that of carbenes. Thus PhN is phenylnitrene, MeSO<sub>2</sub>N is methanesulphonylnitrene, and so on. The chemistry of nitrenes closely parallels that of carbenes in virtually all aspects, and therefore some points are covered in less detail, since it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the principles established in the previous chapter.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Like carbenes, there is the possibility of two spin states for nitrenes, depending on whether the two non-bonding electrons (the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; nitrogen lone pair remains paired) have their spins paired or parallel. In general nitrenes obey Hund&#x2019;s Rule and are ground state triplets with two degenerate <i>sp</i>-orbitals containing a single electron each, although the nitrogen atom in the singlet is usually represented as <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridised. The energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is usually much larger for nitrenes than for carbenes, being estimated at 145 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for nitrene (NH) itself compared with 32&#x2013;42 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>). This is in part due to the fact that nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, and therefore holds its electrons closer to the nucleus. As expected, the nature of the substituent on nitrogen affects both the multiplicity and the normal electrophilic reactivity of nitrenes. Strong &#x03C0;-donor substituents such as amino groups greatly stabilise the singlet as well as causing the nitrene to exhibit nucleophilic character in its reactions. A dramatic example of this effect is seen in the nitrene derived by oxidation of l-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine, which is a ground state singlet, stable in solution at low temperature. IR Spectroscopy suggests the presence of a N=N bond (v<sub>max.</sub> 1638 cm<sup>-1</sup>), the assignment being confirmed by observing the shift (v<sub>max.</sub> 1612 cm<sup>-1</sup>) on isotopic labelling of the exocyclic nitrogen with <sup>15</sup>N. Aminonitrenes of this type are somewhat special, and are usually named as 1,1-diazenes, to reflect the fact that they show little nitrene character. Other aminonitrenes, particularly those derived from <i>N</i>-aminoheterocycles, however, do show nitrene behaviour.</p>

<p class="indent">Although many nitrenes are too unstable to allow the sort of direct observation referred to above, various techniques can be used to obtain the UV and ESR spectra of more transient species. Interestingly, nitrene itself (NH) has been extensively characterised by spectroscopy, the electronic absorption at 336 nm being first observed in 1892, although it was some years before the assignment was unambiguously confirmed. More modern techniques such as laser flash photolysis and low temperature matrix studies allow the routine measurement of UV spectra of nitrenes. Triplet phenylnitrene, for example, shows absorptions between 300 and 400 nm at 77K, whilst ESR measurements on the same species suggest that there is substantial delocalisation of a single electron into the aromatic ring.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Azides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Azides, which have been known for over 100 years are the most widely used precursors of nitrenes. Like diazo compounds they possess a linear 1,3-dipolar structure, and are easily prepared, often by introduction of the N<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion from inorganic salts such as sodium azide. The thermal stability of azides is critically dependent on the substituent on nitrogen. In genuine nitrene reactions the loss of nitrogen is rate determining being largely independent of the nature of the solvent and the concentration of any other compounds present. Whereas most azides decompose thermally in the 100&#x2013;200&#x00B0;C range, some are much less stable, particularly those in which the loss of nitrogen can be assisted in some way. In these assisted reactions, exemplified by <i>ortho</i>-substituted aromatic azides, nitrenes are probably not involved at all, e.g. the facile formation of anthranils from <i>ortho</i>-azido aromatic ketones, probably proceeds by an electrocyclisation followed by loss of nitrogen.</p>

<p class="indent">Like diazo compounds, the decomposition of azides can be catalysed by protic and Lewis acids and by transition metal salts, although in the latter case, less is known about these processes than the corresponding reactions of diazo compounds.

<h3 class="h3">Isocyanates</h3>
<p class="noindent">Aryl isocyanates do not eliminate CO to give nitrenes on heating since the process is energetically unfavourable, although irradiation can provide sufficient energy for the reaction to proceed. Hence the generation of nitrenes from isocyanates is analogous to the generation of carbenes from ketenes. The related sulphinylamines (Ar&#x2013;N=S=O), readily prepared from anilines and thionyl chloride, do decompose to nitrenes thermally with extrusion of SO.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the phosphorus and sulphur ylides of nitrogen, called imino-phosphoranes and iminosulphuranes (sulphimides) respectively, are less well known than their carbon counterparts, they do give nitrene products on irradiation. For example, photolysis of the <i>S</i>,<i>S</i>-dimethyl sulphimide derived from <i>N</i>-phenylbenzamidine gives a high yield of 2-phenylbenzimidazole, presumably via cyclisation of the intermediate imidoylnitrene to the aromatic ring. Thermolysis of the corresponding nitrogen&#x2013;nitrogen ylide (an aminimide) gives the same product, as does photolysis of 1,5-diphenyltetrazole and 3,4-diphenyl-l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-one, strongly suggestive of a common intermediate, the nitrene. The same product is also formed by oxidation of <i>N</i>-phenylbenzamidine using lead(IV) acetate.</p>

<p class="indent">Five-membered heterocyclic rings, including those with aromatic stabilisation, that are able to undergo fragmentation with extrusion of nitrogen or carbon dioxide, readily decompose to give nitrenes on irradiation or vapour phase thermolysis. For instance, l,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones (general scheme, X = Z = O, Y = CO) lose carbon dioxide on heating or irradiation to give acylnitrenes, and examples involving a tetrazole and an oxadiazolone are shown above (p. 54).</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x03B1;-Elimination</h3>
<p class="noindent">The historically significant and synthetically useful &#x03B1;-elimination route to carbenes is less important in nitrene chemistry. Although in a few substrates, such as <i>N,O</i>-bis(trimethylsilyl)hydroxylamines, the elimination can be effected thermally, more often than not the reaction is base mediated, and requires a good leaving group on nitrogen. Since <i>N</i>-halo compounds are often unstable and are prone to radical and ionic reactions, the most useful nitrene precursors of this type are <i>O</i>-arenesulphonylhydroxylamines (RNHOSO<sub>2</sub>Ar), the reaction being best known for ethoxycarbonylnitrene. The elimination can be effected using an organic base such as triethylamine or under phase transfer conditions, and the fact that a genuine nitrene intermediate is involved is strongly suggested by the similar product distribution obtained from &#x03B1;-elimination of EtO<sub>2</sub>CNHOSO<sub>2</sub>Ar and thermolysis or photolysis of EtO<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The deoxygenation of nitro and nitroso groups can be carried out with a variety of reagents although trivalent phosphorus compounds, particularly triethyl phosphite, are most commonly used. Although the intermediacy of nitrenes is not proven in every case, the reaction is useful especially for arylnitrenes since the precursor aromatic nitro compounds are so readily accessible. The deoxygenation may involve nucleophilic attack on oxygen by phosphorus followed by loss of the thermodynamically stable P=O compound, although alternatives are possible. The resulting nitroso compound undergoes similar reactions to complete the deoxygenation.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Oxidation of amines</h3>
<p class="noindent">The removal of both hydrogens from a NH<sub>2</sub> group by oxidation formally results in generation of a nitrene. Although this is not a practicable route for most nitrenes, the oxidation of primary amines usually leading to many products not necessarily nitrene derived, oxidation of 1,1-disubstituted hydrazines is the method of choice for aminonitrenes. Various oxidants such as MnO<sub>2</sub>, HgO, NiO<sub>2</sub> and phenyliodosoacetate [PhI(OAc)<sub>2</sub>] can be used, but the most commonly employed reagent is lead(IV) acetate. The reactions are carried out at low temperature, typically &#x2013;78&#x00B0;C in dichloromethane, although in the lead(IV) acetate oxidations there is the strong possibility that the true intermediate is an unstable acetoxy compound, R<sub>2</sub>NNHOAc, rather than a free nitrene.</p>

This last reaction is one of the most widely studied oxidative routes to nitrenes, and is useful in that the phthaloyl group can be removed from the subsequent nitrene derived products by reaction with hydrazine hydrate to reveal a free NH<sub>2</sub> group. <i>N</i>-Aminoaziridines, prepared by this route are key reagents for the Eschenmoser fragmentation (<a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3.7">Section 3.7</a>).</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Cycloaddition to alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of aziridines by the 1,2-addition of nitrenes to alkenes mirrors the corresponding reaction of carbenes to give cyclopropanes, although it is <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, 4 Nitrenes</a> not as general in its scope. Since nitrenes are generally electrophilic the reaction works best for nucleophilic alkenes, and the stereochemistry of the resulting aziridine is usually dependent on the spin state of the nitrene. Thus the Skell hypothesis also holds for nitrenes, although the reaction is subject to the usual experimental variables. For example, thermal decomposition of ethyl azidoformate in neat <i>cis</i>-but-2-ene gives the singlet nitrene which adds largely stereospecifically to the alkene to give the <i>cis</i>-aziridine. A similar result is obtained when the nitrene is generated by &#x03B1;-elimination from EtO<sub>2</sub>CNHOSO<sub>2</sub>Ar, providing further evidence for the nitrene as a common intermediate in both reactions. However, as the reaction mixture is diluted with an inert solvent, collisional decay to the triplet ground state readily occurs and the reaction becomes less stereospecific. Conversely, addition of triplet (radical) traps such as dienes or &#x03B1;-methylstyrene increases the stereospecificity by selective removal of the triplet. Photolysis is less stereospecific since a higher percentage of the nitrenes are generated directly as triplets.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Aminonitrenes such as phthalimidonitrene, being ground state singlets, usually add stereospecifically to alkenes, and because of their somewhat nucleophilic nature also add to electron deficient double bonds. In contrast, arylnitrenes do not usually undergo addition to alkenes, although if aryl azides are used as precursors, a reaction certainly occurs. This turns out to be a general problem in azide/nitrene chemistry since azides are reactive 1,3-dipoles which readily undergo cycloaddition to alkenes to give five-membered heterocycles, 1,2,3-triazolines. These may subsequently lose nitrogen to give aziridines, presumably by way of a diradical intermediate, with the consequent loss of alkene stereochemistry.</p>

The overall process described by the word insertion can occur by different mechanisms, although most of the preparatively useful C&#x2013;H insertion reactions are believed to involve direct insertion of the singlet nitrene rather than a stepwise H-abstraction&#x2013;recombination mechanism involving the triplet. Both mechanisms are shown below. However, many reactions which lead to products with a new C&#x2013;N bond that are the formal result of C&#x2013;H insertion proceed by an entirely different mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent">The importance of the C&#x2013;H insertion reaction of nitrenes lies in the fact that it is a potentially useful way of functionalising unactivated C&#x2013;H bonds, converting hydrocarbons into amine derivatives. The reaction is highly dependent on the substituents on nitrogen, cyclohexane, for example, only giving good yields of aminocyclohexane derivatives with acyl-, sulphonyl-, and cyano-nitrenes, generated by thermal or photochemical decomposition of the corresponding azides. Alkylnitrenes give very poor yields of insertion products because of the competing rearrangement by 1,2-hydrogen shift (<a href="#ch4.5">Section 4.5</a>), and arylnitrenes often give anilines by hydrogen abstraction by the triplet.</p>

<p class="indent">For all nitrenes studied, the selectivity of C&#x2013;H insertion follows the expected pattern of reactivity decreasing in the order: tertiary > secondary > primary C&#x2013;H, although there is considerable variation in the degree of selectivity. For example, the relative reactivities of tertiary, secondary and primary C&#x2013;H bonds in 2-methylbutane towards ethoxycarbonylnitrene are approximately 30:10:1, whereas the corresponding values for methanesulphonylnitrene are 10:4:1.</p>
<p class="indent">The selectivity of nitrene insertion reactions has been widely studied using substituted cyclohexanes as substrates. For arylnitrenes exhibiting triplet reactivity, the reaction is often low yielding and non-stereospecific, but ethoxycarbonyl-, methanesulphonyl-, and cyano-nitrenes all insert with retention of configuration into the tertiary C&#x2013;H bond of both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i><a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, 4 Nitrenes</a> 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. When optically active substrates are used, virtually complete retention is again observed, ethoxycarbonylnitrene inserting with 98&#x2013;100% retention into the tertiary C&#x2013;H bond of (<i>S</i>)-3-methylhexane. The result is independent of the method of nitrene generation, and of concentration, confirming the view that only the singlet species inserts into unactivated C&#x2013;H bonds.</p>

<p class="indent">Although arylnitrenes often give poor yields of intermolecular C&#x2013;H insertion products, the intramolecular reaction works well, and proceeds with retention of configuration at the reacting centre as shown by the example below (<i>c.</i> 100% retention).

<p class="indent">Formal insertions into aromatic C&#x2013;H bonds often proceed by another mechanism, for example the formation of substituted anilines discussed in <a href="#ch4.3">Section 4.3</a>. This is also true in intramolecular cases, and the formation of carbazole from biphen-2-ylnitrene, a well studied example, probably occurs by an electrocyclic reaction followed by 1,5-hydrogen shift. The high yielding synthesis of indoles from azidocinnamates proceeds similarly by cyclisation of a vinylnitrene.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangement of nitrenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The rearrangement by a 1,2-shift of an atom or group from the adjacent carbon to the electron deficient centre which occurs so readily with carbenes is also a characteristic reaction of nitrenes. When the migrating group is hydrogen, the rearrangement is particularly facile and hence other <a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, 4 Nitrenes</a> intermolecular reactions such as cycloaddition involving alkylnitrenes are rarely seen. The rearrangement results in the formation of an imine, which if unsubstituted on nitrogen is easily hydrolysed to the corresponding carbonyl compound. Bearing in mind the fact that azides, which are usually prepared from halides by reaction with inorganic azide, are the most common nitrene sources, the 1,2-rearrangement provides an overall route from halides to carbonyl compounds. Although the mechanism is often depicted as involving a free nitrene (as below), there is rarely evidence to support this, and it likely that as with carbenes, the migration is &#x2018;concerted&#x2019; with the departure of the leaving group from nitrogen in the nitrene precursor.</p>

<p class="indent">The nitrene analogues of the Wolff rearrangement are the well known Curtius, Hofmann, and Lossen reactions. The Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides to isocyanates, and hence amines upon addition of water and decarboxylation, almost certainly does not involve nitrenes, the migration of the group R being concerted with loss of nitrogen in both thermal and photochemical reactions. In the thermal reaction all attempts to trap intermediate nitrenes failed, and although other nitrene derived compounds such as insertion products are formed in the photochemical reaction, these arise from a parallel pathway. The yield of isocyanate is approximately the same whether the nitrene is diverted or not suggesting that there is no pathway from nitrene to isocyanate. Nevertheless despite the mechanistic uncertainty, the reaction is widely used in preparative organic chemistry as a method of converting a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) into a primary amine (RNH<sub>2</sub>) or amine derivative (RNHCO<sub>2</sub>R&#x2019;) by way of the acyl chloride (RCOC1) and azide (RCON<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p class="indent">The Hofmann reaction achieves a similar overall transformation, going from an amide (RCONH<sub>2</sub>) to an amine (RNH<sub>2</sub>) by treatment with bromine under basic conditions. The reaction proceeds by way of an <i>N</i>-bromoamide (RCONHBr) which in the presence of base undergoes migration of the R group from carbon to the incipient electron deficient nitrogen concerted with the loss of bromide. The Lossen rearrangement of <i>O</i>-acetylhydroxamic acids (RCONHOAc) upon treatment with base no doubt proceeds by a similar process.</p>

<p class="indent">The rearrangement of arylnitrenes parallels that of arylcarbenes in its complexity, and in the gas phase follows a similar reversible pathway involving a strained seven-membered ketenimine.

The process is extremely complicated, and the final product may be derived from any of the intermediates along the pathway. In solution, the highly reactive intermediates <b>A</b> (or <b>B</b>) can be intercepted by an added nucleophile such as diethylamine to give, after hydrogen shift, an isolable 3<i>H</i>-azepine.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nitrenes for the most part being electron deficient are highly electrophilic intermediates and therefore react with nucleophiles of all types. Tertiary amines, phosphines, sulphides, and sulphoxides all react with nitrenes to give ylides, in a reaction which is the reverse of their formation. In practice, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) is often the most convenient nucleophilic trap since it can be used as the reaction solvent, and gives relatively stable sulphoximides.</p>

For example, in attempts to functionalise the 4,4-dimethyl groups in lanosterol, a process of considerable biosynthetic importance, thermal decomposition of 3&#x03B2;-lanost-8-enyl azidoformate gave a &#x03B4;-lactone (25%) resulting from insertion into the 4&#x03B1;-methyl group.

<h3 class="h3">Alkaloid synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of nitrene insertion reactions in the synthesis of diterpene alkaloids goes back to the early 1960s. For example, in a reaction similar to that described above, irradiation of the acyl azide shown below, results in intramolecular insertion into the axial methyl group to give a bridged &#x03B4;-lactam which has the azabicyclononane skeleton of the atisine alkaloids, albeit in poor yield due to competing Curtius rearrangement to give the corresponding isocyanate in about 70% yield.</p>

<p class="indent">The apparent intramolecular insertion of vinylnitrenes into aromatic C&#x2013;H bonds referred to earlier has found wide use in the synthesis of naturally occurring indoles in one of our (C. J. M.) own laboratories. The precursor azides, easily prepared from benzaldehydes in one step, decompose on heating in boiling toluene or xylene to give indole-2-esters in high yield. The reaction has been used as the key step in the synthesis of natural products such as methoxatin (co-enzyme PQQ) as shown below.</p>

<p class="indent">Intramolecular cycloaddition to a 1,3-diene has been used in an elegant approach to pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Heating the dienyl azide results in intramolecular 1,2-addition to give a vinylaziridine; on further heating this undergoes rearrangement to the five-membered ring, and finally simple reduction gives isoretronecanol, the basic ring skeleton of the alkaloids. Of course, a mechanism involving azide cycloaddition rather than a free nitrene cannot be ruled out.</p>
