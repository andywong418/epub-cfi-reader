<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Carbenes are neutral, divalent, highly reactive carbon intermediates, generally written as R<sub>2</sub>C:, the two dots indicating that the carbon has two non-bonding electrons. The simplest carbene, H<sub>2</sub>C:, is usually called methylene, the term being first introduced during the nineteenth century. Indeed before the quadrivalency of carbon was firmly established many early chemists believed that methylene would be a stable entity, and various experiments were attempted for its generation. The word carbene was apparently conceived by Woodward, Doering and Winstein and was first introduced at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in 1951. Nowadays the term is universally used for divalent carbon species which are simply named as substituted derivatives of carbene; for example PhCH is phenylcarbene and Cl<sub>2</sub>C: is dichloro- carbene. The exceptions to this are carbenes in which the divalent carbon is part of a ring or is doubly bonded. These are named using the <i>-ylidene</i> suffix; for example cyclohexylidene (as shown) and H<sub>2</sub>C=C: is vinylidene. The latter structure, containing a doubly bonded divalent carbon, reminds us that carbon monoxide as well as isonitriles can also be written as carbenes, O=C: and RN=C: respectively, although they are probably more accurately represented by their dipolar resonance forms, e.g. <sup>+</sup>O=C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Carbenes are usually thought of as being <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i>hybridised. There are two bonding electrons (both in <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i>orbitals) and two non-bonding electrons associated with the carbon. Since the non-bonding electrons can have their spins paired or parallel, there is the possibility of two electronic arrangements or <i>spin states.</i> The <i>singlet</i> carbene (spin <i>multiplicity</i> = 1) has the spins of its non-bonding electrons paired. This electron pair is in an <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i>orbital leaving a vacant <i>p</i>-orbital. In <i>triplet</i> carbenes, however, the two non- bonding electrons have parallel spins, and both the <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i> and <i>p-</i>orbitals contain one electron each. Hence triplet carbenes (multiplicity = 3) with their unpaired electrons exhibit the properties of diradicals, and, under the right conditions, can be detected by ESR spectroscopy, for example.</p>

<a id="page_27" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 27, 3 Carbenes</a>
<p class="indent">If carbenes were linear the two <i>sp-</i>orbitals would be degenerate and therefore <i>Hund&#x2019;s Rule</i> would predict a triplet ground state. In general carbenes are not linear but nevertheless the triplet is often the ground state, although the energy difference between singlet and triplet states is usually small (estimated to be 32&#x2013;42 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for methylene). However the nature of the substituents has an important effect on the electronic properties of carbenes. For example, as the carbene substituents R become better &#x03C0;-donors, then the ground state changes from triplet to singlet. Thus dichlorocarbene is a ground state singlet because electron donation from chlorine into the vacant <i>p-</i>orbital on carbon stabilises the singlet state through dipolar resonance structures, although because of the relative electronegativities there is a strong &#x03C3;-polarisation in the opposite direction. There can be other reasons for the singlet spin state being lower in energy than the triplet. Cycloheptatrienylidene may be such a carbene since in the singlet, provided the molecule is planar, the vacant <i>p-</i>orbital can overlap with the rest of the &#x03C0;-system, making a total of six delocalised &#x03C0;-electrons and hence a measure of stabilisation, although the cyclic allene structure, cyclohepta-l,2,4,6-tetraene, may be more stable.</p>

<p class="indent">The nature of the substituents also affects the chemical reactivity of carbene intermediates. Carbenes are electron deficient intermediates, the carbon atom having only six electrons in its outer shell. Therefore in general carbenes are highly electrophilic in their reactions. Not surprisingly the more electron withdrawing the substituents, the more strongly electrophilic the carbene. Thus difluorocarbene is a more electrophilic intermediate than dichlorocarbene. However if very strong &#x03C0;-donor substituents such as amino groups are present then the carbene may be nucleophilic in its reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">Until fairly recently the high reactivity and short life times of reactive intermediates had precluded any direct measurements on the species. However the advent of flash photolysis techniques, particularly those employing lasers, has enabled chemists to measure the UV spectra of transient species and hence gain important information about their structure. Matrix isolation methods in which the intermediate is generated within an inert frozen matrix, often argon, at temperatures between 4 and 77K, have also allowed the direct observation of reactive intermediates by IR and ESR spectroscopy. Of particular relevance are the measurements that have been carried out on triplet carbenes, which since they behave as diradicals offer the possibility of <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, 3 Carbenes</a>detection by ESR spectroscopy. Thus diazo compounds, the most common carbene precursors (q.v.), can be frozen in an argon matrix and irradiated with UV light within the probe of an ESR spectrometer to generate the carbene, which provided that it has a triplet ground state may have sufficient life-time to give rise to an observable ESR signal. Analysis of such spectra provides details of the carbene structure such as the bond angle between the two substituents; for example triplet diphenylcarbene has a bond angle of about 142&#x00B0;, whereas the much more hindered di(anthracen-9-yl)carbene is almost linear. The best estimate for the bond angle in triplet methylene itself is about 136&#x00B0;; most singlet carbenes are estimated (by various means) to have bond angles of about 102&#x00B0;. Carbenes can be stabilised by steric and/or electronic effects, and two dramatic illustrations of this are the very recent reports of stable carbenes. French workers have prepared (<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>P-C-SiMe<sub>3</sub>, a distillable red oil, and in 1991 a US group reported the first crystalline carbene!! l,3-Di-l-adamantylimidazol-2-ylidene is a colourless solid, m.p. 240&#x00B0;C, which is stable in the absence of oxygen. The bond angle at the carbene carbon as determined by <i>X</i>-ray crystallography is 102&#x00B0;.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Generation of carbenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most methods of generating carbenes are based on elimination or fragmentation reactions, and usually involve the breaking of rather weak bonds and the formation of a small thermodynamically stable byproduct such as dinitrogen. The commonly used methods are summarised on the next page.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Diazo compounds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Diazo compounds, known for over a century since the first preparation of ethyl diazoacetate by Curtius in 1883, are probably the most widely used carbene precursors. They possess a 1,3-dipolar structure and are readily prepared from a variety of precursors, decomposing to carbenes with loss of nitrogen under thermal or photochemical conditions or under the influence of certain transition metal catalysts. The stability of diazo compounds is very much influenced by the substituents present. Simple diazoalkanes such as diazomethane tend to be rather unstable and because of their toxic and explosive nature must be handled with great care. They are also rapidly decomposed by acids by a mechanism which involves protonation on carbon followed by loss of nitrogen. Diazo carbonyl compounds on the other hand are much more stable towards heat and acid, as are other diazo compounds in which the diazo 1,3-dipole can be resonance stabilised by electron- withdrawing substituents on carbon. In addition, such compounds are easily prepared by the <i>diazo transfer</i> reaction using arenesulphonyl azides.</p>

<p class="indent">Unless the diazo compound is particularly stable, thermal generation of carbenes is usually preferred since the photochemical method produces intermediates with much higher energy, leading to indiscriminate reactions. However the thermal decomposition of many diazo compounds is markedly catalysed by the presence of certain transition metal salts, a fact that was first noted over 80 years ago. Originally copper powder or copper(II) salts were used for such purposes, but nowadays rhodium(II) carboxylates such as rhodium(II) acetate are usually the preferred catalysts. In the presence of such catalysts diazo carbonyl compounds readily decompose at room temperature in dichloromethane or in boiling benzene to give carbene-type products. The intermediates in these reactions are not free carbenes but transition metal complexes often referred to as <i>metallocarbenes</i> or <i>carbenoids</i> and usually represented by the structure shown (L = ligand) containing a formal metal&#x2013;carbon double bond. Such transition metal carbenes possess the same electron deficient nature as free carbenes and undergo the same types of reaction, and although not isolable bear some structural resemblance to stable metal&#x2013;carbene complexes of, for example, tungsten and chromium. The recent development of chiral copper and rhodium catalysts with the potential for asymmetric synthesis has further increased the usefulness of the catalytic decomposition of diazo compounds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Tosylhydrazones &#x2013; the Bamford&#x2013;Stevens reaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">In cases where the diazo compound is somewhat unstable, low molecular weight diazoalkanes for example, then it often better to use a diazo precursor. The simplest of these are hydrazones readily prepared from ketones and converted into diazo compounds using oxidants such as mercury(II) oxide, silver(I) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, or lead(IV) acetate. The diazo compound may be isolated or can be taken straight through to carbene derived products. The method finds application in the synthesis of alkynes from 1,2-diketones via the bis-hydrazones, although non-carbene mechanisms can be written for this transformation.</p>

On heating or on irradiation the salt decomposes with loss of sodium 4-toluenesulphinate (NaTs) and nitrogen to give the carbene. The whole process is known as the Bamford&#x2013;Stevens reaction, and is quite general for a range of carbenes. Under certain circumstances the intermediate diazo compounds may be isolated although this is rare.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ketenes, like diazo compounds, can eliminate a stable molecule (CO) on thermolysis or photolysis to generate carbenes. The reaction, which is illustrated in general (right), is not widely used since ketenes are not readily available precursors and tend to polymerise under the reaction conditions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Ylides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Both phosphorus and sulphur ylides are well known reagents in synthetic organic chemistry and react with carbonyl compounds to give alkenes (the Wittig reaction) and epoxides respectively. Ylides also react with electrophilic alkenes to give cyclopropanes, the formal products of carbene addition to the double bond. However the mechanism involves conjugate nucleophilic addition of the ylide followed by elimination to form the three-membered ring rather than a carbene intermediate. Nevertheless such ylides are often known as carbene transfer reagents.</p>

It should also be noted that, as indicated in the general scheme on page 29 the reaction is reversible since electrophilic carbenes readily react with nucleophiles to give ylides (see later).</p>
<a id="page_32" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 32, 3 Carbenes</a>
<h3 class="h3">Small rings</h3>
<p class="noindent">Three-membered rings, which have a high ground state energy because of steric strain, will often decompose to give carbene intermediates simply on heating or irradiation, provided that a thermodynamically stable fragment is extruded. Examples involving epoxides and cyclopropanes are shown below. Epoxides are useful but rarely used precursors to arylcarbenes, whereas the decomposition of cyclopropanes is the reverse of their formation from a carbene and an alkene, and also of limited use. Related to this formal retro- 1,2-cycloaddition is the retro-1,4-cycloaddition of benzonorbornadienes which decompose on heating to generate carbenes with the elimination of naphthalene. The method is commonly used as a source of dimethoxycarbene and is also widely used for the generation of silylene and germylene intermediates.</p>

<p class="indent">The most useful carbene precursors of the small ring type are diazirines. Diazirines are cyclic isomers of diazo compounds and it is interesting to note that an early structure proposed for diazomethane itself was the three- membered diazirine, although it was many years after this before the first genuine diazirine was isolated. Surprisingly perhaps diazirines are not particularly hazardous to handle despite their obvious desire to lose molecular nitrogen. They are readily prepared from ketones by reaction with ammonia and chloramine followed by oxidation of the resulting diaziridine. The method is quite widely used, particularly for halocarbenes and for mechanistic studies.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Strained alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cleavage of a carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond to give two carbenes is thermodynamically highly unfavourable, the decomposition of ethene into two molecules of methylene, for example, is reckoned to be endothermic by about 800 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>. However if the alkene is extremely sterically hindered then the &#x03C0;-bond is weakened due to the considerably reduced <i>p&#x2013;p</i> overlap and <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, 3 Carbenes</a> distortion from planarity thereby raising the ground state energy, and therefore dissociation to carbenes on heating is not prohibitively costly in energy. The well-known example of this process is the reversible dissociation of tetranaphth-1-ylethene into two molecules of bis(naphth-1-yl) carbene on heating to about 250&#x00B0;C.</p>

<p class="indent">Related to the dissociation of sterically crowded alkenes to carbenes is their rearrangement on irradiation. For example, 1,1-di-<i>tert</i>-butylethenes rearrange by hydrogen shift to generate alkylcarbenes in the reverse of a common carbene rearrangement pathway, the driving force presumably being the relief of strain in going from an <i>sp<sup>2</sup>-</i> to an <i>sp<sup>3</sup>-</i>carbon which bears two bulky groups. On strong heating, usually in the vapour phase, alkynes can also rearrange by hydrogen shift to give vinylidenes. The reaction has been exploited as a route to cyclopentenones since the vinylidenes readily undergo intramolecular C&#x2013;H insertion reactions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Many five-membered ring heterocyclic compounds decompose to give carbenes on heating or irradiation with the extrusion of thermodynamically stable fragments. The decomposition of l,5-dihydro-l,3,4-oxadiazoles shown below occurs readily at about 80&#x00B0;C with loss of nitrogen followed by the carbonyl fragment to give carbenes. In certain cases the intermediate carbonyl ylide, R<sub>2</sub>C=O<sup>+</sup><sub>&#x2212;</sub>C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>Me(OMe) in the example cited, may be trapped in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Another example is provided by 1,3-dioxolan-2-ones which fragment with loss of carbon dioxide and a carbonyl compound. Five-membered heteroaromatic rings can also fragment to carbenes although the aromatic stabilisation usually means that the reaction must be carried out at quite high temperature or photochemically.</p>

<p class="noindent">Historically this is one of the most important routes to carbenes, since it was the investigation into the mechanism of the hydrolysis of chloroform under basic conditions, with the formation of carbon monoxide and formate, by Hine and co-workers in the early 1950s that initiated the modern era of carbene chemistry, although the idea that dichlorocarbene might be an intermediate in the reaction was first expressed by Geuther ninety years earlier in 1862. The carbene mechanism, which involves rapid formation of the stabilised trichloromethyl anion followed by rate determining loss of chloride by &#x03B1;-elimination and subsequent trapping of the carbene by the aqueous solvent, was proven by detailed kinetic studies of the reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The reaction has been extended to other halomethanes and is a general route to dihalocarbenes. The ease of the elimination depends on the halide leaving group and follows the usual order: I &#x003E; Br &#x003E; Cl &#x226B; F. Thus CHClF<sub>2</sub> gives exclusively difluorocarbene, CHBr<sub>2</sub>F gives bromo(fluoro)carbene and so on. The reactions are best carried out in an organic solvent using a strong non-nucleophilic base such as potassium <i>tert</i>-butoxide, although nowadays the use of phase transfer catalysis has become the route of choice for the generation of dichlorocarbene. The method involves taking a two-phase mixture of chloroform (which also contains the substrate for the carbene such as an alkene) and 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and adding a quaternary ammonium salt, e.g. PhCH<sub>2</sub>NEt<sub>3</sub>Cl, which acts as the phase-transfer catalyst to &#x2018;transport&#x2019; the hydroxide base into the organic phase. Although the reaction is run in the presence of water, the carbene is generated and reacts in the organic phase.</p>
<p class="indent">If the strongly basic conditions required to generate dihalocarbenes by &#x03B1;-elimination are likely to cause unwanted side reactions, then a route which avoids the use of external base must be used. The sodium salt of trichloroacetic or tribromoacetic acid is a convenient precursor to dichloro or <a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, 3 Carbenes</a> dibromo carbene since on heating in an aprotic solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane (b.p. 80&#x00B0;C) it readily undergoes decarboxylation followed by loss of sodium chloride (or bromide) from the trihalomethyl anion. A related method involves the use of phenylmercury trihalomethanes, PhHgCX<sub>3</sub>, often called Seyferth reagents after the chemist who developed their use. On heating in benzene the reagents eliminate PhHgX with the formation of the dihalocarbene.</p>

<p class="indent">Attempts to extend the above &#x03B1;-elimination reactions to the generation of carbenes other than dihalocarbenes have been largely unsuccessful. Thus dichloromethane is not a good source of chlorocarbene under the usual basic conditions, although reasonable yields of carbene adducts can be obtained when butyllithium is used as base. However, this and analogous reactions of 1,1-dihalo compounds almost certainly involve an &#x03B1;-halo-organolithium species as the intermediate rather than a free carbene. The mechanism involves metal&#x2013;halogen exchange to give the organolithium intermediate; these are stable in solution at low temperature and have been studied in detail, for example by <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy thereby leaving little doubt about their structure. On being allowed to warm up in the presence of an appropriate substrate, lithium halide is lost and carbene products are formed. Hence the R<sub>2</sub>CXLi intermediates show similar properties to the free carbenes R<sub>2</sub>C:, and for this reason are often known as <i>carbenoids</i> or <i>lithium carbenoids.</i> Unfortunately the carbenoid terminology is also used for the intermediates formed in transition metal catalysed decomposition of diazo compounds (see page 30). Related zinc carbenoids are almost certainly involved as intermediates in the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of alkenes which uses diiodomethane and zinc metal in ether.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Cycloaddition reactions of carbenes</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Cycloaddition to alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of cyclopropanes by the 1,2-addition of carbenes to alkenes was first reported by Doering in 1954. The process which is probably the most characteristic reaction of carbene intermediates is now widely used as a synthetic route to cyclopropanes. Much of the initial work involved the addition of dibromocarbene, a typical electrophilic singlet carbene, to alkenes to give, it was noted, cyclopropanes in which the alkene stereochemistry was preserved. This result was rationalised in the <i>Skell hypothesis</i> (1956) which argued that since a singlet carbene could add to an alkene in a single step process, the two new bonds being formed simultaneously, the addition would be stereospecific. The triplet carbene on the other hand cannot give a cyclopropane in a one-step reaction since this is spin forbidden, and must <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, 3 Carbenes</a> therefore add in two steps via a diradical intermediate which must undergo spin inversion before the second C&#x2013;C bond can form. However spin inversion can be relatively slow, and if bond rotation is faster, then stereospecificity is lost. This does not mean that triplet carbenes always add to alkenes in a non-stereospecific manner since spin inversion may be faster than bond rotation.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The addition of singlet carbenes to alkenes is generally regarded as a concerted process, and therefore should obey the rules of orbital symmetry. However it turns out that the direct approach of a carbene to a double bond is forbidden since there are antibonding interactions whichever combination of orbitals one takes. Therefore the carbene adopts a sideways non-linear approach in which bonding interactions between the relevant orbitals are strictly maintained, the dominant interaction usually being HOMO (alkene)&#x2013;LUMO (carbene), i.e. the carbene &#x2018;attacks&#x2019; as an electrophile with its vacant <i>p-</i>orbital, possibly forming a &#x2018;loose&#x2019; &#x03C0;-complex.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the exact mechanism, the Skell hypothesis generally holds, and intermediates such as dihalocarbenes which have ground state singlets add stereospecifically to alkenes. The stereochemical outcome of other reactions is often subject to experimental conditions since despite the fact that the carbene may have a triplet ground state, it is usually generated as the singlet. Therefore the stereochemistry of the cyclopropane product depends on how fast the singlet carbene adds to the alkene relative to how fast it decays to its triplet ground state. For example, fluorenylidene generated by photolysis of diazofluorene adds largely stereospecifically to <i>cis</i>-but-2-ene since the first formed intermediate is the singlet. However if the reaction is run in the presence of solvents such as dibromomethane or hexafluorobenzene which are good at deactivating the higher energy singlet carbene to its triplet ground state, then not surprisingly the stereospecificity of the addition falls markedly. Conversely if the reaction is conducted in the presence of <i>triplet quenchers</i>, substances such as butadiene which selectively remove any triplet carbenes, the addition is again stereospecific.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Another mechanistic complication arises if the carbene is generated by thermolysis of a diazo compound. Since the diazo compound is a 1,3-dipole it can undergo cycloaddition to the alkene in its own right <i>before</i> it loses nitrogen. The resulting five-membered ring, a pyrazoline, can then lose nitrogen by a diradical mechanism, to give the cyclopropane non- stereospecifically by a mechanism which does not involve a carbene intermediate. The use of transition metal catalysts to decompose the diazo compound avoids this complication.</p>

The asymmetric cyclopropanation of styrene to give a mixture of <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> products, both in high enantiomeric excess, using a chiral catalyst system, one of many currently being studied, is particularly noteworthy. Further examples are given in <a href="#ch3.7">Section 3.7</a>.

<h3 class="h3">Cycloaddition to 1,2-dienes (allenes)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many carbenes add readily to allenes to give alkylidenecyclopropanes in a synthetically useful reaction. Thus allene itself reacts with ethoxycarbonylcarbene generated from ethyl diazoacetate to give the ethyl ester of 2-methylenecyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. 3-Methylbuta-1,2-diene (dimethylallene) has been proposed as a useful probe for carbene multiplicity since singlets add to the more substituted double bond whereas triplets add to the 1,2-bond. The proposal is certainly borne out by dibromocarbene which gives cleanly 1,1-dibromo-2,2-dimethyl-3-methylene cyclopropane.</p>

<p class="noindent">The 1,4-addition of carbenes to 1,3-dienes to give cyclopentenes is extremely rare, since the 1,2-addition to give a vinylcyclopropane is much more favourable. Unfortunately the situation is complicated by the fact that vinylcyclopropanes can be converted into cyclopentenes on heating although this reaction generally requires high temperatures. In special circumstances direct 1,4-addition reactions are observed, but only in poor yield. Thus dichlorocarbene adds to 1,2-bismethylenecycloheptane, in which the two double bonds are held close to one another, in 0.6% yield.</p>

In the first instance the resulting cyclopropene is readily hydrolysed to the corresponding cyclopropenone, and the second reaction is complicated by competing addition of the carbene as a 1,3-dipole to give a furan.</p>

The decomposition of diazo compounds in the presence of aromatic rings is catalysed by transition metal salts and an intramolecular version of the reaction has been used as a route to 7&#x2013;5-bicyclic systems.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Insertion into C&#x2013;H bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another characteristic reaction of carbenes is their insertion into single bonds, notably C&#x2013;H bonds. Provided that it is selective (see below), the insertion reaction is useful in synthesis because it leads to the formation of a new C&#x2013;C bond. As for cycloaddition to alkenes, two mechanisms can be envisaged: a direct concerted insertion of the singlet, or a stepwise hydrogen abstraction recombination mechanism involving the triplet. The stereochemical consequences of these two mechanisms are that singlet carbenes should insert into C&#x2013;H bonds with retention of configuration, whereas in triplet reactions which may involve a diradical intermediate, the stereochemical integrity of the substrate may be lost, although there are exceptions to this.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Very reactive carbenes such as methylene insert almost indiscriminately into hydrocarbon C&#x2013;H bonds. Thus decomposition of diazomethane in pentane or 2,3-dimethylbutane showed that the primary, secondary and tertiary C&#x2013;H bonds were attacked at random, and statistical ratios of products were formed. Other carbenes are more chemoselective, and ethoxycarbonylcarbene, for example, inserts preferentially into tertiary then secondary over primary C&#x2013;H bonds. Less reactive carbenes such as dihalocarbenes only insert into more reactive C&#x2013;H bonds, such as benzylic ones. Insertion into allylic C&#x2013;H bonds is complicated by competing addition to the double bond. Alkylcarbenes almost invariably react by intramolecular C&#x2013;H insertion to give cycloalkanes, which is transannular in the case of cycloalkylidenes, or by rearrangement to give alkenes. Further examples of C&#x2013;H insertion reactions are shown in <a href="#ch3.7">Section 3.7</a>.</p>

Carbenes react with alcohols to give the products of O&#x2013;H insertion although the mechanism probably involves nucleophilic attack by the oxygen rather than a true insertion. Likewise the reaction with amines can lead to the formation of new C&#x2013;N bonds. Many of these reactions are best carried out via transient transition metal carbenoid intermediates, and some examples of their use are given in <a href="#ch3.7">Section 3.7</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangement of carbenes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Carbenes, like other electron deficient intermediates with a vacant <i>p-</i>orbital such as carbocations, undergo facile rearrangement in which an atom or group on the adjacent carbon migrates to the electron deficient centre with simultaneous formation of a new C=C bond. Such rearrangements are usually called 1,2-shifts, and often involve migration of a hydrogen atom since the order of migrating ability is: H &#x226B; aryl &#x003E; alkyl. This hydrogen shift, which can also be regarded as an intramolecular insertion of the carbene into the adjacent C&#x2013;H bond, is analogous to Wagner&#x2013;Meerwein shifts in carbocations, and proceeds so readily that, as noted previously, intermolecular reactions of simple alkylcarbenes are rarely seen. The mechanism involves overlap of the migrating &#x03C3;-bond with the vacant <i>p-</i>orbital of the carbene, and like many such reactions requires the correct spatial alignment of orbitals with the migrating group coplanar with the vacant orbital. Although the rearrangement is often represented as occurring in the free carbene, in most cases the alternative &#x2018;concerted&#x2019; mechanism in which the migration occurs at the same time as the leaving group (e.g. nitrogen from a diazo compound) is lost cannot be ruled out.</p>

Tertiary amines, phosphines, ethers, sulphides, and sulphoxides all react to give ylides in the reverse of a carbene forming reaction, although the reaction with sulphoxides is complicated by competing deoxygenation. Depending on the substituents present, the ylides may be isolable or may undergo rearrangement. Polarised multiple bonds such as C=O and C=N also react with carbenes by attack of the heteroatom lone pair to give ylides which undergo further reaction. Some examples of the formation of ylides from carbenes, which are usually best carried out via the corresponding rhodium carbenoids, are shown.</p>

<p class="indent">Carbon nucleophiles such as stabilised anions also react with carbenes, and the Reimer&#x2013;Tiemann reaction is a well known example of such a process. Phenol is reacted with chloroform and base to give salicaldehyde by initial attack of the phenoxide ion, through carbon, on the electrophilic dichlorocarbene that is generated under the reaction conditions. The resulting adduct rearomatises and the dichloromethyl group is hydrolysed to an aldehyde with assistance from the neighbouring phenoxide ion, possibly via the orthoquinomethide intermediate shown.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Uses of carbenes in organic synthesis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Carbene reactions have found wide application in preparative organic chemistry in recent years, particularly in the synthesis of cyclic systems using intramolecular reactions. Some representative syntheses in which a carbene reaction features as the key step are discussed below.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Cyclopropanes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cyclopropanation of alkenes using carbenes is such a versatile reaction that it is no surprise to find that it has been widely used in the synthesis of cyclopropanes. In the first example presented below, the tricyclic naturally occurring cyclopropane cycloeudesmol is assembled using an intramolecular copper carbenoid addition to a methylene cyclohexane derivative, the substrate diazo compound being readily prepared by a diazo transfer reaction.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The second example involves the preparation of a tetracyclic cyclopropapyrroloindole, an analogue of the mitosene antitumour agents. Again the key step is an intramolecular addition to an alkene, although in this case the reaction probably proceeds through the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the intermediate diazo compound rather than a free carbene.</p>

</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Cyclopentanoid natural products</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cyclopropanes often feature as key intermediates in synthesis, and the following route to the triquinane hirsutene illustrates this. Copper(II) catalysed decomposition of the diazo compound results in formation of a vinyl cyclopropane which on heating undergoes rearrangement to a cyclopentene thereby establishing the tricyclic system in two simple steps. Final reduction and Wittig olefination gives the natural product, hirsutene.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Cyclopentanes are also readily prepared using intramolecular C&#x2013;H insertions. Most of the reactions involve the rhodium(II) catalysed decomposition of &#x03B1;-diazo-&#x03B2;-keto esters which give cyclopentanones in good yield. Three examples are given below and feature as key steps in routes to &#x03B1;-cuparenone, pentalenolactone E, and an analogue of the ginkolide natural products.</p>

<h3 class="h3">&#x03B2;-Lactams</h3>
<p class="noindent">The &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics, e.g. penicillin, play a key role in the treatment of bacterial infections, and therefore, not surprisingly, organic chemists are always looking for new ways in which to prepare these important compounds. Three routes based on carbenes are shown below. The first involves an intramolecular C&#x2013;H insertion reaction of a carbene, derived by photolysis of a diazo amide, to form the four-membered ring itself, whereas the second involves a rhodium carbenoid insertion into the N&#x2013;H bond of an existing &#x03B2;-lactam which allows the fusion of the second ring. This important reaction, which is arguably the most significant carbene reaction of recent years, was originally developed by the Merck company as a key step in the laboratory synthesis of the carbapenam family of antibiotics, and, surprisingly perhaps, is now used in the industrial process. The final example involves a Wolff rearrangement of a diazoketone to effect a ring contraction of a five-membered ring to the &#x03B2;-lactam. Note that it is the C&#x2013;C bond rather than the C&#x2013;N bond (which has amide double bond character) which migrates to the electron deficient centre.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Heterocycles</h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of carbenes in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds has been discussed above, and in <a href="#ch3.6">Section 3.6</a>. Two further examples are presented here and involve an intramolecular O&#x2013;H insertion reaction and an intramolecular attack on sulphur, followed by 1,2-rearrangement of the resulting ylide. Again both reactions are rhodium catalysed reflecting modern practice.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Ring modification reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">As well as being involved in ring forming reactions, carbenes also feature in useful transformations of existing rings. The ring expansion of cyclic ketones via reaction of their trimethylsilyl enol ethers with methyl(chloro)carbene is a useful method, and the fragmentation of carbenes derived from &#x03B1;,&#x03B2;-epoxyketones is a general route to acetylenes. The latter reaction, often known as the <i>Eschenmoser fragmentation,</i> employs tosylhydrazones or aziridinylimines as the carbene precursor and works particularly well for cyclic alkynes.</p>
