<p class="fmnoindent">The use of neutral reactive intermediates (radicals, carbenes, nitrenes, and arynes) in organic synthesis has increased dramatically over the past 10&#x2013;15 years. It is now commonplace for organic chemists to use reactions which proceed via radical intermediates; these processes can be as equally efficient and high yielding as those involving polar intermediates such as carbanions. Carbenes, too, particularly in the form of transition-metal carbenoids, as well as nitrenes and arynes, are increasingly used in synthesis.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Although reactions involving neutral reactive intermediates do appear in standard undergraduate texts, the discussion is usually very brief, and does not emphasize the synthetic potential of such species. This short book aims to fill that gap by providing an up-to-date concise account of the status of reactive intermediates in organic synthesis. The intermediates are discussed in turn, and although the emphasis is on preparatively useful reactions, particularly in the chapter on radicals, the chapters on carbenes, nitrenes, and arynes do contain short accounts of the fundamental properties of the intermediates.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Finally, we thank Dr Russ Bowman for his helpful comments on <a href="Chapter3.xhtml">Chapters 3</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter5.xhtml">5</a>.</p>
