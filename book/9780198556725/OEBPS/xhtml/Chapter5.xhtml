<h1 class="main">5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Arynes</h1>
<p class="noindent">Arynes are neutral intermediates derived from aromatic rings by removing two substituents leaving behind two electrons to be distributed between two orbitals. Although in most cases the substituents are <i>ortho</i> to one another, this is not a prerequisite, and <i>meta</i> and <i>para</i> arynes are possible intermediates. The most common aryne, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is based on benzene itself, although all aromatic and heteroaromatic systems can potentially give similar species. The need to postulate a C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub> intermediate arose in the 1870s in order to explain the formation of biphenyl in certain reactions, and although the first correct formulation of a related intermediate from benzofuran was put forward in 1902, it was not until the 1940s that Wittig advanced clear and convincing arguments for the intermediacy of arynes. This was followed in 1953 by the classic isotopic labelling experiments of Roberts (see <a href="#ch5.2">Section 5.2</a>) and the Diels&#x2013;Alder trapping by Wittig in 1955 (see <a href="#ch5.4">Section 5.4</a>) which finally confirmed the existence of benzyne.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>aryne</i> nomenclature derives from the fact that the <i>ortho-</i>isomer of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (<i>ortho</i>-benzyne) can be represented as an alkyne (see below), although systematically the species should be named as a didehydroaromatic compound. Hence <i>ortho-</i>benzyne is 1,2-didehydrobenzene and 3,4-pyridyne is 3,4-didehydropyridine and so on. Nevertheless the aryne nomenclature remains in common use and will be used here throughout. Although many arynes have been implicated as intermediates, by far the most studied species is <i>ortho</i>-benzyne, a fact reflected by the remainder of this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>ortho</i>-Benzyne</h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>ortho-</i>Benzyne is usually represented as a singlet molecule with a carbon-carbon triple bond. This strained &#x03C0;-bond is formed by lateral overlap of the two orbitals in the plane of the ring. The alternative structure is a diradical, either singlet or triplet, although most of the chemistry of the species is in accord with the alkyne structure. Theoretical calculations support the view <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, 5 Arynes</a> that the symmetrical triple bond structure is lowest in energy, and suggest that the structure is distorted from benzene with estimates for C&#x2261;C bond length in the range 1.25&#x2013;1.34&#x00C5; (cf. 1.20 for ethyne and 1.39 for benzene). The geometric distortion is compensated for by the greater lateral <i>p</i>-orbital overlap, although this overlap is still relatively poor compared with that in a normal &#x03C0;-bond. A direct consequence of the strained &#x2018;alkyne&#x2019; bond is that arynes have low lying LUMOs and hence the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO is small. In accord with this, <i>ortho-</i>benzyne shows the properties of a highly reactive alkyne participating in a range of cycloaddition reactions. In other reactions, however, <i>ortho-</i>benzyne resembles a carbene, having the similar electronic arrangement of two electrons distributed between two orbitals, and behaves as a powerful electrophile, a second consequence of its low lying LUMO. Recently with the advent of sophisticated experimental techniques, benzyne has been observed directly using laser flash photolysis to obtain its UV spectrum and matrix isolation to record the IR spectrum. In the latter experiment an intermediate, controversially assigned as <i>ortho-</i>benzyne, with an IR absorption of 2085 cm<sup>-1</sup>, typical of a C&#x2261;C bond, was observed.</p>

<p class="indent">The triple bond in <i>ortho-</i>benzyne can be stabilised by complexation to transition metals. Aryne&#x2013;metal complexes were originally proposed as intermediates in the decomposition of various aryl derivatives of early transition metals, and the first fully characterised mononuclear <i>ortho-</i>benzyne complex, TaMe<sub>2</sub>(&#x03B7;<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)(&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), was prepared thus. Although this method does not appear general for all transition metals, various complexes of zirconium, rhenium and niobium have been characterised. More recently complexes of nickel and platinum have been prepared. For example, oxidative addition of 1,2-dibromobenzene to a nickel(O) complex of ethene followed by reduction with sodium amalgam gives the <i>ortho-</i>benzyne nickel complex. The same complex can be prepared by generating <i>ortho-</i>benzyne from fluorobenzene in the presence of the nickel ethene complex. X-Ray crystallographic analysis shows that the metal atom and the two aryne carbons form a metallocyclopropene ring.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>meta</i>-Benzyne and <i>para</i>-benzyne</h3>
<p class="noindent">The removal of two substituents from the <i>meta-</i> and <i>para</i>-positions of a benzene ring leaving two electrons in two orbitals should generate <i>meta-</i> and <i>para-</i>benzyne respectively. The benzyne nomenclature is still used for these intermediates despite the fact that there is no formal C&#x2261;C bond present, and the species are more correctly named as 1,3- and 1,4-didehydrobenzene. The structures can be represented either as diradicals or bicyclic compounds with 1,3- and 1,4-bonding. In the case of <i>meta-</i>benzyne, calculations suggest that the bicyclic species, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexa-l,3,5-triene, although highly strained is more stable than the 1,3-diradical, and some experimental evidence has been obtained (<a href="#ch5.2">Section 5.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In contrast, the diradical form of <i>para-</i>benzyne appears to be lower in energy than the highly strained bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-l,3,5-triene (butalene). Evidence for the existence of the diradical, often termed benz-l,4-diyl, was obtained by Bergman in the early 1970s in the specific deuterium scrambling that was observed on heating l,6-dideuteriohexa-l,5-diyn-3-ene. The intermediate 1,4-diradical also abstracts chlorine from CCl<sub>4</sub> to give largely 1,4-dichlorobenzene.</p>

</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Aryl anions</h3>
<p class="noindent">The elimination of a leaving group from the <i>ortho</i>-position of a metallated aromatic ring is historically the most important route to arynes. Although arynes had long been suggested as intermediates in such reactions, it was not until the 1940s that Wittig put the subject on a clear experimental footing. In studying the formation of biphenyl from the reaction of halobenzenes with phenyllithium, he found that the rate was fastest for fluorobenzene. Since this was not the expected result for a simple displacement reaction (fluoride is a worse leaving group than chloride or bromide), an alternative mechanism was suggested whereby the strongly electronegative fluorine facilitated removal of the <i>ortho</i>-proton to give 2-fluorophenyllithium. (In modern terminology we would describe this as a directed lithiation reaction.) Loss of lithium fluoride from this formal anion generates benzyne which rapidly reacts with the strongly nucleophilic phenyllithium. Finally quenching with water in work-up gives biphenyl.</p>

<p class="indent">The <sup>14</sup>C-labelling experiments of Roberts in 1953 put the existence of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne as an intermediate beyond doubt when it was found that treatment of l-<sup>14</sup>C-chlorobenzene with potassamide in liquid ammonia gave a 1:1 mixture of 1- and 2-<sup>14</sup>C labelled aniline. The reaction had clearly proceeded through a symmetrical intermediate, <i>ortho</i>-benzyne. The overall process whereby a nucleophile apparently enters <i>ortho</i> to the leaving group is referred to as <i>cine substitution</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>ortho</i>-metallation of aromatic halides followed by loss of metal halide is now a firmly established route to <i>ortho</i>-arynes. Several bases can be used: alkali metal amides (LiNH<sub>2</sub>, NaNH<sub>2</sub> etc.), alkyllithiums, lithium amides (LiNR<sub>2</sub>), potassium <i>tert</i>-butoxide etc. Some examples of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne generation are shown below. The use of trifluoromethanesulphonate (triflate, OTf) as a superior leaving group to halide is a noteworthy modern advance, particularly when combined with the use of the trimethylsilyl group which on treatment with fluoride ion gives the aryl anion. Precursors which can give aryl anions by other mechanisms are also potential sources of arynes, for example, base induced cleavage of aryl ketones.</p>

<p class="indent">In cases where two possible arynes could be formed from a single precursor, the result will depend on the relative rates of the two steps involved in aryne generation. If the formation of the anion is rate determining then this will control which aryne is formed. For example, lithiation of 3-methoxybromobenzene occurs at the 2-position since it is directed by the oxygen substituent, and provided that loss of bromide is fast, a single <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, 5 Arynes</a> benzyne will result. Likewise powerful <i>ortho</i>-directing substituents such as the oxazoline group can be used to control aryne formation.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The elimination of the elements of HX by strong base can be extended to <i>meta</i>- and <i>prara</i>-benzynes. Thus there is evidence for the involvement of bicyclo[3.1.0]hexa-l,3,5-triene (<i>meta</i>-benzyne) on treatment of the appropriate bicyclic dibromide with potassium <i>tert</i>-butoxide. By a combination of isotopic labelling experiments it was shown that only the bicyclic form of <i>meta</i>-benzyne, rather than the diradical, was an intermediate in the reaction. The aryne is trapped by nucleophiles such as dimethylamine to give an intermediate which undergoes ring opening to give the fulvene as the final product.</p>

<p class="indent">As we have already seen, the diradical form of <i>para</i>-benzyne can be approached by thermal cyclisation reactions of enediynes. The chemical approach to the bicyclic form (butalene) involves a base mediated elimination reaction. Reaction of chlorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexadiene with LiNMe<sub>2</sub> at &#x2013;10&#x00B0;C generates butalene which can be trapped by dimethylamine to give an unstable compound which ring opens to give dimethylaniline. Deuterium labelling experiments, however, show that the reaction is somewhat more complicated than the above analysis would suggest, and for example, direct displacement of chloride cannot be ruled out.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Probably the most important of all precursors to <i>ortho</i>-benzyne is benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate. The compound is easily prepared by diazotisation of 2-aminobenzoic (anthranilic) acid using nitrous acid, and can be isolated as a solid provided it is kept moist. On no account should one attempt to obtain the salt as a dry solid because of the potential explosion risk. To avoid this problem it is quite common to carry out an <i>in situ</i> aprotic diazotisation of anthranilic acid using pentyl nitrite (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>ONO). When heated in a solvent to about 80&#x00B0;C, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are evolved and <i>ortho</i>-benzyne is formed. The decomposition can also be carried out photochemically, and flash photolysis of the diazonium carboxylate has been used to obtain the UV spectrum of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne. Benzenediazonium-3- and 4-carboxylates have been studied under similar conditions and UV spectra have been obtained for the transient intermediates so generated.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the decomposition of benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate can be conveniently represented as a concerted process (as above), this is almost certainly not the case since there is evidence to suggest that nitrogen is lost first. The diazonium carboxylate method is quite general; various substituted <i>ortho</i>-benzynes, 3,4-pyridyne and 2,3-naphthalyne can all be generated from the appropriate amino acid, although some of these may be difficult to prepare, by diazotisation and thermal decomposition. In cases where benzenediazonium carboxylates prove too thermally unstable, one can use a masked version of the diazonium group in the form of a 1,2,3-triazene. These compounds, which should be handled with care since they are potential carcinogens, decompose smoothly at about 130&#x00B0;C (or lower in the presence of acid) with loss of dimethylamine, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Thermal and photochemical fragmentation of cyclic systems</h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne by fragmentation of cyclic systems by electronic rearrangement will only be energetically favourable if the other fragments so formed are extremely thermodynamically stable molecules such as CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. Even so the thermal energy required to initiate the fragmentation is often considerable, high temperature gas phase reactions being necessary. A clue as to whether such a fragmentation is feasible can often be obtained from the mass spectrum of the precursor &#x2013; if the molecule does not fragment in the desired fashion under electron impact it is unlikely to do so under &#x2018;laboratory conditions.&#x2019; Some of the successful cyclic precursors to <i>ortho</i>-benzyne are shown below, and illustrate the large differences in temperatures required to effect the ring fragmentation according to the stability of the precursor.

The reaction, originally studied by C. W. Rees and co-workers, constitutes an extremely mild route to <i>ortho</i>-benzyne, and has been extended to other arynes, notably 1,8-didehydro- naphthalene, a 1,3-diradical. The mechanism formally involves generation of an aminonitrene followed by fragmentation with loss of two molecules of <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, 5 Arynes</a> nitrogen, although in the light of recent results, the intermediate in the lead(IV) acetate reaction should probably be formulated as an <i>N</i>-acetoxy compound.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Other methods</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are many other reactions which possibly involve aryne intermediates. Whilst some are mechanistic curiosities, some have been studied in detail, and although none are generally synthetically useful, some examples are included here. Irradiation of 1,2-di-iodobenzene (or 2-iodophenylmercury(II) iodide) can lead to <i>ortho</i>-benzyne derived products, probably via an aryl radical intermediate resulting from cleavage of the weak C&#x2013;I (or C&#x2013;Hg) bond. Aryl cations, formed by the decomposition of diazonium salts, are also possible intermediates <i>en route</i> to <i>ortho</i>-benzynes; provided that a large <i>ortho</i>-substituent is present, loss of a proton to give an aryne becomes competitive with the normal nucleophilic addition to the cation.</p>

<p class="noindent">The formulation of arynes as compounds with a reactive triple bond often disguises the fact that, like carbenes, they are electron deficient species. They are highly electrophilic and therefore react with nucleophiles of all types,<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, 5 Arynes</a> although because of their low lying LUMOs and highly polarisable orbitals arynes are &#x2018;soft&#x2019; electrophiles and therefore usually react preferentially with soft nucleophiles. Thus it can be shown that the relative reactivity of various nucleophiles follows the order: R<sub>3</sub>C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x2248; RS<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; enolates &#x003E; RO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x003E; Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.

Indeed addition of aryllithiums to <i>ortho</i>-benzynes is a good way of making biaryls. Alkyllithiums add similarly as do acetylenic and benzylic carbanions. Enolates and anions stabilised by cyano, nitro and sulphinyl groups also add to <i>ortho</i>-benzyne and some examples are shown below. Many of these anions are used widely in synthesis, and their arylation by arynes, usually carried out by treating a mixture of the aryl halide and the conjugate base of the anion with potassamide in liquid ammonia, is a useful reaction.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>ortho</i>-Benzyne also undergoes attack from tertiary amines, phosphines, sulphides and related nucleophiles. However in these cases the first formed intermediate cannot undergo the simple proton transfer shown above and therefore reacts in other ways. For example if one of the groups attached to the heteroatom carries a &#x03B2;-hydrogen atom then elimination through a cyclic transition state is the usual process. If no &#x03B2;-hydrogen is available but there are still &#x03B1;-hydrogens present, rearrangement to an ylide is the most likely pathway. Examples of both processes are shown below.</p>

<p class="indent">All the examples discussed to date have involved <i>ortho</i>-benzyne itself, and have simply served to illustrate the range of nucleophiles that react. However one needs to know what happens when unsymmetrical arynes are attacked by nucleophiles, where there are two possible products. The problem arises with substituted <i>ortho</i>-benzynes, arynes with an additional ring, or hetarynes. The ratio of products formed depends on the electronic, and to a lesser extent, steric effects of the substituents (or additional ring or heteroatom) and the incoming nucleophile. Since the relevant orbitals of the aryne are orthogonal to the &#x03C0;-system, the electronic effect of substituents is mainly inductive, i.e. is only relayed through the &#x03C3;-bonds. If the inductive effect of the substituent R can stabilise one of the two transition states to a greater extent then regioselective addition of a nucleophile may be possible. For example, in a 3-substituted aryne, if the substituent is inductively electron withdrawing (&#x2212; I), such as methoxy or dimethylamino, it will stabilise the developing negative charge <i>ortho</i> to itself and hence nucleophilic attack at the <i>meta</i>-position is favoured. Conversely if a +I substituent such as methyl is present, nucleophilic attack often occurs at the <i>ortho</i>-position. An alternative view is that the reaction is under thermodynamic control and simply proceeds to give the more stable aryl anion intermediate. Strictly of course neither analysis of substituent effects is correct, and one should consider the frontier molecular orbitals of the aryne, but such a rigourous treatment is beyond the scope of this book.</p>

<p class="indent">Steric effects only become important when either the attacking nucleophile or the substituent <i>ortho</i> to the aryne bond is very bulky.

Likewise in the addition to 3-methylbenzyne, KNH<sub>2</sub> adds to both <i>ortho</i>- and <i>meta</i>-positions in approximately equal amounts whereas the bulkier nucleophile KNPh<sub>2</sub> adds exclusively to the less hindered meta-position. In additions to 2,3- naphthalyne the <i>peri</i>-hydrogen (H-8) hinders the 1-position, and as the bulk of the nucleophile increases so does the selectivity for attack at C-2.</p>

<p class="indent">One way to avoid the problem of competing sites of nucleophilic addition is to make the reaction intramolecular. In fact intramolecular nucleophilic addition to arynes has been developed into a useful synthetic method for the preparation of benzo fused ring systems. The substrate is usually an aryl halide bearing a side chain, which contains the potentially nucleophilic centre, in the <i>ortho</i>- or <i>meta</i>-position. On treatment with base the aryne is generated and simultaneously the side chain is deprotonated, and provided the anion so formed is nucleophilic enough to compete with the external base, cyclisation occurs in good yield. Some examples are given below. Note that four-, five- and six-membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings are readily formed: in the last example the alkyl side chain is sufficiently long to allow cyclisation to occur at both ends of the aryne although the <i>meta</i>-product is the major one. Benzene rings bridged across their <i>meta</i>- and <i>para</i>-position are known as <i>meta</i>- and <i>para</i>-cyclophanes respectively.</p>

<p class="noindent">Arynes with their reactive triple bond would be expected to participate readily in cycloaddition reactions. However as demonstrated in the previous section, the addition of nucleophiles is extremely facile, and therefore reactions with non-nucleophilic reagents cannot usually be observed unless the aryne is generated in the absence of nucleophiles. In practice this usually means that routes involving the treatment of aryl halides with nucleophilic bases cannot be used. The first cycloaddition reaction of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne, the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction with furan, was observed in 1955 by Wittig and used 2-fluorobromobenzene as the precursor. The cycloadduct was obtained in almost 90% yield, and the reaction has formed the basis for a large number of synthetically useful Diels&#x2013;Alder cycloadditions involving arynes.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Cycloaddition to 1,3-dienes; Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>ortho</i>-Benzyne is an extremely reactive dienophile and reacts with a large range of 1,3-dienes to give Diels&#x2013;Alder products. The reaction is often used as a test for the presence of an aryne intermediate. Furan is commonly used as diene since it is compatible with a number of organometallic reagents and, because it is volatile and easily removed, can be used in large excess. If the aryne is generated under high temperature conditions it is usually better to use the stable but reactive diene l,2,3,4-tetraphenylcyclopenta-l,3-dien-5-one (tetracyclone). In either case the isolation of the appropriate Diels&#x2013;Alder adduct, which in the latter case aromatises by loss of CO, is taken as evidence for the intermediacy of an aryne, although it should be noted that such trapping experiments are not always completely unambiguous. The concerted nature of the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction is shown by the stereospecific addition of <i>E</i>,<i>E</i>-hexa-2,4-diene. In addition to its reactions with &#x2018;standard&#x2019; 1,3- dienes, <i>ortho</i>-benzyne undergoes Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction with compounds not normally considered as dienes such as benzene. Halogenated arynes such as tetrachloro- and tetrafluoro-benzyne are more reactive dienophiles still, and react readily with thiophene and substituted benzenes. Many of these reactions lead to otherwise inaccessible bridged ring systems and are therefore useful in synthesis. Further examples of the Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions of arynes are given in <a href="#ch5.6">Section 5.6.</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">Cycloaddition to alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Arynes react readily with simple alkenes to give either benzocyclobutenes or substituted benzenes. The formation of benzocyclobutenes by what is formally a [2+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the aryne to the alkene proceeds best for strained and electron rich C=C double bonds. For example, dicyclopentadiene reacts to give the <i>exo</i>-isomer of the corresponding four- membered ring in good yield. The addition to cyanoethene (acrylonitrile) and the reaction with the electron rich ethoxyethene (ethyl vinyl ether) gives the cyano- and ethoxy-benzocyclobutenes in 20 and 40% yield respectively, although the latter reaction almost certainly involves nucleophilic addition of the enol ether to the electrophilic aryne followed by collapse of the betaine intermediate. Likewise, addition to <i>E</i>- or <i>Z</i>-l,2-dichloroethene is non- stereospecific in accord with a stepwise, probably diradical, mechanism.</p>

Radical reactions of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne, on the other hand, are extremely rare, since as we have already seen in <a href="#ch5.1">Section 5.1</a>, virtually all of the chemistry of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne is associated with the &#x2018;triple&#x2019; bond rather than the diradical form.</p>

<p class="indent">Many reactions involving <i>ortho</i>-benzyne produce its dimer and trimer, biphenylene and triphenylene respectively. Although in some cases these hydrocarbons are formed as by-products, in others the yields can be quite high. For example, if <i>ortho</i>-benzyne is generated in solution by oxidation of 1-aminobenzotriazole in the absence of a suitable trap, biphenylene is formed in 85% yield. The reaction is highly efficient presumably because the aryne is generated in high local concentration, and therefore dimerises before it can react by other pathways. Decomposition of benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate can also give respectable amounts of biphenylene, although both these precursors only give traces of triphenylene. High yields (over 80%) of triphenylene can be obtained however if <i>ortho</i>-benzyne is generated from an <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, 5 Arynes</a> aryl halide. It is extremely unlikely that under these conditions in the presence of nucleophiles a concerted trimerisation occurs. Much more likely is a stepwise mechanism which involves reaction of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne with the nucleophilic <i>ortho</i>-metallated aryl halide to give an intermediate metallated biphenyl which can react with a second molecule of <i>ortho</i>-benzyne as shown to give, eventually, the observed trimer.</p>

<p class="noindent">Arynes have not been exploited in organic synthesis to the same extent as radicals or carbenes, but nonetheless do undergo some useful transformations. At the simplest level arynes are intermediates in the preparation of &#x2018;unusual&#x2019; isomers of substituted aromatic compounds. For instance treatment of 2- methoxybromobenzene with potassamide in liquid ammonia will result in the formation of the aryne, which will undergo regioselective nucleophilic attack <i>meta</i> to the methoxy group to give 3-methoxyaniline. This is an &#x2018;unusual&#x2019; isomer in the sense that conventional routes such as nitration of anisole followed by reduction of the nitro group do not give the <i>meta</i>-isomer.</p>

As we have already seen in <a href="#ch5.4">Section 5.4</a>, the scope of the Diels&#x2013;Alder reactions with arynes is extremely wide and compounds such as aryl-alkenes and -alkynes, not normally reactive 1,3-dienes, readily participate. Thus 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyne reacts with <i>ortho</i>-benzyne to give, after hydrogen migration, the dimethoxyphenathrene in 42% yield. A similar reaction has been used in an approach to the aporphine alkaloids, whereby 3-methoxybenzyne undergoes Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction with an aryl alkene to give, again after hydrogen migration, the tetracyclic ring system in 30% yield.</p>
