<p class="fmnoindent">Neutral reactive intermediates have progressed from being mechanistic curiosities to being established and reliable tools for organic synthesis, and hence form an essential part of undergraduate chemistry courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. In this eighth primer of the series Chris Moody and Gordon Whitham discuss from first principles the preparation and properties of neutral reactive intermediates with particular emphasis on their use in synthesis. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
