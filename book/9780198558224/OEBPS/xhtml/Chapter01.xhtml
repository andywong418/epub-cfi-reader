As far as possible, we shall define terms using examples from reactions that will be considered later in greater depth, although some will be familiar already. Some of the concepts and definitions presented here will be developed and refined in later chapters.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Elementary reaction</h3>

<p class="noindent">The substitution reaction between chloride and methyl iodide (iodomethane) in an unspecified solvent, <a href="#eq_1.1">eqn 1.1</a>, is an example of a <i>simple</i> reaction&#x2014;one in which reactants give products in a single step. In contrast, <i>complex</i> reactions occur by more than one step, i.e. they involve <i>intermediates</i>, and may be quite complicated. Each individual step of a complex reaction that is a proper chemical reaction in its own right is called an <i>elementary</i> reaction. This does not mean that an elementary reaction cannot be analysed further, for example in terms of bond length and angle changes; it means that these constituent changes are not independent of each other or of other changes involved in the elementary reaction.</p>

<p class="aside">Intermediates, which are discussed on <a href="#page_6">p. 6</a>, may be very short lived or relatively long lived compounds. Their characteristic property is that they are formed in a reaction but are not stable to the reaction conditions so they react further.</p></aside>


<h3 class="h3">Concerted mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">We can imagine a mechanism for the reaction of eqn 1.1 in which the chloride approaches the carbon along a trajectory which is collinear with the <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>carbon-iodine bond, and begins to form a bond to the carbon as the iodide begins to unbond from the other side. This overall process, usually represented by two curly arrows (each of which indicates the movement of an electron pair) as shown in <a href="#eq_1.2">eqn 1.2</a>, is an example of a <i>concerted</i> mechanism.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:8em" id="eq_1.2">
<img src="../images/page_2_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="noindent">The formation of the new bond from the nucleophile to carbon and the breaking of the old bond from carbon to the nucleofuge (this being a nucleophilic substitution reaction at carbon) are not independent elementary reactions; rather, they are conceptually distinct aspects of a single one-step elementary reaction&#x2014;bond making and bond breaking are concerted.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="aside">A nucleofuge is a leaving group which departs with its bonding pair of electrons following heterolysis. A nucleophile is the incoming group which supplies its bonding pair of electrons.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:1em">
<img src="../images/page_2_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure></aside>



<h3 class="h3">Activated complex and transition structure</h3>

<p class="noindent">In the above mechanism, as the concerted bonding of the nucleophile and unbonding of the nucleofuge develop, the molecular potential energy of the ion-molecule system increases until, at a certain stage, it reaches a maximum with both halogen atoms partially bonded to the carbon which is now penta-coordinate. The chemical species corresponding to the molecular potential energy maximum is called the activated complex (indicated by the symbol <sup>&#x2021;</sup>.) and, in this example, it is negatively charged.</p>



<p class="indent3-ka">Like normal molecules, an activated complex has quantized energy levels available to it for all vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom but one of these degrees of freedom is rather special and corresponds to the progress of the reaction (the reaction coordinate, see below). The relationship between its total potential energy and its configuration can in principle be expressed mathematically, and is sometimes called a <i>force field</i> equation. The motionless arrangement of atoms corresponding to the minimum in all degrees of freedom of the potential energy hypersurface of the activated complex (i.e. at the maximum in the reaction coordinate) is called the transition structure. This, unlike the activated complex, has no real existence since all real molecules have at least zero point vibrational energy, but it may be the initial outcome of theoretical calculations. The activated complex (a real molecule) has rotational and vibrational energy according to its temperature.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-23em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The potential energy of a combination of atoms and ions, regardless of whether or not this arrangement corresponds to a stable entity, is the decrease in total energy due to bringing together the constituent atoms and ions from infinite separation to give this arrangement; it does not include the kinetic energy of nuclei or electrons.</p>

<p class="aside">The relationship between configuration and potential energy of a simple molecule is often described by a two-dimensional potential energy diagram or, using three dimensions, a potential energy surface. The force field equation may be regarded as the mathematical version of a potential energy hypersurface, i.e. a multi-dimensional relationship between total potential energy and molecular configuration</p>
</aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">In this particular example, further concerted development of the partial bond from the chlorine to the carbon and attenuation of that between the carbon and the iodine cause the total potential energy of the system to decrease until the former is a fully formed bond and the latter completely broken. At this stage, the molecule-anion pair dissociates to give the products, and further separation of the iodide from the methyl chloride (chloromethane) causes no further change in the total potential energy of the system.</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">Molecularity</h3>

<p class="noindent">The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the number of molecules (or ions) involved in the formation of one activated complex. In the above reaction, a chloride anion and a methyl iodide molecule are involved so it is a bimolecular reaction. The dimerization of cyclopentadiene (see below) is another bimolecular reaction but one in which the two reacting molecules are identical. These two examples show that the number of product molecules that the activated complex yields in the forward direction is not relevant in ascribing molecularity.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A possible mechanism for the <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization of but-2-ene involves rotation about the central carbon-carbon double bond. The activated complex in this mechanism is the molecule with orthogonal <i>p</i>-orbitals on the two adjacent central carbon atoms when the dihedral angle is 90&#x00B0;. Since an activated complex is generated from a single reactant molecule, this is a unimolecular reaction. The de-dimerization of cyclopentadiene dimer (see below) is another unimolecular reaction, so the molecularity of a reversible reaction depends upon which direction is being considered.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="aside">Solvent molecules involved in just solvation changes as reactants give activated complex are Ignored when ascribing molecularity.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:2.5em">
<img src="../images/page_3_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="aside">Trimolecular mechanisms would lead to exceedingly slow reactions because of the infrequency of three- molecule collisions. This is not to say that an activated complex cannot be derived from three (or more) molecules. In such cases, however, the activated complex will have been formed in a bimolecular step which follows an earlier bimolecular step. Thus, in the following, the activated complex in the product-forming step has been built up from molecules A, B, and C, but not in a single trimolecular step.</p>
<p class="aside" style="margin-left:1em"> A + B &#x2192; AB</p>
<p class="aside" style="margin-top:-1em;margin-left:0em">AB + C &#x2192; product</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">Elementary reactions are invariably either unimolecular or bimolecular.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reaction coordinate</h3>

<p class="noindent">The above mechanism for the reaction of chloride with methyl iodide involves changes in various bond lengths and angles as the reaction proceeds. As described above, the distance from the chlorine to the carbon decreases whilst that from the carbon to the iodine increases. Additionally, however, the C-H bond lengths may be expected to change, as also will the H-C-H bond angles, for example. It is convenient to describe the overall progress from reactant molecule and ion to product molecule and ion using a single composite configurational dimension, and we call this the reaction coordinate. It may be a single structural variable in some very simple reactions, for example it is precisely the intemuclear distance in the dissociation of a diatomic molecule such as H-Cl. In most cases of interest to the organic chemist, however, this will not be the case though we may be able to identify principal components, such as the intemuclear chlorine- carbon and carbon-iodine distances in the above substitution reaction. Note, however, that the nature and identity of the principal components of the reaction coordinate may change as the reaction proceeds.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Molecular potential energy reaction profile</h3>

<p class="noindent">If we plot the total molecular potential energy of an elementary reaction against the reaction coordinate, the result is a type of reaction profile. Curve (g) in <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows the molecular potential energy reaction profile for the gas-phase substitution reaction of fluoride with methyl chloride. As the ion approaches the covalent molecule, the potential energy of the system <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>decreases due to the increasingly favourable electrostatic interaction between the anion and the positive end of the molecular dipole (the methyl group). At a certain distance, there is a potential energy minimum corresponding to the stable ion-dipole complex. Further progress along the reaction coordinate involves formation of a covalent bond from the fluorine to the methyl, and cleavage of the bond from the methyl to the chlorine. This rebonding brings about formation of an isomeric stable ion-dipole complex between chloride and methyl fluoride, and involves a potential energy barrier. Separation of this new complex into chloride and methyl fluoride involves work to overcome the ion-dipole interaction, and the energy of the system increases again. Note that there are two stable ion-dipole complexes, and that the energy maximum corresponding to the activated complex for their interconversion is lower than the energy of the reactants (the separate methyl chloride molecule plus fluoride anion).</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The concerted bonding of the nucleophile and unbonding of the nucleofuge in this mechanism are not independent processes. However, the linkage between them does not require that they are exactly synchronous, i.e. exactly together in time. If the bonding of the nucleophile runs ahead of the unbonding of the nucleofuge, there would be a build-up of negative charge in the methyl of the activated complex. Conversely, if the unbonding of the nucleofuge were ahead of the bonding of the nucleophile, the methyl of the activated complex would bear a partial positive charge. In this simple case, the mechanism is almost certainly both concerted and highly synchronous, but these two terms are not synonyms, and later we shall encounter asynchronous concerted mechanisms.</p></aside>

<figcaption><p class="noindent" style="width:100%"><b>Fig. 1.1</b> Molecular potential energy reaction profile for the bimolecular substitution reaction between fluoride and methyl chloride (g) in the gas phase, and (s) in solution</p></figcaption></figure>

<p class="noindent">This picture is completely transformed when solvent molecules are included as curve (s) shows. Solvation of the highly polarizing small reactant and product anions stabilizes them much more than it stabilizes the covalent compounds and the large weakly polarizing activated complex, and the minima corresponding to the ion-dipole complexes have disappeared.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Molar reaction profiles, transition states, and activation parameters</h3>
<p class="noindent">An alternative type of reaction profile may be constructed which includes the molar enthalpy (as opposed to molecular potential energy). In principle, this involves converting from the molecular to the molar scale by multiplying molecular potential energy by the Avogadro number, and taking account of the distribution of all the molecules and ions amongst the many quantized energy levels available to them according to the temperature and <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>volume of the system. The enthalpy of intermolecular and solvation effects (if the reaction is in solution) also has to be taken into account. The practicality of these calculations need not concern us, but we should note that they are meaningful only for reactant, activated complex, and product molecules. So, whereas the line of a molecular potential energy reaction profile describes a continuous relationship (between structure and potential energy), this is not true of lines joining the states of a molar enthalpy profile which are represented by horizontal lines in the profile.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The maximum in an enthalpy profile corresponds to one mole of activated complexes distributed amongst the many energy levels available to them according to the temperature. This hypothetical thermodynamic state is the transition state of the reaction, and the difference in molar enthalpy between the initial state and the transition state is the enthalpy of activation, &#916;<i>H<sup>&#x2021;</sup>.</i> The origin of this activation parameter lies in transition state theory, and it is related to the Arrhenius activation energy of the reaction (<i>E</i><sub>a</sub>, see below) by the equation</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-left:12em"><i>E<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> &#x002B; <i>RT</i></p>



<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_5_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure></aside>

<p class="noindent">Consequently, &#916;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> is often readily determinable from measurements of the rate constant of the reaction at different temperatures <i>(T</i> in the above equation is the mean temperature of the Arrhenius investigation).</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">In principle, knowledge (from theory) of the transition structure and of the molecular vibrations and rotations available to it allows us to calculate the absolute entropy of one mole of activated complexes at a concentration of 1 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> at any temperature. This is difficult and practicable for only few reactions at the present. The difference between this, the molar entropy of the transition state, and the corresponding value for the initial state is the entropy of activation, &#916;<i>S<sup>&#x2021;</sup>.</i> This may be determined experimentally from rate constant measurements at different temperatures because it is related to the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor (A, see below) by the equation</p>

<p class="noindent">Consequently, it is easily accessible from experiment, and is included in the molar free energy reaction profile shown in <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> for the reaction between chloride and methyl iodide in solution. In principle, &#916;<i>G<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i> is also calculable <a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>from the free energy of the initial state and the theoretically derived enthalpy and entropy of the transition state. Presently, however, chemical theory is not sufficiently well developed for reliable calculations to be routine. Furthermore, although <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> includes a reaction coordinate axis, the continuous line joining the thermodynamic states really relates only to the molecular potential energy profile from which this free energy one is conceptually derived; in this respect, therefore, this profile is analogous to an enthalpy profile. And since free energy is a function of temperature, the free energy profile will be temperature-dependent.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Intermediate</h3>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction profile in <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> includes a single free energy barrier between the initial and final states, i.e. the concerted reaction involves the direct formation of products from reactants. In some mechanisms, an intermediate may intervene between reactant(s) and products(s). For example, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of <i>tert</i>-butyl bromide is a two-step reaction involving ionization to give an ion pair and a subsequent step in which the intermediate, represented in the conventional way by square brackets, reacts further with water to give terf-butanol and hydrobromic acid.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:4em">
<img src="../images/eq_6_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="noindent">This mechanism is also represented by the profile in <a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Intermediates may be generated in either unimolecular reactions (such as the above) or in bimolecular reactions, and there may be more than one in a given reaction. Their important characteristic is that they are real chemical species with finite lifetimes (but sometimes very short), they undergo chemical reactions, and may occasionally be observed spectroscopically. Consequently, the intervention of an intermediate in a mechanism is represented by a local minimum in the reaction profile, as for the ion pair in the above. Activated complexes and transition states are represented by maxima in reaction profiles, and are intrinsically different from intermediates; the distinction is important.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Thermodynamic and kinetic instability of intermediates</h3>

<p class="noindent">Some intermediates are sufficiently long-lived that they can be isolated and characterised; others have lifetimes so short that their existence is inferred from indirect evidence. There are two sorts of instability, however, which may be represented in a reaction profile. The free energy difference between the initial (or final) state and the intermediate reflects the thermodynamic stability of the intermediate. A large value corresponds to an unstable intermediate in an absolute sense. However, the heights of the two barriers which flank the intermediate in the profile reflect the elementary rate constants of two of its reactions&#x2014;the forward reaction to give product, and the back reaction to reform its precursor. If these barriers are low, the reactions are fast and we have a reactive intermediate. If they are high, the intermediate is unreactive. It is quite possible, therefore, to have a very unstable intermediate in the thermodynamic sense that it has a large positive free energy of formation, but which is kinetically stable because it does not have easy reaction paths (barriers to its reactions are high). Conversely, another intermediate may be exceedingly short-lived, not because it is of <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>exceptionally high energy, but because it has access to easy reactions (ones with low barriers).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reaction maps</h3>

<p class="noindent">A serious shortcoming of two-dimensional reaction profiles (e.g. <a href="#fig_1.1">Figs. 1.1</a>- <a href="#fig_1.3">1.3</a>) is that there is only one configurational dimension (the reaction coordinate) and this is often imprecisely formulated in other than very simple reactions. Reaction maps are a significant advance because two dimensions are used for independent configurational variables, e.g. the nucleophile-carbon distance and the carbon-nucleofuge distance in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction; the molecular potential energy (or molar free energy) is implicit as a third dimension sometimes indicated by contours. Their general use is best illustrated by a specific case. <a href="#fig_1.4">Figure 1.4</a> is a reaction map for the concerted bimolecular substitution between chloride and an alkyl iodide, R-I.</p>

<figcaption><p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;width:100%"><b>Fig. 1.4</b> Reaction map for the concerted bimolecular substitution reaction between chloride and alkyl iodide R-I</p></figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">In this reaction map, the overall reaction is from the bottom left to the top right. Left to right across the map along or parallel to the x-axis corresponds to approach of the Cl<sup>-</sup> to the &#x03B1;-carbon of the alkyl group, R, <i>without any change in the distance from the &#x03B1;-carbon to the iodine.</i> From the bottom to the top along or parallel to the y-axis corresponds to an increase in the distance from the &#x03B1;-carbon to the iodine <i>without any change in the distance from the chloride to the &#x03B1;-carbon.</i> The straight diagonal (a) from the lower left to the upper right (reactants to products) describes the structural changes corresponding to synchronous progression along both configurational <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>
coordinates, so this path represents a concerted mechanism for the substitution reaction. Appreciable curvature in the reaction path towards the upper left corner, line (b), corresponds to an <i>asynchronous</i> concerted mechanism in which cleavage of the bond to the nucleofuge is running ahead of the formation of the bond to the nucleophile. Curvature towards the lower right, line (c), also corresponds to an asynchronous concerted mechanism but, in this case, the bonding of the nucleophile runs ahead of the unbonding of the nucleofuge.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction map in <a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> and the various paths across it represent only the configuration of the system. Our task is to identify the particular path that best describes the real reaction, i.e. the route with the lowest molar free energy barrier, &#916;<i>G<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i>. This is determined experimentally from the rate constant, and various theoretical and experimental techniques allow scrutiny of the structure of the activated complex. In principle, therefore, we can estimate its location within the reaction map (according to our mechanism) and, since we know the structures of the reactants and products, we may then chart the reaction path across the map.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Very commonly, the rate of a reaction in solution (or in the gas phase at constant volume) at any instant is proportional to the instantaneous concentration of at least one of the reactants raised to some simple power&#x2014; often 1 (first order) or 2 (second order). For example, the substitution reaction of ethyl bromide with chloride in acetone is first order in both ethyl bromide and chloride, so the reaction is second order overall.</p>

<p class="noindent">During the reaction, the two reactants are being consumed so their concentrations decrease and the rate of the reaction slows down. We may replace the proportionality sign by an equals sign plus a constant of proportionality, <i>k</i>, and leave out the indices since they are both unity to give and this is an expression of the rate law of this reaction.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Although [CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br] and [Cl<sup>-</sup>] decrease during the reaction and the rate of reaction gradually decreases, the constant of proportionality, <i>k,</i> does not change and is called the rate constant of the reaction. Since the units on both sides of any equation must be the same, the units of this second-order rate constant, <i>k</i> must be dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

</figure>

<p class="noindent">So even though the reaction involves hydroxide, and the rate could be measured by monitoring [OH<sup>-</sup>], its concentration has no effect upon the rate of the reaction.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The rate laws of these simple reactions have been zero, first, or second order with respect to reactants and this evidence leads to a view of the mechanism. However, it is important to realise that the order of a reaction is <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>
determined from experimental observations and may be non-integral. Reaction order must not be confused with the stoichiometry of a balanced chemical equation or with the molecularity of an elementary step.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>pseudo</i> First-order rate law</h3>

<p class="noindent">Although the reaction of ethyl bromide with chloride has a second-order rate law, it would not be normal practice to measure the second-order rate constant directly by fitting experimental results for the concentrations of the two reactants measured during the course of the reaction to the integrated version of the rate law. There is a much simpler method. The reaction is carried out with [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>o</sub> &#x003E;&#x003E; [CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br]<sub>o</sub> (for example, twenty times larger) where the square brackets with die zero subscript represent concentrations at the beginning of the reaction. At the end of the reaction, all of the CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br will have been consumed but [Cl<sup>-</sup>] will have been depleted by only a small proportion (5&#x0025;). Its concentration during the course of the reaction, therefore, will have remained approximately constant at [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>o</sub> compared with the ever decreasing concentration of the CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br. Consequently, <a href="#eq_1.4">eqn 1.4</a> above may be written as</p>

<p class="aside">Because [Cl<sup>-</sup>] remains approximately constant throughout the reaction, its effect upon the rate of the reaction remains the same. In contrast, [EtBr] decreases which causes the rate to decrease as the reaction proceeds.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent">If we know [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>0</sub>, we can determine <i>k</i> from the experimental value of <i>k</i><sub>obs</sub>. Better still, we could measure <i>k</i><sub>obs</sub> at a series of different [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>0</sub> values, and obtain <i>k</i> from the gradient of a plot of the one against the other.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Rate-limiting step</h3>

<p class="noindent">A reaction such as the bimolecular substitution between chloride and methyl iodide is, mechanistically, a single step reaction with a single transition state separating initial and final states. Such a simple mechanism must lead to a second-order rate law. The mechanism for the hydrolysis of <i>tert</i>-butyl bromide described on <a href="#page_6">p. 6</a>-<a href="#page_7">7</a>, on the other hand, is a two-step process and involves a reactive intermediate. The intermediate in this mechanism reacts rapidly with water to give the products&#x2014;this forward second step from the intermediate has a lower barrier than the reverse of the first step as indicated in <a href="#fig_1.3">
Fig. 1.3</a>, <a href="#page_7">p.7.</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">It can be seen from the profile (and shown mathematically) that the rate of this type of overall reaction is limited by the rate of the initial step, i.e. the rate constant of the overall reaction is equal to the first-order rate constant of the initial unimolecular elementary step. When, in a complex mechanism, a single step limits the overall rate, it is called the rate-limiting (or rate- <a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>determining) step; however, only when it is the first step of a sequence, as here, is the overall rate constant equal to that of the first step. Regardless of how many sequential steps there are in a complex mechanism, as long as one is rate limiting, a simple overall rate law usually identifies the composition of the activated complex in the rate-limiting step.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Because it is not possible to determine the order of a reaction with respect to solvent, the rate law does not allow us to determine how many solvent molecules (if any) are involved in the activated complex.</p></aside>


<h3 class="h3">From rate law to mechanism and from mechanism to rate law</h3>

<p class="noindent">In a reaction with a rate-limiting step, the rate law may lead to the molecularity of that step, and will do so if it is the first step. In a more complicated reaction where there is no single rate-limiting step, a mechanism is usually proposed on the basis of preliminary or incomplete evidence. From the provisional mechanism, a rate law is then deduced which may be a complex algebraic expression including many or all of the rate constants of individual elementary steps of the overall reaction. The individual rate constants of the elementary reactions in the overall reaction are called <i>elementary (or microscopic) rate constants.</i> The form of the rate law deduced from the provisional mechanism is compared with the experimental, and congruence between the two is evidence in support of the mechanism. Individual elementary rate constants in even quite complex mechanisms may occasionally be determinable.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The <i>actual</i> mechanism of a reaction determines the rate law the investigation of which, in turn, is used to elucidate that mechanism.</p></aside>


<h3 class="h3">Effect of medium upon reaction rates</h3>

<p class="noindent">The solvolysis of <i>tert-</i>butyl choride in aqueous ethanol becomes faster as the proportion of water in the medium increases. Statements of this sort are commonly made and clearly understood by organic chemists, so we shall use this form of expression. If we wished to be more rigorous, we would say that the <i>rate constant</i> for the reaction increases as the proportion of water in the medium increases, all other reaction conditions remaining the same. Before attempting to interpret how a change in solvent affects the rate constant of a reaction, we need to distinguish between two possible types of effect. The second-order rate constant for the substitution reaction of methyl iodide with chloride is 10<sup>6</sup> times larger at the same temperature in dimethylformamide than in methanol. This is purely a rate effect since the reactants and products in the two solvents are the same.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:11em">
<img src="../images/eq_12_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">In contrast, the solvolysis of trityl chloride (see above) is much faster in aqueous methanol than it is in ethanoic acid. However, the reactions in these two solvents are not identical. The former leads to a mixture of trityl alcohol and trityl methyl ether whose proportions depend upon the composition of the aqueous methanol, and the latter reaction leads to trityl acetate. In other words, the change in solvent here has altered the nature of the reaction.</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The transfer of a reaction from one medium to another need not be just from one solvent to another. Subtle changes to the bulk properties of a solvent, e.g. water, can be brought about by adding a low concentration of a non-reacting cosolvent or an electrolyte. They alter the solvent&#x2019;s intermolecular structure (especially, in the case of water, the nature of its hydrogen bonding) and thereby change its dielectric constant (relative permittivity). Reactions that involve ions (as reactants, products, or reactive intermediates) are affected most.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A much more drastic change in medium is from solution to the gas phase. The second-order rate constant for the substitution reaction of <a href="#eq_1.6">eqn 1.6</a> in the gas phase is many orders of magnitude larger than in any common solvent.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:10em" id="eq_1.6">
<img src="../images/eq_13_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="noindent">In contrast, the second-order rate constant for the dimerization of cyclopentadiene (which proceeds with no appreciable development or elimination of charge) is similar in the gas phase and in non-polar solvents.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Temperature dependence of rate constants and the determination of activation parameters</h3>

<p class="noindent">Most chemical reactions are faster at higher temperatures, i.e. the rate constant increases with temperature, and the relationship between the rate constant and temperature is given by the Arrhenius equation which may be expressed in either exponential or logarithmic forms:</p>

<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center"><i>k</i> = Ae<sup>-E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup>    &#160; &#160;or&#160;  &#160;    ln<i>(k)</i> = ln<i>(A)</i> - E<sub>a</sub>/RT</p>

<tr><td>&#160;</td> <td><i>T</i>	&#x003D;	absolute temperature,</td> <td> <i>R</i>	&#x003D;	gas constant,</td></tr>

<tr><td>and</td> <td><i>E<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D;	activation energy.</td> <td>&#160;</td></tr></table>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the rate constant for a reaction is measured at different temperatures, the gradient of a plot of ln(<i>k</i>) against <i>(T)<sup>-1</sup></i> is equal to <i>-E<sub>a</sub>/R</i> and the intercept is ln(<i>A</i>). Strictly, <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> is a measure of the temperature dependence of the rate constant, but it is closely related to &#916;<i>H<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i>, the enthalpy of activation of the reaction, see <a href="#page_5">p. 5</a>. Correspondingly, the entropy of activation, &#916;<i>S<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i>, may be derived from the pre-exponential factor, <i>A</i>, <a href="#page_5">see p. 5.</a></p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The intercept in this plot is the hypothetical value of ln<i>(k)</i> at <i>(T)</i><sup>-1</sup> &#x003D; 0, i.e. when <i>T</i> &#x003D; &#x221E;.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Since one cannot really have one mole of a reaction in the transition state, these two activation parameters are hypothetical quantities, but useful. The former is a measure of the enthalpy constraint upon reactivity, e.g. due to changes in bonding as reactant molecules become activated complexes, and the latter is the entropy constraint, e.g. due to the different conformational properties of reactant molecules and activated complexes.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Accounting for the magnitude of &#916;<i>H<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i> in a particular reaction is generally straightforward since enthalpy aspects of chemical reactivity are usually directly related to bond enthalpies (including hydrogen bonds) and (in solution) solvation enthalpies. In contrast, &#916;<i>S<sup>&#x2021;</sup></i> is not at all easy to discuss in <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>the abstract, and reasons for particular values may be very different from one reaction to another as we shall see later.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Structure-reactivity correlations</h3>

<p class="noindent">A common strategy for probing the mechanism of a reaction is to make a minor structural modification to one of the reactants and then investigate the effect. The modification needs to be such that it will either discriminate between alternative mechanistic possibilities, or provide new information about the probable mechanism. Additionally, however, it needs to be sufficiently subtle that it causes only a perturbation of the original mechanism (rather than a change to a completely different reaction). For example, changing the methyl of methyl bromide to <i>tert-</i>butyl in the second- order reaction of <a href="#eq_1.6">eqn 1.6</a> (<a href="#page_13">p. 13</a>) in an aqueous solvent would lead to a much faster reaction. The new reaction, however, would be first order and occur by a different mechanism so we might be misled about the nature of the original reaction. In contrast, if we were to introduce simple substituents into, say, the 4-position of one of the aryl rings of trityl chloride in <a href="#eq_1.5">eqn 1.5</a> (<a href="#page_10">p. 10</a>), the <i>pseudo</i> first-order rate constants of the new reactions would have different values according to the natures of the substituents. All the new reactions, however, would remain of essentially the same type as the original, and we would learn something about the changing nature of the transition states of this closely related family of reactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Kinetic isotope effects</h3>

<p class="noindent">The most subtle modification that can be made to the structure of a reactant is to replace an atom by an isotope. This cannot <i>qualitatively</i> alter the nature or mechanism of a reaction since, chemically, all isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. There can, however, be a <i>quantitative</i> effect since bonds to heavier isotopes have larger bond dissociation enthalpies, i.e. are stronger. So, for example, if cleavage of a C-H bond is involved in the rate-limiting step of a reaction, the deuterium analogue will react more slowly, but by exactly the same mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Measurement of the deuterium solvent kinetic isotope effect is also a powerful technique, especially for investigating catalysed reactions in aqueous solution. This involves comparing the rate constant of the reaction in water with that in deuterium oxide.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Stoichiometry and product analysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Establishing the identities of all products and the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation are necessary steps in determining a reaction's mechanism. The structure of the reactant and the nature of the rate law may, of course, be reliable guides in characterising the reaction, but there must be <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a>product analytical and structural evidence also. For example, to investigate the mechanism of reaction of borohydride, BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> with a hydride acceptor such as a carbonyl compound, it would be necessary to establish whether one BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> anion reacts with one, two, three, or four carbonyl groups. And if we wish to investigate the <i>chemoselectivity</i> of sodium borohydride towards a bifunctional hydride acceptor, e.g. a keto-ester, we would need to establish reaction site over another, by product analysis the ratio of reduction at the two possible sites in a reaction with a deficiency of the sodium borohydride.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Chemoselectivity is the preference that a reagent has for one potential reaction site over another</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">A concept related to chemoselectivity is <i>regioselectivity</i> which may be illustrated by an alkene-forming reaction. Unimolecular substitution reactions of <i>tert-</i>butyl halides are often accompanied by the formation of some 2-methylpropene by proton loss from the intermediate terf-butyl cation. Since the nine hydrogens of this cation are equivalent, there is no question of selectivity. In the corresponding reaction of a <i>tert-</i>pentyl [2-(2-methylbutyl)-] substrate, however, there is not only the question of chemoselectivity (does a water molecule act as a nucleophile at carbon to give substitution, or as a base at a hydrogen to give elimination?), but the additional question of which of two possible isomeric alkenes will be formed in the proton abstraction step, <a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5.</a></p>

isomeric alkenes are formed but in unequal amounts (and not in the
statistical ratio of one to three&#x2014;there is a higher yield of the more
substituted isomer), so proton abstraction from the carbenium ion is
regioselective, i.e. there is a distinct preference for the reaction of the
carbenium ion to be in one direction rather than the other.</p>

<p class="noindent"> <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Description and investigation of organic reaction mechanisms</a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Stereochemistry</h3>

<p class="noindent">This is really an aspect of product analysis. If stereoisomers of a compound react under identical reaction conditions to give different products, the reaction is <i>stereospecific</i>. For example, enantiomeric reactants could undergo the same type of reaction and give enantiomeric products.</p>

<p class="noindent">Stereochemical characterisation of the products from the individual stereoisomers of a compound, therefore, is a necessary early step in the investigation of the mechanism of its reaction.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">On the other hand, if the reactant is non-stereoisomeric but leads to stereoisomeric products in unequal amounts, for example the dimerization of cyclopentadiene to give <i>exo</i> and <i>endo</i> products (<a href="#eq_1.3">eqn 1.3</a>, <a href="#page_9">p. 9</a>), the reaction is said to be <i>stereoselective</i>, and this may be significant mechanistic evidence.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Isotopic labelling studies</h3>

<p class="noindent">Introduction of an isotopic label at a specific site in a reactant followed by analysis of precisely where it turns up in the product is an established method of investigating reaction mechanisms (including enzymatic processes). For example, hydrolysis of simple carboxylic esters under acidic or alkaline conditions using water enriched with <sup>18</sup>OH<sub>2</sub> usually leads to incorporation of the label in the carboxylate and not in the alcohol, <a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6.</a></p>

Besides mass spectrometric methods, modern spectroscopic analysis, principally <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR, is especially helpful in these structural studies.</p>
