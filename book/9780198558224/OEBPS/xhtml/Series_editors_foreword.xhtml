<p class="fmmain">Series Editor's Foreword</p>
<p class="fmnoindent">An understanding of mechanism allows chemistry to be interpreted and hence understood and predicted. Mechanism is therefore the most essential tool for an organic chemist right from the very outset of a student&#x2019;s career, since it facilitates the classification and assimilation of the vast amount of reactivity information available.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be included in an 8-10 lecture course. In this Primer, Howard Maskill has produced an excellent and readable description of many of the basic mechanisms, which will stimulate the student&#x2019;s appetite for organic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
