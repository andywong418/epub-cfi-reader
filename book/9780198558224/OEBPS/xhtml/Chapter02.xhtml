<h2 class="h2">2.1	<b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we shall consider mechanisms of simple substitution reactions of the type shown in <a href="#eq_2.1">eqn 2.1</a> in which a group X, singly bonded to a saturated (<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridized) carbon atom in a molecule, is replaced by another group Y.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Regardless of mechanistic detail, the leaving group X departs as a nucleofuge, i.e. the bond from carbon to X undergoes heterolysis and (when R-X is a neutral molecule) X departs as X<sup>-</sup>, e.g. a halide anion. The group Y supplies the pair of electrons which form the new &#x03C3;-bond to the carbon, i.e. Y acts as a nucleophile and may be an anion Y<sup>-</sup>, e.g. a halide, or a weakly acidic neutral molecule Y-H, e.g. an alcohol. When it is an alcohol, it generates a much more acidic initial product which loses a proton (to the solvent, for example), <a href="#eq_2.2">eqn 2.2</a>. Thirdly, Y may be a non-acidic neutral compound such as a tertiary amine which, in displacing an anionic nucleofuge, generates an ionic product, <a href="#eq_2.3">eqn 2.3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">An activated complex, therefore, comprises the elements of a molecule of the alkyl halide and a hydroxide ion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">If the methyl group of ethyl bromide in this example is replaced by a <i>tert-</i> butyl group to give neopentyl bromide [2,2-dimethylbromopropane], i.e. the <i>primary</i> nature of the alkyl halide is not changed, the rate constant of the new reaction under the same experimental conditions (<a href="#eq_2.5">eqn 2.5</a>) is very much smaller.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">

Sodium ions, therefore, are not involved in the activated complex. They are examples of what are sometimes called <i>spectator ions.</i></p>
<p class="aside">A simple primary alkyl iodide or bromide R-X undergoes hydrolysis only very slowly in water without the addition of a base to generate an appreciable concentration of hydroxide. The very slow reaction that does take place in the absence of hydroxide will also be bimolecular but with a water molecule as nucleophile, i.e. water is both the nucleophile and the solvent.

<p class="indent3-ka">The simplest mechanism which accommodates these kinetics results - the second-order rate law and appreciable retardation as the size of one reactant close to the reaction centre (but not at it) is increased - is a bimolecular reaction in which hydroxide ion reacts directly with the alkyl halide. A rate retardation due to increased bulk of a reactant is characteristic of bimolecular reactions as we shall see in other cases, and is ascribed to <i>steric hindrance.</i> A prediction based upon this mechanistic proposal is that the rate constant would also be smaller than that in <a href="#eq_2.4">eqn 2.4</a> if the steric bulk of the nucleophile were increased (without otherwise changing its nature), all other aspects of the reaction remaining the same. The rate constant for the substitution reaction of a primary alkyl bromide with tert-butoxide is indeed very much smaller than the value for the corresponding reaction with hydroxide (or methoxide) in the same solvent at the same temperature.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Stereochemistry: Inversion of configuration</i>. In the substitution reaction of <a href="#eq_2.6">eqn 2.6</a>, an enantiomerically pure reactant leads to an enantiomerically pure product. Scrutiny of the absolute configurations establishes that the second- order reaction has occurred with inversion of configuration at the carbon at which the substitution has taken place.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Formation of a single product.</i> Many chemical reactions give several products. In some, the different products arise from competing independent parallel reactions of the substrate; in others, they arise by alternative routes from a common intermediate formed in a single initial step from the</p>



<p class="noindent"><a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a></p>

<p class="noindent">substrate. Products of the latter type of reaction are occasionally found to have a structurally rearranged carbon framework when compared with the reactant. The reactions that we are presently considering, however, yield single substitution products (which, in propitious cases and depending upon the skill of the experimentalist, may be isolated in very high yield). This is evidence that these are single-step reactions, i.e. they do not proceed <i>via</i> reactive intermediates.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mechanism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The simplest mechanism that accounts for the above evidence (a single substitution product formed with inversion of configuration and a second- order rate law) involves direct attack of the nucleophile at the carbon from which the nucleofuge departs, as illustrated in <a href="#eq_2.7">eqn 2.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">We saw above that, at this most basic level, the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism in solution is believed to be a simple one-step reaction involving the concerted transformation of reactants directly into products, and this mechanism<a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>describes the reactions between wide ranges of nucleophiles and alkyl halides, etc. As we shall see, the S<sub>N</sub>1 is not a single mechanism in the same sense that the S<sub>N</sub>2 is; rather, it is a family of mechanisms that share common features. Again, we shall consider the evidence and see how this leads to a mechanistic proposal.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Experimental evidence</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Kinetics: First-order rate law.</i> Tertiary alkyl halides (except fluorides) Solvolysis is a reaction that is usually undergo solvolysis reactions in aqueous solution, and in low induced by the solvent and the molecular weight alcohols (e.g. methanol or ethanol) and carboxylic acids (e.g. methanoic or ethanoic acids). The classic example is the hydrolysis of <i>tert-</i>butyl chloride in aqueous solution, the organic cosolvent (e.g. acetone or (ethanoic) acid, etc. acetonitrile) being simply to improve the solubility of the organic substrate in the water, <a href="#eq_2.8">eqn 2.8.</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Solvolysis is a reaction that is induced by the solvent and the products are derived from the solvent. Hydrolysis is solvolysis in water,acetolysis is solvolysis in acetic (ethanoic) acid,etc.</p></aside>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:4em" id="eq_2.8">
<img src="../images/eq_21_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent">This reaction gives tert-butanol and hydrochloric acid, and the rate of the reaction may be measured under thermostatted conditions by monitoring the rate of formation of the acid, for example by titration with standard sodium hydroxide solution, or by monitoring the conductivity of the solution. The reaction has a first-order rate law, <a href="#eq_2.9">eqn 2.9</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:13em" id="eq_2.9">
<img src="../images/eq_21_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Since the overall substitution is of chloride by hydroxide, it is tempting to think that hydroxide is involved directly. However, if the reaction is carried out in the presence of more sodium hydroxide than is required just to neutralize the acid, the rate law is still first order&#x2014;higher concentrations of hydroxide have no effect upon the rate of the substitution reaction. This means that the hydroxide group is incorporated in a step other than that which determines the rate. The reaction must, therefore, be stepwise and involve an intermediate, and the product-forming step follows the rate-determining step. Furthermore, if an additional nucleophile is present, e.g. azide, N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the rate is unaffected even though product derived from the additional nucleophile (<i>t</i>Bu-N<sub>3</sub>) is formed according to the nucleophile&#x2019;s concentration.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">If the substrate is modified in a way that increases the steric bulk but which does not otherwise change the essential nature of the reactant, i.e. it remains a simple tertiary alkyl chloride, we can investigate whether the reaction (like the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction above) is subject to steric hindrance. In fact, the rate constant for the solvolysis of tri(rm-butyl)methyl chloride <a href="#eq_2.2">(2.2)</a> is 600 times larger than that of terf-butyl chloride under identical reaction conditions. This solvolysis, therefore, shows <i>steric acceleration</i>, a phenomenon characteristic of unimolecular reactions.</p>

The product has just a <i>2&#x0025;</i> enantiomeric excess, i.e. it is 98&#x0025; racemic with just a 2&#x0025; excess of inversion over retention of configuration (compared with 100&#x0025; inversion in the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism).</p>

simple first-order solvolytic substitution reactions. There is usually an excess
of inversion over retention, but the extent of this excess depends upon the
nature of the substrate and, for a given substrate, upon the nature of the
solvent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Investigation of the stereochemistry of solvolytic substitution does not require that the substrate be chiral as the result for the acetolysis reaction in <a href="#eq_2.11">eqn 2.11</a> shows.

<p class="noindent"><i>Formation of by-products.</i> Unlike S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions which in principle give clean conversions to single products, first-order solvolytic substitution reactions invariably give mixtures. For example, fert-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol gives substitution products derived from both water and ethanol (and also some alkene as will be discussed in the next chapter), <a href="#eq_2.12">eqn 2.12</a>. The product distribution in this reaction, like the rate constant, depends upon the composition of the aqueous ethanol. If a nucleophilic solute were present, then additional substitution product would be formed from it also.</p>

<a id="page_23" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 23, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mechanism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of different products from a single substrate in an overall reaction that is first order in the substrate and zero order in any other reactants is classic evidence for the intervention of a reactive intermediate formed in an initial unimolecular, rate-limiting step. In the present context, <a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a> describes a mechanism for the solvolysis of <i>tert</i>-butyl chloride in an aqueous medium containing a nucleophilic solute Y<sup>-</sup> in which the reactive intermediate is an ion pair comprising a <i>tert</i>-butyl carbenium ion and the chloride anion. According to this mechanism, which is the simplest to describe the experimental results so far presented, the <i>tert</i>-butyl chloride ionizes without the involvement of other reactants, i.e. there is a unimolecular initial step with a first-order, elementary rate constant, <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> The carbenium ion is then captured by a solvent water molecule to give, ultimately, tert-butanol, or it is captured by the nucleophilic solute Y<sup>-</sup> to give an alternative substitution product <i>t</i>BuY; it may also yield isobutene (2-methylpropene) <i>via</i> proton abstraction by a water molecule. Each of these parallel product-forming steps has its own elementary rate constant as indicated.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">In the case of alkyl groups more complex than <i>tert</i>-butyl, there may be an additional reaction from the first- formed intermediate-rearrangement to an isomeric carbenium ion which, in turn, may lead to further substitution and elimination products.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent">According to this mechanism, the rate of the overall reaction is limited by the rate of the initial ionization, and the intermediate proceeds to give products according to the relative magnitudes of the elementary rate constants of the parallel product-forming steps, and the relative concentrations of the co-reactants in these steps. Clearly, water is both the solvent and a reactant in two of these routes&#x2014;the one leading to tert-butanol and the one leading to isobutene.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The ratios of the rate constants for these various product-forming routes are measures of the <i>selectivity</i> of the reactive intermediate.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The mechanism illustrated in <a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a> may also be described by the reaction profile in Fig. 2.3 which is analogous to that for the hydrolysis of <i>tert</i>-butyl bromide in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_7">(p. 7)</a>, but expanded somewhat.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This mechanism adequately accounts for the first-order rate law, the formation of solvent-derived substitution product, the formation of alkene as a by-product, and trapping of the intermediate by a nucleophilic solute. It does not, however, account satisfactorily for the range of stereochemical outcomes of unimolecular substitution reactions already presented. The inadequacy of this simple mechanism of unimolecular substitution is principally due to its failure to acknowledge the role of the counter-ion of the initially formed carbenium ion, and that carbenium ions vary enormously in stability. They may be transient species with lifetimes measured in picoseconds under solvolytic conditions at one extreme through to long-lived ions which are indefinitely stable in aqueous solution at the other.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Ion pairs</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig_2.4">Figure 2.4</a> includes a contact (or intimate) ion pair (I) as the first formed intermediate from a neutral covalent substrate such as an alkyl halide. This ion pair is within a single solvation shell and may yield products directly, or it may undergo <i>internal return</i> to give starting material; thirdly, an indeterminate number of solvent molecules may insert between cation and anion to give a solvent-separated ion pair (II).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Internal return is the immediate reverse of a bond cleavage, i.e. it occurs before the fragments dissociate.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">The solvent-separated ion pair is still an ion pair, i.e. the cation and anion are not independent of each other, and may also yield products, return to the contact ion pair, or undergo ion-pair separation to give fully dissociated and independently solvated cation (III) and anion. These<a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>dissociated ions may also yield product or return to the solvent-separated ion pair.</p>

<p class="aside">It is important to appreciate that <a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a> represents a comprehensive mechanistic scheme, but that any single compound will not react by all routes within it. For example, the reaction with solvent to give product from the contact ion pair from one substrate may be so rapid that no contact ion pairs proceed to give solvent-separated ion pairs. In contrast, another substrate may ionize to give contact ion pair (I) with a relatively stable carbenium ion that proceeds to (II), and (II) then goes on to give (III) faster than either (I) or (II) undergoes any significant extent of reaction to give products. In the former case, no product will be derived from (II) or (III), and in the latter case all product will be through (III).</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">We can now see how different stereochemical results may be obtained and, moreover, how the stereochemical outcome depends upon the stability of the carbenium ion. If a carberiium ion is particularly reactive and does not survive to give the solvent-separated ion pair, all the product is derived from the contact ion pair (I). In this event, the counter ion inhibits nucleophilic attack at the face of the carbenium ion from which it departed as nucleofuge. Consequently, substitution will be with an overwhelming preference for inversion of configuration. In contrast, a much more stable carbenium ion lives long enough to proceed via (II) to become the fully dissociated ion (III). It will then be approachable from either above or below its <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridized central carbon with equal ease, so we expect equal amounts of retention and inversion of configuration. Between these two extremes, we may expect substitution product from the solvent-separated ion pair (II) to be mainly inverted but accompanied by some retention of configuration.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.4	S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2 ? Factors affecting mechanism and reactivity in nucleophilic substitution reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, we have considered the unimolecular and bimolecular mechanisms of substitution separately as though a substrate always reacts by just one mechanism or the other, and that it is always obvious what the mechanism is. Occasionally this is true. Simple primary alkyl halides and sulfonates, if they undergo substitution reactions in solution, invariably react by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism; in contrast, tertiary alkyl analogues, if they undergo substitution, react by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. However, that leaves simple secondary alkyl analogues, ally lie systems, benzylic systems, etc., which may react by either mechanism depending upon the particular compound and the reaction conditions. We now need to understand how the structures of the substrate and the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions, determine whether a substitution reaction will be by the S<sub>N</sub>1 or S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism (or both), and how they affect the reactivity within each mechanism.</p>

The activated complex that intervenes between substrate and ion pair will have an extended, attenuated bond from carbon to halogen and an appreciable degree of charge separation. If the reaction is transferred to a more polar medium (one which is better able to stabilize ionic states), we could describe it in another profile. However, in order to see the effect of the solvent change more conveniently, we add the new profile, line (ii), to the same diagram, and do so in such a way that the free energies of the initial states in the two media are superimposed. This allows us to see more easily the changes in stabilities of activated complex and intermediate <i>each relative to the substrate</i> upon the transfer, even though the absolute free energies of all (including the substrate) will be different in the two media.</p>

The difference between the <i>maxima</i> in lines (i) and (ii) represents the greater stability of the activated complex, again relative to the non-polar substrate, upon transferring the reaction to the more polar medium, i.e the barrier is lower in solvent (ii) than in solvent (i). The stabilising effect of this change of solvent upon the activated complex, which has only partial charge development, is not as great as upon the fully formed ion pair intermediate. We now see why the rate constant for this type of S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, for example the solvolysis of <i>tert</i>-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol, increases as the proportion of water in the medium increases, i.e. with increasing polarity of the medium. Moreover, we also see (according to this analysis) that the transition state for ionization in the more polar medium occurs earlier in the reaction coordinate, i.e. the structures of the activated complexes in the two solvents are not the same. There is actually a<a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a><i>lower</i> degree of bond cleavage, and hence charge separation, in transition state &#x2021;2 in the more polar medium than in transition state &#x2021;l in the less polar medium.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Effect of solvent upon the reactivity of the nucleophile.</i> So far, our attention has been focussed on the effect of solvent upon the transformation of a molecule of the organic substrate into an activated complex. In the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, a nucleophile is also involved in the formation of the activated complex, so the effect of solvent upon its initial state must also be considered for a more complete understanding of the effect of the solvent upon the rate of such a reaction. The nucleophile, regardless of whether it is an anion or a neutral molecule, is initially fully solvated and, in order to interact with the electrophile to form an activated complex, must undergo some degree of desolvation. Consequently, solvents that least well solvate nucleophilic solutes will be the best solvents in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions (though the nucleophile must be soluble for a homogeneous reaction in solution, so very weakly solvating media such as hydrocarbons are no use in this respect). For example, the rate constant for the simple substitution reaction in <a href="#eq_2.14">eqn 2.14</a> is10<sup>6</sup> times larger in the polar <i>aprotic</i> solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) than in the similarly polar but <i>protic</i> solvent methanol.</p>

<p class="aside">In this section, the effect of the solvent upon the rate constant of a reaction has been analysed by considering the charge redistribution as reactants are transformed into activated complexes.

<p class="noindent">This is because chloride ions are strongly hydrogen-bonded in methanol butnot in DMF, and consequently less energy is required for their desolvation in DMF. Aprotic dipolar compounds such as DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide are generally excellent solvents for bimolecular substitution reactions.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Nucleophile</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>Effect of nucleophile upon</i> <i>S<sub>N</sub>1</i> <i>reactions.</i> Since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate-determining step of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, its nature or concentration cannot have a direct effect upon the rate of the reaction.Nucleophiles are involved in the product-forming steps of S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions, so their nature and concentration determine the products. In the reaction of <i>tert-</i>butyl bromide in dilute sodium hydroxide containing sodium azide, <a href="#eq_2.15">eqn 2.15</a>, the rate will be independent of [OH<sup>-</sup>] and [N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], but the ratio of <i>tert    -</i> butanol (formed by capture of the carbenium ion by H<sub>2</sub>0 with subsequent proton loss, and by OH<sup>-</sup>) to rm-butyl azide (formed by capture of the carbenium ion by N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) will be determined by the relative concentrations of the three nucleophiles and their relative reactivities towards the <i>tert-</i>butyl carbenium ion, i.e. the rate constants in the three parallel product-forming steps in the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism. Although water is the weakest of the three nucleophiles, it will lead to an appreciable yield of tert-butanol because, being the solvent, it has the highest effective concentration.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">As we have already seen, the ability of the medium to stabilize the formation of ions from neutral reactants affects the rates of their S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions.

<p class="noindent"><i>Effect of nucleophile upon S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.</i> Rate-determining and productforming steps are one and the same in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, so the nature and concentration of the nucleophile affect both the rate and the identity of the product. Within a family of related nucleophiles, e.g. ones which bond through oxygen, the nucleophilicity is broadly parallel to base strength so, as nucleophiles, RO<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; HO<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and the conjugate base of a compound will always be more nucleophilic than the compound itself (RO<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; ROH). Thus, a simple primary alkyl halide will react very slowly in water or an alcohol, but much more rapidly with the conjugate base of the solvent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Other trends may be more complicated and depend to some extent upon the electrophile. In aprotic media, the nucleophilicities of the halide anions follow their base strengths (F<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Cl<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; I<sup>-</sup>), but in hydroxylic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is reversed (I<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Cl<sup>-</sup> &#x003E;&#x003E; F<sup>-</sup>) with fluoride showing virtually no nucleophilic tendencies in water. The former sequence represents these anions&#x2019; intrinsic nucleophilicities, and the reversed order is due to hydrogen bonding in hydroxylic solvents. The more strongly the anion is hydrogen bonded (<i>F<sup>-</sup> &#x003E;&#x003E;</i> Cl<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; I<sup>-</sup>), the less effective it is as a nucleophile (see above).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In <a href="#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>, we see initially that hydroxide is too poor a nucleofuge to be displaced from a primary alkyl residue by chloride in aqueous solution. A low equilibrium extent of protonation of the alcohol by concentrated hydrochloric acid transforms the leaving group into a water molecule that can be displaced by Cl<sup>-</sup> in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (although the reaction may be slow at room temperature). Addition of a tertiary alcohol to concentrated hydrochloric acid leads to the rapid formation of the terf-alkyl chloride by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism, also through transformation of a poor nucleofuge into a good one by protonation of the OH; with chloride but no acid, there is no perceptible reaction at all. Between these two, a secondary alcohol reacts in concentrated hydrochloric acid <i>via</i> its protonated form by either an S<sub>N</sub>2 or an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism (or both mechanisms in parallel, depending upon its <a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon</a>structure) faster than the primary analogue but more slowly than the tertiary.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Change in mechanism caused by a change in nucleofuge.</i> As nucleofuge X in R-X is modified from poor &#x2192; moderate &#x2192; good, we may simply see a rate increase within a single mechanism.

The best nucleofuge is the nitrogen molecule of an alkanediazonium ion (R-N<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) generated as a very unstable intermediate in the deamination of a primary aliphatic amine RNH<sub>2</sub> by nitrous acid (from sodium nitrite and H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). Fluoroalkanesulfonates such as trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) are also very good nucleofuges. Thus, for a simple secondary alkyl substrate, R-X, in solution in the presence of a modest nucleophile, there is no reaction at all for X &#x003D; F or OH, an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction when X is a better nucleofuge such as chloride or bromide, perhaps parallel S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions for the triflate, and an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction in the case of HNO<sub>2</sub>-induced deamination.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Alkyl group R in R-X</h3>

<p class="noindent">A general strategy was developed above for analysing the effect of a change of some sort upon the reactivity of compounds in both the S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms. In the case of a solvent change, for example, we compare the effect separately upon the substrate(s) and upon the activated complex. If the transition state is stabilized more than the initial state (or destabilized less) by the change in solvent, the rate constant is larger; if the free energy difference between the two becomes larger, then the rate constant is smaller. This strategy is reliable within the context of a single mechanism, though we need to bear in mind the possibility of a change in mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The effects of changes to the alkyl group of the substrate upon its reactivity by a given mechanism can be much more dramatic than any of the changes so far considered, and the scope for such modifications causing a change in mechanism is larger. However, our procedure for understanding them is the same; we consider the effect of the structural change upon the free energy difference between initial state and transition state.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Additionally there is an electronic effect. Besides factors already
mentioned (such as the nature of the solvent), the ease of heterolysis of the

<p class="indent3-ka">As these hydrogens are successively replaced by alkyl groups to give (after ionization) primary, secondary, and then tertiary carbenium ions, the central cationic carbon becomes increasingly able to attract electron density from the &#x03C3;-bonded alkyl groups.

<p class="indent3-ka">On the basis of this electronic contribution towards the increase in S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity in <a href="#table_2.2">Table 2.2</a>, we predict that substituents in the alkyl groups R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>3</sup> which reduce the ability of the developing electron-deficient centre to attract electron density along the &#x03C3;-bonds would be rate-retarding.

<p class="aside">These dramatic effects upon the rate of the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism by successively introducing phenyl groups to the &#x03B1;-carbon will also cause the <i>nature</i> of the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism to change within the ion pair scheme shown in <a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. This minor complication does not invalidate the attempt using <a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a> to illustrate the gross effects.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The representation in <a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a> of the results in <a href="#table_2.3">Table 2.3</a> requires an interpretation. The occupied &#x03C0;-systems of the phenyl and allyl groups have the correct symmetry for overlap with the vacant p-orbital on the central <i>sp<sup>2</sup> </i>hybridized carbon of the carbenium ion, so the positive charge may be delocalised over a more extensive molecular system. This is represented in resonance terms by the canonical forms shown in<a href="#fig_2.11"> Fig. 2.11</a>. Accordingly, the more extensive the delocalised system, the greater the stabilization of the intermediate carbenium ion. The rate effect, then, is because some of this resonance stabilization of the intermediate is available to the developing carbenium ion, i.e. the preceding activated complex.</p>

This sort of orbital overlap leads to a more delocalized bonding molecular orbital in the activated complex and is, hence, a stabilizing feature. A carbonyl or vinyl group on the &#x03B1;-carbon has a similar effect.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Rearrangements in allylic systems</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If an allylic compound with a good nucleofuge undergoes solvolysis in a highly ionizing medium, the mechanism may be unimolecular via a delocalised intermediate carbenium ion. The symmetry of the parent allyl cation causes the two terminal CH<sub>2</sub> groups to be equivalent, so the nucleophile, e.g. water in the case of hydrolysis, will bond to either end but, in the absence of isotopic labels, we obtain a single product. If the symmetry of the reactant is reduced by the site-specific incorporation of an isotopic label, e.g. a <sup>13</sup>C atom indicated in<a href="#fig_2.13"> Fig. 2.13</a> by an asterisk, the sites of nucleophilic attack are distinguished, and the two differently labelled molecules are formed in equal amounts. When the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism occurs with an allylic rearrangement of this sort, it is usually called the S<sub>N</sub>1&#x00B4; mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In <a href="#fig_2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>, structurally isomeric reactants ionize (at different rates) to give a common allylic carbenium ion which then undergoes nucleophilic capture at both ends of the allylic system, but in this case the two ends are not equivalent. Consequently, structurally isomeric products are formed in unequal amounts. However, the same product mixture is obtained from both reactants since they are formed through a common intermediate.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Allylic rearrangements can also occur in bimolecular substitution reactions, but there is an important mechanistic difference. The S<sub>N</sub>1 and s<sub>N</sub>1&#x00B4; mechanisms occur via a single common allylic intermediate which suffers nucleophilic capture at alternative sites. This nucleophilic capture is regioselective if the two ends of the allylic carbenium ion are different. In contrast, the S<sub>N</sub>2 and its counterpart with allylic rearrangement, the S<sub>N</sub>2&#x00B4;, are separate parallel competing reactions,<a href="#fig_2.15"> Fig. 2.15</a>. They occur in relative amounts according to the site selectivity of the given nucleophile for the particular substrate.</p>
