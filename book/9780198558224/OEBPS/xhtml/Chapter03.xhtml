Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">We saw in the previous chapter that nucleophilic substitution reactions at saturated <i>(sp<sup>3</sup></i> hybridised) carbon atoms occur by either concerted (S<sub>N
</sub>2) or stepwise (S<sub>N</sub>1) mechanisms. We shall see that there are two principal alkene-forming reactions from alkyl halides, for example, which closely parallel S<sub>N</sub>2 and S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanisms. One is bimolecular and concerted, the other is stepwise with an initial unimolecular step. Both reactions overall involve a base (although this may be just the solvent in some reactions) and the elimination of HX from a molecule where X is either halogen or another nucleofuge bonded through a hetero-atom (usually oxygen) to the &#x03B1;-carbon. We shall also consider two other mechanisms for the elimination of HX. One is stepwise and involves a base, the other is a thermally induced single- step unimolecular mechanism which does not involve a base. Finally, we shall consider briefly the mechanism of a nucleophile-induced reaction which yields alkenes though not by the elimination of HX, but X<sub>2</sub>. We shall not consider here, however, mechanisms of elimination reactions which yield unsaturated compounds other than alkenes (ketones, alkynes, nitriles, etc.). Again, we follow the pattern of<a href="Chapter02.xhtml"> chapter 2</a> by first presenting evidence, then showing how this leads to a mechanism; occasionally, we shall indicate how the proposed mechanism led to a prediction which could be tested.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-24em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The &#x03B1;-carbon is the one to which the nucleofuge is initially bonded, and the carbon chain from this may be labelled &#x03B2;,&#x03C7;,&#x03B4;, etc., following the Greek alphabet. If there are two carbon chains from the &#x03B1;-carbon, they are differentiated by using primed Greek letters as in (<a href="#page_38">3.1</a>). &#x03B1;-Elimination of HCI from (<a href="#page_38">3.1</a>) would yield a carbene,&#x03B2; -elimination yields an alkene, and &#x03C7;-elimination would yield a cyclopropane.</p>

Unimolecular elimination of HX to give alkenes, E1</h2>




<p class="noindent">This reaction frequently accompanies the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism if the substrate has at least one hydrogen on a &#x03B2;-carbon; we saw an example in the formation of 2-methylpropene in the solvolysis of <i>tert-</i>butyl chloride, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq_2.12">eqn 2.12</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_22">p. 22</a>). Although we have to ask whether the alkene is also formed from the carbenium ion intermediate of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (or by an entirely independent route), the co-occurrence, indeed the frequent inseparability, of the two reactions is in itself evidence of a mechanistic link.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Experimental evidence</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Kinetics: First-order rate law.</i> Solvolytic elimination reactions are first order in the organic substrate and show no second-order term in the rate law upon the addition of modest concentrations of a base, e.g. the conjugate base<a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Elimination reactions to give alkenes</a>of the solvent. For example, <a href="#eq_3.2">eqn 3.2</a> is the rate law for the reaction of <i>tert-</i> butyl bromide in ethanol containing ethoxide, <a href="#eq_3.1">eqn 3.1</a>, to give <i>tert-</i>butyl ethyl ether (substitution) and 2-methylpropene (elimination), and (the experimental rate constant for the overall reaction) is unaffected by the concentration of the ethoxide.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-left:2em">rate=k<sub>obs</sub>[tBuBr]<span style="float:right;margin-right:2.5em">(3.2)</span></p></figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">We need go no further in describing or exemplifying the rate laws of other such reactions because they are exactly as given in the account of the kinetics of S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions in the previous chapter. Since the rate law indicates the composition (though not the structure) of the activated complex, this can involve nothing more than the elements of the reactant molecule (plus, perhaps, an indeterminate number of solvent molecules).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Product analysis: Product distribution approximately independent of the nature of the nucleofuge.</i> The ethanolysis of other <i>tert-</i>butyl substrates gives almost the same ratio of <i>tert-</i>butyl ethyl ether to 2-methylpropene (isobutene) as shown in <a href="#eq_3.1">eqn 3.1</a> even though their rates of reaction may be very different. In the aqueous ethanolysis of <i>tert-</i>pentyl halides (<a href="#page_39">3.2</a>) shown in <a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>, not only is the ratio of substitution to elimination largely independent of the halide nucleofuge (though the different substrates react at different rates), but the ratio of the structurally isomeric alkene products of elimination remains approximately constant at about 30&#x0025; to 7&#x0025; in favour of the more substituted isomer.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="aside">where<i> K<sub>sub</sub></i> and <i>k<sub>elim</sub></i> are the component first-order rate constants for the constituent reactions. This dissection of the experimental first-order rate constant into substitution and elimination components does not in itself require that the constituent reactions are mechanistically linked. In order to determine these individual rate constants, we need the product analysis, and to be sure that the overall reaction is kinetically controlled.</p>
<p class="aside">The product distribution in E1/S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions becomes dependent upon the nucleofuge in less ionizing media as increasing proportions of the product form via ion pairs.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">This product analytical evidence suggests that the nucleofuge must have departed before the electrophilic residue of the substrate partitions amongst the several product-forming routes. We have here evidence for a multi-step mechanism with parallel product-forming routes from a single carbenium ion intermediate.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Mechanism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have seen that elimination almost invariably accompanies the unimolecular (S<sub>N</sub>1) mechanism for substitution which is a stepwise process involving rate-limiting formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. In some<a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Elimination reactions to give alkenes</a>cases, first-order elimination is the main process, with the S<sub>N</sub>1 the minor accompanying reaction. The most economical explanation of the very close correspondence between the formation of two types of product (elimination and substitution) from a common reactant with the same rate law is that they arise from different product-forming steps after a common rate-limiting step as illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a> for the reaction of <i>tert</i>-butyl bromide.</p>

ionization followed by the parallel substitution and elimination product-forming routes</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">In this reaction scheme, we see that the carbenium ion suffers nucleophilic capture at the &#x03B1;-carbon by a solvent molecule to give, after proton loss, the ether; this is the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction with which we are already familiar. Additionally, however, we see that the carbenium ion may suffer proton abstraction from a &#x03B2;-carbon by a solvent molecule to yield isobutene; this is the El reaction channel. The mechanism in <a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a> may also be represented by the reaction profile in<a href="#fig_3.3"> Fig. 3.3</a>.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">That the reaction is under kinetic control is easily established by investigating the stability of the individual products to the reaction conditions.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">This includes the information that the substitution product is more stable (under these conditions) than either the reactant or the alkene. However, the reaction is kinetically controlled. Consequently, the higher yield of the ether is because it is formed <i>faster</i> from the intermediate (about four times faster according to the product analysis) and not because it is the more stable. For<a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Elimination reactions to give alkenes</a>this reason, the barrier from the carbenium ion to give substitution is drawn lower than that for elimination.</p>

Bimolecular elimination of HX to give alkenes, E2</h2>



<p class="noindent">We saw in the previous chapter that some compounds undergo substitution reactions in solution only by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism (e.g. acyclic rm-alkyl bromides), some only by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism (e.g. simple primary alkyl chlorides), and some (e.g. benzyl arenesulfonates) by either depending upon the reaction conditions. In elimination reactions, there are some compounds which give alkenes only under strongly basic conditions by the mechanism we are about to consider. However, there are very few if any which will yield alkenes exclusively by the El reaction that we considered above. In other words, virtually any compound that undergoes the El reaction will also undergo a second-order elimination reaction under strongly basic conditions.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Experimental evidence</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Kinetics: Second-order rate law.</i> Simple primary alkyl halides and arenesulfonates react in hydroxylic media containing the conjugate base of the solvent with second-order rate laws. We saw in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">chapter 2</a> that some such reactions are bimolecular substitutions, but there may also be some extent of elimination co-occurring. If the base is particularly bulky, the elimination may dominate as, for example, in the reaction of ethyl bromide with potassium terf-butoxide in terf-butanol,<a href="#eq_3.3"> eqn 3.3</a>.</p>


<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.3" style="margin-left:3.5em">
<img src="../images/page_41_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>


<p class="noindent">This rate law tells us that the activated complex in this elimination is formed from the alkyl halide and the base.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Stereochemistry: Second-order elimination reactions are stereospecific.</i> The diastereoisomers of 1,2-diphenylbromopropane [CH<sub>3</sub>CH(Ph)CH(Ph)Br] react in ethanol containing ethoxide at different rates to give different dehydrobromination products. The <i>IR,2R</i> compound and its enantiomer (1s,2s), either individually or as the racemic modification, react in a relatively slow reaction to give c/s-&#x03B1;-methylstilbene,<a href="#fig_3.4"> Fig. 3.4.</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="aside">If the &#x03B2;-C-<sup>1</sup>H is replaced by a &#x03B2;-C-<sup>2</sup>H in these second-order elimination reactions, the second- order rate constant is smaller by a factor of about 5, i.e. K<sup>H</sup><i>l</i>K<sup>D</sup>= 5; this is excellent evidence that cleavage of the &#x03B2;-C-H is involved in the transition state.</p></aside>

<p class="aside">The mechanism represented in <a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a> is an <i>anti</i> elimination.

<p class="aside">We may expect that &#x0394;S<sup>&#x2021;</sup> for these reactions will be appreciably negative (unfavourable) because open chain conformationally mobile reactant molecules have to assume very particular conformations in order to react with the base.

<p class="aside">In these Newman projections, the broken lines are to indicate the increasing steric interactions as groups which are gauche in the required conformations of the reactants become <i>cis</i> and coplanar in the products.

E1 or E2 ? Elimination or Substitution? Factors affecting mechanism and reactivity in elimination reactions, and competition with substitution reactions</h2>


<p class="noindent">We now need to consider the factors which determine whether an elimination reaction will occur by the El or the E2 mechanism. Moreover, we also have to consider possible competition between elimination and substitution since we have now seen that an alkoxide (for example) can act as a base and abstract a &#x03B2;-proton in an elimination reaction, or as a nucleophile and react at the &#x03B1;-carbon in a substitution. The factors are precisely those identified in our earlier consideration of competition between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms, viz. the nature of the reactants (base/nucleophile, nucleofuge, and the structure of the alkyl residue) and the experimental conditions (solvent, concentrations, and temperature).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Nucleofuge</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Since partitioning between El and  S<sub>N</sub>1  reaction channels occurs after the departure of the nucleofuge in the rate-limiting step, it cannot be affected by the nature of the nucleofuge. Thus, although the <i>tert</i>-butyl halides undergo solvolysis in largely aqueous ethanol at different rates, the product is a mixture of tert-butanol and isobutene (with some <i>tert</i>-butyl ethyl ether depending upon the composition of the solvent) which is virtually the same for chloride, bromide, and iodide,<a href="#eq_3.4"> eqn 3.4</a>.</p>

<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.4" style="width:70%;text-align:center">
<img src="../images/page_43_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>




<p class="indent3-ka">The effect of the nucleofuge upon El versus E2 is exactly parallel to its effect upon  S<sub>N</sub>1 versus  S<sub>N</sub>2. A good nucleofuge may depart in the unimolecular reaction leading to El (accompanied by  S<sub>N</sub>1) whereas departure of a poor one requires the assistance supplied by the base in abstracting the proton in the E2 mechanism. With a very poor nucleofuge, there may be no elimination at all even in the presence of a high concentration of a strong base (but see later about the <b>ElcB</b> mechanism).</p>





<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Minor variations in the product analyses of families of reactions such as those in <a href="#eq_3.4">eqn 3.4 </a>can be explained by the different extents of ion-pair participation as product-forming intermediates in the different reactions according to the nature of the nucleofuge (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_25">p. 25</a>).</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Solvent</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The strategy here is the same as in the case of  S<sub>N</sub>1 and  S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions; we consider the electronic redistribution associated with the transformation of reactant(s) into activated complex and decide whether this will be facilitated or inhibited by a particular change in solvent. No new matters of principle are involved. If the formation of the activated complex is accompanied by a decrease in dipolarity or the destruction of ions, the reaction will be facilitated by solvents with poor ionizing properties. However, there may be


<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Elimination reactions to give alkenes</a>
practical restrictions in this direction; anionic bases such as sodium and potassium alkoxides, or lithium and sodium amides, will not dissolve in non-polar solvents. Dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide are particularly useful for promoting homogeneous E2 reactions with ionic strong bases. An E2 reaction using a neutral base such as pyridine can also be facilitated by using the base as solvent, i.e. in the highest possible concentration.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Base/nucleophile</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">If an alkyl halide or arenesulfonate undergoes a unimolecular ionization as the first step in the  S<sub>N</sub>1/El reaction with no second-order contribution to the rate law, the concentration or nature of a basic or nucleophilic solute cannot affect the rate of the reaction. However, as we saw in<a href="#fig_3.2"> Fig. 3.2</a>, once formed, the intermediate carbenium ion partitions between nucleophilic capture and proton abstraction by the solvent according to the relative rates of these alternative  S<sub>N</sub>1 and El product-forming steps. If a basic or nucleophilic solute is added, additional product-forming routes from the intermediate carbenium ion become available. For example, without forming new products, the conjugate base of the solvent could alter the relative proportions of substitution to elimination if it reacts differently between proton abstraction and nucleophilic capture from the solvent itself. Another basic solute with no nucleophilic tendency, e.g. a sterically hindered amine, would also alter the ratio of substitution to elimination without leading to the formation of new products. However, a nucleophilic solute, e.g. azide, would intercept the intermediate carbenium ion to give a new product, an alkyl azide, by an additional product-forming route.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">If a substrate RX which undergoes an E1 /S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction also undergoes an E2 reaction if a base is present, the relative rates of the two reactions will be given by the ratio of the respective rate laws:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;">rate of El &#x002B;  S<sub>N</sub>1 &#x003D; <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> [RX]</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;">rate of E2 &#x003D; <i>k</i>2 [RX] [base].</p>
<p class="noindent">Consequently,</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;">E2/(E1 &#x002B; S<sub>N</sub>1) &#x003D; k<sub>2</sub>[base]<i>/</i>k<sub>1</sub></p>
<p class="noindent">so, by increasing the concentration of base, the proportion of elimination by the bimolecular mechanism may be increased. Virtually all E1/ S<sub>N</sub>1substrates also undergo E2 reactions (even though they may not undergo  S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions), so this is a useful device for increasing the proportion of total elimination to unimolecular substitution.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The proportion of S<sub>N</sub>2 to E2 is relatively easy to control even though some Lewis bases act both as Br&#x00F8;nsted bases and as nucleophiles. The pk<sub>a</sub> of a base is a good measure of its proton-abstracting ability in an E2 reaction, and this is not significantly affected by steric effects; thus HO<sup>-</sup>,
<a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Elimination reactions to give alkenes</a>
EtO<sup>-</sup>, and tBuO<sup>-</sup> are all good bases in E2 reactions. However, nucleophilicity is very severely affected by steric factors and, of these three bases, tBuO<sup>-</sup> has no significant nucleophilic tendencies. So, in order to promote the E2 reaction at the expense of a potentially competing S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, a sterically hindered base should be chosen. On the other hand, if substitution is required, then HO<sup>-</sup> or a soft nucleophile that is only weakly basic such as cyanide (CN<sup>-</sup>), azide (N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), or thiolate (RS<sup>-</sup>) could be chosen according to the nature of the new bond to the &#x03B1;-carbon that is required.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Alkyl group R in RX</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We saw in the previous chapter that simple primary alkyl halides and arenesulfonates (R'CH<sub>2</sub>-X where R' is an acyclic saturated alkyl group) do not undergo S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions simply because the potential primary carbenium ion (R'CH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) is too unstable to exist in solution. It now follows that such compounds do not give El reactions either since El and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions share a common rate-determining step. We also saw that tertiary alkyl halides and arenesulfonates (R'R"R'"C-X) do not undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions since they are sterically too hindered. Interestingly, such compounds do undergo E2 reactions, so we may conclude that E2 reactions are sterically less demanding than their substitution counterparts. This is illustrated by the results in <a href="#table_3.1">Table 3.1</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center"><b>Table 3.1</b> Proportions of E2 to S<sub>N</sub>2 in bimolecular reactions of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides with EtO<sup>-</sup> Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in EtOH, 50&#x00B0;C</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0.5em">As shown in<a href="#fig_3.8"> Fig. 3.8</a>, the nucleophile has to get at the inside of the substrate in order to displace the nucleofuge from the &#x03B1;-carbon about which there is an increase in co-ordination upon formation of the activated complex. In contrast, the base in an E2 reaction abstracts a proton from a &#x03B2;-carbon (and there may be several of these), and this is well away from the nucleofuge departing from the &#x03B1;-carbon, so access by the base is much less sterically hindered or electronically inhibited.

Regioselectivity in elimination reactions</h2>

<h3 class="h3"><b>E1 Reactions and sterically unhindered E2 reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Preference for the more stable alkene.</i> Regardless of whether the mechanism is El or E2, <i>tert-</i>butyl substrates can give only a single elimination product (2-methylpropene) whereas tert-pentyl substrates may give two (2-methylbut-l-ene and 2-methylbut-2-ene). In the solvolysis of<a href="#fig_3.1"> Fig. 3.1</a>,<a href="#page_39"> p. 39</a>, <i>tert-</i>pentyl halides give both constitutional isomers but with a 4:1 preference for 2-methylbut-2-ene. This apparent preference for the more substituted of the possible structurally isomeric alkenes is typical of most El eliminations and very many E2 reactions as well. It was recognised many years ago and is sometimes called the Saytzeff Rule.</p>











<p class="indent3-ka">Formation of isomeric alkenes depends upon having different &#x03B2;- hydrogens to be eliminated with the nucleofuge, but does not require that the alkyl group be tertiary. Elimination of HC1 from compound (<a href="#page_46">3.1</a>) could lead to <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> hex-3-enes or <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> hex-2-enes according to whether a proton is abstracted from the &#x03B2;-carbon or the &#x03B2;'-carbon (carbons 4 and 2 of the hexane chain). If the mechanism is E2 in such reactions, the elimination is in one direction or the other according to the selectivity of the base for the &#x03B2;-C-H or the &#x03B2;'-C-H of the substrate; if the mechanism is El, it depends upon the selectivity of the base (solvent) for the &#x03B2;-C-H or the &#x03B2;'-C-H of the carbenium ion intermediate. This type of selectivity is called regioselectivity.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The Saytzeff Rule, originally formulated from empirical observations, was first expressed (as above) as a preference for the formation of the more <i>substituted</i> alkene. On the basis of a modern mechanistic understanding of elimination reactions, it would be better expressed as a preference for the more <i>stable</i> of the possible structural isomers although, for a set of isomeric alkenes, the one with the greatest degree of alkyl substitution will usually be the most stable. Even this, however, is not rigorously correct. If an elimination is kinetically controlled, it is the relative stabilities of the respective activated complexes leading to the alternative products that determines the regioselectivity, not the relative stabilities of the products themselves. This is illustrated for a hypothetical El reaction in <a href="#fig_3.9">Fig. 3.9</a> where we have a free energy profile for the formation of two possible acyclic alkenes from a tertiary alkyl substrate R'CH<sub>2</sub>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>X in aqueous solution. The respective activated complexes with the developing double bonds are sketched in <a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-27em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">That it is stability rather than degree of substitution that is important in predicting regioselectivity of eliminations is illustrated by the dehydrobromination of <i>exo-</i> 2-bromobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (<a href="#page_46">3.3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In this reaction, the rate-limiting step leads to a carbenium ion which has six equivalent &#x03B2;-hydrogens (the methyl groups) and two equivalent &#x03B2;'-hydrogens (the methylene group). Abstraction of a &#x03B2;'-proton leads to the more substituted alkene which is more stable than the one formed by abstraction of a &#x03B2;-proton. More significantly, however, the greater stability of the more substituted alkene is manifest in the activated complex leading to its formation. In other words, the activated complex with the more

substituted <i>developing</i> double bond, and this is the real cause for the regioselectivity that is observed. It is a kinetic effect.</p>

<p class="noindent">For a base with only modest steric demands, we see that the regioselectivity is not much different from that of the El reaction&#x2014;a preference for the more substituted, more stable, alkene. However, as the base becomes larger (without a significant change in its base strength or electronic properties), a preference for the less substituted alkene develops, and this changed regioselectivity becomes stronger as the base becomes increasingly bulky.<a href="#fig_3.13"> Fig. 3.13</a> shows that the same change in regioselectivity can also be brought about by increasing the steric bulk of the alkyl group R in the substrate.</p>

<p class="noindent">We may conclude that appreciable steric bulk in either the base or the alkyl group causes the normal regioselectivity to be reversed leading to an unmistakable preference for the formation of the less substituted alkene. We need to consider the E2 mechanism in a little more detail now to see how bulky groups are able to subvert the usual electronic effects and cause the less substituted, less stable alkene to be formed preferentially, rather than the more stable.</p>

<p class="aside">The proportion of the rotameric form of the substrate whose Newman projection is shown on the right will increase as R (and X) become increasingly large.

</aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">Notice that these two pathways are electronically very similar, i.e. both lead to a 1,2-dialkylethene. However, development of the double bond in the <i>cis</i>-2-alkene from the conformer in the centre involves an increasingly adverse steric interaction between R and the methyl as they become <i>cis</i> and coplanar. There is nothing comparable in the formation of the <i>trans-</i>2- alkene from the conformer on the left. Consequently, in this reaction, there will be a greater yield of the <i>trans</i> diastereoisomer. And in both pathways, the base approaches (to abstract a proton from carbon-3) gauche to the methyl on carbon-2, and R on carbon-3 is gauche to the nucleofuge on carbon-2. Both pathways, therefore, become increasingly difficult as either the base or R becomes increasingly bulky.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="aside">According to this analysis, we may also expect that increasing the steric bulk of the nucleofuge will also lead to inhibition of the formation of the more substituted alkene. This has been observed along the series Cl, Br, I, but it is only a small effect.</p>

However, there is less steric strain in the activated complex of this path than in the reactions of <a href="#fig_3.14">Fig. 3.14</a> when the base or the alkyl group R is bulky.

<p class="aside">We have seen here how steric interactions cause the normally electronically controlled regioselectivity to be reversed.

If the strain involved in forming the more (rather than the less) alkyl- substituted alkene is bond-length, bond-angle, or torsional strain, then the tendency to give the less substituted alkene is much greater as in the reaction of 2-bromo- bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane

<p class="noindent"><i>Elimination reactions from tetra-alkylammonium cations</i>. So far, the regioselectivity in E2 reactions has been a question of whether  &#x03B2;-proton or &#x03B2;&#x00B4;-proton is eliminated with the nucleofuge on the &#x03B1;-carbon as in, for example, compound <a href="#page_46">(3.1)</a>, <a href="#page_46">p. 46.</a> The regioselectivity issue is somewhat different in eliminations from tetra-alkylammonium cations as structure(<a href="#page_50">3.6</a>)	illustrates. If we focus on the carbon labelled &#x03B1;, then we have the tertiary amine R<sup>&#x0027;&#x0027;</sup>R<sup>&#x0027;&#x0027;&#x0027;</sup>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>R<sup>&#x0027;</sup> as a potential nucleofuge bonded to it, and the &#x03B2;-CH<sub>2</sub> above.

In such reactions (the Hofmann elimination reaction of heating a tetra-alkylammonium hydroxide), we observe a preference for the less substituted alkene as exemplified in <a href="#fig_3.16">Fig. 3.16.</a> This is ascribed to the greater steric strain (due to the bulky tertiary amine nucleofuge) in the activated complex of the alternative unfavourable formation of isobutene plus dimethylethylamine.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Proton abstraction followed by expulsion of nucleofuge, ElcB</b></h3>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the El mechanism, the initial step is departure of the nucleofuge, and the elimination is completed by proton loss from the intermediate carbenium ion; this mechanism occurs only when there is a good nucleofuge and a viable carbenium ion. In the E2 mechanism, departure of the nucleofuge is assisted by the concerted proton abstraction; this reaction occurs either when the nucleofuge is not quite good enough to depart without assistance, or if the potential carbenium ion is insufficiently stable to exist under the conditions of the reaction. By following these thoughts further, we may anticipate another mechanism&#x2014;stepwise like the El, but in the alternative sense&#x2014;proton abstraction followed by departure of the nucleofuge. This could occur when the nucleofuge is not good enough to depart even with a concerted proton abstraction, but is good enough to depart from a fully formed carbanion intermediate generated in a prior step. Such a mechanism, the ElcB (unimolecular elimination from the conjugate base of the substrate), although not common, has been characterized. It usually requires an electron-withdrawing substituent on the &#x03B2;-carbon to facilitate the formation of the carbanion intermediate. The conceptual transformation of mechanism as we proceed from stepwise El, to concerted E2, to stepwise ElcB is illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.18">Fig. 3.18.</a></p>

The initial state is the bottom left and the final state is the top right; the configurational co-ordinates are the extension of the bond from the &#x03B1;-carbon to the nucleofuge (the <i>y</i> axis), and the extent of proton transfer from the &#x03B2;-carbon to the base B<sup>-</sup> (the <i>x</i> axis).</p>

<p class="noindent">The path shown crosses the map diagonally so it represents a synchronous concerted mechanism, and the transition state will be somewhere in the centre of the map. The activated complex in this E2 mechanism will involve a partially developed double bond, partial cleavage of the C-X bond, and a proton partially transferred from the &#x03B2;-carbon to the base.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Any feature of the reactants which stabilizes the state corresponding to the bottom right of the map, e.g. Z being an electron withdrawing group, will cause curvature of the path towards the bottom right, and the activated complex then has some carbanionic character, i.e. the proton abstraction is running ahead of the departure of the nucleofuge. Alternatively, any feature which stabilizes the state corresponding to the top left, e.g. R being an electron-supplying substituent, will cause curvature towards the top left. The departure of the nucleofuge now runs ahead of the proton abstraction, and <a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Elimination reactions to giv alkenes</a>the activated complex has carbenium ion character. Either of these modifications, if only modest, alters the nature of the E2, and introduces some degree of asynchroneity. However, if the group Z is sufficiently effective that the carbanion becomes an intermediate, i.e. the state described by the bottom right of the diagram corresponds to a minimum in the energy surface, then the mechanism has transformed into an ElcB, and is stepwise. Alternatively, if R is such that the carbenium ion is a viable intermediate, i.e. the state described by the top right of the map corresponds to a minimum, the mechanism has become an El and is stepwise in the alternative sense.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Pyrolytic elimination</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Carboxylic esters undergo thermal elimination reactions, e.g. <a href="#eq_3.6">eqn 3.6.</a> The temperatures needed for such reactions depend very much upon the structure of the particular ester, but are rather high.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Mechanistic evidence.</i> The reactions are first order in the gas phase or in an inert solvent, and do not involve a base. Product analytical evidence indicates that the &#x03B2;-C-H and the &#x03B1;-C-acetoxy that are eliminated to yield the alkene need to be <i>cis</i> to each other in the reactant. For example, <i>trans-</i>1,2- dimethylcyclopentyl acetate, 
<a href="#page_54">(3.7)</a> in <a href="#fig_3.21">Fig. 3.21</a>, eliminates acetic acid to give only the two alkenes shown; no 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene is formed. In contrast, its <i>cis</i> isomer (3,8) gives all three possible products.</p>

<p class="aside">The reactant molecules In this type of elimination are conformationally mobile but need to assume a rather particular and improbable conformation in order for the concerted redistribution of electron density to occur in the transition state. This accounts for the appreciably negative 
&#x0394;<i>S</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> values that are observed, and the concerted formation of new bonds and cleavage of old ones accounts for the very modest &#x0394;<i>H</i><sup>&#x2021;</sup> values.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Generally, thermal decompositions of simple carboxylic esters require high temperatures and consequently are not synthetically very useful. However, the closely related reactions of amine oxides (and xanthate esters) occur at much lower temperatures and are useful. As the example in<a href="#fig_3.23"> Fig. 3.23</a> illustrates, there is a modest regioselectivity in favour of formation of the less substituted, less stable, alkene suggesting that steric factors are important in the formation of the five-membered cyclic activated complex <a href="#page_55">(3.10)</a> required in the decomposition of amine oxides.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Dehalogenation of 1,2-dihalides</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">These reactions are very similar to E2 reactions considered earlier, the main difference being that a nucleophile (rather than a base) abstracts an electrophilic halogen (rather than a proton) as the vicinal halide departs as a nucleofuge. Since the double bond is formed between the two carbons to which the halogens were initially bonded, there is no question of regioselectivity.</p>

<p class="noindent">The stereospecificity illustrated in <a href="#fig_3.24">Fig. 3.24</a> confirms that the mechanism involves the <i>tram</i> coplanar arrangement of the carbon-halogen bonds in the activated complex<a href="#page_56">(3.11)</a>; this allows maximal steric separation of the nucleophile and the nucleofuge, and the most favourable stereoelectronic arrangement for rebonding.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A restriction to the usefulness of this procedure is that 1,2-dihalides are almost invariably made by addition of halogen to an alkene&#x0021; However, since the elimination is stereochemically the reverse of the addition, this signals the use of the halogen addition-elimination sequence as a functional group protection-deprotection procedure for alkenes.</p>
