<h1 class="main">Glossary of terms</h1>
<p class="noindent">Discussions of mechanisms of chemical reactions have frequently been confused by misunderstandings caused by loosely defined terminology or misuse of precisely defined terms. In this book, we have aimed to use terms recommended by the Physical Organic Chemistry Commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Terms in <i>italics</i> are themselves later entries in this list.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <b>activated complex</b> is the assembly of atoms (charged or neutral) which corresponds to the maximum in the <i>potential energy profile</i> (or the saddle point on the potential energy surface) describing the transformation of reactant(s) into product(s) in a single step reaction with the vibrations and rotations appropriate to the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, solvent, etc.). Either the reactant or product in this definition could be an <i>intermediate</i> in an overall transformation involving more than one step.</p>

<p class="noindent">A <b>carbenium ion</b> (carbonium ion in the older literature) is a type of carbocation; it has a central <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> hybridised trivalent trigonal carbon atom with a vacant <i>p-</i>orbital, i.e. there are three sigma bonds attached to the positively charged central carbon which has only six valence electrons. It may be seen as a derivative of a protonated carbene.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Chemoselectivity</b> is the preferential reaction of a reagent at one of two or more potential reaction sites. It is a term that admits qualification, i.e. a reaction may be of high or low chemoselectivity, e.g. sodium borohydride is a more chemoselective reducing agent than lithium aluminium hydride.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The term &#x2018;carbonium ion&#x2019; is restricted in modern usage to penta-coordinate, carbocations, i.e. derivatives of protonated methane. In such species, there are only eight valence electrons involved in bonding the five ligands to the central carbon, so they involve, non- classical multicentre bonds.</p>

<p class="aside">The shapes of these cations are still a matter of investigation, but they are almost certainly not static trigonal bipyramidal ions.</p></aside>
<p class="noindent"><b>Concerted</b> is the term applied to two or more changes occurring in a single step reaction, e.g. the bond forming and bond breaking in an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. These changes may be <i>synchronous</i> <b></b>or asynchronous.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_92" class="page">Page 92, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a><b>An elementary reaction </b>is a single step in a more complex kinetic scheme, i.e. a chemical reaction in which there are no <i>intermediates</i> and occurs through a single <i>transition state.</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Enantiomeric excess is</b> <i>(&#x0025;R - &#x0025;S)</i> or <i>(&#x0025;S - &#x0025;R</i>) for a single stereogenic element in a chiral compound. It is a common measure of the <i>stereoselectivity</i> of a reaction in which enantiomers are formed in unequal proportions from an achiral or racemic reactant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <b>initial state</b> is the thermodynamic state of the reactant side of a chemical reaction; it corresponds to the reactant(s) on a molar scale under specified conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration, solvent, etc.</p>

<p class="noindent">An <b>intermediate</b> is a molecule or ion of finite lifetime which intervenes between reactant and product in a chemical transformation. It corresponds to a minimum in the <i>potential energy profile</i> of the reaction. A reaction which involves an intermediate is necessarily a stepwise reaction. If it has a particularly short lifetime, it is sometimes called a reactive intermediate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Internal return</b> is the process whereby an ion pair (or a radical pair) intermediate returns to its covalent precursor (rather than proceeding to product or the next intermediate) in a stepwise sequence.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Kinetic control</b> characterises a reaction in which the product composition is determined by the relative rates at which the various components are formed (in contrast to a reaction under <i>thermodynamic (or equilibrium) control).</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Molecular potential energy</b> is the energy of an arrangement of atoms excluding the translational energy of the arrangement as a whole. It is the change in energy of the system as the component atoms are brought together from infinite separations.</p>
<p class="noindent">A <b>pre-equilibrium</b> is a rapidly reversible step preceding the <i>rate-determining step</i> in a complex reaction. The initial proton transfer step in a specific acid catalysed reaction is an example.</p>
<p class="noindent">A <b>post-equilibrium</b> is a final equilibration in a reaction which determines the product composition but which does not affect the reaction rate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_93" class="page">Page 93, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a>A <b>post-equilibrium</b> is a final equilibration in a reaction which determines the product composition but which does not affect the reaction rate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Product determining steps</b> in a complex reaction are (parallel) steps which lead to the products, e.g. from a common intermediate formed in a prior rate-determining step as in an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <b>rate-determining (or rate-limiting) step</b> in a stepwise complex reaction is the one which involves <i>the transition state</i> of highest free energy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <b>reaction co-ordinate</b> is an inter- or intra-molecular configurational variable whose change corresponds to the conversion of reactant into product. It may be a simple bond length, as in the dissociation of a diatomic molecule, or it may be a composite term, for example, in an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.</p>
<p class="noindent">A <b>reaction profile</b> is a plot of energy (molecular potential energy, molar enthalpy, or free energy) against reaction co-ordinate for the conversion of reactant(s) into product(s) based upon a particular mechanism.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Regioselective</b> describes a reaction in which one direction or orientation of bond making or breaking occurs preferentially over all others, e.g. in the addition of HX to an unsymmetrical alkene. The term admits qualification, i.e. reactions may be of high regioselectivity (strong preference for one orientation) or low (both or all orientations to comparable extents).</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Stereoselective</b> describes a reaction of a racemic compound, or one without a stereogenic element, in which stereoisomers are formed in unequal amounts. If the products are enantiomers, the phenomenon is enantioselectivity (and quantified by the enantiomeric excess); if the products are diastereoisomers, it is diastereoselectivity (and quantified as the diastereoisomeric excess).</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Stereospecific</b> describes a reaction in which stereoisomeric reactants behave differently; they may react at different rates, or give different products, or give the same products but in different relative yields. The stereospecificity of a reaction may be qualified, e.g. as high or low.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_94" class="page">Page 94, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a><b>Steric acceleration</b> is when the rate constant of a reaction becomes larger as the reactant becomes more sterically hindered; it is usually evidence of a unimolecular mechanism, or of one with a unimolecular rate-limiting step.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Steric hindrance</b> is when the rate constant of a reaction becomes smaller as a reactant becomes more sterically hindered; it is usually evidence of a bimolecular mechanism, or of one with a bimolecular rate-limiting step.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Synchronous</b> is the term applied to two or more changes occurring at exactly the same time in a single step reaction; such changes are necessarily concerted.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>A transition state</b> is a hypothetical thermodynamic state corresponding to the maximum in the reaction profile of a single reaction step. It is hypothetical because it corresponds to one mole of activated complexes under the specified conditions of temperature, pressure, solvent, etc. Each step in a stepwise reaction has its own transition state.</p>
<p class="noindent">A <b>transition structure</b> is the hypothetical motionless assembly or arrangement of atoms which corresponds to the maximum in the potential energy profile (or the saddle point on the potential energy surface) describing the transformation of reactant(s) into product(s) in a single reaction step. This term is usually applied to structures which are the outcome of theoretical chemical calculations and corresponds to an arrangement of atoms without vibrational or rotational motion.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Thermodynamic (or equilibrium) control</b> characterises a reaction in which the product composition is determined by the relative stabilities of the products under the conditions of the reaction. Such an outcome is evidence that the products undergo equilibration in a reaction subsequent to their formation, or that the mechanism of their formation involves reversible steps which allow equilibration.</p>
