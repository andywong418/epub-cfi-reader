<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we deal with additions of XY (where X and Y are single atoms or polyatomic groups) to double and triple carbon&#x002D;carbon bonds to give products in which X and Y are separately bonded to the adjacent carbons of the original multiple bond. The simplest are reactions of diatomic molecules HX or X<sub>2</sub> where X is a halogen (most commonly chlorine or bromine) and these almost invariably have step&#x002D;wise mechanisms. Such additions to alkenes or alkynes are the reverse of elimination reactions and, as we shall see, two of the mechanisms are the El and ElcB in reverse.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">We shall consider the mechanisms of addition in turn according to their common names, i.e. according to whether the initial step of the reaction of the unsaturated organic compound is with an electrophile, a nucleophile, or a radical. In electrophilic addition, of course, the overall process is completed by the addition of a nucleophile and, in nucleophilic addition, completion involves addition of an electrophile.</p></section>

The ratio of alkyl chloride to alcohol depends upon the reaction conditions, in particular the concentration of the hydrochloric acid. The formation of the alcohol suggests the involvement of a solvent water molecule, and the formation of more than a single product is reminiscent of the S<sub>N</sub>1&#x002D;E1 mechanisms in which substitution and elimination products form by parallel product&#x002D;forming routes from a common reactive intermediate formed in an earlier step.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Mechanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">The mechanism which best accommodates the kinetics, the multiple product formation, and the stereochemical evidence so far presented for the addition of HC1 or HBr to a simple alkene in aqueous solution is illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2.</a> It involves a rate&#x002D;limiting proton transfer from the hydronium ion to the carbon&#x002D;carbon double bond to generate a carbenium ion. This is then rapidly captured by a nucleophile&#x2014;either the counter &#x002D;ion of the acid (Cl<sup>&#x203E;</sup> or Br<sup>&#x203E;</sup>) or water. The <i>anti</i> stereoselectivity requires that the nucleophile captures the carbenium ion from the face of the trigonal system opposite to the one approached by the hydronium ion which delivered the proton.</p>

<figure class="fig1"  id="fig_5.2" style="text-align:center;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_78_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center"><b>Fig. 5.2 </b>Mechanism of electrophilic hydration and addition of HX to a simple alkene using H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>&#x002B;</sup> X&#x203E; in aqueous solution<sup></sup></p>

<p class="noindent">This mechanism will be recognised as the reverse of the El, and whether the reaction proceeds in one direction or the other depends upon the reaction conditions as well as the identity of the starting material.</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside"><i>Hydron</i> is a term to represent any of the isotopes of hydrogen ,and the symbol L is often used, i,e CL<sub>3</sub> is a methyl group containing protium, deuterium, or tritium</p></aside>




<p class="indent3-ka">The reversibility of the initial hydron transfer in the addition direction may be investigated by carrying out the reaction in deuterium oxide rather than ordinary water. If the carbenium ion formation is reversible, deuterium will become incorporated in starting material isolated after, say, one half-life. It was shown that such incorporation did not occur in the hydration of 2&#x002D; methylbut&#x002D;2&#x002D;ene, so the carbenium ion in this case is captured by a water molecule to give product much faster than it loses a hydron in the reverse of the first step, <a href="#eq_5.2">eqn 5.2.</a></p>

<figure class="fig1" id="eq_5.2" style="text-align:center;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_78_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">However, we have already seen in our consideration of elimination reactions, that an El mechanism will not occur if the carbenium ion intermediate is too unstable to exist. In such cases, we saw that the elimination becomes concerted and the formation of the very unstable</p>

<a id="page_79" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 79, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds </a>


<p class="noindent">intermediate is avoided. If the intermediate is not accessible in the elimination direction, it must also be inaccessible in the addition direction. In such addition reactions, therefore, the bonding of the nucleophile to the incipient &#x03B1;&#x002D;carbon must be concerted with the delivery of the proton to the incipient &#x03B2;&#x002D;carbon from the other face of the alkene, i.e. a <i>trans</i> coplanar arrangement of proton donor, the two carbons, and the approaching nucleophile is achieved in the activated complex (<a href="#page_79">5.1</a>), and the reaction is now the reverse of a solvent&#x002D;induced E<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Halonium ions</h3>
<p class="noindent">We saw above in the addition of HX to an alkene using H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>&#x002B;</sup> X&#x203E; that a potential carbenium ion intermediate too unstable to exist may be avoided if bonding of the electrophile (proton) and nucleophile (X&#x203E;) are concerted. This instability of a potential carbenium ion intermediate usually arises from the absence of substituents which can stabilise the developing electron&#x002D; deficient centre on what becomes the &#x03B1;&#x002D;carbon. However, in the addition of CI<sub>2</sub> or Br<sub>2</sub> to an alkene, the electron deficiency of the incipient carbenium ion intermediate in the two&#x002D;step reaction may be relieved by involvement of a lone pair of the halogen which entered in the first step. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a> for the reaction of chlorine with cyclohexene in water. The three&#x002D; membered cyclic cationic intermediate in this reaction, a chloronium ion, is represented as three resonance canonical forms two of which contribute equally because of the symmetry of the system. Nucleophilic capture of this chloronium ion by chloride at either of the two carbon atoms (reaction at only one is shown) from the top face of the molecule as drawn involves opening the three&#x002D;membered ring in a process akin to an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. The product immediately formed has the two chlorines trans and diaxial; conformational equilibration yields the trans diequatorial form. Attack at the other carbon will give the enantiomeric dichloro&#x002D;product (not shown).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Correspondingly, nucleophilic capture of the chloronium ion by a water molecule (followed by proton loss) gives the chlorohydrin as shown (and its enantiomer).</p>

<p class="noindent">Bromine adds to <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-but-2-enes as shown in <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4.</a> The intermediate bromonium ion from the trans isomer has C<sub>2V</sub> symmetry, consequently, bromide will be unable to distinguish between the two electrophilic carbons in the second step. It will react as shown to give the (2R,3S)-dibromo compound, and with equal probability at the other carbon with opening of the other carbon-bromine bond of the three-membered ring to give the <i>(2S,3R)</i> compound. However, these compounds are identical rather than enantiomeric (the conformer of the product in which like groups eclipse each other has a mirror plane), so addition of bromine to the trans reactant gives the achiral <i>meso</i>2,3-dibromobutane.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The intermediate from electrophilic attack at the cis isomer has a mirror plane (rather than a C<sub>2V</sub> axis) which also renders the two central carbons of the bromonium ion indistinguishable to the bromide. This time, however, the reaction gives the (<i>2S,3S)</i> compound as shown, plus an equal amount of the <i>(2R,3R)</i> compound. The product of bromine addition to the cis isomer, therefore, is racemic 2,3-dibromobutane. These bromine additions to <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i> but-2-enes are, consequently, completely stereospecific.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Regioselectivity in unsymmetrical electrophilic addition to alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">With just one exception, the addition reactions so far have been of symmetrical alkenes R<sub>2</sub>C&#x003D;CR<sub>2</sub>, or of symmetrical reagents X<sub>2</sub>, consequently, the question of which way an unsymmetrical reagent XY adds to an unsymmetrical alkene R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C&#x003D;CR<sup>3</sup>R<sup>4</sup> has not arisen. This type of chemoselectivity is called regioselectivity. The exception above was the overall addition of BrOH to MeCH&#x003D;CH<sub>2</sub>, using a solution of bromine in water, and the outcome of that reaction can be explained in terms of the charge distribution within the delocalised reactive intermediate, the<a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a>unsymmetrical bromonium ion (<a href="#page_79">5.2</a>), <a href="#page_79">p. 79</a> and <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5.</a> The positive charge is distributed within (<a href="#page_79">5.2</a>) principally among the two carbons and the bromine of the three-membered ring, and described according to the relative contributions of the three resonance canonical forms shown in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5.</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fig. 5.5</b> Electronic structure of an unsymmetrical bromonium ion</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent">The form with three full bonds and a positive charge on bromine will be the main contributor since, in that, no atom is formally electron deficient. Of the other two, the one with the positive charge on the secondary carbon will contribute more than the one with the positive charge on the primary carbon. Consequently, the carbon with the methyl substituent will be the more electrophilic and the site of nucleophilic attack by water to give 1-	bromo-2-hydroxypropane (after proton loss) as shown on <a href="#page_79">p. 79</a> (and not 2-	bromo-1 -hy droxypropane).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the addition of HX to an unsymmetrical alkene in aqueous solution, the initial step is delivery of a proton by H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to one carbon or the other to give either or both of two structurally isomeric carbenium ion intermediates, and this determines the regioselectivity. The addition of HBr to 2-methyl-1- phenylcyclohexene in <a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a> illustrates how the outcome may be predicted by considering the energetics of the alternative routes.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the addition of HBr to propene using hydrobromic acid is considered in exactly the same way, the initial protonation could be either on carbon-1 to give the 2-propyl carbocation, or on carbon-2 to give the 1-propyl carbocation, <a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8.</a> Clearly, the secondary carbenium ion is more stable than the primary, so the regioselectivity is to give 2-bromopropane as the product.

<p class="noindent">We saw in <a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a> the simplest expression of the mechanism of electrophilic hydration of a simple alkene; we are led to predict that substituents which stabilise the intermediate carbenium ion by an electron- donating resonance interaction will enormously accelerate the reaction rate<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a>and control the regioselectivity. This is observed in the hydrolysis of vinyl ethers which are, of course, alkoxy-substituted alkenes,<a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9.</a> These compounds react with complete regioselectivity with even quite dilute aqueous strong acids at room temperature. (In contrast, hydration of a mono-alkyl-substituted ethene usually requires heating for a longer period with a higher concentration of aqueous acid.)

<p class="aside">The first step of the reaction under alkaline conditions uses a hydroxide ion which is regenerated in the second step. The reaction under acidic conditions uses a proton in the first step which is liberated in the last step. Both oxirane hydration reactions, therefore, are genuinely catalytic.</p>

<h3 class="h3">1.2-	Bis Hydroxylation</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reaction of aqueous potassium permanganate with alkenes is familiar as a qualitative test. It involves the oxidative <i>syn</i> addition of the permanganate anion to the electron rich alkene to give an unstable cyclic permanganate ester which cannot be isolated and undergoes subsequent hydrolysis to give a 1.2-	diol. Alas, the yield and reproducibility of this reaction are such that it is unreliable as a general synthetic method. Furthermore, permanganate is a powerful and indiscriminate oxidizing agent which oxidizes a wide range of other organic functional groups (including 1,2-diols).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Osmium tetroxide is far more effective for the selective conversion of alkenes to <i>cis</i>-l,2-diols, <a href="#fig_5.13">Fig. 5.13</a>; the reaction may be carried out in a nonpolar medium, e.g. diethyl ether.

Monoalkyl and dialkyl boranes (RBH<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>BH), as well as B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and BH<sub>3</sub> complexes, react as electrophiles with alkenes, but the mechanistic details remain obscure because of the difficulties in carrying out quantitative measurements. The basis of the regioselectivity is partly steric and partly electronic, but usually predictable: the boron bonds to the carbon of the alkene which bears the greater number of hydrogens. This is exploited in the most important application of hydroboration when the reaction is directly followed by oxidation, <a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14.</a> The stereoselectivity is generally controlled by steric factors, thus, if the two faces of the alkene are different, the borane approaches the less encumbered face as illustrated for &#x03B1;-pinene (<a href="#page_85">5.7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The initial hydroboration step of this sequence is a <i>syn</i> addition which is followed by the oxidation which involves an interesting rearrangement. Note that the carbon migrates from the boron to the oxygen as the hydroxide departs. This step converts an alkylborane to an alkyl borate, i.e. an ester. Repeat oxidation-rearrangement steps lead to a trialkyl borate which finally is hydrolysed by the alkaline reaction conditions. This overall sequence has hydrated the alkene with overall anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. It is, therefore, complementary to the electrophilic hydration effected by dilute aqueous acidic conditions, see <a href="#page_82">p. 82.</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-18em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Hydroboration-acidolysis is another useful reaction, i.e. quenching the alkylborane product of hydroboration of an alkene with a weak non- aqueous acid such as propionic acid. The carbon-boron bond is replaced by a new carbon-hydrogen bond, so the overall reaction is the <i>syn</i> addition of hydrogen to the alkene. Using a deuterio-acid, RCO<sub>2</sub>D, provides a method for the introduction of deuterium into a molecule at a specific site.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent">Simple alkynes are much less susceptible to electrophilic addition than are simple alkenes, but the mechanisms appear similar; for example, the regioselectivity is predictable from the relative stabilities of the alternative isomeric vinyl cations. However, the stereoselectivity is much lower than in corresponding reactions of alkenes and, in less polar solvents, there is often a preference for <i>syn</i> addition, <a href="#eq_5.3">eqn 5.3.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">We saw above that alkenes are much more reactive than alkynes in electrophilic addition reactions. When the two-step addition is initiated by a nucleophile, the order is reversed&#x2014;alkynes are more reactive than alkenes. Alkenes do not, in fact, readily undergo nucleophilic addition but, when they do, the reactions are synthetically important.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Alkenes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reaction of <a href="#eq_5.5">eqn 5.5</a> occurs only when the alkene is activated towards nucleophilic attack by an electron-withdrawing substituent Z which is able to stabilise the intermediate carbanion. We see that this overall reaction is the reverse of an ElcB, and will proceed in one direction or the other according to the particular system and the experimental conditions.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="eq_5.5" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_86_4.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">In <a href="#fig_5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>, the stabilisation is by the electron-withdrawing resonance effect of the carbonyl group which also controls the regiochemistry: if the<a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a>initial attack of the CN&#x203E; were at the other end of the double bond, the negative charge on the intermediate could not be delocalised conjugatively into the carbonyl group. The anionic intermediate in this reaction is an enolate so, upon subsequent protonation at normal temperatures, the enol and ketone will be generated in equilibrium proportions. In this example, the isolated product will be the &#x03B2;-cyanoketone.</p>

<p class="aside">Because of the present context, the reactant in <a href="#fig_5.15">Fig. 5.15</a> is presented as an alkene with a carbonyl-containing substituent. It may also be seen as a modified ketone, i.e. a conjugated enone, and nucleophiles add to such compounds at the carbonyl as well as at the &#x03B2;-carbon. When the nucleophile is a carbanion, these reactions are synthetically very useful, and addition at the &#x03B2;-carbon is sometimes known as the Michael Reaction.</p></aside>
<h3 class="h3">Alkynes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nucleophilic addition to alkynes may be carried out under mild reaction conditions, but the products are usually synthetic intermediates and transformed further. For example, the substituted vinyl ethyl ether in <a href="#fig_5.16">Fig.5.16</a> is the direct product of the base-catalysed nucleophilic addition of  ethanol to the terminal alkyne, and is converted into the more useful methyl ketone by the subsequent acid-catalysed hydrolysis.

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Note also that the regioselectlvity of this addition is consistent with the mechanistic precepts of the electrophilic addition to alkenes. The addition of the nucleophile is to the carbon allowing the formation of the more stable of the two possible carbanion intermediates-the one with the negative charge on the less alkyl- substituted carbon.</p></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">A nucleophile as weak as water will add to an alkyne with the catalytic assistance of mercuric ions.

<h2 class="h2">5.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Radical addition to alkenes</h2> 
<p class="noindent">We are concerned in this book principally with reactions that proceed via heterolysis of bonds, sometimes called polar reactions, rather than homolyses which involve radicals, i.e. species with unpaired electrons (formerly called <i>free</i> radicals). However, by too rigid an adherence to this demarcation, we would miss important connections and relationships between the two types of reaction. This is particularly true in additions to alkenes, so here we shall deal with the radical addition mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">When hydrogen bromide in a non-aqueous medium reacts with an unsymmetrical alkene such as propene in the presence of UV irradiation, or in a thermal reaction using a compound capable of generating radicals, the regioselectivity is not as found for the electrophilic addition using aqueous hydrobromic acid. Both reactions are shown in <a href="#eq_5.7">eqn 5.7.</a></p>
<figure class="fig1" id="eq_5.7" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_88_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent">These differences according to the reaction conditions indicate that different mechanisms must be involved, and the radical chain mechanism in <a href="#fig_5.17">Fig. 5.17</a> has been proposed to account for the anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity of the non-electrophilic addition.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The initial step in this mechanism is the production of a low concentration of a radical Z<sup>&#x2022;</sup> of appropriate reactivity though its identity does not matter. This may be by homolysis of a peroxide or an azo compound either of which has a weak bond susceptible to thermal homolytic cleavage. Alternatively, it could be by a photolytic reaction. Either way, <i>Z<sup>&#x2022;</sup> </i>is formed which abstracts a hydrogen atom from a molecule of hydrogen<a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds</a>bromide to give an inert by-product ZH and a bromine atom. The bromine atom now adds to the double bond of an alkene molecule with the regioselectivity shown in the first of the two propagation steps in <a href="#fig_5.17">Fig. 5.17.</a> The bromine-containing secondary alkyl radical so produced now abstracts a hydrogen atom from another HBr molecule which generates a molecule of product (bromopropane), and another bromine atom which begins another cycle of the propagation steps. These propagation steps continue until all of
the limiting reactant (usually the propene) is used up, whereupon the chain mechanism terminates.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The distinctive regioselectivity of this mechanism is due to the first of the propagation steps in<a href="#fig_5.17"> Fig. 5.17.</a> The bromine atom adds to give the secondary alkyl radical rather than the isomeric primary alternative (which would have given the Markovnikov product). This is because the relative stabilities of radicals (seven valence electrons) follows the order of carbenium ions (six valence electrons) rather than the order of carbanions (closed shell of eight valence electrons)&#x2014;tertiary more stable than secondary more stable than primary.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Although other compounds X-H also add to alkenes in the anti-Markovnikov manner, for example thiols (RS-H), none of the other hydrohalides do. At one extreme, the bond energy of HF is too high for the fluorine atom to be formed, and, at the other, the iodine atom is too unreactive to add to alkenes at a rate that would lead to a viable reaction. A radical mechanism for hydrogen	chloride appears feasible on thermochemical grounds (the Cl atom could be generated and would be sufficiently reactive), but it appears that under all conditions, the electrophilic heterolytic addition reaction is always faster.</p>
