<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space"></span><b>Introduction</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">In the context of organic synthesis, reactions of carbonyl compounds are probably the most useful of all; they are also amongst the most varied. This is because carbonyl is both the functional group of simple aldehydes and ketones (whose properties may be modified by conjugated unsaturation), and also a principal component of a range of the more complex functional groups of carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters, amides, anhydrides, etc. The distinction between compounds in which the carbonyl group is not directly bonded to a potential nucleofuge, e.g. structures <a href="#page_58">(4.1a)</a>, and those in which it is, structures <a href="#page_58">(4.1b)</a>, will prove helpful. As we shall see, the former undergo reactions with nucleophiles which, overall, are usually either addition or condensation reactions; in contrast, compounds <a href="#page_58">(4.1b)</a> generally react to give substitution of the group X.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Functional groups which include a carbonyl are very widespread in the molecules of nature. An understanding, therefore, of how the carbonyl group reacts is essential for the study of biological chemistry as well as organic synthesis. These reactions are invariably with nucleophiles at the carbon atom, as expected of a functional group with the polarity represented by the partial structure <a href="#page_58">(4.2)</a>, although complexation of an electrophile (e.g. a proton) by a lone pair on the oxygen sometimes leads to electrophile (acid) catalysis.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space"></span><b> Modes of initial nucleophilic attack at a carbonyl</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In this section, we shall consider three modes of reaction by which a nucleophilic compound HY may add to the carbon-oxygen double bond of a carbonyl group. We shall use HY (where Y is a hetero-atom) to represent the nucleophile or Lewis base, i.e. Y bears a lone pair and a weakly acidic hydrogen. Proton transfers are involved in all of these reactions and, since they are between hetero-atoms (usually oxygen and nitrogen, but occasionally sulfur), they are all extremely fast in the thermodynamically favourable direction.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The nucleophile approaches from above or below the plane of the trigonal carbon of the carbonyl in order to maximise the interaction of the lone pair of the nucleophile with the antibonding &#x03C0;<sup>&#x002A;</sup> orbital of the carbonyl group.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Uncatalysed addition of HY</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>, we see nucleophilic attack of HY upon a carbonyl compound to give a dipolar tetrahedral intermediate; the options available to this species include return to starting materials, proton transfer (probably via the solvent in aqueous solution) to give the isomeric uncharged tetrahedral intermediate, and further reaction. The predominant path will depend upon the particular carbonyl compound and the nature of HY.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The first-formed zwitterionic tetrahedral species in <a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1 </a>is represented as an intermediate which may undergo (rapid) proton transfer to give its uncharged isomer. The lifetime of the zwitterion will depend upon the natures of Y, R, and X. In some cases, the proton transfer will be so fast that it becomes coupled with the initial nucleophilic attack, and the zwitterion then has no real existence. The uncharged tetrahedral species will be the first proper intermediate in such a case.</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Acid-catalysed addition of</b> HY</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the above reaction, the nucleophile and the electrophile are both neutral even though both may be polar molecules. In aqueous acidic solution, however, there will be a low equilibrium extent of protonation of the oxygen of the carbonyl. The conjugate acid of the carbonyl compound so formed will be much more electrophilic, i.e. much more susceptible to attack by HY. The consequent mechanism is shown in <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>. Note that the extent of protonation of the carbonyl may be very low, but it will be attained very rapidly. So, as the low extent of the protonated form reacts, more will form, and so on, until all of the carbonyl compound has reacted.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Under acidic conditions, Jhe nucleophile, almost certainly being more basic than the carbonyl compound, will also become protonated to some extent to give its non-nucleophilic conjugate acid, H<sub>2</sub>Y<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. It is obviously important to identify conditions sufficiently acidic to protonate the carbonyl compound to an appropriate extent, but not so acidic that the nucleophile is completely protonated. Normally, these conditions are relatively easily achieved, e.g. by using buffered solutions of low acidity.</p></aside>

<p class="aside">Until relatively recently, it had been assumed that the tetrahedral intermediates implicated in many of the reactions of carbonyl compounds were so short-lived that they were not amenable to direct investigation.

<h3 class="h3">From aldehydes and ketones</h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Cyanohydrin formation.</i> When X &#x003D; hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl, and HY &#x003D; HCN in <a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>, the neutral tetrahedral product of addition is a cyanohydrin, an isolable compound, <a href="#eq_4.1">eqn 4.1.</a></p>

<img src="../images/eq_60_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Whilst formally this reaction is the base-catalysed addition of HCN, it is normally achieved experimentally by acidifying a solution of the aldehyde or ketone plus potassium cyanide. The acid protonates the anionic tetrahedral intermediate and allows the isolation of the cyanohydrin by driving the equilibrium across to the right hand side.</p></aside>


<p class="noindent"><i>Reduction by hydride.</i> The reduction of simple aldehydes and ketones by hydride or hydride donors (e.g. sodium borohydride) is closely related to the reaction of <a href="#eq_4.1">eqn 4.1</a>, but with important differences. Formation of cyanohydrins is normally achieved by having the carbonyl compound, <a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, Reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds</a>nucleophile, and acid in the reaction mixture together. However, the reaction is reversible and may be driven in either direction by appropriate choice of reaction conditions. In contrast, the proton donor (normally dilute aqueous acid) is added to a hydride reduction reaction in a subsequent workup step because the hydride anion and most hydride donors are unstable to acidic conditions. Furthermore, the conjugate bases of the primary and secondary alcohols formed in this reaction from aldehydes and ketones, respectively, are quite stable under the reaction conditions, so the process is not at all reversible.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">Mechanistically, the addition of organometallics such as Grignard reagents to aldehydes and ketones is very similar to these hydride reductions.</p>
</aside>

<p class="noindent"><i>Formation of hydrates, hemiacetals, and acetals.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The formation of hemiacetals from simple aldehydes and ketones may be catalysed by either acids or bases (the reaction is slow in the absence of catalysis). However, hemiacetals are usually unstable and, like hydrates, not generally isolable. The conversion of hemiacetals to acetals (strictly, not a reaction of a carbonyl compound, but sufficiently closely related and important to be included here) is catalysed by acids but not by bases. In <a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4,</a> we show the overall formation of acetals with acid catalysis.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">As implied by the reversible arrows, the reactions in <a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a> are wholly reversible, so the relative concentrations of the various components at equilibrium depend upon the initial reactant concentrations and the various equilibrium constants. The reaction can be driven in the forward direction (formation of the acetal) by carrying out the reaction in a non-aqueous solvent and selectively removing water (e.g. by azeotropic distillation). It may be reversed (liberation of an aldehyde or ketone from its acetal) by carrying out the reaction with a large excess of water. Since the formation of acetals from hemiacetals is not catalysed by bases, it follows that neither is their hydrolysis; acetals, therefore, are quite stable to aqueous hydrolytic conditions in the absence of an acid.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The preparation of acetals from aldehydes and ketones and their subsequent hydrolysis are a very important aspect of functional group protection in synthesis. For this purpose, a single diol such as ethane-1,2-diol is commonly used. Thiols, RSH, are much more nucleophilic than the corresponding alcohols, ROH, and thioacetals, (RS)<sub>2</sub>CR'R&#x0027;&#x0027;, may be prepared without acid catalysis.</p>

These moderately stable intermediates have a weakly acidic hydrogen on the nitrogen, and the tetrahedral carbon (which was originally the carbonyl) now bears a hydroxyl. An elimination reaction, i.e. a dehydration, becomes feasible as indicated. The overall process of addition-elimination in this context is usually called a condensation reaction (to give an oxime, an arylhydrazone, and a semicarbazone with the reagents mentioned above) and may lead to diastereoisomeric products. In practice, either the <i>E</i> or the Z isomer usually predominates, often to the exclusion of the other. As discussed above, the initial nucleophilic addition may be either acid or base catalysed and, in <a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> for the reaction of hydroxylamine with a ketone, this is not specified. The subsequent elimination reaction may also be acid or base catalysed and both possibilities are indicated; depending upon the pH of the reaction mixture (if the solution is aqueous), however, only one route will be followed in a particular reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">When X<sup>-</sup> is a nucleofuge, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by nucleophilic addition of an anion to a carboxylic acid derivative has available to it a reaction that is not available to the intermediate obtained from a simple aldehyde or ketone. Reaction may proceed in the forward direction from <a href="#page_63">(4.4)</a> in <a href="#fig_4.6">Fig. 4.6</a> by ejection of X<sup>-</sup>. Overall, this is substitution at the unsaturated carbon of the carbonyl; it may also be seen as the transfer of the acyl residue (a Lewis acid) from one Lewis base to another. Mechanistically, it is a two-step process involving nucleophilic addition then elimination of the nucleofuge.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Reduction by hydride donors.</i> Carboxylic acid derivatives may be reduced by hydride donors such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride (it is important to use an appropriate reagent for a particular substrate), but the reactions are a little more complex than those of simple aldehydes and ketones. If Y<sup>-</sup> &#x003D; H<sup>-</sup> in <a href="#fig_4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>, the initial step becomes irreversible because IT is a very poor nucleofuge. In principle, there remain the possibilities of ejection of X<sup>-</sup> to give an aldehyde, or protonation (following subsequent acidification). In most cases, the aldehyde is produced very readily. It then reacts further with more hydride donor (as discussed above), and the final product (after acidification) is the primary alcohol, <a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7.</a></p>

Under these conditions, the reaction is first order in ester and zero order in water since water is the solvent and hence at constant concentration (a small proportion of a cosolvent to ensure solubility would not significantly affect matters). As the acid and alcohol form, they are at such high dilution in the water that the reverse reaction to reform the ester is so slow that it may be ignored.</p>

 Other acyl transfer reactions and mechanisms</h2>


<h3 class="h3">via Tetrahedral intermediates</h3>

<p class="noindent">The A2 and B2 mechanisms for hydrolysis of esters presented earlier serve as models for other acyl transfer reactions such as those in <a href="#fig_4.14"> Fig. 4.14.</a> Whereas details will be different, for example, the relative heights of the two barriers which flank the tetrahedral intermediate, no new matters of principle are involved. A generalised reaction profile is shown in  <a href="#fig_4.15">Fig. 4.15 </a>where, again for the sake of simplicity, proton transfers have been left out.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In the first reaction of <a href="#fig_4.14"> Fig. 4.14</a>, chloride is a better nucleofuge than ethylamine, so &#x2021;2 will be lower than &#x2021;l in <a href="#fig_4.15"> Fig. 4.15</a>, and the forward reaction from the tetrahedral intermediate will be faster than the reverse of the first step. In contrast, hydroxide (poor as it is) is a better nucleofuge than amide in the second example of <a href="#fig_4.14"> Fig. 4.14</a>, so &#x2021; 1 will be lower than &#x2021;2 in <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds </a>  <a href="#fig_4.15">Fig. 4.15</a>, and the first step will be reversible in what is a very slow overall reaction.</p>

During this phase of the reaction, the arrangement of the bonds about the original carbonyl carbon changes, but the bond to the nucleofuge is not appreciably attenuated.

In the first step of this mechanism, the nucleofuge departs before the nucleophile begins to bond which corresponds to progress up the left-hand side of the map to form the acylium cationic intermediate at A.

<h3 class="h3">Concerted acyl transfers</h3>
<p class="noindent">The reaction map of <a href="#fig_4.16"> Fig. 4.16</a> also includes a very slightly curved diagonal across the centre; this corresponds to a single-step mechanism with unbonding of the nucleofuge concerted with bonding by the nucleophile.

Concerted acyl transfer with curvature of the diagonal towards the top left occurs in reactions with good nucleofuges, poor nucleophiles, and substituents stabilizing the acylium-like state. An example is the substituted benzoyl transfer between weakly basic anions shown in  <a href="#fig_4.18">Fig. 4.18</a> where Z and W are electron- withdrawing substituents, and Ar has electron-supplying ones.</p>

Nucleophilic addition versus a-proton abstraction</h2>


<p class="indent3-ka">Besides acting as nucleophiles, Lewis bases often have Brpnsted base properties. Consequently, if an organic compound has at least one hydrogen on a carbon alpha to a carbonyl as in (<a href="#page_72">4.14</a>) of <a href="#fig_4.19"> Fig. 4.19</a>, then proton abstraction competes with addition to the carbonyl. This chemoselectivity is an issue for reactions of aldehydes, ketones, esters, etc., and is affected by thermodynamic and kinetic factors. These include the acidity of the &#x03B1;-C-H of the reactant compared with that of XH and of the products (under the conditions of the reaction), the stability of the potential tetrahedral intermediate, and the reversibility of all the steps.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds </a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Steric as well as electronic factors may be important, for example <i>tert-</i> butoxide acts solely as a base and shows no nucleophilic tendencies, whereas methoxide and ethoxide are effective nucleophiles as well as bases. In contrast, hydroxylamine and hydrazine (and their derivatives) almost invariably act as nucleophiles even though they are moderately strong bases.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center"><b>Fig. 4.19 </b>Competition between nucleophilic addition and abstraction of an a-CH by a base</figcaption></figure>

<p class="noindent">The reaction in the following section illustrates some of the mechanistic complexities that can arise, and how knowledge of the p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> values of the species involved (and an appreciation of the principles of chemical equilibrium) allow the outcome to be understood.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Reaction of ethyl ethanoate with an alkoxide base</h3>

<p class="noindent">We have already seen that simple esters such as ethyl ethanoate react with aqueous hydroxide by the B2 mechanism leading to hydrolysis as a result of nucleophilic attack by HO<sup>-</sup> at the carbonyl group,  <a href="#fig_4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>. Abstraction of a proton from the methyl alpha to the carbonyl (p<i>k</i><sub>a</sub> ca. 24 in water) by HO<sup>-</sup> is not seriously competitive under these reaction conditions.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">However, with sodium ethoxide in ethanol, nucleophilic addition leads to a tetrahedral intermediate which can only regenerate starting material, and reaction via proton abstraction now becomes viable as shown in <a href="#fig_4.20">Fig. 4.20.</a> Nucleophilic addition of the conjugate base of ethyl ethanoate at the carbonyl of another molecule of ethyl ethanoate yields a tetrahedral intermediate which, upon ejection of an ethoxide anion, gives ethyl 3-oxobutanoate (ethyl acetoacetate). This compound now has four possibilities: nucleophilic addition of ethoxide at either of the two carbonyl groups, or further proton abstraction from either the methylene or the terminal methyl group. Nucleophilic addition to the keto carbonyl of ethyl acetoacetate is simply the reverse of the last step of the reaction whence it came, and addition to the ester carbonyl generates a tetrahedral intermediate which is equally unproductive since it can only regenerate ethyl acetoacetate. The methylene group is flanked by two carbonyl groups and hence is appreciably more acidic (p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> ca. 11) than the terminal methyl <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds </a>group which is adjacent to just a single carbonyl group, so proton abstraction from the methylene is the preferred reaction.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center"><b>Fig. 4.20</b> Reaction of ethyl ethanoate with ethoxide in ethanol &#x007B;followed by acidification&#x007D;</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Since ethyl acetoacetate is more acidic than ethanol (p<i>k</i><sub>a</sub> ca. 16), this final equilibration uses up the ethoxide which, consequently, has to be used at least in stoichiometric amount, i.e. the reaction is not catalytic. The reaction proceeds to give wholly the conjugate base of ethyl acetoacetate, the neutral product being generated only upon the subsequent acidification.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Haloform reactions</h3>

<p class="noindent">This reaction between a methyl ketone, concentrated alkali, and a halogen (most commonly iodine) illustrates well the competition between different electrophilic sites for reaction with hydroxide. It also provides a link between the reactions of acid derivatives on the one hand, and ketones and aldehydes on the other. So far, the bond to X in structure ( <a href="#page_58">4.1</a>) on<a href="#page_58"> p. 58 </a>has been either to hydrogen or carbon when X has not been a nucleofuge, or it has been to a heteroatom of a nucleofuge. We shall now see how, due to the particular molecular circumstances of the haloform reaction, we can have a nucleofuge bonded from carbon to a carbonyl.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The overall reaction is described by <a href="#eq_4.6">eqn 4.6</a> and a mechanism is shown in  <a href="#fig_4.21">Fig. 4.21</a> with the reactant (<a href="#page_74">4.15</a>) in the centre of the first line. We see to the right that the methyl ketone undergoes unproductive hydroxide addition to give (in low concentration) a tetrahedral species. In competition with this, it <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Reactions of nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds </a>also suffers proton abstraction to give the enolate shown to the left which then reacts with halogen to give the monohalomethyl ketone, (<a href="#page_74">4.16</a>)</p>

<p class="aside">The haloketones (<a href="#page_74">4.16</a>) and (<a href="#page_74">4.17</a>) also undergo nucleophilic addition of hydroxide in competition with proton abstraction, but these, like the corresponding reaction of ( <a href="#page_74">4.15</a>), are unproductive.</p></aside>



<p class="noindent">The single hydrogen on the carbon a to the carbonyl is now even more acidic, so the next enolate is generated which, in turn, reacts with more halogen, to give the trihalomethyl ketone, (<a href="#page_74">4.18</a>). The strongly electrophilic carbonyl group of (<a href="#page_74">4.18</a>) now suffers nucleophilic addition to give a relatively stable tetrahedral intermediate without competition from further deprotonation. This intermediate may now lose the trihalomethyl carbanion as nucleofuge which is made possible by the strong electron-attracting effects of the three halogen atoms assisted by the increasing steric effect of the CX<sub>3</sub> group along the series X &#x003D; Cl, Br, I. Upon departing, the carbanion is protonated by the solvent to yield the haloform, HCX<sub>3</sub>, and the carboxylic acid is rapidly deprotonated by the alkaline conditions to give RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>.</p>
