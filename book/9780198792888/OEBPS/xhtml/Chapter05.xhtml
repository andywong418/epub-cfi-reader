<p class="noindent">Elements of the <i>p</i>-block (<a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>) are those whose atoms have their last electron placed into a <i>p</i> subshell. They start with the Group 13 elements and conclude with the noble gas (Group 18) elements at which point the final electron completes the <i>p</i> level. Later sections in this chapter address trends in properties on moving down groups in the periodic table but it is appropriate here to consider trends on moving across the periodic table. For purposes of comparison of these horizontal trends, the <i>s</i>-block elements are included in the charts. The chemistry of the elements is dominated by electronic configuration. Each group in the periodic table has a group electronic configuration (<a href="#tab5.2">Table 5.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Trends across the periodic table</h2>
<p class="noindent">Some general periodic trends are outlined in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. The <i>p</i>-block elements to the bottom left are metallic (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.1">Section 2.1</a>) while those to the top right are non-metallic. A diagonal set of elements possess intermediate characteristics and are termed semi-metallic or metalloids (<a href="#tab5.1">Table 5.1</a>). Elements towards the top and right of the block are gases. Only bromine is a liquid at 25&#x00B0;C. The remainder are solids.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 5.2</b> Variation of first ionization energy (left) and electron affinity (right) for <i>s</i>- and <i>p</i>-block elements.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">The ionization energy is the energy change associated with formation of ions M<sup>+</sup> from gaseous atoms M. Large positive numbers mean it is difficult to remove the electron. As shown by the charted first ionization energy (<a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>), it becomes progressively more difficult to remove an electron from the <i>s</i>- and <i>p</i>-block elements on moving from left to right across the table. In this direction, the nuclear charge increases and while the valence electrons are screened from the full charge by whatever core electrons there are, the resulting <i>effective nuclear charge</i> also increases. When the effective positive charge is larger, the valence electrons are held more tightly and more closely to the nucleus. This makes it more difficult to remove electrons from the atom. The plot in <a href="#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a> also shows a trend for ionization energy to <i>decrease</i> on moving <i>down</i> the group. The valence orbitals are larger for the heavier elements and so electrons located within them are further away from the nucleus. They are also screened from the nucleus by the inner electrons and this means they are held less tightly and so are easier to remove.</p>
<p class="indent">The three-dimensional plot is very effective for seeing gross trends but a conventional plot reveals &#x2018;irregularities&#x2019; more clearly (<a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). This plot shows that the trend is not a smooth curve. Values for the Group 13 elements are lower than might have been expected, as are the values for the Group 16 elements. The group electronic configuration of the Group 13 elements is <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>1</sup>. The outermost electron is in a <i>p</i> orbital and on average is further away from the nucleus than the <i>s</i> electrons. The <i>s</i> electrons also screen the <i>p</i> electron from the nucleus. The effect is that it is relatively a little easier to remove the <i>p</i> electron from an atom with an <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>1</sup> configuration than from an atom with the <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup> configuration. A different argument is used to account for the dip at the Group 16 elements. Here the group electronic configuration is <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>4</sup>. In these cases the final electron is located in an orbital that <i>already contains</i> an electron. This results in electron&#x2013;electron repulsion in that <i>p</i> orbital. The effect of this repulsion is easier removal of that last electron.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">For similar reasons, the tendency for the atoms to attract electrons to form anions increases across the table (<a href="#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). This means that the chemistry of elements to the right is dominated by tendencies to gain an electron and acquire a negative oxidation state rather than to lose an electron. This tendency declines towards the left and down the groups where positive oxidation states are more important. The electron affinity of the Group 15 element is very low &#x2014; meaning that compared to the Groups 14 and 16 to either side, it is more difficult to form M<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions. The group electronic configuration for Group 15 is <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>3</sup>. Gain of an electron to form M<sup>&#x2212;</sup> gives ions with the configuration <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>4</sup>. The fourth <i>p</i> electron is required to enter into a <i>p</i>-orbital that already contains an electron. There is an energy penalty to pay, however, since the two electrons mutually repel. This results in a much lower electron affinity.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ionic size</h2>
<p class="noindent">In many instances, elements from the left of the periodic table form ionic compounds with anions of the Group 16 and 17 elements. The Pauling ionic radii are illustrated in <a href="#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a> and show that the size of the Group 16 X<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ion is about the same size as the adjacent Group 17 X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ion. The ions get larger on descending the group because of orbital size and inner electron screening (see <a href="#sec_5.1">Section 5.1</a>). These trends in size have ramifications for the structures of, for instance, the Group 1 halides, where the relative sizes of the anions and cations determine the solid state structure.</p>

Those of the Period 3 and 6 elements are shown in <a href="#tab5.4">Tables 5.4</a> and <a href="#tab5.5">5.5</a>. For Period 2 fluorides, the Group 14&#x2013;18 elements are covalent and follow the octet rule. The Group 13 fluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, is covalent but boron has only six electrons in its outer shell (three from boron and one from each of the three fluorides). The fluorides of Group 1 and 2 elements are ionic lattices (indicated by the high melting<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, p-Block elements</a> points in <a href="#tab5.6">Table 5.6</a>) with each ion possessing a stable noble gas electron structure &#x2014; the fluoride always possesses the electron configuration of the <i>next</i> noble gas (Ne) while the cation always displays that of the <i>previous</i> noble gas (He).

<p class="noindent">The graph of boiling points of the <i>p</i>-block element hydrides (<a href="#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>) shows that the boiling points of the period 2 hydrides of the Groups 15, 16, and 17 are higher than might have been expected. This is just as well, as it means<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, p-Block elements</a> that water is normally liquid rather than a gas, allowing life as we know it to occur. These apparently anomalous boiling points are a consequence of hydrogen bonding. In water, electronegativity differences between the two elements mean that the O&#x2014;H bonds are polarized so that the hydrogen possesses a slight positive charge and the oxygen is somewhat negatively charged. These partial charges are such that there are significant interactions between the partial charges upon adjacent molecules. Similar arguments may be used to explain the high values for the boiling points of NH<sub>3</sub> and HF.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is necessary to know the most favourable arrangement for any given number of electron sets surrounding any particular atom. These arrangements are found using simple geometrical constructions. This involves placing the nucleus of the atom in question at the centre of a sphere and then placing the electron pairs on the surface of the sphere so that they <i>are as far apart as possible</i>. The resulting arrangements are often intuitively obvious (<a href="#tab5.7">Table 5.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For the case of just two electron pairs (<a href="#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>) the arrangement is simple and the minimum energy configuration is when the electron pairs form a linear arrangement with the nucleus. In this configuration the electron pair&#x2013;nucleus&#x2013;electron pair angle is 180&#x00B0;. The coordination geometry of the central atom is described as <i>linear</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Three electron pairs arrange themselves <i>trigonally</i>, that is, with bond angles of 120&#x00B0;. For four electron pairs, one might expect the square-planar geometry to be favourable. However, tetrahedral bond angles are 109.5&#x00B0;, larger than the square-planar angles of 90&#x00B0;. The electron pairs are further apart in the tetrahedral arrangement than in a square&#x2013;planar arrangement. There is more electron pair&#x2013;electron pair repulsion in the square-planar geometry and so the <i>tetrahedral</i> geometry is favoured.</p>

<p class="noindent2">There are two environments in a trigonal bipyramid, axial and equatorial. These two environments are chemically distinct.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Five coordination is a little trickier. Most molecules whose shape is determined by five electron pairs are <i>trigonal bipyramidal</i>. There is another very reasonable candidate structure, and that is the square-based pyramid. In effect, this arrangement is an octahedron in which one group is removed and in which the four adjacent groups move down slightly to occupy partially the resulting vacancy. In practice, this geometry is only a little disfavoured relative to the trigonal bipyramid.</p>
<p class="indent">For six-coordinate systems, the <i>octahedral</i> geometry is by far the most important. An alternative geometry, the trigonal prism, is uncommon.</p>
<p class="indent">A Lewis single bond is always regarded as a <i>a</i> bond. Recall that Lewis dot structures allow double and triple bonds between some elements. For VSEPR calculation purposes, a double bond is always regarded as a &#x03C3;+ &#x03C0; bond interaction, while a triple bond is always treated as a &#x03C3; + 2&#x03C0; bond interaction. Double and triple bonds are treated as single sets of electrons and still <i>only occupy one coordination vertex</i>. The shape of a molecule is therefore dictated by the <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond framework. Each vertex of the coordination polyhedron is necessarily occupied by a &#x03C3; bond (possibly supported by &#x03C0; bonds) or a lone pair of <i>&#x03C3;</i> symmetry, otherwise the vertex would not exist. The determination of a molecule&#x2019;s geometry therefore reduces to a calculation of the number of electrons contained in the &#x03C3; orbitals. Electrons in &#x03C0; bonds must therefore be recognized and care taken not to confuse them with <i>&#x03C3;</i> bond electrons. The following procedure, which is not unique, works well. The examples which follow will make the procedure clear.</p>

<p class="indent">A statement of rules always seems more imposing than their actual operation. It is therefore appropriate to examine some sample calculations. The calculation for methane shows that the carbon atom is associated with 8 electrons in the &#x03C3; framework. This corresponds to four shape-determining electron pairs. The coordination geometry of carbon is consequently tetrahedral. There are four bonded groups, therefore there are no lone pairs.</p>

There are<a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, p-Block elements</a> three bonded groups, therefore there is one lone pair. Although lone pairs help determine shape, they are not described normally as part of the shape. So, the <i>shape</i> of ammonia is <i>pyramidal</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">In a bonding pair of electrons, the two electrons are located between two nuclei, and are attracted by both. A lone pair is different. It is necessarily only attracted to one nucleus and the consequence is that it adopts a position effectively <i>closer</i> to that one nucleus than the bonding pairs of electrons. The effect is for the lone pair to repel other electrons around the central atom more strongly. This means that the effective solid angle occupied by a lone pair is <i>greater</i> than that occupied by a bond pair. Lone pairs demand greater angular room, and are located closer to their atoms than bond pairs. The consequence of this for ammonia is that the lone pair makes room for itself by pushing the three hydrogen atoms together a little and the H&#x2014;N&#x2014;H bond angles are slightly less (106.6&#x00B0;) than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5&#x00B0;.</p>
<p class="indent">Water has four electron pairs and the <i>coordination geometry</i> of oxygen is based upon a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs. Since there are only two bonded groups, there are two lone pairs. Since the lone pairs are not included in the description, the <i>shape</i> of water is bent.

<p class="indent">Boron trifluoride only has six valence electrons and is one of the relatively rare second period covalent molecules that disobeys the octet rule.

It is interesting to compare this to the structure of nitrogen<a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, p-Block elements</a> dioxide, NO<sub>2</sub>. The shape of nitrogen dioxide is determined by one less electron than that of SO<sub>2</sub> and instead of a lone pair there is a lone electron (in effect, half a lone pair).

<p class="indent">Boron exists as a number of complex allotropie forms. For instance, &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-rhombohedral boron contain B<sub>12</sub> icosahedra linked through B&#x2014;B interactions. The most common mineral source of boron is the aluminosilicate tourmaline. Aluminium is a structurally useful metal that would normally be highly reactive. However, aluminium surfaces are normally protected by an inert oxide layer. Coloured aluminium surfaces are possible through the addition of pigments within the oxide layer. Aluminium is mined in huge scales as bauxite (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x00B7;2H<sub>2</sub>O). Bauxite contains Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> impurities. In order to provide pure aluminium, these impurities must be<a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, p-Block elements</a> removed from the bauxite. This is done by treatment with sodium hydroxide solution, which results in a solution of sodium aluminate and sodium silicate. The iron remains behind as a solid. When CO<sub>2</sub> is blown through the resulting solution, the sodium silicate stays in solution while the aluminium is precipitated out as aluminium hydroxide. The hydroxide can be filtered off, washed, and heated to form pure alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Pure aluminium is obtained from the pure Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by an electrolytic method, necessary as aluminium is rather electropositive.</p>

<p class="indent">All the elements other than boron form M<sup>3+</sup> ions and all form covalent bonds in various MX<sub>3</sub> molecules. The electron count in molecules such as BF<sub>3</sub> and AlCl<sub>3</sub> is only six, meaning the octet structure is not achieved. The chemistries of such species are dominated by their tendencies to acquire an extra pair of electrons to achieve that octet structure. In BF<sub>3</sub>, the boron is trigonal (<a href="#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>), as predicted by VSEPR methods. Each of the three B&#x2014;F &#x03C3; bonds contains two electrons, six in total. Three of these originate from boron, and one each from the three fluorine atoms. Boron has a <i>vacant p</i> orbital lying out of the plane of the molecule. This orbital interacts with the electron density from the fluorine lone pairs and in effect the fluorine atoms form slight dative interactions into the vacant <i>p</i> orbital. This means that the effective bond order between boron and each fluorine atom is a little greater than 1, accounting for the rather short B&#x2014;F bonds actually observed.</p>

<p class="indent">The vapour phase structure of AlCl<sub>3</sub> is interesting. The electron count for aluminium in AlCl<sub>3</sub> is six, two short of an octet. This makes aluminium in AlCl<sub>3</sub> inclined to accept an electron pair, in other words to behave as a Lewis acid. There are plenty of electron pairs on the chlorine atoms and aluminium achieves the octet count by accepting an electron pair from a neighbouring AlCl<sub>3</sub>. In turn, the first AlCl<sub>3</sub> group donates an electron pair to the second aluminium atom. The resulting dimer (<a href="#fig5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>) has two chlorine bridges.</p>

In corundum, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> lattice (<a href="#fig5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>) may be regarded<a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, p-Block elements</a> as ionic, that is, consisting of Al<sup>3+</sup> and O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions. In support of this notion, molten alumina conducts electricity. However, the oxide ions are distorted by the small, highly charged aluminium tri-cations resulting in a flow of electron density back towards the cations. In effect, this is a covalent contribution. Very crystalline samples of corundum are clear and if there are traces of <i>d</i>-block cations such as iron or titanium present as impurities, the result is the gemstone blue sapphire.

<p class="indent">The most common form of pure carbon is graphite. Diamond is a second form (allotrope) of carbon but is much less common. Graphite possesses a layer structure (<a href="#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>) in which each carbon is directly bound to three other carbon atoms. Derealization in the bonding is evident since the C&#x2014;C distances are equal and shorter than normal single bonds. There are two forms of graphite related by the way the layers stack upon each other. &#x2018;Amorphous&#x2019; forms of carbon such as soot and lampblack are materials consisting of very small particles of graphite.</p>
<p class="indent">Diamond is a slightly more compact structure, hence its greater density. The appearance of diamond is well known and it is also one of the hardest materials known. Like graphite, it is relatively unreactive but does burn in air at 600&#x2013;800&#x00B0;C. Each carbon atom is bound to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion and so each diamond crystal is a single giant lattice structure. In principle (and in practice!) graphite may be converted into diamond by the application of heat and pressure.</p>

Nitrous oxide is a gas and is relatively unreactive. It is known for its anaesthetic properties (&#x2018;laughing gas&#x2019;). Nitric oxide is formed in many reactions, including those involving dissolution of metals in concentrated nitric acid.</p>

<p class="indent">Nitric oxide possesses an odd number of electrons [N (5) + O (6) = NO (11)]. It is therefore <i>paramagnetic</i>. The odd electron is removed quite easily and the resulting nitrosonium ion (NO<sup>+</sup>) is well known, in particular for its ability to coordinate as a ligand to <i>d</i>-block elements. Nitric oxide reacts very easily with oxygen to form the well-known brown nitrogen dioxide, NO<sub>2</sub>. Nitrogen dioxide also has an odd number of electrons and is also, therefore, paramagnetic. In this case, two molecules of NO<sub>2</sub> combine through pairing of the odd electron to form colouress N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">This contains no unpaired electrons and is therefore diamagnetic. Nitrogen dioxide and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are present in temperature&#x2013;dependent equilibrium. On cooling to the solid, the equilibrium lies completely towards N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

<p class="indent">The most important phosphorus oxide is P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> (phosphorus(V) oxide, referred to as phosphorus pentoxide, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, in older literature). This consists of discrete tetrahedral molecules (<a href="#fig5.17">Fig. 5.17</a>). Each edge of the tetrahedron consists of POP links and each P atom is also bonded to another oxygen atom. A related molecule P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, phosphorus(III) oxide, is also known but does not contain the terminal oxygen atoms. The compound P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> is an excellent drying agent, even to the extent of removal of H<sub>2</sub>O from sulphuric acid to form SO<sub>3</sub>. Hydration of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> results in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, orthophosphoric acid, or just phosphoric acid. This is an important acid and is commonly available as a syrupy 85% pure form containing some water. Phosphoric acid is <i>tribasic</i>, and phosphates containing tetrahedral phosphate ions, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x2212;</sup>, are well known and important. Ammonium phosphate is an important fertilizer for example.</p>

<p class="indent">Oxygen as O<sub>2</sub> (dioxygen) makes up about a fifth of the atmosphere and is<a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, p-Block elements</a> fundamental to life. Dissolved oxygen is also abundant in water. Most of this oxygen is biological in origin, specifically from the photosynthetic transformation of water into oxygen by green plants. Most oxygen for laboratory use is obtained through the liquefaction of air and is supplied in cylinders under pressure. On a small scale, oxygen can be generated by the thermal decomposition of potassium chlorate (<a href="#eq5.5">Eqn 5.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Oxygen is diatomic with a formal double bond connecting the two atoms. The Lewis representation shows that the double bond is required to allow an octet of electrons to form at each atom but suggests that O<sub>2</sub> should not contain any unpaired electrons (compounds containing no unpaired electrons are referred to as diamagnetic). In fact, O<sub>2</sub> is <i>paramagnetic</i>, that is, it contains unpaired electrons. More sophisticated views of the bonding than the Lewis model successfully account for this phenomenon. Liquefied and solid oxygen are both pale blue.</p>
<p class="indent">A second form <i>(allotrope</i>) of oxygen is called <i>ozone</i> and has the formula O<sub>3</sub>. Ozone is paramagnetic and is blue when in a liquid form. Pure ozone is explosive. The solid is violet&#x2013;black. While ozone is toxic, it is important in the upper atmosphere as the ozone layer. The ozone layer has a role in the absorption of harmful ultraviolet wavelengths (220&#x2013;290 nm) and there is currently great concern about emerging &#x2018;holes&#x2019; in the ozone layer over the poles which seem to lead to increases in skin cancer rates. In part, the holes in the ozone layer are caused by release of refrigerants and aerosol propellants such as CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and CFCl<sub>3</sub> into the atmosphere, and by nitrogen oxides from engine exhausts. Once in the upper atmosphere these result in radicals such as Cl<sup>&#x2022;</sup> which can catalyse ozone decomposition (<a href="#eq5.6">Eqns 5.6</a>&#x2013;<a href="#eq5.7">5.7</a>) &#x2013; the <sup>&#x2022;</sup>O<sup>&#x2022;</sup> radical is produced through photodissociation of dioxygen.</p>

<p class="indent">Sulphur is found in nature as the free element and in ores. It is an important and undesirable impurity in coal and crude oils from which it should be removed. Elemental sulphur exists as a number of allotropes, in particular various forms of S<sub>8</sub>, although larger rings such as S<sub>12</sub>, S<sub>20</sub>, etc. are known (<a href="#fig5.19">Fig. 5.19</a>). Selenium and tellurium are usually impurities in sulphur ores while there are no known stable isotopes of polonium. As always, the trend towards metallic properties increases down the group and polonium can safely be regarded as metallic. For example, the oxide PoO<sub>2</sub> is ionic and reacts with HCl to form PoCl<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxygen, as implied by its name, is a good oxidizing agent and oxides of nearly all the elements are known. Sulphur dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, and sulphur trioxide, SO<sub>3</sub>, are particularly important. The former is a pollutant produced through burning sulphur-containing fuels such as coal and some oils. Once in <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, p-Block elements</a>the air it reacts with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, which dissolves in clouds, causing acid rain. Acid rain is a major political issue and while technology exists to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, its use is far from universal. Sulphur dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, reacts with oxygen under the influence of a catalyst such as platinum or V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, to form SO<sub>3</sub>. In industrial plants the SO<sub>3</sub> is absorbed into 98% sulphuric acid to form fuming sulphuric acid, oleum, which is then diluted back with water to form pure sulphuric acid. This is safer than the direct reaction of SO<sub>3</sub> with water since that reaction is too exothermic for convenience. Sulphuric acid is the chemical produced in greatest tonnage every year around the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Whereas the binary hydrogen oxide H<sub>2</sub>O, water, is obligatory for life on this planet, the corresponding sulphur compound, H<sub>2</sub>S, is not. Indeed, the foul smelling dihydrogen sulphide is more toxic than hydrogen cyanide, HCN. The H&#x2014;O&#x2014;H bond angle is 104.5&#x00B0;, that is, slightly closed from the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5&#x00B0; as a result of repulsive effects of the lone pairs. However, the corresponding angles for the lower analogues approach 90&#x00B0; (H&#x2014;S&#x2014;H, 92&#x00B0;, H&#x2014;Se&#x2014;H, 91&#x00B0;, and H&#x2014;Te&#x2014;H, 90&#x00B0;). The closeness of these values to 90&#x00B0; is not treated satisfactorily by simple VSEPR rules but can be rationalized in the same way as the corresponding values for the group 15 elements (<a href="#sec_5.8">Section 5.8</a>). The thermal stability of the compounds decreases down the group as the bond energies decrease. The graph of boiling points for H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>Te shows the expected increase on going down the group, with the clear exception that the boiling point of water is far higher than might have been expected. This is fortunate as it means that liquid water is available at temperatures convenient for life. The origin of this phenomenon is hydrogen bonding (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The graphs in <a href="#fig5.18">Fig. 5.18</a> show that oxygen is quite distinct from the lower elements, and that the properties of the lower elements are somewhat similar to each other. The decreasing electronegativity down the group implies that the lower elements are less likely to form ionic compounds. Higher oxidation states and higher coordination numbers are evident down the group. This &#x2018;octet expansion&#x2019; after period 2 allows for the existence of species such as SF<sub>6</sub> and SF<sub>4</sub>O.</p>

<p class="indent">Bromine also occurs in seawater as the sodium salt but in much smaller quantities than chloride. It is recoverable through the treatment of seawater with chlorine gas and flushing through with air. The principle of oxidation of bromide to bromine is shown by the addition of a little chlorine water to aqueous solutions of bromide. These become brown as elemental bromine forms. It is a corrosive, volatile dark-red mobile liquid at room temperature. Bromine is reasonably soluble in water and very soluble in a number of organic solvents.</p>
<p class="indent">Iodine also occurs in seawater and some marine life concentrates iodine. It also may be isolated by oxidation. It is a nearly black crystalline solid which must be stored in a sealed vessel as it sublimes at room temperature to give a characteristic corrosive violet vapour. While slightly soluble in water it is quite soluble in some organic solvents. Solutions in alcohol <i>(tincture of iodine</i>) are antiseptic and so useful for minor cut and grazes.</p>
<p class="indent">The halogens are all a single electron short of filled valence electron configurations and the tendency for them to acquire that electron dominates their chemistry. This is done either by acquisition of an electron to form the anion <i>X</i><sup>-</sup> or through formation of a single covalent bond. All the halogens are highly electronegative &#x2014; fluorine the most so (<a href="#fig5.21">Fig. 5.21</a>). Fluorine itself is particularly reactive. This is because of the weakness of the F&#x2014;F bond (<a href="#fig5.21">Fig. 5.21</a>) and the strength of M&#x2014;F bonds. The weakness of the F&#x2014;F bond is connected with lone pair-lone pair repulsions between the adjacent atoms in difluorine.</p>
<p class="indent">Most halide salts are soluble in water, those of Pb(II) and Ag(I) are exceptions. Thus halide ions in water may be tested for by the addition of a little aqueous silver nitrate. This gives white to yellow (AgCl is white, AgBr is cream, and Agi is yellow) precipitates except in the case of fluoride. All four halide ions precipitate with Pb(II).</p>
<p class="indent">Silver bromide is important in black and white photography and is a component of the film. Silver bromide decomposes to silver on exposure to light. Little light is required as the silver atoms produced induce the formation of many more silver atoms. Part of the development process involves treatment <i>(fixing</i>) with silver thiosulphate <i>(hypo</i>). This results in the removal of excess AgBr as the soluble ion [Ag(S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>. The remaining silver stains the film producing the negative.</p>
<p class="indent">Most elements in the periodic table form halides. Those of hydrogen are particularly important. Halides vary in nature from highly ionic (the Group 1 halides are a good example (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>) to strikingly covalent compounds such as CC1<sub>4</sub>. In general, the highest possible formal oxidation states of the elements are displayed by the fluorides. Examples include PtF<sub>6</sub> and UF<sub>6</sub>. The latter is enormously important. Despite the formal oxidation number of +6, it is highly covalent. It melts at about 64&#x00B0;C and has a vapour pressure of about 115 mm at room temperature. As such, the hexafluoride is used in gas diffusion processes to separate uranium isotopes.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Group 18 elements are often referred to as <i>noble gases</i>. They exist as monoatomic molecules and are found uncombined in nature. The group electronic configuration is <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup><i>np</i><sup>6</sup> meaning that the valence shell is closed. While helium (2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) does not have any <i>p</i> electrons, its valence shell is also closed and most commonly used periodic tables place helium above neon in Group 18.

<p class="indent">The Group 18 gases are trace components in the atmosphere and neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are all isolated through fractionation of liquid air. While helium does occur in the atmosphere, helium is obtained commercially from some natural gas wells, particularly in the USA. Concentrations can be up to 5-7%. It is likely that the origin of the helium in these gases is through the decay of radioactive elements in rocks. All isotopes of radon are radioactive and there is concern in some areas of the world where poor ventilation in homes results in build-up of radon gas (which comes from the rocks upon which the homes are built).</p>
<p class="indent">The elements are all colourless. The boiling points of these elements increase smoothly down the group (<a href="#fig5.22">Fig. 5.22</a>). Helium is unique in that it has no triple point &#x2014; that is, there is no single combination of temperature and pressure at which the solid, the liquid, and the gas all exist. At around 2 K, helium undergoes a transition to a form of helium labelled He<sub>II</sub>. This form of helium has strange properties, including the ability to form films only a few hundred atoms thick that flow apparently without friction, even up the sides of a vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">The gases are used to fill electric light-bulbs with various interesting colours. In addition they are used to provide inert gases for welding. Argon is used quite commonly as an inert atmosphere under which to carry out sensitive reactions in the laboratory and there is now interest in the use of the liquefied gases as solvents for specialized reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">The Group 18 elements have limited reactivity &#x2014; indeed, the origin of the <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, p-Block elements</a>term noble gases is linked to their apparent lack of reactivity. What chemistry there is, however, is interesting and largely concerns xenon.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxygen is known to react with PtF<sub>6</sub> to form an orange salt [O<sub>2</sub>][PtF<sub>6</sub>]. This material contains discrete O<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> cations. The tendency for xenon gas to ionize is about the same as dioxygen and indeed xenon gas does react with PtF<sub>6</sub>, although the reaction is complicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Most xenon chemistry is associated with the fluorides and oxyfluorides (<a href="#fig5.23">Fig. 5.23</a>). The difluoride and tetrafluoride are both available through the reaction of xenon with fluorine at high pressure. The hexafluoride is also available directly but requires very forcing conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The shapes of these xenon compounds are successfully predicted by simple VSEPR models. Thus, the &#x03C3;-framework of XeF<sub>2</sub> is determined by ten electrons, meaning that it is trigonal bipyramidal. On paper a number of isomers are possible but that which minimizes the electron pair&#x2013;electron pair interactions has the two fluorines in the axial positions, making the molecule linear. The tetrafluoride is square planar. The case of XeF<sub>6</sub> is more interesting. Its shape is determined by seven pairs of electrons. Experimental results indicate that the solid state structure is very complex and distorted.</p>
<p class="indent">The fluorides XeF<sub>4</sub> and XeF<sub>6</sub> both react with water to form the explosive trioxide XeO<sub>3</sub>. This dangerous property explains why only skilled chemists attempt to work with xenon fluorides, since even trace amounts of water can lead to XeO<sub>3</sub>. This compound is pyramidal and the xenon has a directional lone pair. Very careful and controlled reaction of XeF<sub>6</sub> with water results in the oxofluoride XeF<sub>4</sub>0 (<a href="#eq5.12">Eqn 5.12</a>). This material reacts with XeO<sub>3</sub> to form the dioxide XeF<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#eq5.13">Eqn 5.13</a>).</p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq5.12">XeF<sub>6</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2192; XeF<sub>4</sub>O + 2HF <span style="margin-left:5em;">(5.12)</span></p>

<p class="indent">Again, the shapes of these two compounds are predicted successfully by applying VSEPR rules. They have shapes dictated by six and five electron pairs respectively. The compound XeF<sub>4</sub>O has one lone pair and its shape is therefore square-based pyramidal while the geometry of xenon in XeF<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is trigonal bipyramidal with equatorial oxide ligands and lone pair.</p>
<p class="indent">The hexafluoride XeF<sub>6</sub> is a fluoride ion acceptor. Thus CsF reacts to form the heptafluoroxenate and upon gentle warming this material converts into the remarkably stable octafluoroxenate Cs<sub>2</sub>[XeF<sub>8</sub>] (<a href="#eq5.14">Eqn 5.14</a>).</p>
