<h1 class="main">6<span class="space">&#160;</span><i>d</i>-Block elements</h1>
<p class="noindent">The term <i>d-block elements</i> refers to the 30 elements contained in the 10 columns (3-12) in the periodic table (inside back cover). It is also a convenient term since it includes the elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury, some properties of which it is logically appropriate to include in a discussion of transition metal chemistry. The term <i>transition metal</i> is normally associated with those elements that possess a <i>d</i> sublevel that is partially filled with electrons in either its atom or a common oxidation state. As <a href="#tab6.1">Table 6.1</a> shows, by this definition zinc is not a transition element and both scandium and copper just scrape in by virtue of one configuration each.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.1">
<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Variable oxidation state</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although <i>d</i>-block metals are similar in many ways to those of the <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> blocks they have a much greater tendency to display variable oxidation states. As an example, there are four vanadium fluorides: VF<sub>2</sub> (blue), VF<sub>3</sub> (yellow-green), VF<sub>4</sub> (lime green), and VF<sub>5</sub> (colourless). <a href="#tab6.1">Table 6.1</a> shows the electron configuration of each element in the first row of the <i>d</i> block together with its common oxidation states.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig6.1">Figure 6.1</a> shows that successive ionization energies for metals in the <i>s</i> and <i>P</i>-blocks generally show a large jump when a noble gas electron configuration is disturbed and this determines the oxidation state of the metal in simple ionic compounds. For a <i>d</i>-block metal such as vanadium, however, after the 4<i>s</i> electrons have been lost, some, or all, of the 3<i>d</i> electrons may usually be removed successively without a sudden jump in ionization energy.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">The connection between coloured compounds and a partially filled <i>d</i> sub-level can be explored by comparing the energy changes involved in forming the anhydrous chlorides: CoCl<sub>2</sub>, which is blue (3<i>d</i><sup>7</sup>), and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, which is <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, d-Block elements</a>colourless (3<i>d</i><sup>10</sup>). There is little indication of any difference from a comparison of the Born&#x2013;Haber cycles for the formation of the compounds (<a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). Each chloride is energetically more stable than its elements thanks largely to a very exothermic lattice energy resulting from the strong attraction between the M<sup>2+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the crystal. To begin to account for the blue colour of cobalt chloride we must also consider the mutual repulsion of electrons on the metal and halide ions as they approach each other to form the lattice.</p>
<p class="indent">If a Co<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion is in the gas phase, all five of the <i>d</i> orbitals are at exactly the same energy and it does not matter along which directions the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> axes lie. The five <i>d</i>-orbital functions are arranged in space with respect to each other as shown in <a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>. There is no energy advantage in an electron occupying any particular orbital. In effect, although the <i>d</i> orbitals are normally labelled according to the cartesian (<i>xyz</i>) coordinate system, the isolated ion has no sense of direction.</p>
<p class="indent">However, when the lattice forms, the <i>d</i> electrons on the cation suffer repulsion from the electrons on the surrounding anions. The electrons in the <i>d</i> orbitals now arrange themselves in space so as to minimize this repulsion. This is done so far as possible by the electrons arranging themselves not to point directly towards the anions. They tend to occupy regions of space orientated between the anions. The orientation of the d-orbital system will depend upon the geometry of the surrounding anions in the lattice and in this case the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> directions are defined so that the anions lie on the coordinate axes.</p>
<p class="indent">In the cobalt(II) chloride lattice (<a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>), each Co<sup>2+</sup> ion is at the centre of an octahedral arrangement of six Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. The <i>d</i> orbitals are arranged so that the <i>d</i><sub>z<sup>2</sup></sub> and <i>d</i><sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub>-<sub>y<sup>2</sup></sub> orbitals on the metal ion point directly at the Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, with the remaining <i>d<sub>xy</sub></i>, <i>d<sub>xz</sub></i> and <i>d</i> orbitals each pointing between the anions. The d orbitals are now no longer at the same energy, since electrons occupying</p>

<p class="noindent">orbitals pointing directly at the chloride ions will suffer greater repulsion than those in the other set of orbitals. In cobalt(II) chloride, the difference in energy between the two sets of <i>d</i> orbitals, referred to as the octahedral <i>crystal field splitting energy</i>, &#x2206;<sub>o</sub>, is less than the energy required to overcome the repulsion between electrons occupying the same orbital, so the ground state electronic arrangement of the d electrons will be as shown in <a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Cobalt(II) chloride absorbs visible light towards the red end of the spectrum. Light at that wavelength possesses the correct energy to promote an electron from the <i>lower</i> to the <i>higher</i> energy set of <i>d</i> orbitals. Light from the blue end of the visible spectrum is not absorbed and it is this unabsorbed <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, d-Block elements</a>light that accounts for the observed colour of cobalt(II) chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>d</i> orbitals in zinc chloride also suffer crystal field splitting. However, since all the orbitals are fully occupied, no promotion from the lower set of <i>d</i> orbitals to the higher is possible and so this compound does not absorb visible light.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Aqua complexes: dissolving a metal compound in water</h2>
<p class="noindent">Both cobalt(II) chloride and zinc chloride dissolve exothermically in water. Since water molecules are polar, they are strongly attracted to the ions and the combined energy released by these hydration processes is more than sufficient to overcome the attraction between the ions in the lattice (<a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As might be expected from the previous section, zinc chloride solution is colourless. However, although dilute aqueous cobalt(II) chloride is coloured, it is <i>pink</i> and not <i>blue</i> like the anhydrous solid. The reason for this lies in the change in the environment of the Co<sup>2+</sup> ions upon dissolving. The chloride ions surrounding the cobalt ion in the solid lattice are replaced by water molecules.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<img src="../images/page75-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The arrangement of attached atoms around the Co(II) is still octahedral but the water molecules produce a larger crystal field splitting energy so absorbing light of higher quantum energy towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from the red end of the visible spectrum is not absorbed, leading to the observed pink colour of the solution.</p>
<p class="indent">All <i>d</i>-block metal ions are hydrated in aqueous solution but usually the resulting species will not be coloured unless it possesses a partially filled <i>d</i> sublevel. The central metal ion will attract a lone pair of electrons from each of the water molecules to some extent and so the bonding between them may be regarded as somewhere between simple electrostatic attraction and coordinate covalent (<a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">When the oxidation state of the metal ion is higher than +3, the attraction for electrons on coordinated water molecules is so strong that <i>both</i> the hydrogen atoms may be lost. Thus, manganese(VII) in aqueous solution forms manganate(VII), [MnO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> (or permanganate). Although, nominally, the manganese in manganese(VII) has no <i>d</i> electrons, the complex [MnO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> is intensely purple. In this case, absorption of visible light causes electrons to jump from filled orbitals on the oxo ligands into empty orbitals on the central metal. Such <i>charge-transfer</i> mechanisms are also responsible for the colour of other species containing <i>d</i>-block metals in a high oxidation state, including chromate(VI) and dichromate(VI) (<a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hexa-aqua complexes also undergo characteristic reactions with other bases. As an example, addition of sodium hydroxide solution to [M(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+/3+</sup>(aq) always first produces a precipitate. Formation of a precipitate in this way is a good indicator of the formation of an electrically neutral species. The precipitate is formed by losing an H<sup>+</sup> from the required number of coordinated water molecules (<a href="#eq6.1">Eqns 6.1</a> and <a href="#eq6.2">6.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Addition of acid shifts the equilibrium to the left, and the precipitate, acting as a base, accepts H<sup>+</sup>. It redissolves to form the hexa-aqua complex.</p>
<p class="indent">In a few cases, including Cr(III) and Zn(II), addition of excess sodium hydroxide solution also dissolves the initial precipitate by removing further H<sup>+</sup> ions to form an <i>anionic</i> complex (<a href="#eq6.3">Eqn 6.3</a>). Substances like [Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] that can both accept and donate H<sup>+</sup> are referred to as <i>ambiprotic</i> (or <i>amphoteric</i>).</p>

However, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> is a much weaker base than OH<sup>-</sup> and only undergoes this reaction with moderately strong acids. Addition of sodium carbonate solution therefore gives a precipitate of the neutral hydroxo complex with M<sup>3+</sup>(aq) that is insoluble in excess of the reagent (<a href="#eq6.5">Eqn 6.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Initially, at least, dilute ammonia solution reacts in exactly the same way as sodium hydroxide, giving a precipitate of the electrically neutral hydroxide with both M<sup>2+</sup>(aq) and M<sup>3+</sup>(aq) (<a href="#eq6.7">Eqns 6.7</a> and <a href="#eq6.8">6.8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Although aqueous ammonia is not a sufficiently strong base to remove further protons from the neutral hydroxo complex, the precipitate nonetheless often dissolves on adding an excess of the reagent. This is because as well as acting as a base, ammonia can also compete with water as a ligand (by donating the lone pair of electrons from the nitrogen atom to the central metal) resulting in the formation of soluble charged complexes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ligand exchange reactions involving aqua complexes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Neutral hydroxo complexes often dissolve in excess aqueous ammonia owing to ligand exchange producing cationic ammine complexes. Since water and ammonia molecules are roughly the same size, there is no change in coordination number (<a href="#eq6.9">Eqn 6.9</a>). In the case of copper(II), aqueous ammonia does not replace all the water molecules (<a href="#eq6.10">Eqn 6.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Ligand exchange is nearly always accompanied by a <i>colour</i> change. In the case of ammine formation there is no change in the <i>geometry</i> of the complex but ammonia ligands are generally rather better at splitting the <i>d</i> orbitals on <a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, d-Block elements</a>the metal than aqua ligands.

<p class="noindent">Several of the simple ligands mentioned in previous sections possess more than one lone pair of electrons (<a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>). Although such species may act as bridges by donating an electron pair to each of two metal ions as in the dichromate(VI) ion (<a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>), these ligands are referred to as monodentate as only one atom can donate electron pairs.</p>

<p class="noindent2-cen"><b>Fig 6.13</b> Some ligands with more than one lone pair.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">Some ligands, however, contain two or more atoms that can act as electron pair donors. Examples of such didentate, tridentate, and tetradentate ligands are shown in <a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>. A metal ion that accepts two or more pairs of electrons from the same ligand becomes incorporated into a ring system known as a chelate. Such complexes are generally much less susceptible to exchange reactions than non-chelates since two or more coordinate bonds must break almost simultaneously in order to release the ligand. Thus the EDTA anion, which can supply up to six electron pairs to a single metal ion, forms extremely stable complexes of the type shown in <a href="#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Standard potentials, <i>E&#x00B0;</i>, and redox reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">This section explains the term <i>standard electrode potentials</i> and indicates how they may be used to predict the course of redox reactions. Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons. Any species that loses electrons is said to be oxidized whilst those that gain electrons are reduced. Neither of these processes can occur in isolation and must occur simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">When a metal is dipped into a solution of its ions, a redox equilibrium is set up (<a href="#eq6.12">Eqn 6.12</a>).</p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.12"><img src="../images/page82-4.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">The better the metal (M) is at giving away electrons, the more negative will be the charge that the solid metal develops at equilibrium.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not possible to measure the potential of a single redox electrode in isolation but it is possible to measure the potential <i>difference</i> between any two electrodes by setting up a chemical cell. Like any other equilibrium, the position of a redox system will depend upon the conditions chosen. <i>The standard potential of any system is defined as its potential measured relative to the hydrogen electrode (<a href="#eq6.13">Eqn 6.13</a>) at 25&#x00B0;C, 1 atmosphere pressure, and with all aqueous concentrations equal to 1 M</i>.</p>
<a id="page_83" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 83, d-Block elements</a>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.13"><img src="../images/page83-1.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent">The more <i>negative</i> the value of the standard electrode potential, the more easily the system loses electrons so the <i>greater</i> is its <i>reducing power</i> (and the weaker its oxidizing power.) We can, therefore, use <i>E&#x00B0;</i> values to predict the course of reactions involving redox equilibria.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, consider the addition of magnesium metal to dilute sulphuric acid. The two redox systems involved are shown in <a href="#eq6.14">Eqns 6.14</a> and <a href="#eq6.15">6.15</a>.</p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.14"><img src="../images/page83-2.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.15"><img src="../images/page83-3.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">When the two systems are in contact, electrons will flow if possible from the more negative system (<a href="#eq6.14">Eqn 6.14</a>) to the more positive (Eqn. 6.15).</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page83-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This will disturb the above redox equilibria, and reactions will take place producing aqueous magnesium ions and hydrogen gas:</p>
<p class="fig1">Mg(s) &#x2192; Mg<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup></p>
<p class="fig1">H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> &#x2192; 0.5H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
<p class="noindent">To get the overall equation it is necessary to ensure that the number of electrons released by the reducing agent equals the number accepted by the oxidizing agent. In this case this balance is achieved by doubling the values in <a href="#eq6.15">Eqn 6.15</a>.</p>
<p class="fig1">Mg(s) &#x2192; Mg<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup></p>
<p class="fig1">2H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> &#x2192; H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
<p class="fig1" style="border-top: 2px solid;">overall equation = Mg(s) + 2H<sup>+</sup>(aq) &#x2192; Mg<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + H(g)</p>
<p class="indent">So, in this case a reaction is predicted between magnesium and dilute sulphuric acid, although strictly speaking this is only valid for the conditions <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, d-Block elements</a>at which standard electrode potentials are measured. Now consider adding copper metal to dilute sulphuric acid. The two reactions in question are given in <a href="#eq6.16">Eqns 6.16</a> and <a href="#eq6.17">6.17</a>.</p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.16"><img src="../images/page84-1.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig1a" id="eq6.17"><img src="../images/page84-2.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">In this case, a flow of electrons from the more negative hydrogen system to the copper system is predicted.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The predicted reactions are given below and the overall reaction is their sum. Copper metal will not, therefore react with H<sup>+</sup>(aq) under standard conditions. In fact, the reverse process, that is the reduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup>by hydrogen, is predicted.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Redox reactions and catalytic action</h2>
<p class="noindent">Higher oxidation states of transition elements are often reduced in acid solution by reducing agents such as zinc metal. For example, when zinc is added to a solution containing ferric ion, Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq), the result is reduction to ferous ion, Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) (<a href="#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>). The colour change in this reaction results from a change in the number of electrons populating the <i>d</i> orbitals. As with ligand exchange, characteristic colour changes in redox reactions can be used in chemical analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">If the metal is capable of displaying multiple oxidation states, then a series of colour changes may well indicate progressive reduction. For vanadate(V) the following sequence is observed upon reduction with zinc metal:</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">If the resulting final solution is separated from the zinc and allowed to stand in air it reverts to a bright blue colour, showing that +4 is the most stable oxidation state of vanadium under these conditions. Reduction of dichromate(VI) solution by zinc takes place as follows:</p>
<figure class="fig1">

<p class="indent">Intermediate oxidation states are not always observed. For instance, in strongly acidic solution manganate(VII) is reduced directly to manganese(II):</p>

<p class="indent">Although the &#x2018;most stable&#x2019; oxidation states are labelled in the above sequences, it should be noted that this can depend upon the conditions or the type of ligand.

<p class="indent">Although very favourable in terms of electrode potentials, the reaction is very slow since the negative charge on each species will result in mutual repulsion as they approach each other. Addition of a small amount of Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq), however, speeds up the reaction dramatically by providing an alternative reaction pathway. The first step involves oxidation of iodide by iron(III) (Fig 6.23). The persulphate is then reduced by the iron(II) formed (Fig 6.24).</p>
<a id="page_88" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 88, d-Block elements</a>
<p class="indent">The iron has acted as an intermediary in the transfer of an electron from I<sup>-</sup> to S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Since it both speeds up the reaction and is reformed, the Fe<sup>3+</sup>(aq) has acted as a catalyst. Of course, Fe<sup>2+</sup>(aq) would be equally effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Before leaving the topic of oxidation and reduction, consider the preparation from iron of the anhydrous chlorides, FeCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Again the conditions are important in deciding which product is formed. If iron is heated in a stream of chlorine, the oxidizing nature of the halogen means that the higher chloride is produced (<a href="#eq6.18">Eqn 6.18</a>). This can be reduced to iron(II) chloride by heating in a stream of hydrogen (<a href="#eq6.19">Eqn 6.19</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">In the space available here it is only possible to give a flavour of the importance and diverse uses of <i>d</i>-block compounds. It is true to say that animal life itself depends upon transition metal complexes such as <i>haemoglobin</i>. This molecule, which contains Fe<sup>2+</sup> at the centre of a tetradentate haem group, acts as the oxygen carrier in blood by accepting a lone pair of electrons from O<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#fig6.25">Fig. 6.25</a>). Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it binds more strongly to the iron that the oxygen molecule. Patients suffering from certain types of anaemia are treated with tablets containing iron(II) sulphate which boosts the iron levels in the blood.</p>

<p class="noindent">Platinum was chosen for the electrodes as it is a very unreactive metal and was therefore unlikely to influence the results.</p>
<p class="indent">It was found that, although individual cells continued to grow normally, the formation of new cells by division was inhibited. After exhausting all other possible variables in the experiment that might have caused this effect, the researchers concluded that perhaps the platinum had reacted with the solution and produced a new chemical that interfered with cell division. They found very tiny quantities (about 10 parts per million) of cisplatin, together with its isomer transplatin (chloride ligands opposite each other rather than side by side). Further research showed that, unlike cisplatin, transplatin has no effect on cell division.</p>

<p class="indent">Since tumours result from uncontrolled division of cancer cells, it was reasoned that cisplatin might be an effective treatment if injected directly into a tumour. This was confirmed by trials and the drug is now a common and effective treatment for testicular cancer provided it is diagnosed early enough.</p>
<p class="indent">Although very effective, cisplatin is rather toxic and has unpleasant side-effects. This provoked research into the mechanism of its anti-cancer properties so that safer alternatives might be developed. It appears that cisplatin loses its two chloride ligands and then binds to a specific site (the N-7 atoms of adjacent guanines) on the DNA chain (<a href="#fig6.26">Fig. 6.26</a>). Over 2000 related compounds have undergone medical trials and carboplatin is now in clinical use. This retains the <i>eis</i> arrangement of the NH<sub>3</sub> molecules in cisplatin but replaces the chloride ligands with an organic group. It is almost as effective as cisplatin but much less toxic.</p>
