<h1 class="main">2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Bonding</h1>
<p class="noindent">Understanding what holds atoms together is not easy. What is clear, however, is that all bonding is a consequence of electrostatic interactions between positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons. The type of bonding that holds atoms together in a metal, such as iron, is called <i>metallic bonding</i>. Compounds such as salt (sodium chloride) consist of lattices of anions and cations held together via electrostatic forces. This is <i>ionic bonding</i>. Compounds such as oxygen and nitrogen in the air that we breathe are held together by shared-electron bonds. This is <i>covalent bonding</i>. Most compounds are best described as being somewhere between pure covalent and pure ionic in nature.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">There are simple and less simple ways to describe bonding. Any attempt to describe bonding is called a model and even the most complicated models have problems. The Lewis model of bonding (&#x2018;dot-and-cross&#x2019;) is credited to G.N. Lewis who worked in the area at the start of the twentieth century. His contribution to chemistry is immense, especially when it is recognized that virtually nothing was known about atomic structure at the time. Lewis noticed that some atoms towards the right of the periodic table form ions by gaining electrons in such a way that the total number of valence electrons surrounding that atom is eight (the &#x2018;octet&#x2019; configuration). This is done either by electron donation to that atom (ionic bonding), or by electron sharing (covalent bonding) with one or more adjacent atoms. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that eight is the &#x2018;magic number&#x2019; because it corresponds to the number of electrons required for filling all available energy levels in the valence shell, at least for the lighter elements up to neon.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lewis model has problems, as we shall see, but has the important advantage of simplicity. When the Lewis model of bonding fails in some way, perhaps the <i>hybridization model</i> will suffice. If and when that fails, maybe a further model involving <i>molecular orbitals</i> will be appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">Some atoms are not held together by any bonds. Examples include the Group 18 noble gases. All the Group 18 gases freeze to form regular lattices of atoms on cooling. Since the solids exist, there must be some interaction between the atoms in these solids. These interactions are provided by weak attractive forces known as van der Waals forces.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>van der Waals forces</i>: transient fluctuations in electron density on a molecule result in a dipole. This induces a fluctuation in electron density (and so a dipole) on a neighbouring molecule. The result is an attraction between the two instantaneously produced dipoles.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Metallic structures</h2>
<p class="noindent">Whatever the nature of metal&#x2013;metal bonding, there are interactions between adjacent metal atoms. Metals are interesting materials. They have high melting points, so clearly strong bonding must exist, and yet their shape is changed easily, suggesting that it is possible to move the atoms in the bulk metal relative to each other quite easily. There is more than one way to treat<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Bonding</a> bonding in metals. One of the simplest is to envisage the metal as a <i>regular lattice array</i> of cations, each of which consists of the metal atom less the valence electrons. Those valence electrons are detached from any single cation and the spaces between the cations are filled with a &#x2018;sea&#x2019; of electrons. The sea of electrons is mobile, accounting for the high electrical conductivity of metals. At a more sophisticated level, the behaviour of electrons in the &#x2018;sea&#x2019; may be described using the <i>band level</i> model, but this is beyond the scope of this text.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">As metallic bonding involves loss of electrons to the &#x2018;sea&#x2019; it is adopted by elements that have a low ionization energy. Suitable elements include the <i>s</i>- <i>d</i>- and <i>f</i>-blocks and a few of the <i>p</i>-block elements (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When considering the solid state structures of metals it is convenient to regard these metal cores as small hard spheres. In order to describe the nature of metal packing, it is necessary to visualize the arrangement of the atoms or spheres in space. Atoms in solid metals are not arranged in random arrays. Instead, the atoms are arranged in regular repeating crystalline arrays. There are many different ways for the metal atoms cores to be arranged in regular lattice arrays.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the simplest crystalline arrays conceptually is a cubic array (<a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>). Perhaps surprisingly, this form is displayed only by a single metal &#x2014; polonium.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In most, but not all cases, the total amount of bonding for a metal atom is maximized by placing as many metal atoms around it as possible. The problem therefore requires an analysis of the ways in which balls pack so as to maximize the total number of balls surrounding any one ball.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to approach this problem is to arrange a number of balls in a tray so that as little space is taken up as possible. The result is the arrangement in the left section of <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. Note the hexagonal arrangement. Note also that each internal ball is surrounded by six others. The spheres are shown as not quite touching so that the diagrams might be a little clearer. The next step is to arrange a second layer of balls upon the first. In practice, the next layer of balls will fall naturally into place and this creates a second hexagonal array identical in appearance to the first but displaced (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, centre). In order to distinguish these two layers, one is labelled <i>a</i> and the second is labelled <i>b</i>.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The third layer of balls can be arranged so that each ball is arranged directly over the balls in the first layer. The third layer is therefore labelled <i>a</i> as well and overall the three-layer structure is labelled <i>aba</i>. If the pattern is continued with more layers, the resulting structure is denoted <i>ababababababab</i>&#x2026;. As the balls in this structure are arranged as tightly as possible, the packing is referred to as close packed. Because of the hexagonal<a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Bonding</a> nature of the packing, the structure is called <i>hexagonal close packed</i>. Note that each internal ball touches 12 other balls: the <i>coordination number</i> is 12.</p>

<p class="noindent2-cen"><b>Fig. 2.3</b> The <i>abcabcabc</i> cubic close packed structure.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">There is another possibility however. The third layer can stack, as in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a> over the <i>a</i> layer to form the <i>abababab</i> hexagonal close-packed structure. Alternatively, the third layer can occupy a <i>third</i> position, <i>c</i>, by stacking over the holes evident in the centre structure of <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. The result is shown in the third part of <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. Following this, repeat layers are put down so that the resulting structure is labelled <i>abcabcabcabc</i>&#x2026;. This type of structure is referred to as <i>cubic close-packing</i>. The <i>abcabc</i> structure from <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a> is redisplayed in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a> after rotation and the spheres shaded dark show clearly the origin of the term cubic close packing.</p>
<p class="indent">Armed with a knowledge of internuclear distances in any given close-packed metal it is possible to define the metallic radius for that metal as one-half of that internuclear distance. Since the coordination number is 12 in close packed structures, this is sometimes referred to as the <i>r</i><sub>12</sub> for that metal.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>ababab</i> and <i>abcabc</i> structures are the most efficient in terms of the percentage space occupied per unit volume, but not all metals display one of these two structures in their normal form. A slightly less efficient form of packing known as body-centred cubic (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>) is displayed by the Group 1, 5, and 6 elements together with one or two other metals.</p>

<p class="indent">In this form of packing, instead of the first layer consisting of atoms surrounded by six other atoms in a hexagonal array, it consists of atoms surrounded by <i>four</i> other atoms in a square array. The second layer is displaced so as to fill in the pits and is also necessarily a square array. The third layer quite naturally fits in above the first layer making the layer structure <i>abababab</i> overall. <a href="#fig2.5">Figure 2.5</a> shows a section of 16 atoms from this<a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Bonding</a> structure and illustrates the origin of the term body centred cubic. The eight dark grey spheres are from adjacent layers of the <i>a</i> layer and form a perfect cube. The other eight spheres are from the <i>b</i> layer and the very dark sphere of that second set of atoms is located at the precise centre of the cube defined by the eight <i>a</i> atoms. Note that in this structure (edges excepted), every atom in the structure is at the centre of a cubic array of eight atoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Since the coordination number is 8 for such metals, it is not quite correct to compare directly a radius defined as one-half of the internuclear distance in body-centred cubic structures with the <i>r</i><sub>12</sub> values for close-packed metals as like is not being compared with like. Instead, values of radii obtained for body-centred cubic structures are converted so as to reflect the values they would have if 12-coordination was that displayed (<a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). Note that the metallic radii tend to decrease towards the centre of the <i>d</i>-block. The first <i>d</i>-block period elements are smaller than the second and third series, which are about the same size as each other.</p>

<p class="noindent">Recall that Lewis noticed that some atoms towards the right of the periodic table form anions by gaining electrons in such a way that the total number of valence electrons is that of the next noble gas. Atoms of elements at the left of the periodic table form cations by losing electrons in such a way that the valence electron count is that of the previous noble gas. So in common salt, NaCl, chlorine gains an electron from sodium to form chloride and so achieve an octet, while sodium loses its valence electron to become Na<sup>+</sup> (also an octet structure).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In one sense, ionic structures are related to metallic structures. Ionic compounds, such as salt, consist of arrays of atoms, in this case as cations and anions, in regular crystalline lattices.</p>
<p class="indent">Anions are generally larger than cations. Therefore, one can visualize the crystalline lattice as packed spherical anions. The cations are contained within the remaining spaces, or holes. Consider the structure of common salt, commonly displayed as in <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>. Rather than drawing the diagram with the anions just touching each other, the spheres are scaled so as to aid<a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Bonding</a> understanding. This lattice is shown in slightly extended form in <a href="#fig2.8">Fig 2.8</a>. Each of the components of <a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a> are the same piece of lattice, but displayed from different angles. The chloride ions are shaded in the second and third images to show that the lattice is made up as an <i>abcabcabc</i> close packed array of ions &#x2014; in other words <i>cubic close-packed</i>. The sodium ions are smaller (116 pm) than the chloride ions (167 pm) and occupy the available space left after close packing of the chloride ions.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Determination of the size of an ion is not simple. While for a species consisting of a single element, such as a metal, it seems entirely reasonable to define the radius as one-half of the interatomic distance, this option is not available for any species containing more that one element. In any given interaction, where does one element start and the other finish? However, if the size of <i>one</i> of the ions is known then it is easy to calculate the size of the second. The way forward is to <i>define</i> the size of one anion (six-coordinate O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> as 126 pm) and to use this value to determine the sizes of all the other ions based upon that single value.</p>
<p class="indent">The structure of the Group 1 halide NaCl is discussed above. However, not all halides show the same structure. If the size of the cation is much larger than that of the sodium cation, then there is insufficient room for the cation to fit within the holes in the cubic close-packed array of anions. This is the case for caesium (181 pm). Caesium chloride therefore adopts a different structure so as to accommodate the larger cation.</p>
<p class="indent">A measure of the total bonding in any crystal lattice is given by the lattice energy. This is the enthalpy change associated with bringing together, in the case of salt, a mole of Na<sup>+</sup>(g) cations and a mole of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>(g) anions to form salt. This quantity cannot be measure directly, so it is derived indirectly through the use of other enthalpy changes which are known. The formation of salt can be approached from the constituent elements around the &#x2018;Born&#x2013;Haber&#x2019; cycle in two ways (<a href="#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>). The formation of salt from its component elements in their standard state is the enthalpy of formation and is a directly measurable quantity. Alternatively, the formation can be broken down into component<a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Bonding</a> processes, atomization, ionization, electron affinity, and the lattice energy. By Hess&#x2019;s law, the sum of these enthalpy changes of these component processes must add up to the enthalpy change of formation. So, provided the ionization enthalpies, atomization enthalpies, and electron affinity are known, the lattice energy may be calculated.</p>

<p class="indent">Lattice energies, in many cases, can be calculated. In cases where the experimentally derived lattice energies fail to match the calculated values based upon the compound being purely ionic, then the difference can often be ascribed to the compound not being a pure ionic structure; in other words, there is a covalent contribution to the structure. The form of the covalent contribution is a distortion of the electron clouds under the influence of the adjacent cations. There is a covalent component to the bonding in most ionic crystals, but it may be small.</p>

<p class="noindent">In common salt, NaCl, chlorine gains an electron from sodium to form chloride and so achieve an octet. The situation for chlorine in molecules such as chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, is related, except that here a different mechanism is used by chlorine to achieve the octet structure. The chlorine atom has seven valence electrons and only requires one extra electron to attain the neon electronic structure. Instead of gaining an electron from an element such as sodium, it does this is by <i>sharing</i> an electron with another chlorine atom. In effect, the shared electrons (negatively charged) hold the positively charged nuclei<a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Bonding</a> together through electrostatic attraction. For convenience, the two electrons connecting the chlorine atoms are normally represented by a line and so chlorine is Cl&#x2014;Cl. Chlorine has six pairs of electrons that are <i>not</i> shared with other atoms. These pairs of electrons are <i>lone pairs</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Oxygen has six valence electrons and so requires <i>two</i> electrons to attain the structure of neon, the noble gas. Rather than gaining two electrons by transfer from an atom such as magnesium, the oxygen atom can do this by sharing <i>two</i> electrons with a neighbouring oxygen atom. This places <i>two</i> shared pairs of electrons between the two oxygen nuclei. This introduces the concept of <i>bond order</i>. Two electrons located between two atoms are defined as forming a <i>single bond</i>. Two pairs of electrons between two atoms constitute two bonds, that is, a <i>double bond</i>. The bond order in dioxygen is 2 and dioxygen is written O=O. Each oxygen atom has two lone pairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Cl<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> are symmetrical and therefore there cannot be a charge imbalance between the two atoms. Diatomic molecules such as HCl are <i>asymmetric</i> and there is no reason, except by accident, for there <i>not</i> to be a charge imbalance between the two atoms. The power for atoms within a molecule to attract electrons to themselves is called electronegativity. An <i>electronegativity scale</i> (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">5</a>) is a set of numbers which ranks the ability of any given atom in a molecule to attract electrons from other atoms. Elements which attract electrons strongly are said to be very electronegative. Elements that do not do this well are weakly electronegative, or electropositive.</p>
<p class="indent">In a diatomic molecule such as H&#x2014;Cl, the chlorine is more electronegative and attracts electron density away from the hydrogen. The consequence of this is that there is more electron density at the chlorine end of the molecule than at the hydrogen end. The bond is <i>polar</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The procedure for writing down the Lewis structure for a polyatomic molecule starts with a calculation of the total number of valence electrons for all the atoms in a molecule, including any necessary compensation for charge if the molecule is ionic. The electrons are then arranged around the component atoms (arranged in the correct connectivity) so that, if possible, the octet rule (or duplet for hydrogen) is satisfied for each (<a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>). Note that the Lewis representation of ethene successfully accounts for the double bond. Atoms in molecules do not necessarily share all their electrons. Nitrogen in ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, retains a lone pair of electrons for itself. Note that nitrogen still has an outer octet of electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a very few exceptions to the octet rule for the second period elements. However, in BF<sub>3</sub>, although all the fluorine atoms attain the octet configuration, boron has only six. The chemistry of molecules of this type is dominated by a tendency to react with a source of electrons, so attaining the octet configuration. The octet rule is frequently adhered to by main group elements below the second period, but there is scope for exceptions. So for the third period elements, there are a number of cases, such as PF<sub>5</sub>, where the<a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Bonding</a> electron count expands beyond eight. This is often attributed to participation in the bonding by <i>d</i> orbitals. There is space in the valence shell for more than eight electrons.</p>

<p class="indent">It is common to denote bonds by a line such as that in F&#x2014;F. The line corresponds to two electron dots in <a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a> and is generally a more convenient representation than the dots. The two dots are retained for lone pairs, but lone pairs are often only denoted on the atom of interest in a molecule (<a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>). So in PF<sub>3</sub>, only the phosphorus lone pair is generally written (:PF<sub>3</sub>) and the fluorine lone pairs are omitted from the diagram.</p>
<p class="indent">One can elaborate on the covalent bonding in hydrogen as follows. The hydrogen atom has one electron (H<sup>&#x2022;</sup>). In the molecule H<sub>2</sub>, each H atom attains the electronic configuration of the next noble gas, in this case the helium duplet, by sharing the two electrons. This is represented as H:H, or more simply H&#x2014;H. There are two electrons located between the two hydrogen nuclei and these two electrons form the bond holding the nuclei together.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a number of interactions (<a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>) to be considered. The force between two point charges varies with the square of the distance between them. The two protons are positively charged and repel each other. The two electrons are negatively charged and repel each other. However, this is more than offset by the four proton&#x2013;electron attractions. These six interactions therefore represent the net bonding in the system.</p>
<p class="indent">In an orbital description of bonding between two hydrogen atoms, the two hydrogen atomic orbitals (1<i>s</i>) overlap to make an <i>orbital</i> which is distributed over both component atoms. The two electrons reside in the one orbital. The electron density aggregates between the two nuclei. This is shown schematically in <a href="#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a> in a number of different styles, all of which are in common use.</p>

The localized bond approach implies that one orbital on one atom interacts with an orbital on a second atom to form a bond. Orbitals on other atoms in the molecule are not involved. A further approach (the molecular orbital description) involves derealization of electrons in<a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Bonding</a> molecular orbitals over the whole molecule, but this approach is beyond the scope of this text.</p>

It is <i>not</i> something that atoms <i>do</i> in the sense that hybridization does not occur during chemical reactions, it is a convenient mathematical procedure which describes bonding in terms of conceptually simple two-centre, two-electron bonds. It gives a way of using modified atomic orbitals to overlap more strongly with atomic orbitals on other atoms and so to form more stable bonding orbitals.</p>

This can be achieved by first imagining that one of the electrons in the boron 2<i>s</i> orbital moves to an unoccupied boron <i>p</i> orbital (<a href="#eq2.1">Eqn 2.1</a>). This is often called promotion, since the energy level of the <i>p</i> orbital is above that of the <i>s</i> orbital. Of the three orbitals containing one electron, two are at 90&#x00B0; to each other and the other is non-directi&#x00F6;nal. Unfortunately, these cannot be used directly for constructing three trigonal bonds (120&#x00B0; bond angles).</p>

<p class="indent">The shape of trigonal molecules is determined by three electron pairs. The most convenient way of generating acceptable trigonal orbitals on boron is to <i>hybridize</i> one <i>s</i> with two <i>p</i> orbitals (<a href="#eq2.2">Eqn 2.2</a>). Recall each of these contains one electron. By convention, the <i>z</i>-axis is taken to be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. It makes sense to mix the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals since the 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbital is directed out of the plane of the three bonds. These orbitals are called <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrids. The three resulting orbitals are equivalent and each of the<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Bonding</a> hybrids contain one-third <i>s</i> character and two-thirds <i>p</i> character. One <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid is illustrated in <a href="#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>. Each of these <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals contains one electron. The remaining 2<i>p</i> orbital (2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i>) is both empty and non-bonding. The <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals are now set up in the correct orientation to overlap with the three hydrogen atoms (<a href="#fig2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>) and so to form three shared electron bonds. Each of these resulting covalent bonds is called a &#x03C3; bond. The electron density lies directly between the two connected nuclei.</p>

<p class="noindent">Systems based upon a tetrahedral geometry (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>) such as methane or SiH<sub>4</sub> require that the hybridization involves four orbitals. This means mixing the <i>s</i> and all three <i>p</i> valence orbitals into <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrids. All four are equivalent, differing only in direction. Each contains one-quarter <i>s</i> character and three-quarters <i>p</i> character. In practice, they are very similar in appearance to <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals. The mathematics works out so that the orbitals are mutually orientated at angles of 109.5&#x00B0; &#x2014; that is, along tetrahedral axes.</p>
<p class="indent">The ground state electronic structure of carbon is [He]2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>. Four unpaired electrons are achieved by conceptually promoting one of the electrons into the remaining empty <i>p</i> orbital (<a href="#eq2.3-2.4">Eqn 2.3</a>). Note that of the original four carbon orbitals, three are orientated at 90&#x00B0; and the fourth is non-directional. Without invoking hybridization to form <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrids (<a href="#eq2.3-2.4">Eqn 2.4</a>) it would be difficult to construct four tetrahedral localized bonds. So in the hybrid view of bonding for methane there are four equivalent C&#x2014;H bonds with bond angles of 109.5&#x00B0;.</p>

<p class="indent">Molecules such as PF<sub>5</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>, and most metal complexes, have more than four bonds and so require hybridization schemes that produce five, six, or more orbitals capable of binding to the peripheral atoms. This is achieved by involving <i>d</i> orbitals.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before proceeding further, it is necessary to introduce one further concept: <i>Oxidation:</i> removal of electrons the <i>oxidation state</i>. The oxidation state is a useful way to keep track of <i>Reduction:</i> gaining of electrons electrons and can be helpful when categorizing compounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider lithium fluoride, LiF. The formation of the salt involves the transfer of electrons from lithium to fluorine. The lithium is said to oxidize and the fluorine is said to reduce. Since a single electron is removed from each lithium atom, the oxidation number (or oxidation state) is +1. Since a single electron is added to each fluorine atom, the oxidation number (or oxidation state) is &#x2212;1. Note the oxidation state has a sign.</p>
<p class="fig1">Li &#x2192; Li<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>&#x2212;</sup><br/>F + e<sup>&#x2212;</sup> &#x2192; F<sup>&#x2212;</sup></p>
<p class="indent">One can also assign oxidation numbers without considering formation processes. Most formulae, such as LiF, can be dissected in our minds into ions so as to ensure that all of the resulting ions possess a closed shell of electrons. For lithium fluoride, note that both the resulting ions Li<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>possess closed shell structures. The oxidation number is then defined as the charge possessed by each ion (+1 and &#x2212;1 for LiF). Oxidation numbers are commonly written using Roman numerals, so the lithium in LiF is denoted Li(I) and the fluorine as F(&#x2212;I). Aluminium oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is dissected as 2A1<sup>3+</sup> and 3O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> giving oxidation states of +3 and &#x2212;2 for aluminium and oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases such as C1F where it is not possible to dissect the structure so that each ion possesses a closed shell structure, the electrons are assigned to the most electronegative atoms first. So C1F is dissected into Cl<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and the oxidation number of chlorine is +1 and that of fluorine is &#x2212;1. In this case after the dissection, the chlorine ion has only six valence electrons. It is far more usual for chlorine to adopt an oxidation state of &#x2212;1 and so achieve an octet.</p>
<p class="indent">The above procedure is a common way to assign oxidation state and works well. However, the method can lead to the common misconception that the oxidation state corresponds to the electric charge on atoms in any particular compound. For salts such as LiF, perhaps regarding the structure as a lattice of Li<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions is not unreasonable, but consider CF4. Here the oxidation states are assigned as +4 for carbon and &#x2212;1 for each fluorine. However, tetrafluoromethane is covalent and while it is correct to assign carbon as C(IV) and the fluorine as F(&#x2212;I), CF<sub>4</sub> is certainly not a lattice of C<sup>4+</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions. Uranium hexafluoride, UF<sub>6</sub>, formally is made up from U(VI) and F(&#x2212;I), but its nature is not an ionic lattice of U<sup>6+</sup> and F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions. Instead, it is a covalent material, boiling point 56&#x00B0;C, which in the gas phase is used for the isotopie fractionation of uranium isotopes.</p>
<p class="indent">So, it is most important to realize that oxidation state is not a physical property. There is not a machine which functions as an oxidation state meter. Nevertheless, the oxidation state is a useful way to keep track of electrons and to categorize compounds. It is still in common use, although perhaps, in time, alternative general purpose categorization schemes might replace the oxidation number concept.</p>
