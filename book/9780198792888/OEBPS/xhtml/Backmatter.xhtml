<p class="fmnoindent">Notes: Elements for which the atomic weight is contained within parentheses have no stable nuclides and the weight of the longest-lived known isotope is quoted. The three elements Th, Pa, and U do have characteristic terrestrial abundances and these are the values quoted. In cases where the atomic weight is known to better than three decimal places, the quoted values are rounded to three decimal places. There is considerable confusion surrounding the Group labels. The top, numeric, labelling system (1-18) is the current IUPAC convention. The other two systems are less desirable since they are confusing, but still in common usage. The designations A and B are completely arbitrary. The first of these (A left, B right) is based upon older IUPAC recommendations and frequently used in Europe. The last set (main group elements A, transition elements B) was in common use in America. For a discussion of these and other labelling systems see: Fernelius, W.C. and Powell, W.H. (1982).
