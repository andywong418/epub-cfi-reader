<p class="noindent">Matter is made up from very small particles called <i>atoms</i>. To date, 109 different atom types are known and named. Each type is referred to as an <i>element</i>. Claims for new elements with atomic numbers 110&#x2013;112, 114, 116, and 118 are being analysed. Most matter in the universe is made up of just two elements, hydrogen (about 75% by weight) and helium (about 23% by weight). Heavier elements are synthesized in stars by nuclear reactions and those present in our environment represent the debris from stellar explosions from long ago.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1">
<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Atomic structure</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, it is useful to regard atoms as small billiard ball-like entities, but usually a chemist does need a more advanced view of atom structure. Atoms possess structure. They are not little, hard, featureless balls, although they are spherical. An atom consists of a positively charged <i>nucleus</i> surrounded by negatively charged <i>electrons</i>. Most of the volume of the atom is associated with the electrons. Although the radius of the nucleus is only about 0.01% of that of the atom, the total mass of the electrons is much less than that of the nucleus. Atoms are very small, with radii of the order of 100 pm, meaning that several million atoms could line up in a row less than a millimetre long.</p>
<p class="indent">The nucleus contains one or more protons which from the chemist&#x2019;s point of view are positively charged indivisible particles. Apart from hydrogen, the nucleus also contains neutrons, also indivisible, which weigh about the same as protons, but are electrically neutral. The identity of the atom is defined by the number of protons within the nucleus. So, the nucleus within all hydrogen atoms possesses one and only one proton, the nucleus within all helium atoms contain two protons, and so on. The nucleus is surrounded by a number of electrons. Electrons are negatively charged but the magnitude of the charge is precisely the same as that upon a proton. The effect is that the atom is electrically neutral.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>Atomic number</i>, number of protons</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">While all atoms of one element possess the same number of protons, the nuclei of atoms of any one element may contain different numbers of neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons but differing number of neutrons are called <i>isotopes</i>. So, all carbon atoms possess six protons and most contain six neutrons. The atomic mass of this form of carbon is 12 (6 + 6) and this isotope is denoted <img src="../images/page1-1.jpg" alt="images"/>. A small number of carbon atoms (1.1% in naturally occurring carbon) contain seven neutrons. These have an atomic mass of 13 and are denoted <img src="../images/page1-2.jpg" alt="images"/>. A very small proportion of carbon atoms, perhaps 1 in 10<sup>12</sup> within living creatures, possess eight neutrons. These carbon atoms are <img src="../images/page1-3.jpg" alt="images"/>. The nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are not stable and decompose slowly, with a half-life of 5715 years, to the nitrogen isotope <img src="../images/page1-4.jpg" alt="images"/><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Elements and periodicity</a> in a process which releases a <i>&#x03B2;</i>-particle (an electron) from the nucleus and <i>&#x03B3;</i>-irradiation. Isotopes which decompose are &#x2018;radioactive&#x2019;. In this particular case, the radioactive decay is useful in that it forms the basis of radiocarbon dating.</p>

<p class="indent">The masses of the carbon isotopes weighted for their relative proportions in nature constitute the relative atomic mass. By international convention, relative atomic masses are expressed on a scale relative to the mass of the <img src="../images/page1-1.jpg" alt="images"/> isotope (12.0000). Since the proportion of <img src="../images/page1-2.jpg" alt="images"/> is only 1.1%, the relative atomic mass of carbon is slightly over 12.0000, actually 12.0107 according to the latest (1997) values. It is common to see relative atomic masses expressed as the term <i>atomic weight</i>, indeed the definitive IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) tables do exactly that.</p>
<p class="indent">Conceptually, one of the simplest models of atomic structure is the Bohr model. In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>), the single electron rotates around the nucleus in a &#x2018;planetary&#x2019; fashion within an <i>orbit</i>. The radius of the orbit is denoted <i>r</i>. Under normal conditions, in <i>every</i> hydrogen atom, the electron revolves around the nucleus at the <i>same</i> distance <i>r</i>. The electron in motion possesses a certain amount of energy (<i>E</i>), which in practice can be calculated. This energy, <i>E</i>, depends upon the radius, <i>r</i>, of the orbit (that is, the energy, <i>E</i>, is <i>a function of</i> the radius, <i>r</i>). Since the radius is the same for every hydrogen atom, the energy of the electron is also the same for every hydrogen atom. The electron is said to reside at a particular energy level. Under certain circumstances it is possible, by inducing the atom to absorb some energy, for the electron to transfer to another orbit and so to a different energy level further from the nucleus (since the new radius is different from the first radius). A key feature of the Bohr description is that <i>only certain values of orbit radius are allowed</i>. From this it follows that only certain energy levels are allowed. The radius (and therefore the energy) is said to be <i>quantized</i>. Allowed radii (called <i>shells</i>) are labelled with quantum numbers 1, 2, 3&#x2026; but the electron always resides in the level labelled 1 unless that atom is in an excited state (after promotion of the electron in some way). These particular quantum numbers are <i>principal quantum numbers</i>. They do not denote the radius, they are simply labels.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom may be extended to multielectron elements starting from helium. The Bohr model of the fluorine atom is shown in <a href="#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>. In all cases, this simple pictorial model has electrons revolving around the central nucleus in orbits at fixed distances. These pictures are useful at an elementary level in that they help to keep track of electrons; however; their usefulness is diminished because of the danger that they foster the notion that this is what atoms &#x2018;look like&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">The Bohr model is useful for many reasons, not the least of which is that it is easy to understand. However, it is fundamentally flawed. In the Bohr model, there seems nothing to stop the electrons spiralling into the nucleus. A useful discussion of many chemical phenomena requires a more sophisticated model. Unfortunately any more sophisticated model is inherently more difficult to understand, in part because of difficulties in visualizing it.</p>

<p class="indent">It is often useful to get away from the planetary electron model and to regard the electron as an altogether more tenuous entity smeared over a<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Elements and periodicity</a> volume of space (<a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>). In this &#x2018;non-classical&#x2019; view, it is not appropriate to refer to the electron as a charged particle that revolves around the nucleus. Instead, the electron in that region of space is represented by an <i>orbital</i>, a term clearly related to the word orbit. In <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>, the <i>density</i> of the dots represents <i>electron density</i> in hydrogen&#x2019;s lowest energy orbital, otherwise known as the hydrogen 1 <i>s</i> orbital. The diagram is actually a slice through the spherically symmetrical three-dimensional shape representing the orbital. The density falls away exponentially with distance from the nucleus. The electron density is related to the probability of finding the electron at any one point.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">It is not always convenient to draw complicated density diagrams, which require computer programs to generate, so shorthand representations such as those in <a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> are commonly employed.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the Bohr model, it is possible to calculate the energy associated with the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital, and the energy calculated is <i>precisely</i> the same energy as associated with the Bohr orbit. Further, under the same conditions referred to above for the Bohr model, if the atom is induced to absorb some energy, then the electron is <i>promoted</i> from one orbital to another. Since the energy of the electron in the new orbital is different from that in the first, the electron has changed energy levels.</p>
<p class="indent">As in the Bohr model, only certain values of energy level are allowed. The energy is quantized. One important distinction between this model and the Bohr model, however, is that the quantization of the energy levels arises perfectly naturally from the mathematics used to describe the orbitals. In the Bohr model the quantization is an artificial constraint imposed to fit the observed data.</p>
<p class="indent">The orbital depicted in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> is spherically symmetrical and is called an <i>s</i> orbital (for historical reasons). Its full name is 1<i>s</i>. The number 1 is a quantum number, in this case known as the <i>principal quantum number</i> (the same quantum number as in the Bohr model). The electronic structure of hydrogen is written as 1 <i>s</i><sup>1</sup> (&#x2018;one-<i>s</i>-one&#x2019;). This tells us that there is a single electron (denoted by the superscript) in the <i>s</i>-orbital of the first shell.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>Shell</i>: a set of energy levels all of which have the same principal quantum number, <i>n</i>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Any orbital can accommodate up to just <i>two</i> electrons, never more. Certain properties of electrons are treated conveniently as if the electrons spin about an axis passing through a diameter of the electron (the <i>particle model</i>), rather like the earth spins about an axis every 24 hours. When there are two electrons in an orbital, one is said to <i>rotate</i> or <i>spin</i> in one direction and the second in the other. This is unfortunate terminology perhaps, but in common usage. The <i>spin quantum number</i> differentiates between the two directions of spin and takes the values +&#x00BD; or &#x2212;&#x00BD;. This spin is not to be confused with the notion of electrons rotating about, or orbiting, the nucleus.</p>
<p class="indent">The hydrogen atom contains a single proton. The next element after hydrogen is helium with two protons &#x2014; and so two electrons. The second electron also resides in the 1<i>s</i> orbital and the electronic structure of helium is written as 1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> (&#x2018;one-<i>s</i>-two&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="indent">Not all orbital functions are spherical. In fact, only <i>s</i> orbitals are spherically symmetrical. A second group of orbitals are called <i>p</i> orbitals. There are three distinct <i>p</i> orbitals. There are no <i>p</i> orbitals in the <i>n</i> = 1 shell, but<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Elements and periodicity</a> there are three in all other shells. Each of the three 2<i>p</i> orbitals contains two lobes (<a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>) and are respectively orientated along the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> axes. Again, the origin of the letter <i>p</i> is historical. The electron density is shown for one of the 2<i>p</i> orbitals in <a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a> (left). Orbitals known as <i>d</i> orbitals are more complex again. Four of the <i>d</i> orbital functions possess four lobes (<a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>, centre) and the fifth (the <i>d</i><sub><i>z</i><sup>2</sup></sub> orbital) has two lobes with a further ring of electron density surrounding those two lobes (<a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>, right).</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The periodic table</h2>
<p class="noindent">The name most commonly associated with the development of the periodic table is Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published an important document in 1869. He described a periodic table and left gaps in it where he predicted that then unknown elements should occur. His predictions were based upon the observations of <i>periodicity</i> in the properties of the elements. However, other chemists made enormously important contributions as well. In particular, John Newlands, an English chemist, observed in 1864 that patterns existed in the properties of the elements. When the elements are arranged in order of atomic weight, he commented that the properties of the eighth element resembled those of the first, those of the ninth resemble those of the second, and so on. He divided the elements into periods and groups according to his &#x2018;law of octaves&#x2019;. In 1864 a German chemist called Lothar Meyer published a partial periodic table and revised his table later in 1869. Much earlier (1817), a German chemist Johann Dobereiner noted that there were a number of groups of elements (which he called triads) such as calcium, strontium, and barium with related properties for which the atomic weight of the centre element is about the average of the first and last.</p>
<p class="indent">Originally, the periodic table was constructed as a way to organize the chemical elements (many of those known now were unknown at the time) into groups of elements with related chemical properties. For instance, elements forming oxides with the stoichiometric formula M<sub>2</sub>O are grouped together. Elements forming oxides with the stoichiometric formula MO are placed into a different group. From a more modern perspective, one can appreciate that since chemical properties rely upon <i>electronic structure</i>, then a periodic table based upon elemental electronic structures is most appropriate. Perhaps the magnitude of the achievements of Newlands, Meyer, Mendeleev, and others in constructing the periodic table is appreciated more when it is realized that their work was carried out nearly half a century before the first even slightly sensible ideas concerning atomic structure were proposed by Rutherford.</p>

<p class="noindent2"><i>Stoichiometry</i>: the relative proportions of the elements in a given compound.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Over the years, many forms of the periodic table have been devised but the current standard table is that shown on the inside cover of this book. The standard form is not necessarily the best, but as it is the most commonly used it is important to be familiar with it. The elements in the standard table are organized into four blocks, <i>s</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>f</i>. The <i>f</i>-block elements are placed as a distinct block below the other three blocks, not for any chemical reason but for ease of organization on the printed page. On moving from left to right across the <i>p</i> block, successive elements gain an additional electron until the <i>p</i> level is filled with the final element of that <i>p</i> block element row. The situation is related for the <i>s</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>f</i> block elements. Helium (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) does not have any <i>p</i> electrons but nevertheless is placed over neon rather than beryllium (2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) because in helium and neon, the final electron completes a <i>valence shell</i>. Hydrogen is placed over lithium as both have <i>n s</i><sup>1</sup> configurations. However, hydrogen has the ability to accept a single electron to complete the valence shell, as does fluorine. Some tables therefore place<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Elements and periodicity</a> hydrogen in two groups, 1 and 17, to reflect this, or even as a lone element apart from the main body of the table. Note that a successful periodic table allows the user to determine the electronic structure of most if not all of the elements.</p>

<p class="noindent">Periodic trends which apply to specific areas of the periodic table are discussed in later chapters. This section addresses a few general properties across the whole table.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the clearest classifications for the elements is into metals or non-metals. There are distinctions of metal and non-metal properties (<a href="#tab1.2">Table 1.2</a>) in addition to clear differences in chemistries. The reasons for this are associated with the abilities of the atoms of the elements to bond together and these are associated with their electronic structures. Metallic properties are more apparent to the left and to the bottom of the periodic table. In practice, a number of elements display properties somewhat intermediate between those of metal and non-metal. These are referred to as semi-metallic or metalloid. What constitutes semi-metallic is slightly open to interpretation but a diagonal set of elements (<a href="#tab1.3">Table 1.3</a>) across the <i>p</i>-block elements is referred to as metalloid. Some texts treat a slightly different set of elements as metalloid. Some elements show exceptional properties. So, while carbon as graphite is regarded as a non-metal, it conducts electricity well.</p>

<p class="indent">Clear trends in physical properties of the elements are apparent and illustrated for just one property, melting point, in <a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>. Metals tend to have high melting points although there is a large range. Some non-metals and metalloids (carbon, boron) have high melting points. Melting points tend to decrease down the group for Groups 1 and 2 and the <i>p</i>-block elements (with exceptions) but increase down the group for the <i>d</i>-block elements.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The abrupt transition between carbon and nitrogen is interesting. Nitrogen is able to satisfy the octet rule (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) through the formation of a triple bond between two atoms. The resulting species, N<sub>2</sub>, interacts relatively little with adjacent molecules and so the melting point is low. Carbon cannot satisfy the octet rule by forming a diatomic species since to do so would require a quadruple bond, not possible for <i>p</i>-block elements. It is able, however, to achieve an octet structure by making bonds in lattices, either as graphite or diamond (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.7">Section 5.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some elements lose electrons more easily than others. Others show tendencies to acquire electrons. The ease by which electrons are lost from a neutral atom is measured by the first ionization energy. This is the energy change, in <a href="#eq1.1">Eqn 1.1</a>, and values of the first ionization energy are displayed in <a href="#fig1.7">Figs. 1.7</a> and <a href="#fig1.8">1.8</a>. It is also possible to measure second and subsequent ionization energies which are the corresponding energy changes in the formation of M<sup>2+</sup>(g) and so on.</p>
<p class="fig2" style="margin-left:-7em;" id="eq1.1">M(g) &#x2192; M<sup>+</sup>(g) + e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>(g)</p>
<p class="indent">The ease with which the outermost electron is removed depends upon the distance of the electron from the nucleus. This seems reasonable given the existence of an inverse square law governing the attraction of the nucleus to the surrounding electrons. There are other factors, however, including the charge on the nucleus and the effect of any other electrons in the atom or ion. The greater the nuclear charge, the more strongly held is the electron. However, the nuclear charge effectively is lessened, or <i>screened</i>, by any intervening electrons. Although the nuclear charge increases on descending a group in the periodic table, this is more than compensated for by the greater distance of the outermost electron from the nucleus and the screening effect<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Elements and periodicity</a> of the inner electrons. The consequence is that ionization enthalpies fall on descending a group in the periodic table.</p>

<p class="indent">Ionization energies increase on moving from left to right along a row in the periodic table. On moving along the row, the nuclear charge increases, causing the atom&#x2019;s electrons to move close to the nucleus and the energy levels, including the outermost one, to drop in energy. The practical consequence of this is that electrons are removed far less easily to the right of the periodic table. Elements with low ionization energies lie to the left of the table and to the bottom of the table. The chemistry of these elements is dominated by tendencies to lose electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">The tendency for atoms of neutral elements to gain electrons is measured by the electron affinity. This is numerically equal to the negative of the electron gain enthalpy, which is the enthalpy change when a gas-phase atom gains an electron (shown in <a href="#eq1.2">Eqn 1.2</a> for chlorine).</p>

<p class="indent">Inspection of <a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a> shows that elements to the right and top of the periodic table show the greatest tendencies to gain electrons. This feature is extremely important in their chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent">Once in a molecule, there is no particular reason for the distribution of electrons in bonds between different atoms to be equal. Some atoms <i>in molecules</i> tend to attract bonded electrons far more strongly than others. This tendency is put on a quantitative basis by the <i>electronegativity</i> concept (see <a href="#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>). Strongly electronegative elements in molecules strongly attract electrons. Weakly electronegative elements in molecules show little tendency to attract electrons. Such elements are sometimes referred to as electropositive.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">There are several electronegativity scales in use and the basis of each is different. Perhaps the best known is the Pauling scale (<a href="#fig1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>). This is based upon differences between observed and calculated vales of bond dissociation energies in molecules AA, BB, and AB. The figure demonstrates that the <i>most</i> electronegative elements are positioned to the <i>right</i> and <i>top</i> of the periodic table while the <i>least</i> electronegative are to the <i>bottom</i> and <i>left</i> of the table. In a molecule containing a bond A&#x2014;B, if B is more electronegative than A, then the charge distribution in that bond is such that B is more negatively charged. This is important, since partial positive and negative<a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Elements and periodicity</a> charges in molecules are important in defining at which points given reagents will attack.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Size is a fundamental property of atoms. It is not easy to assign values to size, however. Since electrons are contained within orbitals that do not have a definite limit, there is no precise edge to an atom isolated in space. It is therefore necessary to <i>define</i> size in some way. The size could be defined in molecules such as H<sub>2</sub> as one-half of the internuclear distance, the <i>single non-polar covalent radius</i>. Not all the elements form species M<sub>2</sub> containing a single M&#x2014;M bond, O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> are examples. In such cases, a radius might be inferred from the lengths of bonds to elements of known size. There are other definitions of size. In metals, the <i>metallic radius</i> is one-half of the internuclear distance between two metal atoms. This measure of radius gives values that are not precisely the same as covalent radius. When the valence shells of atoms are in non-bonded contact, the non-bonded radius is one half of the internuclear distance. This radius is the van der Waals radius. It has great importance in the packing of atoms and molecules in crystals.</p>
<p class="indent">The size of an isolated atom can be <i>calculated</i> once an appropriate definition of size is defined. One such definition might be the distance between the nucleus and the distance of maximum electron density for the valence orbitals. These calculations are not trivial. The results of one such set of calculations are portrayed in <a href="#fig1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>. Size increases <i>down</i> the groups. Size decreases from left to right across the table. This is because increasing nuclear charge draws in the valence shell more tightly. Atoms to the left of table are larger because the inner electrons screen the valence electrons from the full nuclear charge. On moving across the periodic table from left to right, the size decreases as the increasing nuclear charge exerts an increasing effect through the core of inner electrons.</p>
