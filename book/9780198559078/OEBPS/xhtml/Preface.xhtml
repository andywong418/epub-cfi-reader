<p class="noindent" style="width:100%;">The study of the dynamics of elementary gas phase reactions addresses fundamental questions about how atoms and molecules interact and undergo chemical change. The aims of this Primer are to introduce reaction dynamics at an amenable second or third year undergraduate level, and to provide a unified treatment of the dynamics and kinetics of elementary chemical reactions. Many of the key concepts are illustrated by recent experimental results, and an extensive list of references to the original scientific literature is provided.</p>
<p class="indent" style="width:100%;">I would particularly like to thank Javier Aoiz and David Manolopoulos, both for supplying data for figures, and for critically reading the Primer. I am also indebted to Simon Gatenby for proof-reading the manuscript, and for helping with the drawing of numerous figures.</p>
