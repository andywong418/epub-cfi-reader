<p class="noindent" style="width:100%;">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="indent" style="width:100%;">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Mark Brouard has produced an authoritative and clearly written account of <i>Reaction Dynamics</i> detailing fundamental aspects of chemical reactions occurring in the gas phase. This Primer will stimulate all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
