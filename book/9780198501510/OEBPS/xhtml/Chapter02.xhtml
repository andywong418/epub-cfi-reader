<h2 class="main"><b>2.1 Occurrence of the 3</b><b><i>d</i></b><b> elements in nature</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">While the <i>transition elements</i> as a whole are widely distributed throughout the Earth&#x2019;s crust, by far the most abundant is iron. In fact, of all the elements encountered within the crust, iron is fourth after oxygen, silicon and aluminium, comprising about 6% of the total crustal composition. This is not so surprising given the widely accepted belief that the Earth&#x2019;s metallic core is mostly made up of this element (see below).</p>
<p class="indent">The next most abundant <i>first-row transition elements</i> are titanium (<i>ca</i>. 0.6%), and manganese (<i>ca</i>. 0.1%) while the remainder (V, Cr, Co, Ni and Cu) are more sparsely distributed (less than 0.01%).</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of the elements occur in minerals as oxides, hydrated oxides and carbonates, although sulphides and arsenides are also significant. The principal minerals and other sources of the elements are shown in <a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Vanadium is found naturally in some living systems, particularly sea squirts, tunicates and some mushrooms, but its role is far from clear. The element also occurs in certain petroleum deposits, particularly from Venezuela, and can be extracted from them as a vanadyl porphyrin compound.</p>
<p class="indent">Trace amounts of chromium, as oxides, are responsible for the characteristic colours of ruby and emerald. Gem-quality corundum (<i>&#x03B3;</i>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) containing traces of iron is commonly known as sapphire. Manganese occurs in over 300 different and widely distributed minerals, and as a result of weathering, colloidal particles of manganese and other metal (iron, copper, cobalt) oxides are continually washed into the sea. On agglomeration and being compacted on a geological time scale, &#x2018;manganese nodules&#x2019; have been <a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Chapter 2 Metals and solid compounds</a>formed which, when dried, contain between 15 and 30% manganese. This is on the verge of being economically viable for extraction.</p>
<p class="indent">Cobalt and nickel frequently coexist in minerals, often in association with copper and lead, and in combination with arsenic, antimony and sulphur. Elemental nickel is also found, alloyed with iron, in meteors and is believed to occur in the Earth&#x2019;s core.</p>

<h2 class="main"><b>2.2 Structure of solids</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The structures of many solids can be conveniently represented in terms of the close-packing of spheres, the spheres representing, to a first approximation, atoms, simple or complex ions, or even molecules.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig2.1">
<img src="../images/fig14.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><b>Fig. 2.1</b> Close-packing of spheres</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">Metals are the easiest solids to describe in this way, since the atoms are all of the same size and they can pack closely together forming two distinct arrangements: <i>hexagonally close-packed</i> (hcp) and <i>cubic close-packed</i> (ccp). In the latter the spheres have a face-centred cubic (fcc) arrangement (see <a href="#fig2.4">Fig.2.4</a>, <a href="#page_25">p.25</a>). The former is shown in <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> where the third layer is superimposed directly over the first, giving an ABA&#x2026; pattern of layer alternation. In the latter, the third layer is imposed above the gaps in the first layer, giving an ABC&#x2026; pattern of layer alternation.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of &#x2018;holes&#x2019; in these close-packed structures: the tetrahedral (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2(a)</a>) and the octahedral &#x2018;hole&#x2019; (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2(b)</a>). The former is generated by a planar triangle of touching spheres which are capped by the fourth sphere lying in the dip between them. If there are <i>n</i> spheres in the solid, there are 2<i>n</i> tetrahedral holes (the apex of the &#x2018;tetrahedron&#x2019; can be &#x2018;up&#x2019; or &#x2018;down&#x2019;). The octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; are generated by two oppositely directed triangles of touching spheres and if there are <i>n</i> spheres, there are <i>n</i> octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 2 Metals and solid compounds</a></p>
<p class="indent">Although the hexagonal and cubic close-packed arrangements are frequently met, there are other ways in which spheres can pack almost as efficiently, body-centred cubic (bcc) being relatively common in metals (<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). Metals which are tightly close-packed at low temperatures adopt a body-centred structure at high temperatures. This is due mainly to the requirement for a less-compact structure as atomic vibrations increase with temperature.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alloys</i> are formed by melting two or more metals and then cooling the mixture. If the mixture results in a random distribution of the atoms of one metal among those of the others, then a solid solution is formed. There are two types of such solutions: substitutional and interstitial. The former is produced when the atoms of the component metals have very similar radii and the latter when the atoms of one component are very small relative to the other&#x2019;s. The former situation occurs in alloys of nickel and copper, and the latter occurs with non-metals such as H, B, C or N, these atoms being accommodated in the &#x2018;holes&#x2019; in the host metal whose basic structure is preserved.</p>
<p class="indent">When molten metal mixtures are cooled, phases with definite structure can be formed which may not be related to the structures of the alloy components. These materials are intermetallic compounds, and <i>&#x03B2;</i>-brass (CuZn) falls in this category (see also <a href="#page_25">p.25</a>).</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>Titanium</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The metal cannot be made by reduction of TiO<sub>2</sub> with carbon due to the formation of the extremely stable carbide TiC and, furthermore, hydrogen reduction of the dioxide at 900&#x00B0;C gives only Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. However the metal is obtained by the <i>Kroll process</i> which involves chlorination of iron titanate in the presence of carbon, to give TiCl<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="imgc"><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:mn>F</m:mn><m:mn>e</m:mn><m:mn>T</m:mn><m:mn>i</m:mn><m:msub><m:mn>O</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mn>7</m:mn><m:mn>C</m:mn><m:msub><m:mn>l</m:mn><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mn>6</m:mn><m:mn>C</m:mn><m:mo>&#x2192;</m:mo><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:mn>T</m:mn><m:mn>i</m:mn><m:mn>C</m:mn><m:msub><m:mn>l</m:mn><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:mn>F</m:mn><m:mn>e</m:mn><m:mn>C</m:mn><m:msub><m:mn>l</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mn>6</m:mn><m:mn>C</m:mn><m:mn>O</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math></p>
<p class="noindent">The reaction is carried out at 900&#x00B0;C, and the TiCl<sub>4</sub> is fractionally distilled from FeCl<sub>3</sub> and other impurities. The tetrachloride is then reduced to titanium metal by magnesium at 1000&#x00B0;C, the magnesium chloride formed being volatilised out, and excess magnesium dissolved away in dilute HCl.</p>

<p class="noindent">The titanium, formed as a sponge, can be cast into ingots, but very pure metal is best obtained by decomposition of vaporised TiI<sub>4</sub> by a hot wire.</p>
<p class="indent">The metal is less dense than iron, stronger than aluminium, and almost as corrosion resistant as platinum. For these, and other reasons, the metal is particularly useful in the construction of very high performance combustion engines, aircraft frames, marine equipment and industrial plants.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">At normal temperatures, titanium is hexagonal, but at about 820&#x00B0;C it undergoes a phase change to the <i>&#x03B2;</i> form which has a cubic structure.</p>

<h3 class="main2"><b>Vanadium</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Vanadium ores are converted to V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> or metavanadates (&#x005B;VO<sub>3</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) by roasting with carbon. Since the metal is extremely reactive towards carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, particularly at high temperatures, it is difficult to produce free of impurities. The pure metal can be made by reduction of VCl<sub>4</sub> or V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, by the thermal decomposition of VI<sub>4</sub>, or by electrochemical reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">Vanadium, like titanium, is corrosion resistant and hard. Its main use is in alloying with steels giving ductile and shock-resistant <i>ferrovanadium</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">If pure chromium is needed, chromite is converted into chromate (&#x005B;CrO<sub>4</sub>&#x005D;<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>) by alkali and oxygen. This is transformed into dichromate which is reduced by carbon to Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the pure metal being obtained by reduction of the oxide with Al or Si.</p>
<p class="indent">The metal is hard and brittle but has low ductility at ordinary temperatures which significantly reduces its use when pure. However, chromium is extremely resistant to normal corrosive agents which is why it has been extensively used as an electroplated protective coating. Most chromium metal is used in the production of non-ferrous alloys.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Manganese</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The metal is obtained by reduction of various oxides by Al, and its physical and chemical properties are quite similar to iron although it is harder and more brittle. Its main use is in alloying with iron to give <i>ferromanganese</i>, important in the hardening of steels.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Manganese has four allotropes, but only the <i>&#x03B1;</i> form is stable at room temperature, having a body-centred cubic structure.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Iron</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Iron is made industrially by reduction with coke in a blast furnace. The reducing agent is CO which converts the iron oxides to the metal and is itself oxidised to CO<sub>2</sub>. Limestone is added to the process to remove sand and clays as slag. The molten iron produced is known as &#x2018;cast-iron&#x2019; or &#x2018;pig-iron&#x2019; and is impure, containing about 4% carbon and variable amounts of silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. Synthesis gas (H<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; CO) may also be used as a reducing agent, at a lower temperature than the coke process, the metal produced having sponge-like characteristics. This technology is an alternative when coke is not easily available, and is appropriate for small-scale production of steel <i>via</i> electric arc furnace refining (see below).</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Iron exists as several allotropes: a room temperature form, <i>&#x03B1;</i>, which is body-centred cubic, and higher temperature forms (<i>&#x03B2;</i>, apparently body-centred cubic; &#x03B3;, face-centred cubic; and &#x03B4;, body-centred cubic).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The &#x2018;cast-iron&#x2019; is hard and brittle, but if the non-metallic impurities are removed by oxidation using Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &#x2018;wrought-iron&#x2019; can be produced which is tougher and more malleable, and ideal for mechanical working. This is rarely carried out now, since the bulk of &#x2018;cast-iron&#x2019; is converted to steel by the basic oxygen process (BOP) or by open hearth or electric arc furnace techniques. These essentially employ high temperature oxidation <i>via</i> O<sub>2</sub> which drives off most of the non-metals, leaving between 0.5 and 1.5% carbon and traces of <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chapter 2 Metals and solid compounds</a>sulphur and phosphorus, without significant oxidation of the iron and trace metals. This affords &#x2018;mild steel&#x2019;, which is stronger and more workable than &#x2018;cast-iron&#x2019;, but which can be hardened by alternately heating to red heat and quenching in water or mineral oil, and &#x2018;tempered&#x2019; by reheating to 200&#x2013;300&#x00B0;C and cooling more slowly. The hardness, resilience and ductility of the steel can be controlled by varying the temperature and rate of cooling, and through the precise composition, particularly the carbon content, of the steel. Alloying with other metals also dramatically affects the properties of steel.</p>
<p class="indent">On a small scale, iron can be produced by the reduction of the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or by reacting the impure metal with CO under pressure, which gives &#x005B;Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>&#x005D; (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.1">Section 5.1</a>). This carbonyl may subsequently be thermally decomposed to the pure element. It is also produced by electro-deposition from aqueous solutions of Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> salts.</p>
<p class="indent">The pure metal is not especially hard, and is readily attacked by moist air forming hydrated oxides, <i>i.e.</i>, rust. It is easily magnetised. When finely divided, iron is pyrophoric and reacts with ammonia at 400&#x00B0;C giving a nitride which is the basis of &#x2018;nitriding&#x2019; &#x2013; another process for the hardening of steels.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Cobalt</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Cobalt is frequently obtained as a by-product of copper production. However, when arsenic-containing ores are roasted (volatile AS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> being recovered as a valuable side-product), the mixed ores can be leached with sulphuric acid which dissolves out the iron, nickel and cobalt, leaving copper behind. The iron and nickel salts are precipitated from the acid solution by addition of lime, and the cobalt is separated by precipitation with NaOCl, which affords basic cobalt oxide. On heating, this breaks down into Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CoO which afford the metal on reduction with red-hot charcoal.</p>
<p class="indent">Pure cobalt is harder and less reactive than iron. It may be combined with other metals to give magnetic alloys, <i>e.g., alnico</i> (Al, Ni and Co) which is a light, permanent magnet up to 25 times more powerful than magnetised iron. Addition of cobalt to iron affords a high-temperature alloy.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Cobalt exists as two allotropes: <i>&#x03B1;</i> which has a hexagonal close-packed structure, and <i>&#x03B2;</i> which is face-centred cubic.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Nickel</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Earth&#x2019;s core is believed to be made up of an iron&#x2013;nickel alloy, and elemental nickel is found alloyed with iron in meteorites. The industrial production of nickel is complicated, depending on the source of the ore, which may be oxide or sulphide. In general, the sulphides are roasted in air to give NiO which is then reduced by carbon to impure metal. Refinement can be achieved either electrolytically or by reaction with CO at about 50&#x00B0;C and normal pressures, which affords &#x005B;Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>&#x005D; (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.1">Section 5.1</a>). The tetracarbonyl is easily thermally decomposed to extremely pure metal.</p>
<p class="indent">The pure metal is malleable and ductile, and has relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities. It is used in the production of both ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, the former including steels used in armoured plating and stainless steels (up to 8% Ni). The latter alloys are extensive, including <i>EPNS</i> or electroplated nickel silver which is used in tableware, corrosion-resistant <i>Monel metal</i> (58% Ni, 32% Cu, traces of Mn and Fe), <i>nichrome</i> (60% Ni, 40% Cr) which has a very small temperature coefficient of <a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, Chapter 2 Metals and solid compounds</a>electrical resistance, and <i>invar</i> (Ni, Fe) which has a very small coefficient of expansion.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Nickel has a face-centred cubic structure.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Nickel is quite resistant to corrosion and is sometimes used as an undercoat for electroplated chromium. It reacts extremely slowly with F<sub>2</sub> and with corrosive fluorides and so is used in equipment for handling these reactive substances.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2"><b>Copper</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Crushed copper-containing ores are concentrated by froth-flotation, the main impurities being Fe, Ni, Au and Ag. The concentrate is then melted with sand (SiO<sub>2</sub>) at 1400&#x2013;1450&#x00B0;C, iron silicate slags and a matte containing Cu<sub>2</sub>S and FeS being formed. The matte is further heated with sand and oxygen which removes most of the iron as oxide in slag, leaving Cu<sub>2</sub>O which is then reduced to blister copper. The metal is purified electrolytically. It may also be extracted from aqueous acid solution using organic solvents containing chelating ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">The metal is non-magnetic, strong but soft, malleable, ductile, fairly corrosion resistant and has high thermal and electrical conductivity. The last two properties are mainly responsible for the enormous usage of the metal in electric motors, electronic equipment, plumbing installations and building construction, and in household appliances, jewellery and coinage.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Copper has a face-centred cubic structure.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Copper forms many alloys, the most common of which are <i>bronze</i> (Cu &#x002B; 7&#x2013;10% Sn), <i>brass</i> (Cu &#x002B; 10&#x2013;40% Zn which causes the colour to change from a bronze hue to reddish yellow), <i>nickel silver, Monel metal</i>, aluminium bronzes (Cu &#x002B; Al), phosphor bronzes (Cu &#x002B; up to 10% Sn and 0.35% P) and <i>cupro-nickels</i> (up to 80% Cu, the rest mainly Ni) used in &#x2018;silver&#x2019; coinage. Brass is also used extensively because it is stronger and more corrosion-resistant than pure copper.</p>
<p class="indent">In moist air, copper metal assumes a green coating or patina of hydroxo-carbonates and hydroxo-sulphates, and many old buildings whose roofs were originally constructed of the metal now have this malachite-green colour as a result of atmospheric corrosion.</p>

Among the first-row transition metal compounds which adopt this structure are the <i>monoxides</i>, MO (M = Ti, Fe and Ni). Pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>, can be described as a distorted NaCl-type structure in which rod-shaped S-S<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> ions are centred on the Cl positions, oriented so that they are inclined away from the cubic axis. A similar structure is adopted by MS<sub>2</sub> (M = Mn, Co and Ni).</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Zinc blende or sphalerite and wurtzite structures, ZnS</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">In a close-packed lattice of sulphide ions, zinc ions usually occupy tetrahedral holes because they are smaller than sulphide ions. If the latter form a ccp array, then the zinc blende structure is formed, but if they form a hcp array then the wurtzite form is adopted, each ion being four-coordinated in both structures. CuCl adopts the zinc blende structure whereas MnS has a wurtzite structure.</p>

<p class="noindent">This structure is based on an expanded, distorted hcp anion array, the cations occupying octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;. The arsenic ions are trigonal prismatically coordinated by the nickel ions. Many binary metal <i>monosulphides</i> MS (M = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni) adopt this structure, as well as many examples of MSe, MTe, MP, MAs, and MSb.</p>

<p class="noindent">This structure is based on an expanded fee lattice of the cations. This generates two types of tetrahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;, both of which are occupied by the anions. The cation adopts eight-coordination with a cubic arrangement of F<sup>&#x2013;</sup> around the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. The anion is four-coordinate, but if the positions and numbers of cations and anions are reversed, the <i>antifluorite</i> structure is formed.</p>

This structure is adopted by some <i>dioxides</i> MO<sub>2</sub> (M = Cr, Mn) and <i>difluorides</i> MF<sub>2</sub> (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni). CrF<sub>2</sub> (Cr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub><i><sub>g</sub></i><sup>3</sup><i>e<sub>g</sub></i><sup>1</sup>) has a distorted structure in which 4F<sup>&#x2013;</sup> are closer to the metal than the other two, a consequence of Jahn&#x2013;Teller distortion (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#page_16">p. 16</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Gemstones are formed when Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystals contain transition metal impurities.

<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">If a crystal is introduced into an electric field and it experiences a reversible contraction or elongation, or the crystal generates an electric field when it is stressed (pressure), it is exhibiting the <i>piezoelectric effect</i> This behaviour is only observed in crystals whose unit cells do not have a centre of symmetry, <i>e.g</i>., the zinc blende form of ZnS.</p>
<p class="sidebar">When crystals contain permanent dipoles as a result of unit cells not having a centre of symmetry, and the dipoles are uniformly oriented in domains (like ferromagnets), they can exhibit <i>ferroelectric</i> behaviour. This means that the polarisation of the crystal increases with increasing electric field, and when that field is removed, there is a permanent polarisation and the materials can have very large dielectric constants. BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, which has a distorted perovskite structure between 5 and 120&#x00B0;C, exhibits this behaviour because the close-packed arrangement formed by the Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and O<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> ions generates octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; rather too large for the Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>. The titanium ion can rattle within the O<sub>6</sub> cage and so is easily polarised towards one O atom. The effect in the extended solid phase is domain polarisation. BaTiO<sub>3</sub> is used extensively in the manufacture of capacitors with very large capacitance and also has useful non-linear optical properties (frequency doubling).</p>

<p class="noindent">In the mineral perovskite, CaTiO<sub>3</sub>, the A cation (Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) is much larger than the B cation (Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup>), and the oxide ions and calcium form a ccp array with the small Ti<sup>4&#x002B;</sup> ion occupying those octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; formed exclusively by oxide ions. The structure is frequently distorted, partly as a consequence of the small size of the B cation, and is adopted by many ABO<sub>3</sub> oxides.

<h4 class="main3"><i>Spinels, AB</i><sub>2</sub><i>O</i><sub>4</sub></h4>
<p class="noindent">The mineral spinel is MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> which has a structure based on a ccp array of oxide ions in which the metals are dispersed in tetrahedral and octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;. There are twice as many tetrahedral as there are octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; and both are large enough to accommodate first-row transition and other metal cations. The octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; are larger than the tetrahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;, so larger metal ions would normally occupy them in the lattice, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p class="indent">In natural spinel, one-eighth of the tetrahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; are occupied by Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions and one-half of the octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019; are occupied by Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>. This structure is adopted by most mixed metal oxides of the type &#x039C;<sup>II</sup>&#x039C;<sup>III</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (<i>e.g</i>., FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and by some of the type M<sup>IV</sup>M<sup>II</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (<i>e.g</i>., SnCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). This structural type is sometimes represented as A&#x005B;B<sub>2</sub>&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub> where the square brackets enclose the ions in the octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;. This is the <i>normal spinel</i> structure.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 2 Metals and solid compounds</a></p>
<p class="indent">A very important variant is the <i>inverse spinel</i> structure, B&#x005B;AB&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub>, in which half the B ions are in the tetrahedral sites and the other half are in the octahedral sites together with the A ions. Such a situation occurs when the A cations have a stronger preference for octahedral coordination than do the B cations. It seems that the majority of compounds of the type &#x039C;<sup>IV</sup>&#x039C;<sup>II</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (<i>e.g</i>., Zn&#x005B;ZnTi&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub>) and many of the type M<sup>II</sup>M<sup>III</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (<i>e.g</i>., Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x005B;Co<sup>II</sup>Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub>, Fe&#x005B;Fe<sup>II</sup>Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x005B;Ni<sup>II</sup>Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x005D;O<sub>4</sub>) are inverse spinels.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Site selection in spinels and other systems</i>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">A simple explanation of preference of M<sup>II</sup> and M<sup>III</sup> in the spinels for octahedral or tetrahedral sites can be provided by crystal field theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Most Cr<sup>III</sup> spinels adopt a normal spinel structure (<a href="#tab2.2">Table 2.2</a>), the reason being due mainly to the very high octahedral site preference energy of the <i>d</i><sup>3</sup><i><sup></sup></i> metal ion in the relatively weak oxide crystal field. The same is true for Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> which contains <i>d</i><sup>5</sup> Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, which has no site preference, and <i>d<sup>4</sup></i> Mn<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>, which does (octahedral). The cobalt oxide CO<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a special case since Co<sup>III</sup> is spin-paired. Since there is substantial CFSE gained from a low-spin <i>d</i><sup>6</sup> configuration, the Co<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> ion prefers an octahedral site. Because the energy difference between Co<sup>II</sup> in a tetrahedral and an octahedral environment is not very significant, CO<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> adopts a normal spinel structure.</p>
<p class="indent">However, a typical example of an <i>inverse</i> spinel is NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in which Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> is high spin because of the weak crystal field exerted by the oxide lattice. There is no net crystal field stabilisation for a <i>d</i><sup>5</sup> metal ion in this symmetry, and so Fe<sup>III</sup> is relatively indifferent to site location. However, <i>d</i><sup>8</sup> Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> has a significant octahedral preference, and the compound adopts the inverse arrangement. Magnetite, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, also has an inverse spinel structure, again because Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> has no site preference, and while <i>d</i><sup>6</sup> Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> has only a small octahedral preference, it is obviously sufficient to tip the balance from normal to inverse.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><i>Superconductivity</i>. At a critical temperature, <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, superconductors exhibit no electrical resistance and are also capable of excluding magnetic fields (the Meissner effect). Most materials which exhibit this effect only do so at temperatures close to that of liquid He. However, compounds have been discovered in which <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> has risen above the boiling point of N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="sidebar">Among the materials which exhibit superconductivity are perovskites containing copper in the octahedral sites but which are deficient in oxygen, <i>e.g</i>., MCuO<sub>3&#x2013;</sub><i><sub>X</sub></i>. A typical compound is YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> which has a perovskite superstructure, with <i>ca</i>. 7/9 of the oxygen positions vacant so that <i>ca</i>. 2/3 of the copper ions have square-pyramidal coordination and the remainder are square-planar. Because of the inclusion of Y<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions, the average oxidation state of the copper is &#x002B;2.33, indicating that this is a mixed-valence compound containing Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Cu<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
