<p class="noindent">It appears that 13 metals are essential for plants and animals, of which four, Na, K, Mg and Ca, the so-called <i>bulk metals</i>, are present in relatively large amounts. The other nine are the so-called <i>trace metals</i>, which includes V &#x2192; Cu, Zn and Mo. Of this group, iron, copper and zinc are at the top end of the scale; the other metals are present in extremely low concentrations. There is, as yet, no detectable role for Ti in biochemical processes.</p>

<p class="indent">Iron and copper are essential for most, if not all, life forms. These metals are characterised by readily interchangeable oxidations states: Fe<sup>III</sup>/Fe<sup>II</sup> and Cu<sup>II</sup>/Cu<sup>I</sup>, and so are important in electron-transfer systems, <i>i.e.</i>, redox reactions. They are also involved in oxygen-storage and -transport. The other 3<i>d</i> block metals which have so far been identified as active in life processes occur in enzymes, Nature&#x2019;s catalysts, and serve a variety of purposes.</p>

<p class="indent">The functions of metals in biology may be generally classified into two major groups: metalloproteins, which are further sub-divided into transport and storage functions, and metalloenzymes; and non-protein systems, also involved in storage and transport, and in photo-redox activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains. Polypeptide chains are comprised of amino acids usually connected by a peptide (or amido) bond (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). Some commonly encountered naturally occurring amino acids are shown in <a href="#fig6.2">Fig 6.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>metalloproteins</i> incorporate one or more metal atoms as a normal part of the tertiary structure of the protein. <i>Metalloenzymes</i> are a sub-class of this group, and the term is applied to systems which not only require the participation of metal ions at the active site to function, but also bind the metal ion or ions strongly, even in the resting (non-functioning) condition. In a number of enzymes which are structurally characterised, the metal ion is bound in an unusual, perhaps enforced, stereochemistry, known as the <i>entatic state</i>, which appears to enhance its ability to bind and/or activate the ) substrate.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible in some cases to remove the metal ions and then either restore them or replace them with other ions without serious disruption of the protein structure. The demetallated system is known as an <i>apoprotein</i>, which implies that the metalloprotein function is virtually totally recovered upon reconstitution with the naturally occurring metal ion.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, many of the r&#x00F4;les of first-row transition metals in biological chemistry are outlined. The examples chosen are either those where a structure of at least one metalloprotein has been determined crytallographically, or where there are appropriate model complexes which mimic biological function realistically.</p>

<h2 class="main2"><b>6.1 Transport and storage</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In the following sections, particular mention is made of transport and storage of metals, especially Fe, electron transfer, and transport and storage of dioxygen.</p>
<h3 class="main2"><b>Transport</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Transition metal ions must be mobilised from their point of uptake from the environment, protected and delivered to the organs which require them, and stored, if there is an excess, until the metal is required. Part of the transport phenomenon requires passage of these metal cations across biological barriers, <i>i.e.</i>, cell membranes. The 3<i>d</i> metals usually precipitate, as hydrated oxides, at biological pH values and are frequently toxic since they can generate small amounts of radicals, <i>e.g.</i>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> or HO, which can attack and rupture the amino acid constants of proteins, thereby destroying the functions of metalloproteins and enzymes. To deal with these possibilities, the metal ion must be complexed by appropriate carrier/protective ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">Iron is probably the best understood metal in this respect, and its transportation modes differ in vertebrates (<i>e.g.</i>, humans) and in bacteria. In the former, iron is extremely efficiently recycled and very little is absorbed from diet or is excreted under normal conditions. Only about 1% of iron in the body is used at any one time (<i>e.g.</i>, in respiration or electron transfer processes) and the rest is stored. The transport proteins (<i>transferrins</i>) include serum transferrin and lactoferrin which is present in milk. These are monomeric species with molecular weights of <i>ca</i>. 80000) which bind two Fe<sup>III</sup> ions tightly but reversibly in two separated but linked domains. The formation or stability constant for the metal ions is in excess of 10<sup>20</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. The iron site in each domain appears to be six-coordinate, there being two phenolate ligands (tyrosine), one N (histidine), a monodentate carboxylate (aspartate) and a bidentate carbonate ion. The precise modes of action of transferrins are not fully understood but among their roles is protection of the body against invading microbes which require iron, presumably by collecting excess iron and delivering it to a storage protein.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 6.3</b> (a) Hydroxamate and (b) catecholate ligands</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent">Most micro-organisms require iron for growth, and in bacteria iron is mobilised by <i>non-protein</i> chelating ligands known as <i>siderophores</i>. These are widespread in nature, and are derived either from hydroxamate (<i>ferrichromes, ferrioxamines</i>) or catecholate (<i>enterobactins</i>) ligands (<a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>). These ligands provide O donor atoms to stabilise Fe<sup>III</sup> with stability constants in excess of 10<sup>30</sup> M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> (a biological example of high stability associated with chelation and hard acid/hard base pairing). The Fe<sup>III</sup> centres are high-spin and are kinetically labile which, of course, is important to the extraction and exchange of iron. This property also permits replacement of iron by other metals, including the kinetically stable Cr<sup>III</sup>, which allows detailed spectroscopie studies of the siderophore ligand superstructures, and by V<sup>IV</sup> which has facilitated X-ray crystallographic studies of an enterobactin complex. It appears that the mode of release of iron from siderophores involves reduction of the Fe<sup>III</sup> species to Fe<sup>II</sup> whose stability constants are significantly lowered (<i>ca</i>. 10 M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>).</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A demetallated siderophore, <i>desferrioxamine B</i>, has been used effectively in the treatment of iron overload diseases (p.90).</p></aside>

<p class="indent">Vanadium is extracted from soil and accumulated by a mushroom (<i>Amanita muscaria</i>). The metal, as V<sup>IV</sup>, is extracted as a low molecular weight complex, <i>amavadin</i>, which contains 2,2&#x2032;-(hydroximino)dipropionic acid &#x005B;HIPDAH<sub>3</sub>&#x005D;, <a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4(a)</a>, as a ligand. This complex may be oxidised to a V<sup>V</sup> species, &#x005B;V(HIPDA)<sub>2</sub>&#x005D;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, whose structure is known. The metal is eight-coordinate (<a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4(b)</a>), each ligand providing two monodentate carboxylato groups and a very unusual <i>&#x03B7;</i><sup>2</sup>&#x2013;N&#x2013;O interaction, similar to the bonding in some hydroxylamine species (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, p.56). It is thought that amavadin is involved in electron transfer processes.</p>
<h4 class="main3"><i>Electron transfer proteins</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Among this class of biomolecule are the cytochromes, iron&#x2013;sulphur cluster proteins and blue copper proteins. Almost all biological electron transfers reactions occur <i>via</i> an outer-sphere mechanism (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.4">Section 3.4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>cytochromes</i> are haem proteins (see <a href="#fig6.5">Fig 6.5</a>) in which the iron centre is coordinated by a planar porphyrinate ring and may carry one or two additional axial ligands. These molecules are present in all forms of aerobic life: in plants where they are involved in photosynthesis, and in a very wide range of cells where they are intimately involved in the process of respiration.</p>
<p class="indent">Cytochromes are classified according to the substituents on the porphyrinate ring, whether the haem group is covalently bound to the protein or not, whether the ring is partially reduced, whether the metal is four- or five-coordinate, and on the type of axially coordinated groups whose ligand field strength controls the spin-state of the iron. Because the majority of cytochromes contain six-coordinate iron, they cannot bind small molecules and so are exclusively involved in one-electron transfer, interconverting between the Fe<sup>II</sup> and Fe<sup>III</sup> forms. Several cytochromes carry axial histidinyl (N) and methioninyl (neutral S) ligands which are attached to the protein backbone. From structural studies of a particular oxidised and reduced cytochrome it is clear that electron transfer occurs over quite long distances (&#x003E;16 &#x00C5;), but without significant conformation changes.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The <i>cytochromes</i> contain an Fe porphyrinato (2&#x2013;) core and are <i>haem</i> proteins. Ferredoxins do not contain porphyrinato ligands; they are <i>non-haem</i> proteins.</p></aside>

<p class="indent">Iron&#x2013;sulphur electron transfer proteins are encountered in all living organisms and are known collectively as <i>ferredoxins</i>. There are a number of structural types: mononuclear species containing Fe coordinated by four S (cysteinyl) atoms, or clusters containing Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>-, Fe<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>- or Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>- groups. In the clusters, each Fe atom is coordinated by four sulphur atoms, either &#x2018;inorganic&#x2019; S<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> or protein-bound cysteinyl S<sup>&#x2013;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest iron&#x2013;sulphur protein is <i>rubredoxin</i> which is found in bacteria. It contains one Fe atom coordinated by the S atoms of four cysteinyl residues and, as it has a distorted tetrahedral geometry, it may be considered to be in an entatic state. Rubredoxins appear to act as one-electron donor-acceptor proteins, which involves shuttling between high-spin Fe<sup>II</sup>, &#x005B;Fe(S-cys)4&#x005D;<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>, and high-spin Fe<sup>III</sup>, &#x005B;Fe(S-cys)4&#x005D;<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, states.</p>

Although this cluster system has three oxidation levels, only one pair is used biologically, depending on the source of the protein. The potential range for electron transfer is nearly 0.75 V, but it appears that it is the protein rather than the cluster which dictates the particular redox pattern chosen by the natural system.

<p class="indent">The <i>blue copper proteins</i> are so called because of an intense absorption near 600 nm (<i>&#x03B5;</i> &#x003E; 3000 M<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) caused by S(cysteinyl) &#x2192; Cu<sup>II</sup> charge transfer. <i>Plastocyanin</i>, which occurs in higher plants and green algae, is involved in electron transfer in photosynthesis, and <i>azurin</i>, found in denitrifying bacteria, facilitates electron transfer in some respiratory processes. Both proteins exploit the Cu<sup>II</sup>/Cu<sup>I</sup> redox couple which is greatly influenced by the stereochemical requirements of the different oxidation states: tetrahedral for Cu(I) and tetragonally distorted octahedral for Cu(II). X-Ray crystallographic studies of both proteins in both oxidation states has shown that there is very little change in gross structure on reduction from the Cu(II) to the Cu(I) states. In plastocyanin, the Cu site has a distorted tetrahedral geometry with an unusually long Cu&#x2013;S(methionine) bond, regardless of formal metal oxidation state (<a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7(a)</a>). In azurin, there is a slight expansion in the copper&#x2013;ligand bond lengths on reduction, as expected by the increase in ionic radius.

<h3 class="main2"><i>Oxygen transport</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Proteins which are responsible for the transport and storage of dioxygen are sometimes referred to as the &#x2018;respiratory pigments&#x2019;. These are required by all animals and many other species. The most common respiratory pigment in man is, of course, <i>haemoglobin</i>, an iron-based species which has a deep red colour the intensity of which depends on whether the protein is oxygenated or not. However, not all species use haem proteins. Many invertebrates (lobsters and crabs, squid, octopus, snails and marine worms) employing <i>haemocyanin</i>, a dinuclear copper species which gives blood a blue colour, or <i>haemerythrin</i> which uses two iron atoms and imparts a violet colour to blood. The prefix &#x2018;haem&#x2019; is confusing, as it is often used in conjunction with proteins containing an iron porphyrinate ring, but of the respiratory pigments, only haemoglobin contains this group.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Haemoglobin</i> has a molecular weight of <i>ca</i>. 65000 and is tetrameric. <i>Myoglobin</i> can be regarded as its monomeric analogue. The haem unit is a Fe<sup>II</sup> protoporphyrin IX group (<a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8(a)</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">These species absorb one molecule of O<sub>2</sub> per iron atom, the dioxygen ligand being monodentate with an Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;O bond angle varying between 115&#x00B0; (<i>oxy</i>myoglobin) and 156&#x00B0; (<i>oxy</i>haemoglobin). In the <i>deoxy</i> forms the iron atom is nearly square-pyramidal with an axial histidine N atom, the high-spin Fe<sup>II</sup> atom lying above the plane of the porphyrinate ring. Upon O<sub>2</sub> absorption, the metal becomes six-coordinate. A considerable amount of work on model dioxygen complexes has revealed a lot about the natural oxygen-carriers. It is clear that the iron centre in porphyrinate complexes must be protected sterically, since reaction of simple planar porphyrinato complexes leads to inactive dinuclear species containing an Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe linkage, <i>e.g.</i>, &#x005B;L(porph)Fe&#x2013;O&#x2013;Fe(porph)L&#x005D; (porph = porphyrinate) where L is a Lewis base ligand. However, the porphyrin ring can be modified by attaching substituents which constitute a kind of &#x2018;picket fence&#x2019; around the iron centre (<a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8(b)</a>), which not only prevents dimerisation, but also provides a hydrophobic pocket at the iron site for interaction with O<sub>2</sub> in an end-on fashion as Fe<sup>III</sup>&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Three terms occur frequently in the context of oxygen-carrying proteins: <i>deoxy, oxy</i> and <i>met</i> The first refers to proteins in which the metal is fully reduced.

<p class="noindent">Iron is stored in animals, many plants, and some bacteria, mainly in a &#x2018;bio-mineral&#x2019; <i>ferritin</i>. Ferritins are a group of large, approximately spherical proteins (diameter <i>ca</i>. 130 &#x00C5;) encapsulating hydrated Fe<sup>III</sup> oxide quite similar to a particle of rust <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">(Chapter 4)</a>. This mineral core, which may contain up to 4500 iron atoms, has an approximate composition &#x005B;&#x007B;FeO(OH)&#x007D;<sub>8</sub>&#x007B;FeO(PO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)&#x007D;&#x005D;, with a structure akin to a close-packed array of oxide and hydroxide ions, the Fe atoms occupying octahedral &#x2018;holes&#x2019;. The phosphate residues may anchor the iron oxide particles to the surrounding protein shell. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic channels connect the inner mineral core to the outer environment, enabling iron and other agents to enter and leave. The mode of core formation and extrusion of iron is not fully understood, but it appears that the core can only be formed from aqueous Fe<sup>II</sup> and that oxidation to Fe<sup>III</sup> only occurs inside the protein casing. Potential model cluster oxy-iron species, <i>e.g.</i>, &#x005B;Fe<sub>11</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CPh)<sub>15</sub>&#x005D;, can be assembled by slow reaction of salts of &#x005B;Fe<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>6</sub>&#x005D;<sup>2&#x2013;</sup> with benzoate ion in acetonitrile. The 11 iron atoms are at the vertices of a distorted penta-capped trigonal prism with 12 triply bridging O atoms and 15 doubly bridging benzoate groups, each iron having distorted octahedral coordination.</p>

<h2 class="main2"><b>6.2 Metalloenzymes</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Enzymes are catalysts and metalloenzymes comprise about 40% of all enzymes. First-row transition metals, especially Fe and Cu but also Mn and Ni, play the crucial role in a group of metalloenzymes known as the <i>oxidoreductases</i>, which catalyse a wide variety of biological oxidations and reductions. Oxidases use O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide and peroxide ion as oxidants in aerobic organisms, and sulphate and other oxidants in anaerobic systems. The hydrogenases use H<sub>2</sub> as reductant.</p>
<aside class="abc1" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that <i>cytochrome P-450</i>, so-called because of an electronic absorption present in its CO adduct, is an O-transfer enzyme: most other cytochromes, <i>e.g., cytochrome c</i>, are electron-transfer proteins.</p></aside>
<p class="indent"><i>Mono-oxygenases</i> catalyse the insertion of one O atom of dioxygen into a substrate, <i>i.e.</i>, conversion of C&#x2013;H to C&#x2013;OH, the other O being reduced to water. A most important mono-oxygenase is the haem-containing enzyme <i>cytochrome P-450</i>. This enzyme is important in the body&#x2019;s defences against hydrophobic compounds such as drugs and pesticides, converting them to water soluble and therefore easily excreted compounds. The structure and catalytic behaviour of this species is reasonably well understood, the haem fragment shuttling between five- and six-coordinate species, the metal centre existing in formal oxidation states II, III and IV (as the ferryl group FeO<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>). The proposed catalytic cycle is shown in <a href="#sch6.4">Scheme 6.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The &#x2018;resting condition&#x2019; of the enzyme contains high-spin Fe<sup>III</sup>, the axial ligands being H<sub>2</sub>O and S<sup>&#x2013;</sup> (cysteine). The hydrocarbon substrate then binds in the proximity of the haem group (there is no evidence to suggest that the substrate actually binds to iron), which retains its high-spin configuration but becomes square pyramidal. Electron transfer causes reduction to pyramidal high-spin Fe<sup>II</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub> then binds, generating initially a six-coordinate low-spin Fe<sup>III</sup> superoxo complex. Further reduction affords a low-spin Fe<sup>III</sup> peroxo complex which, following proton transfer, releases H<sub>2</sub>O with generation of a low-spin ferryl species (Fe<sup>IV</sup>O), which inserts the O atom <a id="page_87" class="page">Page87, Chapter 6 Bio-transition metal chemistry</a>into the hydrocarbon substrate. An important competing reaction of the high-spin five-coordinate Fe<sup>II</sup> precursor is its reaction with CO to irreversibly generate a highly stable monocarbonyl complex. This reaction, common to all five- or potentially five-coordinate Fe<sup>II</sup> haem compounds, effectively blocks the oxygen-transport and -activation functions of these compounds, and has catastrophic consequences for species whose life depends on these functions. Nitrogen monoxide, NO, behaves similarly.</p>
<p class="indent">Mono-oxygenases and model compounds have been used successfully to catalyse epoxidation of a variety of alkenes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Methane mono-oxygenase</i> catalytically converts CH<sub>4</sub> to methanol. One form of this enzyme contains a di-iron centre, and the structure of an extract reveals a coordination arrangement somewhat reminiscent of that in haemerythrins. The iron atoms, which have distorted octahedral geometries, are bridged by OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, a carboxylato group of a glutamate residue, and an acetate (<a href="#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>). This last group may be derived from the crystallisation of the compound, however, so may not be integral to the structure of the natural enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">Metal-containing <i>dioxygenases</i> usually contain non-haem iron. Among the reactions they catalyse is the oxidative cleavage of catechols (1,2-dihydroxybenzene derivatives) to unsaturated dicarboxylic acids. The structure of one enzyme which has this function has established that the Fe<sup>III</sup> is distorted trigonal bipyramidal, with axial tyrosine (O) and histidine (N) ligands, and a tyrosine, histidine and water molecule in the equatorial positions. A reactive functional model compound contains tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (four N donor atoms) and 3,5-<i>t</i>-butylcatecholate bound to Fe<sup>III</sup> (<a href="#fig6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>). The structure is distorted octahedral and the Fe&#x2013;O bonds are unusually long. The complex causes oxidative cleavage of catechols in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">Peroxide and superoxide ions, and hydroxyl radicals, even when produced <i>in vivo</i>, are highly toxic. Superoxide may be implicated in arthritis, <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Chapter 6 Bio-transition metal chemistry</a>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and in ageing processes. Both peroxide and superoxide may also produce hydroxyl radicals which abstract H atoms from organic molecules and so impair cellular function, modifying DNA bases which can result in mutation. These species must be controlled by appropriate antioxidants, among them the <i>superoxide dismutases, catalases</i> and <i>peroxidases</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Superoxide dismutases</i> can exist either as mononuclear or dinuclear metalloenzymes. The structures of mononuclear Fe and Mn species have been established crystallographically. They have similarities: both have distorted quasi-trigonal bipyramidal geometries with one axial and two equatorial histidine groups and one tyrosine residue. The Mn species has an axial water molecule but the Fe species is four-coordinate with a missing apical ligand, suggesting an entatic state. The mechanism of action of these dismutases is not entirely clear, but the mononuclear iron species may proceed as shown in the following equations:</p>

<p class="indent">One of the dinuclear superoxide dismutases contains one Cu and one Zn atom which are connected by an imidazolate bridge from a histidinyl residue. The zinc is tetrahedrally coordinated, by one N atom of the bridge, two other histidine groups and an aspartate residue (carboxylate O). The copper(II) centre is distorted square pyramidal with the bridging N imidazole atom in the apical site and the basal sites occupied by three histidinyl residues and a water molecule. The copper ion is the active centre, the water molecule being replaced by superoxide ion.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Peroxidases</i> and <i>catalases</i> catalyse the destruction of peroxide. The active centre in <i>horse radish peroxidase</i> is an Fe<sup>III</sup> haem centre (protoporphyrin IX), in which the fifth coordination site is occupied by a histidinyl N atom, and the sixth may either contain H<sub>2</sub>O or be vacant. The iron(III) is low spin at high pH and high spin at low pH. Reaction with peroxide generates a ferryl species.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Hydrogenases</i> catalyse the interconversion of dihydrogen and protons. All known hydrogenases contain iron&#x2013;sulphur clusters, and many also contain nickel, possibly in the form of Ni<sup>III</sup>. A recent structural determination has shown that one nickel&#x2013;iron hydrogenase contains two Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and one Fe<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster, the latter similar to the cubane-like Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> species with one Fe atom missing. These clusters are clearly involved in electron transfer processes, and there is also a hydrogen-binding centre which may involve a heterodinuclear Fe&#x2013;Ni system. The nickel coordination sphere involves four protein-derived cysteine S atoms, two of which act as bridges to the iron atom which, in turn, appears to carry three or four non-protein ligands L, possibly CO or CN<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. There is an additional bridging group X, possibly O (<a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>).</p>

This biological process contrasts dramatically with the Haber&#x2013;Bosch process which achieves the same reduction using solid iron catalysts promoted by <a id="page_89" class="page">Page 89, Chapter 6 Bio-transition metal chemistry</a>non-transition metal oxides but under relatively high temperatures (<i>ca</i>. 450&#x00B0;C) and pressures (<i>ca</i>. 270 atm).</p>
<p class="indent">The Fe/Mo nitrogenases consist of two proteins. The first, which has a molecular weight of <i>ca</i>. 60000, contains one Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster, and the second, with a molecular weight of <i>ca</i>. 220000, contains two Mo atoms, 30&#x2013;32 Fe atoms and approximately the same number of &#x2018;inorganic&#x2019; (non-cysteinyl) S atoms. Nitrogenase obtained from <i>A.vinelandii</i> contains two Fe/Mo cofactors based on a Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>8</sub>X (X may be O or N) core (<a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14(a))</a> and two so-called &#x2018;P-clusters&#x2019;, based on linked Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> clusters (<a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14(b)</a>). The cofactor is bound to the protein superstructur <i>via</i> a histidine attached to the Mo (six-coordinate) and a cysteine bound to the Fe (four-coordinate) at the other end of the cluster. What is not known is where N<sub>2</sub> binds in the activation process: it could be at either the Fe or Mo and there are ample models of N<sub>2</sub> complexes of both metals. Other types of nitrogenases are known which contain V in place of Mo, and there is even a system containing only Fe as the transition metal.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>NO synthases</i> catalyse the formation of NO from L-arginine in a five-electron oxidation. Nitrogen monoxide is a vital biological messenger, causing muscles to dilate and relax, helping to lower blood pressure, and participating in gut contraction and food movement. It also kills cells and inhibits cell multiplication and growth. All NO synthases use iron protoporphyrin IX (<a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8(a)</a>) and a number of other coenzymes, and it is well established that NO forms complexes with iron porphyrinato complexes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></i> is the human body&#x2019;s defence against pernicious anaemia. It cannot be synthesised in the body and so must be supplied in the diet, and is stored in the liver. The coenzyme form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is based on a cobalt(III) corrin ring complex, containing a Co&#x2013;C bond. The corrin ring is similar to a porphyrin ring with one &#x2013;CH= group missing, and provides a near-planar set of four N atoms to support the six-coordinate metal (<a href="#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a>). One axial position is occupied by a 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole group which is attached, <i>via</i> a monosaccharide group linked to a phosphate residue, to the corrin framework. The basic five-coordinate corrin&#x2013;benzimidazole&#x2013;cobalt group is often referred to as &#x2018;<i>cobalamin</i>&#x2019;, and if the sixth position is occupied by CH<sub>3</sub> the compound is called methylcobalamin (R = Me in <a href="#fig6.15">Fig 6.15(a)</a>).

This process appears to involve a reduced cobalamin intermediate, B<sub>12</sub><i><sub>s</sub></i><sub>,</sub> which abstracts a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate (another cofactor), forms a CO&#x2013;CH<sub>3</sub> bond, and then transfers this methyl group to homocysteine, thereby forming methionine.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wilson&#x2019;s disease, which leads to dementia and eventual death, is caused by an over-accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Early chemotherapy exploited the high stability of copper(II) complexes of EDTA<sup>4&#x2013;</sup> and related polydentate carboxylic acid salts. Although the copper levels in patients could be lowered relatively efficiently, treatment with this agent also resulted in bone weakening caused by leaching of calcium, a consequence of the high stability of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> complexes of EDTA<sup>4&#x2013;</sup>. Treatment for this disease is now based on the administration of D-penicillamine (3,3-dimethyl-D-(&#x2013;)-cysteine, Me<sub>2</sub>C(SH)CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>H) or its <i>N</i>-acetyl derivative (the L-form is toxic). The &#x2018;ligand&#x2019; presents a slightly &#x2018;softer&#x2019; donor atom set (N/O/S) which allows effective discrimination between copper and calcium: copper penicillamine complexes are more thermodynamically stable than those of calcium.</p>
