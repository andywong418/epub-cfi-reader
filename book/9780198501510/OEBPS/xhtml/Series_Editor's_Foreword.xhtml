<p class="fm-no">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of current understanding of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fm-in">Jon McCleverty has provided an essential guide to first-row transition element chemistry, which provides a fine precis of the theory and underlying structures and reactivity of this important part of the Periodic table. The quality and depth of this survey emanates from Jon&#x2019;s own research life at the heart of this field. Companion books covering the heavy transition elements and the f-block elements will succeed this volume. 3d-element chemistry is universal in undergraduate chemistry courses, and this text is perhaps the most approachable companion to these courses.</p>
