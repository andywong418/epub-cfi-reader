<p class="noindent">Symmetry is all around us, and even from early childhood most people seem to have an innate ability to respond to those shapes and patterns which can be described in terms of symmetry. At a conscious level, it underpins our notions of &#x2018;fairness&#x2019;&#x2014;during cake-cutting operations, for example&#x2014;and at a subconscious level it has even been claimed that the more symmetrical a person&#x2019;s face, the more attractive it is to the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">And if further confirmation should be required of the influence sym-metry may have on our lives, one need look no further than the advertising world. Here, real money has been spent trying to catch and hold our attention with a multitude of logos and emblems, many of which utilise designs with characteristically identifiable symmetry. This apparently innate response to symmetry, and the attendant search for pattern, surface in numerous ways in almost every branch of science, and descriptions or &#x2018;explanations&#x2019; which incorporate symmetry are often regarded not only as being particularly elegant, but possibly even &#x2018;true&#x2019;.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka1">This Primer is concerned with the symmetry of molecular species, and with the inter-relationship between molecular symmetry and properties such as vibrational spectra and molecular energy levels.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">In order to explore these aspects of chemistry, it is necessary first to establish a framework for describing in a consistent way both the sym&#173;metry of a particular molecule, and also the results of carrying out sym&#173;metry operations. The former task leads to the idea of the molecular point group, and occupies a major part of <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><a href="Chapter02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> begins with a description of single symmetry operations in terms of simple matrices, continues with illustrations of sequential sym&#173;metry operations, and leads to the concept of a symmetry group through a consideration of multiplication tables. This is followed by an introduction to representations and basic functions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Character tables, and the use of the reduction formula to establish the symmetries of irreducible representations are described in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, and other basis functions such as interatomic bonds and atomic orbitals are also introduced here, whilst degenerate representations and higher order point groups are explored in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><a href="Chapter05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a> deals with the symmetry aspects of vibrational spectroscopy, using firstly a fuller treatment which includes bending modes, and sec&#173;ondly a &#x2018;stretches-only&#x2019; approach based on internal coordinates. In <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, the role of symmetry in infrared and Raman vibrational spectroscopy is discussed.</p>
<a class="page" id="page_2">Page 2, Introduction-the structure of this Primer</a>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The final chapter provides an introduction to symmetry aspects of molecular bonding, and in particular to the sets of orbitals which can combine to form a molecular orbital diagram.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">The book has been designed to be of assistance to Chemistry students at several different stages during their degree courses. An understanding of symmetry elements and operations, and the resulting description of molecular symmetry in terms of the point group, now form part of many First Year Honours courses; whilst in their Second and Third years, students increasingly encounter aspects of spectroscopy and bonding which greatly benefit from a symmetry-based approach involving the use of character tables.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1">Each chapter contains a number of worked examples, and there are also supplementary problems for individual or group study. These exercises are of varying degrees of difficulty, and although their primary purpose is to reinforce directly the material in the chapter, some of them, at least, may be of interest to graduate students with a weakness for problem-solving. The answers to these appear in <a href="AppendixI.xhtml#app1">Appendix I</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka1"><a href="AppendixII.xhtml#app2">Appendix II</a> contains the character tables of the most commonly encountered point groups, the understanding and use of which are central to many areas of modern chemistry, and a bibliography of additional reading may be found in <a href="AppendixIII.xhtml#app3">Appendix III</a>.</p>
