<p class="fmnoindent">Aromatic heterocyclic chemistry is an enormous and complex subject of great industrial and academic significance. A number of the molecules of life are derived from aromatic heterocycles and many important pharmaceutical and agrochemical compounds are based on aromatic heterocycles. Consequently, the importance of aromatic heterocyclic chemistry has stimulated a vast amount of synthetic and theoretical work in the area.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry, and contain only the essential material that would be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. In this primer David Davies has produced an excellent introduction to aromatic heterocyclic chemistry that should stimulate any reader to explore further into this vast topic. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
