<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Pyridine <b>5.1</b> is a polar liquid (b.p. 115&#x00B0;C) which is miscible with both organic solvents and water. It can formally be derived from benzene by replacement of a CH group by a nitrogen atom. Pyridine is a highly aromatic heterocycle, but the effect of the heteroatom makes its chemistry quite distinct from that of benzene. The aromatic sextet of six &#x03C0; electrons is complete without invoking participation of the lone pair on the nitrogen. This is in direct contrast with the situation in pyrrole (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) where the aromatic sextet includes the lone pair on the nitrogen. Hence the lone pair of pyridine is available for bonding without disturbing the aromaticity of the ring. Pyridine is moderately basic (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&#x003D;5.2) and can be quaternised with alkylating agents to form pyridinium salts <b>5.2</b>. Pyridine also forms complexes with Lewis acids such as sulphur trioxide. This complex <b>5.3</b> is a mild source of sulphur trioxide for sulphonation reactions (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The effect of the heteroatom is to make the pyridine ring very unreactive to normal electrophilic aromatic substitution. Conversely, pyridines are susceptible to nucleophilic attack. These topics are discussed later.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of pyridines</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Our retrosynthetic analysis of generalised pyridine <b>5.4</b> commences with an adjustment of the oxidation level to produce dihydropyridine <b>5.5</b>. This molecule can now be disconnected very readily. Cleavage of the carbon&#x2013;heteroatom bonds in the usual way leaves dienol <b>5.6</b> which exists as diketone <b>5.7</b>. The 1,5-dicarbonyl relationship can be derived from a Michael reaction of ketone <b>5.8</b> and enone <b>5.9</b>, which in turn can arise from condensation of aldehyde <b>5.10</b> and ketone <b>5.11</b>.<a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 5 Pyridines</a></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.3">
<img src="../images/f0036-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">These processes are facilitated when R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are electron-withdrawing groups such as esters. Furthermore, when ketones <b>5.11</b> and <b>5.8</b> are the same, we have the basis for the classical Hantzsch pyridine synthesis.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.4">
<img src="../images/f0036-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For instance, condensation of ethyl acetoacetate, formaldehyde, and ammonia gives dihydropyridine <b>5.12</b> which is readily oxidised with nitric acid to give pyridine <b>5.13</b>. Although the precise details of this multicomponent condensation are not known, a reasonable pathway is shown below.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-15.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">Note that in this example R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are ethyl esters, so the adjacent carbon is actually an active methylene group. The higher acidity and hence nucleophilicity of these centres facilitates the reaction sequence.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 5 Pyridines</a></p>
<p class="indent">Some examples of dihydropyridines prepared in this way are shown below. (The student is encouraged to work out the aldehydes used in each case.)</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.6">
<img src="../images/f0037-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">As well as being intermediates for the synthesis of pyridines, these dihydropyridines are themselves an important class of heterocycles. For instance, dihydropyridine <b>5.14</b> is a drug for lowering blood pressure. In the synthesis of <b>5.14</b> note that carrying out the Hantzsch synthesis stepwise allows for the preparation of an unsymmetrical dihydropyridine, having both a methyl and an ethyl ester.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">A consequence of the asymmetry of <b>5.14</b> is that C4 is a stereogenic centre. Hence the product is formed as a racemic mixture.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Electrophilic substitution of pyridines</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Pyridine is virtually inert to aromatic electrophilic substitution. Consider nitration of pyridine by nitric acid. First, as pyridine is a moderate base, it will be almost completely protonated by the acid, making it much less susceptible to electrophilic attack. Second, addition of the electrophile to the small amount of unprotonated pyridine present in solution is not a facile process.</p>
<p class="indent">Attack of the electrophile at the C2 or C4 position results in an intermediate cation with partial positive charge on the electronegative nitrogen atom. This is clearly not energetically favourable when compared to C3 substitution, where no partial positive charge resides on nitrogen. In fact the product of C3 substitution, nitropyridine <b>5.15</b>, can be isolated from the exhaustive nitration of pyridine, but only in poor yield.</p>

<p class="indent">Although better results have been achieved with the sulphonation of pyridine to give the sulphonic acid <b>5.16</b>, electrophilic substitutions on an inactivated pyridine ring are in general not preparatively useful.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.10">
<img src="../images/f0038-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Pyridine can be activated to electrophilic substitution by conversion to pyridine N-oxide <b>5.17</b>. At first sight it is curious to consider oxidation (i.e. electron loss) as a means of activating a system to electrophilic substitution, but <b>5.17</b> can act rather like a sterically-hindered phenolate anion towards electrophiles, producing intermediate <b>5.18</b> which then loses a proton to give substituted N-oxide <b>5.19</b>. For this methodology to be useful it is of course necessary to remove the activating oxygen atom. This can be done with phosphorus trichloride, which becomes oxidised to phosphorus oxychloride.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.11">
<img src="../images/f0038-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 5 Pyridines</a>For instance, 4-nitropyridine <b>5.20</b> can be prepared from pyridine in three steps by this methodology.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.12">
<img src="../images/f0039-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Pyridine N-oxides can also be converted into synthetically useful 2-chloropyridines <b>5.21</b> (see later).</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.13">
<img src="../images/f0039-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Another approach to electrophilic substitution involves the chemistry of 2-pyridone <b>5.22</b> and 4-pyridone <b>5.23</b>. These are the tautomeric forms of 2-and 4-hydroxypyridine respectively. They exist exclusively in the pyridone form, the hydrogen atom being attached to the nitrogen atom, not the oxygen. Their electronic structures are not adequately described by a single valence representation, the lone pair from the nitrogen atom being delocalised to a considerable extent onto the oxygen atom, as in mesomeric representations <b>5.22a</b> and <b>5.23a</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.14">
<img src="../images/f0039-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Both pyridones can react with electrophiles at positions <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to the activating oxygen atom. For instance, 4-pyridone reacts with electrophiles at the C3 position (the mechanism can be formulated from either mesomeric representation) to give intermediate <b>5.24</b>. As with pyridine N-oxides, reaction with phosphorus oxychloride gives useful chloropyridines <b>5.25</b>. We shall see the utility of 2- and 4-chloropyridines in the next section.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Nucleophilic substitution of pyridines</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Pyridine can be attacked by nucleophiles at the C2/C6 and C4 positions in a manner analogous to the addition of nucleophiles to a carbonyl group in a 1,2 or 1,4 fashion. Attack at the C3/C5 positions is not favoured because the negative charge on the intermediate cannot be delocalised onto the electronegative nitrogen atom.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_5.16">
<img src="../images/f0040-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Under conditions of high temperatures the intermediate anion can re-aromatise by loss of a hydride ion, even though it is a very poor leaving group. This is illustrated by the Chichibabin reaction of pyridine and sodamide to produce 2-aminopyridine <b>5.26</b>. The immediate product of the reaction is <b>5.27</b>, the sodium salt of <b>5.26</b>, as the eliminated hydride ion is very basic. Protonation of this sodium salt during the aqueous workup then regenerates <b>5.26</b>. A simplistic rationale is shown below.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">The actual mechanism is rather complicated. Hydrogen gas is evolved, but in reality free sodium hydride is never generated. See McGill and Rappa (1988).</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, before leaving this section, we shall consider the synthesis of pyridotriazine <b>5.32</b>, a potential anti-fungal drug. This synthesis illustrates features of both electrophilic and nucleophilic pyridine chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitration of 4-pyridone <b>5.23</b> gives <b>5.28</b>, and reaction with phosphorus oxychloride affords chloropyridine <b>5.29</b>. This pyridone-chloropyridine conversion activates the system to nucleophilic attack by hydrazine, affording <b>5.30</b>. The nitro group also facilitates nucleophilic attack by delocalisation of negative charge in the intermediate.</p>

<p class="noindent">We earlier drew a parallel between nucleophilic attack on the C2/C6 and C4 positions of pyridine and 1,2 and 1,4 addition of nucleophiles to a carbonyl group. This analogy can be extended to deprotonation of alkyl substituents at the C2/C6 and C4 positions.</p>

<img src="../images/f0042-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Just as a carbonyl group stabilises an adjacent negative charge as an enolate anion, so the anion derived from 2-methyl pyridine is stabilised by delocalisation of the negative charge onto the electronegative nitrogen atom.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Chapter 5 Pyridines</a>A similar argument holds for 4-methyl pyridine. These stabilised anions can then react with the usual range of electrophiles.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Dialkyl pyridine <b>5.33</b> is selectively deprotonated at the C4 alkyl group, illustrating the greater acidity of this position over the C3 position. With regard to ring deprotonation, however, there are relatively few examples known for simple pyridines, in contrast to the extensive chemistry developed for the five-membered ring heterocycles. This is because the resultant organometallic species are good nucleophiles, and because pyridines are also moderate electrophiles, polymerisation problems are often encountered. More success has been achieved with substituted pyridines having an <i>ortho</i> activating substituent (e.g. -CONHR, -NHCOR, -OMe, -CH2NR2 etc). These substituents increase the rate of kinetic deprotonation and stabilise the intermediate organolithium species by coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, 4-aminopyridine <b>5.34</b> can be converted to amide <b>5.35</b> which, on treatment with two equivalents of butyl lithium, gives organometallic species <b>5.36</b>.
