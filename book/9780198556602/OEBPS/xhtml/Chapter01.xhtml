<p class="noindent">Heterocyclic chemistry is a large and important branch of organic chemistry. Heterocycles occur in nature, for instance in nucleic acids (see <a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) and indole alkaloids (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>). Synthetic heterocycles have widespread uses as herbicides (e.g. <b>1.1</b>), fungicides (e.g. <b>1.2</b>), insecticides (e.g. <b>1.3</b>), dyes (e.g. <b>1.4</b>), organic conductors (e.g. <b>1.5</b>), and, of course, pharmaceutical products such as the anti-ulcer drug <b>1.6</b>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Aromaticity and heteroaromaticity</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Any ring system containing at least one heteroatom (i.e. an atom other than carbon - typically nitrogen, oxygen, or sulphur) can be described as heterocyclic. This broad definition encompasses both aromatic heterocycles (such as pyridine <b>5.1</b>) and their non-aromatic counterparts (piperidine <b>1.7</b>).</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">The compound numbering system in this chapter is not as odd as it might seem. For more on compound <b>5.1</b> see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, etc.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Aromatic heterocycles are described as being heteroaromatic, and we shall concentrate on these systems in this book at the expense of more saturated systems. Let us now consider the concept of aromaticity with regard to benzene.<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.3">

</figure>
<p class="indent">The carbon atoms in benzene are <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridised, and the hydrogen atoms are in the same plane as the carbon atoms. The remaining six <i>p</i> orbitals are at right angles to the plane of the ring and contain six &#x03C0; electrons. Benzene fulfils the H&#x00FC;ckel criteria for aromaticity as applied to cyclic polyenes containing 4n &#x002B; 2 electrons (where <i>n</i>&#x003D;l in this case) in filled <i>p</i> orbitals capable of overlap.</p>
<p class="indent">Although two mesomeric representations <b>1.8a,b</b> can be drawn for benzene, this does <i>not</i> imply two rapidly-interconverting forms. Rather, the six &#x03C0; electrons are delocalised in molecular orbitals resulting in an annular electron cloud above and below the plane of the ring. Benzene can also be represented by structure <b>1.9</b>, which emphasises the cyclical arrangement of electrons. In agreement with this theory, the carbon&#x2013;carbon bond lengths are all equivalent (0.14 nm) and intermediate between that of a single (0.154 nm) and double (0.133 nm) carbon&#x2013;carbon bond. The extra thermodynamic stabilisation imparted to benzene by this phenomenon of electron delocalisation, called &#x2018;resonance&#x2019;, can be determined indirectly. Real, delocalised benzene is thermodynamically more stable than a theoretical cyclohexatriene molecule (i.e. non-delocalised structure <b>1.8a</b>) by around 150 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">How does this concept of aromaticity apply to typical heterocycles such as pyridine <b>5.1</b> and pyrrole <b>2.1</b>? Pyridine can formally be derived from benzene by replacement of a CH unit by an <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridised nitrogen atom. Consequently, pyridine has a lone pair of electrons instead of a hydrogen atom. However the six &#x03C0; electrons are essentially unchanged, and the pyridine is a relatively aromatic heterocycle.</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="fig_1.4">
<img src="../images/f0002-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A difficulty arises with five-membered heterocycles such as pyrrole, which at first sight would appear to have only four &#x03C0; electrons, two short of the 4<i>n</i> &#x002B; 2 H&#x00FC;ckel criteria for aromaticity. The nitrogen atom is <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridised and formally contains a lone pair of electrons in the remaining <i>p</i> orbital at right angles to the ring. However, the system is delocalised, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.5">
<img src="../images/f0002-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<a id="page_3" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 3, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>
<p class="indent">Thus, delocalisation of the nitrogen lone pair completes the sextet of electrons required for aromaticity. These two examples illustrate the point that certain heterocycles (closely analogous to benzene and naphthalene) such as pyridine <b>5.1</b>, pyrimidine <b>10.1</b>, and quinoline <b>6.1</b> are aromatic &#x2018;by right&#x2019; whereas other heterocycles such as pyrrole <b>2.1</b>, imidazole <b>3.2</b>, and triazole <b>8.7</b> have to &#x2018;earn&#x2019; aromaticity by delocalisation of a lone pair of electrons from the heteroatom.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.6">
<img src="../images/f0003-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">What are the consequences of this concept of lone pair delocalisation for a related series of heterocycles such as pyrrole <b>2.1</b>, thiophene <b>2.2</b>, and furan <b>2.3</b>? As delocalisation results in electron loss from the heteroatom concerned, the extent of delocalisation (and hence aromaticity) will vary with the electronegativity of the heteroatom. The highly electronegative oxygen atom in furan holds on to electron density more strongly than the heteroatom in thiophene or pyrrole. Furan is generally considered to have a non-aromatic electron distribution fairly close to that depicted by structure <b>2.3</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">For a review on the concept of heterocyclic aromaticity see Katritzky <i>et al</i> (1991).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In fact the thorny problem as to how aromatic is a particular heterocycle or series of heterocycles has been a preoccupation of physical organic chemists for some time. Bond lengths, heats of combustion, spectroscopic data, and theoretically-calculated resonance energies have all been invoked, but an absolute measure of aromaticity remains elusive. Nevertheless, trends regarding relative aromaticity will be alluded to in this text as they arise.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3">
<h2 class="h2"><b>1.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of heterocycles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are many syntheses of the major heterocycles and they are often complementary in that they afford different substitution patterns on the ring. Most of the synthetic methods we shall examine are fairly classical (indeed some are decidedly ancient!) although many of the specific examples are quite modern. Many classical syntheses of heterocycles revolve around the condensation reaction in its various guises. Let us consider the mechanism of a simple acid-catalysed condensation, that of generalised ketone <b>1.10</b> and amine <b>1.11</b> to give imine <b>1.12</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Protonation of the ketone oxygen atom activates the ketone to nucleophilic attack by the amine. Loss of a proton from <b>1.13</b> produces neutral intermediate <b>1.14</b>. A second protonation, once again on the oxygen atom affords <b>1.15</b>, which on loss of a water molecule and a proton gives the <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>imine <b>1.12</b>. All these steps are reversible, but in practice if water can be removed from the equilibrium (for instance by azeotropic distillation) then such reactions can be forced to completion. This type of reaction occurs many times in this text, but in future will not be presented in such detail. The student is strongly advised to work through, using pen and paper, the mechanism shown below and the many subsequent mechanisms. Confidence with reaction mechanisms will facilitate understanding of heterocyclic chemistry and organic chemistry in general.</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="fig_1.8">
<img src="../images/f0004-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The disconnection approach to synthesis essentially involves working backwards from a target compound in a logical manner (so-called retrosynthesis), so that a number of possible routes and starting materials are suggested. This approach has been applied mainly to alicyclic, carbocyclic, and saturated heterocyclic systems. Retrosynthetic analyses are presented in this text not as an all-embracing answer to synthetic problems, but rather as an aid to understanding the actual construction of unsaturated heterocycles.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the condensation presented above, this leads to an important disconnection. The imine-like linkage present in several heterocycles (generalised structure <b>1.16</b>) can arise from cyclisation of <b>1.17</b>, containing amino and carbonyl functionalities.</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="fig_1.9">
<img src="../images/f0004-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-8.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">The symbol &#x21D2; denotes a disconnection, an analytical process in which a structure is transformed into a suitable precursor</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Now consider condensation of ammonia with ketoester <b>1.18</b>. The isolated product is not imine <b>1.19</b> but the thermodynamically more stable enamine tautomer <b>1.20</b> which has a conjugated double bond system and a strong intramolecular hydrogen-bond. Although not a heterocyclic example, <b>1.20</b> illustrates that an enamine-like linkage, as in generalised heterocycle <b>1.21</b>, is also accessible by a condensation reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="fig_1.10">
<img src="../images/f0004-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<p class="indent">In a retrosynthetic sense, formal hydrolysis of the carbon-nitrogen bond of <b>1.21</b> reveals enol <b>1.22</b> which would exist as the more stable ketone tautomer <b>1.23</b>. Note that in the hydrolytic disconnection step the carbon becomes attached to a hydroxy group and the nitrogen to a hydrogen atom &#x2013; there is no change in the oxidation levels of carbon or nitrogen.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.11">
<img src="../images/f0005-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Unlike our initial imine disconnection which is restricted to nitrogen heterocycles (with one or two specific exceptions such as pyrylium salts, see <a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>), the heteroatom in the enamine or enamine-like disconnection could be divalent. Therefore this disconnection is also applicable to oxygen-and sulphur-containing heterocycles, typified by <b>1.24</b> and <b>1.25</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.12">
<img src="../images/f0005-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Let us see how this disconnection approach can rationalize the synthesis of pyrrole <b>2.16</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.13">
<img src="../images/f0005-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Retrosynthetic analysis suggests a double condensation between diketone <b>1.26</b> and ammonia. Pyrrole <b>2.16</b> can actually be prepared if this way &#x2013; see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Chapter 2.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another aid to understanding heterocyclic synthesis in general is the fact that a large number of five- and six-membered heterocycles can be constructed from various combinations of small acyclic molecules by complementary matching of nucleophilic and electrophilic functionality.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.14">
<img src="../images/f0005-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Returning to the synthesis of pyrrole <b>2.16</b>, diketone <b>1.26</b> can be regarded as a four-carbon bis-electrophjlic fragment and ammonia, in this instance, as a bis-nucleophilic nitrogen fragment. Ammonia can form up to three bonds in a nucleophilic manner.<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Chapter 1 Introduction</a></p>
<p class="indent">In this particular instance the correct oxidation level automatically results from the condensation reaction, giving pyrrole <b>2.16</b> directly. In other cases cyclisation does not afford the correct oxidation level and an unsaturated system has to be oxidised to achieve aromaticity. For instance, 1,5-diketones <b>1.27</b> react with ammonia to give dihydropyridines <b>1.28</b> which can be oxidised to pyridines <b>1.29</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.15">
<img src="../images/f0006-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Examples of this cyclisation&#x2013;oxidation strategy include the synthesis of pyridotriazine <b>5.32</b> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_42">page 42</a>) and syntheses of quinolines and isoquinolines (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). Some examples of nucleophilic and electrophilic fragments are shown in <a href="#tab_1.1">Table 1.1</a>. Several points arise from the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider acylating species such as acid chlorides. Acylation of diamine <b>1.30</b> initially gives amide <b>1.31</b> which undergoes a condensation to produce benzimidazole <b>1.32</b>. The carbonyl moiety is acting exclusively as an electrophilic centre.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_1.16">
<img src="../images/f0006-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">However, delocalisation of the nitrogen lone pair in the amide linkage (see mesomeric representations <b>1.33a,b</b>) produces a nucleophilic oxygen atom which can react with electrophiles as shown.</p>
