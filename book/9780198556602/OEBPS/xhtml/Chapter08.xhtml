<h2 class="h2"><b>8.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The broad category of five-membered ring heterocycles containing three or four heteroatoms encompasses many heterocyclic systems. Obviously there is considerable variation in the physical and chemical properties of such a large group of heterocycles. For instance, with regard to aromaticity, oxadiazole <b>8.3</b> is considered to be less aromatic than triazole <b>8.8</b> or tetrazole <b>8.9</b>.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-21.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em">Note the parallel with furan being less aromatic than pyrrole, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Nevertheless, this collection of heterocycles does share certain characteristics. The trend we have seen of decreasing tendency towards electrophilic substitution on going from furan, pyrrole, and thiophene to the azoles is continued into these series. The presence of additional &#x2018;pyridine-like&#x2019; nitrogen atoms renders these systems particularly &#x2018;electron-deficient&#x2019;, and electrophilic substitution is of little importance.</p>
<p class="indent">Conversely, nucleophilic substitution (which we have seen in earlier chapters on 1,3-azoles and pyridines) does occur in these systems, especially when the carbon atom concerned is between two heteroatoms, as in the displacement reactions of oxadiazole <b>8.12</b> and tetrazole <b>8.13</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:1em;">Once again note the analogy with standard carbonyl chemistry.</p>

<img src="../images/f0062-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Another similarity with azoles is that there are examples of deprotonation of alkyl substituents between two heteroatoms followed by quenching the resultant carbanions with electrophiles, as in the preparation of oxadiazole <b>8.14</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.4">
<img src="../images/f0062-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Ring deprotonation is also known with certain members of these series. Carbanion <b>8.15</b> is stable at low temperature (&#x2212;70&#x00B0;C) and can be trapped with electrophiles, but on warming to room temperature it decomposes with ring fragmentation and extrusion of nitrogen. This fragmentation process is reminiscent of the base-catalysed cleavage of isoxazoles (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.5">
<img src="../images/f0062-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For simplicity we shall now consider the synthesis of just three members of these series, 1,2,4-oxadiazole <b>8.3</b>, 1,2,3-triazole <b>8.7</b>, and tetrazole <b>8.9</b>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>8.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Disconnection of the C5-oxygen bond in <b>8.16</b> leads to iminoalcohol <b>8.17</b> which occurs as amide <b>8.18</b>. Cleavage of the amide linkage leads to an activated carboxylic acid <b>8.20</b> plus the heteroatom-containing amidoxime <b>8.19</b>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, Chapter 8 Five-membered ring heterocycles with three or four heteroatoms</a></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.6">

</figure>
<p class="indent">Amidoximes can be prepared by acid-catalysed additon of hydroxylamine to nitriles.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.7">
<img src="../images/f0063-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">An example of this approach to oxadiazoles is shown by the conversion of ester <b>8.21</b> to oxadiazole <b>8.22</b>, prepared as a potential candidate for the treatment of senile dementia. Simple esters are metabolically unstable in man because of the high activity of esterases. These enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. A common tactic in drug research when confronted with the problem of metabolic instability of a biologically active ester is to replace the ester group with a small heterocycle (often oxadiazole), to try to produce a biologically-active molecule with improved metabolic stability. This concept of replacing fragments of a molecule by groups with broadly similar physicochemical parameters in a systematic manner is known as bioisosteric replacement. In this instance oxadiazole <b>8.22</b> can mimic both the physical and biological properties of <b>8.21</b>, but it is obviously not a substrate for esterases.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>8.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">These are best prepared by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azide and an acetylene.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.9">
<img src="../images/f0063-04.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For instance, triazole <b>8.8</b> itself has been prepared by cycloaddition of hydrazoic acid to acetylene.</p>

<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.10">
<img src="../images/f0064-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Although a simple mechanism can be drawn for this transformation, it is only useful as a &#x2018;book-keeping exercise&#x2019; to ensure that the correct structure is drawn for the product. In reality the reaction is a concerted process and the usual considerations of nucleophilic and electrophilic attack do not apply.</p>
<p class="indent">Excellent yields are achieved in these cycloadditions when electron-withdrawing groups are present on the acetylene, as in the preparation of triazole <b>8.23</b>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>8.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of tetrazoles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Tetrazoles of general structure <b>8.24</b> can be prepared in a very similar manner to triazoles, except that nitriles are used rather than acetylenes. Once again the reaction with azides is a conceited cycloaddition process.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Let us now consider the synthesis of tetrazole <b>8.27</b>, an inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, which catalyses the conversion of ornithine <b>8.25</b> to diamine <b>8.26</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.13">
<img src="../images/f0064-04.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent">The tetrazole moiety is an excellent bioisosteric replacement for a carboxylic acid, being a small, polar, acidic heterocycle.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 8 Five-membered ring heterocycles with three or four heteroatoms</a></p>
<p class="indent">Tetrazole <b>8.27</b> is sufficiently similar to ornithine <b>8.25</b> in its physical properties to bind to the active site of the enzyme. However, as it obviously cannot undergo the decarboxylation process, it acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">The synthesis commences with alkylation of the stabilised carbanion derived from cyanoester <b>8.29</b> with iodide <b>8.28</b> to give adduct <b>8.30</b></p>

<figure class="imgc" id="fig_8.16">
<img src="../images/f0065-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Note that the first-formed product from the cycloaddition is actually the sodium tetrazolate salt <b>8.32</b>. Protonation affords the neutral tetrazole <b>8.31</b>. Prolonged acidic hydrolysis accomplishes several transformations: hydrolytic removal of both the phthalimide and acetyl nitrogen protecting groups, and hydrolysis/decarboxylation of the ester. The net result is to produce the target tetrazole <b>8.27</b> as its dihydrochloride salt. This tetrazole-assisted decarboxylation is mechanistically very similar to the decarboxylation of malonyl half-esters <b>8.33</b>.</p>
