<h2 class="h2"><b>7.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Fusion of a benzene ring onto the C2/C3 positions of pyrrole formally produces the corresponding benzopyrrole <b>7.1</b> known as indole. An analogous theoretical transformation can be envisaged to form benzofuran <b>7.2</b> and benzothiophene <b>7.3</b>. This chapter will concentrate exclusively on indole, by far the most important member of this series.</p>

<p class="indent">Indole is a ten-&#x03C0; electron aromatic system. As with pyrrole, delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons from the nitrogen atom is necessary for aromaticity. The single overall electronic structure of indole is not completely described by structure <b>7.1</b>, because this implies localisation of the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. Mesomeric representation <b>7.1a</b> makes a contribution to the electronic structure of indole, as to a lesser extent do mesomeric representations where the negative charge occurs on the benzenoid ring.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.2">
<img src="../images/f0053-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A consequence of this delocalisation is that the lone pair is not available for protonation under moderately acidic conditions so, like pyrrole, indole is another weakly basic heterocycle. Another similarity to pyrrole is that being an &#x2018;electron-rich&#x2019; heterocycle indole easily undergoes aromatic electrophilic substitution, and is also rather unstable to oxidative (electron-loss) conditions. However, an important difference emerges here, in that whereas pyrrole preferentially reacts with electrophiles at the C2/C5 positions, indole substitutes selectively at the C3 position. The reasons for this will be discussed later.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Chapter 7 Indoles</a></p>
<p class="indent">Historically, interest in indoles arose with the isolation and characterisation of members of the enormous family of indole alkaloids, such as lysergic acid <b>7.4</b>. Many indole alkaloids possess interesting and sometimes useful biological activities. Although natural product chemistry is still an active area of primarily academic research, considerably more effort is expended nowadays in the preparation of indole derivatives as potential drug candidates. Following on from the observations that certain indole alkaloids or their semi-synthetic derivatives (e.g. lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD <b>7.5</b>) have potent central nervous system activity, it was established that the simple indole 5-hydroxytryptamine <b>7.6</b> is a major neurotransmitter. Many indole derivatives which mimic or block the binding of this neurotransmitter to its receptors have been synthesised and are beginning to find use in the treatment of various psychological disorders.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Synthesis of indoles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As might be expected for a large branch of heterocyclic chemistry, many syntheses of indoles have been developed. We shall restrict our discussion to two, commencing with the widely-used Fischer synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">The Fischer synthesis is the condensation of an aryl hydrazine with a ketone followed by cyclisation of the resultant hydrazone under acidic conditions to give the corresponding indole, as illustrated by the preparation of 2-phenyl indole <b>7.9</b>.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.4">
<img src="../images/f0054-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The actual cyclisation stage is not as imponderable as it appears. The first step is the acid-catalysed equilibration between hydrazone <b>7.8</b> and ene hydrazine <b>7.10</b>. The next step, which is irreversible, is a concerted electrocyclic reaction, forming a strong carbon&#x2013;carbon bond, and breaking a weak nitrogen&#x2013;nitrogen bond. The resulting imine <b>7.11</b> immediately re-aromatises by tautomerisation to aniline <b>7.12</b>. Finally, acid-catalysed elimination of ammonia forms indole <b>7.9</b>, reminiscent of the last step of the Knorr pyrrole synthesis (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 7 Indoles</a></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.5">
<img src="../images/f0055-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The electrocyclic reaction is very similar to the Claisen rearrangement of phenyl allyl ether <b>7.12</b> to give phenol <b>7.13</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Some examples of the Fischer indole synthesis are shown below.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.8">
<img src="../images/f0055-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">An interesting regioselectivity question arises with the use of unsymmetrical ketone <b>7.14</b> to prepare indole <b>7.15.</b> Two ene hydrazines <b>7.16</b> <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 7 Indoles</a>and <b>7.17</b> can form, which would give rise to indoles <b>7.15</b> and <b>7.18</b> respectively.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.9">
<img src="../images/f0056-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In such cases the most thermodynamically stable ene hydrazine, i.e. the one with the more highly substituted double bond, forms preferentially. In this particular example there is also extra stabilisation derived from conjugation of the lone pairs of electrons on the sulphur atom with the double bond. This regioselectivity in ene hydrazine formation is then reflected in the regioselectivity of indole formation.</p>
<p class="indent">The more recent Leimgruber synthesis is illustrated by the aminomethylenation of nitrotoluene <b>7.19</b> to give <b>7.20,</b> followed by hydrogenation to produce indole <b>7.1.</b></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.10">
<img src="../images/f0056-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The combination of formyl pyrrolidine acetal <b>7.21</b> and nitrotoluene <b>7.19</b> produces electrophilic cation <b>7.22</b> and nucleophilic carbanion <b>7.23a,b</b> which react together affording enamine <b>7.20.</b></p>

<img src="../images/f0056-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 7 Indoles</a></p>
<p class="indent">Hydrogenation of enamine <b>7.20</b> reduces the nitro group giving aniline <b>7.24,</b> then elimination of pyrrolidine produces indole <b>7.1.</b> Note the similarity of this ring closure step to the last step of the Fischer synthesis. In both cases the eventual C2 carbon atom is formally at the carbonyl oxidation level, even though it occurs as either an imine (Fischer synthesis) or an enamine (Leimgruber synthesis). Elimination of ammonia or pyrrolidine respectively is analogous to a condensation process involving elimination of water (as in the Knorr pyrrole synthesis).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Electrophilic substitution of indoles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As an electron-rich heterocycle, indole easily undergoes electrophilic substitution. However whereas pyrrole reacts preferentially at the C2/C5 positions (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>), indole reacts preferentially at the C3 position.</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.14">
<img src="../images/f0057-03.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">One explanation is that attack at C2 results in disruption of the aromaticity of the benzenoid ring, as in intermediate <b>7.25.</b> This is therefore a high-energy intermediate, and this reaction pathway is slower because the first step is rate-determining. Also the C3 selectivity is in accord with the electrophile attacking the site of highest electron density on the ring. In essence, indole tends to react like an enamine towards electrophiles, with substitution <a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Chapter 7 Indoles</a>occurring at the C3 position, although substitution occurs at the C2 position when the C3 position is blocked.</p>
<p class="indent">Indole itself is unstable to the mineral acid conditions for nitration. The nitration of substituted indoles is quite complex and the outcome is dependent on the precise reaction conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Like pyrrole, indole readily undergoes the Mannich reaction affording the aminomethyl derivative <b>7.26.</b> A variety of nucleophiles can displace the amine <i>via</i> an elimination followed by a 1,4-addition reaction, as in the preparation of acetate <b>7.27.</b></p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Acylation of the C3 position can also be accomplished with acid chlorides, as illustrated in the synthesis of indole <b>7.34,</b> a drug for the treatment of depression. Reaction of indole <b>7.31</b> with oxalyl chloride affords C3-substituted product <b>7.32</b> even though the benzene ring is very electron-rich. Conversion to amide <b>7.33</b> is followed by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride which removes both carbonyl groups, affording the target indole <b>7.34.</b></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Anion chemistry of indole</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Treatment of indole (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> &#x003D; 17) with strong bases such as butyl lithium, Grignard reagents, or metal hydrides produces the corresponding indolyl anion, which reacts with electrophiles either on nitrogen or at the C3 position. With lithium, sodium, or potassium as counterion the indolyl anion tends to react on nitrogen, as in the preparation of <b>7.35.</b> However, with magnesium as the counterion the intermediate has an essentially covalent rather than ionic structure, and reaction tends to occur at the C3 position, as in the preparation of <b>7.36.</b></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig_7.21">
<img src="../images/f0059-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">When the nitrogen is blocked, deprotonation can occur at the C2 position, adjacent to the electronegative heteroatom. This offers a means of introducing electrophiles at this position, complementing the C3 selectivity shown by classical electrophilic substitution. For instance, alcohol <b>7.37</b> can be prepared in this way using ethylene oxide as the electrophile.</p>
