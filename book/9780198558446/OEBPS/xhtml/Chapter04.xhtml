<p class="noindent">Reactions that show oscillations in closed systems give rise to a range of interesting wave behaviour in unstirred systems. As described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, clock reactions give rise to one-off reaction-diffusion fronts, with the reactants being completely consumed as the front passes. In BZ-type systems, the front corresponds to a wave of reaction involving the intermediates, with little consumption of the major reactants. The resetting mechanism means that there will be a wave &#x2018;back&#x2019; following the front, returning the system to its original, prefront state. This gives rise to a <i>pulse</i>. If there are further initiations, the system will also be able to support further waves, possibly giving rise to a series of pulses, a <i>wavetrain</i>. These wavetrains can organize the reaction mixture in two or three dimensions into a variety of intricate, evolving patterns.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Kinematic and phase waves</h2>
<p class="noindent">Two of the types of wave observed in so-called <i>active media</i>, such as the BZ reaction, have little to do with diffusion. If the BZ reagent is distributed in a tube along which a spatial gradient of say pH or temperature is established, the period of the spontaneous oscillation will vary continuously in space. This can give rise to an apparent travelling wave, as the red &#x2192; blue transition occurs at slightly different times at each position. This <i>kinematic wave</i> is of the same character as the &#x2018;moving&#x2019; lights of a neon advertising sign. A <i>phase wave</i> also has little involvement of diffusion, relying on the reaction being initiated at different times as we move along the tube. There is no background spatial gradient, but the spontaneous oscillation again occurs at a time that varies smoothly along the tube, giving the appearance of movement. The speeds at which such waves &#x2018;travel&#x2019; is determined primarily by the underlying concentration of phase gradients and so can be tuned to almost any value. Phase waves do play a role in creating the patterns in the BZ and other systems, but only when coupled with true reaction-diffusion or <i>trigger</i> waves.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Trigger waves in one dimension: pulses</h2>
<p class="noindent">The BZ system supports pulses or wavetrains for compositions such that the bulk reaction is spontaneously oscillatory. The situation is, however, somewhat simpler if the conditions are changed slightly, so that the reaction mixture is spontaneously excitable (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.7">Section 3.7</a>). This means that the reaction sits at steady state in the absence of perturbations. Small perturbations <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>lead only to a rapid return to the steady state but disturbances above some critical threshold cause a single, large excursion before returning.</p>

<p class="indent">An excitable system subjected to a single, sufficiently large initiation will support a single wave pulse. The front of this pulse is very little different from the fronts described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. Ahead of the front, the mixture is in the reduced state (coloured red). The front is a wave of oxidation, that causes an increase in HBrO<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>ox</sub>, with a consequent decrease in Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, as sketched in <a href="#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>. Immediately after the wave, there is a period during which [HBrO<sub>2</sub>] falls only slowly. This quasi-steady region is the equivalent of the post-front composition in the iodate-arsenite system. In the BZ system, however, there is a wave back following some distance behind. This is a reduction wave, through which HBrO<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>ox</sub> are consumed and Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is produced, returning to their pre-front concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent">The wave propagates at a constant velocity and is driven by the diffusion of HBrO<sub>2</sub> into the reduced state ahead of the front. There, it reduces the local Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup> concentration (via Process A reactions). Once [Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] decreases below [Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>cr</sub>, the autocatalytic Process B leads to the local oxidation and production of HBrO<sub>2</sub> as in the homogeneous oscillation. The autocatalysis in the BZ system gives rise to a quadratic-type rate law, <i>x</i>(1-<i>x</i>), as seen in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#eq3.11">Eqn (3.11)</a>, for example. The analysis in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq2.13">Eqn (2.13)</a>, showed that the speed of such reaction-diffusion fronts is given by</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Waves in two dimensions: circles and targets</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many of the studies of waves in the BZ system have been carried out in thin films of solution in a Petri dish. Again, the simplest situation arises when the reaction mixture is excitable, rather than spontaneously oscillatory. A point source initiation then naturally gives rise to an expanding circular wave pulse. Once these have expanded sufficiently, they propagate much as one-dimensional waves. In the presence of a periodic or continuous stimulation, a series of concentric rings, giving rise to a <i>target patterns</i> of blue circles nested on a red background, emerges, as shown in <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>. The inner rings rely on the resetting of the intermediate concentrations and so are not possible in one-off clock-type reactions.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">Recipe due to A.T. Winfree for BZ target patterns: mix 67 rnl H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 ml H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 5 g NaBrO<sub>3</sub>. Take 6 ml and add &#x00BD; ml of a solution of 1 g NaBr in 10 ml H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 ml of a solution of 1 g malonic acid in 10 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. Wait for the Br<sub>2</sub> produced to vanish. Add 1 ml of 2mM ferroin and wait for waves to develop. Other recipes are collated by W. Jahnke and A.T. Winfree (1991). <i>J. Chem. Educ</i>., <b>68</b>, 320.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The spontaneous initiation of the waves in a target pattern appears to rely on the presence of heterogeneities, such as the presence of dust particles or defects in the surface of the Petri dish. Careful filtering suppresses this spontaneous initiation in excitable systems. Each target reflects the frequency of the initiation at its centre. If this is caused by random heterogeneities, different target cores may naturally have different frequencies. The speed of the waves varies from one target pattern to another, with low frequencies leading to higher velocities. These two effects mean that the waves are more closely spaced for high frequency sources, i.e., these have a shorter wavelength.</p>
<p class="indent">When waves from two targets collide, they annihilate each other. As the subsequent wave for the higher frequency pattern comes closer on the heels of the annihilated wave than that for the low frequency source, the next collision occurs closer to the latter. Over the course of several collisions, waves from the high frequency source eventually reach the vicinity of the low frequency core, which is then also annihilated. High frequency targets grow at the expense of low frequency ones; given sufficient time, the highest frequency source will entrain the whole dish.</p>
<p class="indent">For a given target pattern, <a href="#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a> also reveals that the outermost wave travels at a slightly higher speed than subsequent, inner waves, all of which have essentially the same speed. This indicates a dependence of the velocity on the concentrations ahead of the wave that does not emerge in the simple analysis leading to <a href="#eq4.5">Eqn (4.5)</a>. This point is addressed below.</p>

<p class="noindent">These equations, including the Fick&#x2019;s law diffusion terms &#x25BD;<sup>2</sup>x and &#x25BD;<sup>2</sup>z, are dimensionless, with <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> representing [HBrO<sub>2</sub>] and [M<sub>ox</sub>] respectively. The appearance of the terms &#x03B5;<sup>2</sup> and &#x03B5; in front of the diffusion terms indicates that the diffusion coefficients of HBrO<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>ox</sub> are relatively small quantities compared with the size of the Petri dish and the kinetic timescale.

<p class="noindent">Again, we can use the <i>x-z</i> phase plane and the nullclines of the kinetic terms, to represent the wave pictorially. With an excitable system, the intersection point of the nullclines occurs to the left of the minimum in the x-nullcline as indicated in <a href="#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>. The steady-state composition corresponds the reaction mixture sufficiently far ahead of any advancing wave front. As a front approaches, the diffusion of HBrO<sub>2</sub> increases <i>x</i> locally. If <i>x</i> is increased beyond the threshold value, corresponding to the middle of the jt-nullcline, then the local kinetics will cause the system to jump across the <a id="page_45" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 45, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>phase plane to the right-hand branch. This jump can be identified with the leading front of the wave pulse.</p>

<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:0em; margin-top:1em;"><b>Fig. 4.3</b> Phase plane representation of BZ waves. Initially the system sits at the steady state indicated by the intersection of the x- and z-nullclines. An increase in [HBrO<sub>2</sub>] (<i>x</i>) may arise due to diffusion from an approaching front. Once this perturbs the system sufficiently far from the steady state (across the middle branch of the x-nullcline as indicated by dashed line) the system responds with a fast motion across the phase plane to the right-hand branch of the nullcline: the concentration of the oxidized form of the catalyst remains virtually constant during this jump, with <i>z</i> = <i>z</i><sub>ss</sub>. This corresponds to the outermost wavefront of a target pattern. The system then undergoes slow motion along the right-hand branch of the <i>x</i>-nullcline, during which oxidation of the metal catalyst and hence a colour change occurs, until it approaches the maximum. Close to the maximum, there is a sharp transition back to the left-hand branch, corresponding to the wave back. In this recovery process, the system then evolves along the left-hand branch, with <i>z</i> decreasing. At some stage a further front is initiated, but this usually occurs before <i>z</i> regains its steady state concentration and so lies at higher <i>z</i>.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The jump occurs whilst the concentration of the oxidized catalyst <i>z</i> remains effectively constant and equal to its steady-state value. Rather than dealing with two reaction-diffusion equations, therefore, we need only consider the modified form of <a href="#eq4.6">Eqn (4.6)</a></p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq4.8">
 <img src="../images/page45-14.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">where <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> is a constant, and <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>z</i><sub>ss</sub> in this case. Apart from the final term, <a href="#eq4.8">Eqn (4.8)</a> is essentially the same as <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq2.8">Eqn (2.8)</a>, with a quadratic autocatalytic rate law rather than a cubic form. In fact, as <i>x</i><sub>ss</sub> &#x2248; <i>q</i>, the second term makes little contribution at the leading edge of the front, which is where the wave-speed is mainly determined. As the system departs from the left-hand branch and <i>x</i> increases, however, the final term in <a href="#eq4.8">Eqn (4.8)</a> makes its <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>presence felt. The value of <i>x</i> ahead of the front <i>x</i>, is simply the steady-state value, <i>x</i> = <i>x</i><sub>ss</sub>: after the jump, <i>x</i> &#x2248; 1, with the exact value <i>x</i><sub>+</sub> given by the highest solution of the nullcline condition</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq4.9">
 <img src="../images/page46-15.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">for the same <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>z</i><sub>ss</sub>. The wave-speed is determined by <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> and also by the concentrations <i>x</i><sub>&#x2212;</sub> and <i>x</i><sub>+</sub> ahead of and behind the front.</p>
<p class="indent">In the post-front region, the system, moves along the right-hand branch of the x-nullcline, just as observed for the well-stirred system. The concentration of the oxidized catalyst, <i>z</i>, therefore also changes in this region. At some point, there is a jump back to the left-hand branch corresponding to the wave back. This jump may occur when the system reaches the maximum in the nullcline, or it may happen earlier, stimulated by diffusional loss of <i>x</i>. If the pulse is to maintain a constant shape, the speed of the wave back must equal that of the front. The wave-speed will again be determined by <a href="#eq4.8">Eqn (4.8)</a>, but this has now to be solved for some higher value of <i>z</i><sub>0</sub>; the initial and final values for <i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sub>+</sub>, and <i>x</i><sub>&#x2212;</sub>, are also different from those appropriate to the front. If a back with the appropriate speed does not exist, this <i>recovery</i> wave is simply a phase wave.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the system has returned locally to the left-hand branch of the <i>x</i>-nullcline, it slowly evolves along this towards the steady state. For a one-off circular wave pulse, the steady state will finally be attained (strictly speaking at infinite time). For target patterns, however, the system may not have time to return to the vicinity of the steady-state point. At some time determined by the frequency of the source, a subsequent front will approach. Provided the system has recovered sufficiently to have left its refractory phase and regained its excitability, the diffusion of HBrO<sub>2</sub> from this new wave will increase <i>x</i> beyond its (slightly higher) threshold and stimulate a new jump to the right. This occurs for some <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> that is higher than <i>z</i><sub>ss</sub> and so the wave will have a different (lower) speed than the first for which <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>z</i><sub>ss</sub>. All subsequent waves will jump from the same z<sub>0</sub>, whose value will depend on the source frequency, and so have the same speed. If we concentrate on the behaviour at any given point in the reaction medium, locally the solution is simply undergoing a regular oscillation similar to that described in the previous chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Targets with different frequency sources will have different effective values of <i>z</i><sub>0</sub> and hence different speeds, as observed experimentally. The dependence of the wave-speed on the source frequency or, equivalently, the period or wavelength of the target pattern is known as the <i>dispersion relation</i>. This can be determined (numerically) from <a href="#eq4.8">Eqn (4.8)</a> which gives the speed, and <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#eq3.23">Eqn (3.23)</a> which gives the period.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Curvature effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The above analysis is appropriate to plane waves or to circular waves that have grown sufficiently large in radius to have low curvature. For the initial development of circular waves at the centre of a target, however, there is <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>generally high curvature. Typical sizes of the source for target patterns indicate a diameter of the order of 90 &#x03BC;m: for a circle, the curvature is simply the inverse of the radius, &#x03BA; = 1/<i>r</i>. With high curvatures, the dilution due to diffusional spreading of the autocatalyst into the region ahead of the wave is much enhanced compared to the planar wave case. If this dilution is too strong, the wave may fail as the perturbation will not reach the threshold required to reduce [Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] to its critical value.

<h2 class="h2">4.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Spirals</h2>
<p class="noindent">If target waves are broken, e.g., by gently tilting the reaction mixture, the two ends created respond by curling up to form a pair of counter-rotating spirals. Spiral waves thus formed are shown in <a href="#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>. In contrast to the behaviour of targets, all spirals in a given BZ reaction mixture rotate with the same period and wavelength, reflecting the bulk kinetics rather than local heterogeneities. (The outermost turn of the spiral propagates at a slightly higher speed than the inner turns as it is propagating into reagent at the steady-state composition; the inner turns are propagating into the wake of an earlier wave, exactly as for target waves.) The propagation speed must be constant at all places in the bulk, or the spiral will deform as it evolves. This conservation of shape provides a second condition that selects just one of the wave speed-period pairs from the dispersion curve available to target patterns. Spirals with multiple arms have also been created experimentally; <a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> shows examples with 1, 2, 3, and 4 arms rotating about a common core.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fig. 4.6(a). As the conditions are varied, however, the tip of the spiral begins to meander. Initially, this involves a second oscillation appearing, so the tip describes a quasiperiodic motion. As the behaviour becomes more complex, various patterns resembling flowers or other objects are described by the tip path as shown in <a href="#fig4.6">Fig. 4.6(c)</a>. This change from &#x2018;rigid&#x2019; to &#x2018;compound&#x2019; rotation occurs as the excitability of the system is decreased. This can be achieved experimentally by decreasing the concentration of bromate or H<sup>+</sup>. In terms of the dimensionless parameters in the Oregonator model, this corresponds to increasing the value of <i>f</i>, so that the intersection point moves further up the left-hand branch of the <i>x</i>-nullcline away from the minimum, or of increasing the value of &#x03B5;, so that the two species HBrO<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>ox</sub> (<i>x</i> and <i>z</i>) evolve on less different timescales.

<p class="noindent">&#x2018;phase-locked&#x2019; quasiperiodic motion, with the two oscillatory frequencies having some simple ratio, so that the actual path closes up. Further complexities arise as the excitability is decreased further and the size of the petal shape shows a general increase as <i>f</i> increases. Eventually, as the system becomes sufficiently non-excitable, the system may return to simple quasi-periodic meandering, then to rigid rotation and, finally, spiral wave behaviour can no longer be supported.</p>
<p class="indent">Spiral waves are also observed in the growth cycle of the slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i> A colony of this beast will feed in a given area until the nutrient falls below some critical concentration. Certain cells then begin to emit periodically a messenger chemical cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The surrounding cells then migrate towards these pacemakers, proceeding up the concentration gradient (a feedback process known as <i>Chemotaxis</i>). This gives rise to spirals in the cell density that are virtually indistinguishable from the BZ spirals in black and white photographs.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Waves in three dimensions: scroll waves</h2>
<p class="noindent">A single spiral can be imagined lying in an extremely thin reaction layer, but in thicker layers or other genuine three-dimensional situations, other shapes <a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>are possible. The simplest situation would arise if the solution effectively gives rise to a set of spiral waves stacked up exactly on top of each other. The resulting wave would then resemble a scroll of paper unwinding, as sketched in <a href="#fig4.7">Fig. 4.7</a> (or, at least, a folded sheet of paper unwinding: the waves have fronts and backs and a tip corresponding to the fold). The tips of these stacked spirals would then revolve around a stack of cores, describing a thin circular tube or <i>filament</i>. In this simplest case, the filament is straight. In other situations, the filament may bend or twist. This arises because the unwinding spiral sheets distort and stretch. In some cases, the inner sheets of the spirals may collide with outer turns, leading to annihilations. Some very complex three dimensional patterns are created with the filament forming a loop or becoming knotted, giving rise to highly dramatic three-dimensional wave structures.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Significance in biology</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spiral and scroll waves occur in some important areas outside chemistry. Waves of <i>spreading depression</i> have been observed associated with the depolarization of the neuronal membrane of the brain, spiralling around lesions in the brain cortex. The correlation between such wave activity and such abnormalities as epilepsy is under current study. Scroll waves have been linked reasonably firmly with <i>cardiac arrhythmias</i>. Under normal circumstances, heart muscle produces a coordinated contraction with a frequency of <i>c</i>. 1 Hz; in <i>ventricular flutter</i>, larger amplitude contractions occur with a frequency of <i>c</i>. 7 Hz and are associated with a rotating spiral wave in the heart tissue; in <i>fibrillation</i>, the contractions are smaller in amplitude and occur in an apparently random manner, with potentially fatal consequences. The onset of fibrillation seems to be connected with the development of scroll-type waves in the muscular wall of the heart. Elsewhere, calcium waves pass over the surface of a fertilized egg as a precursor to cell division. The enhancement in velocity achieved by coupling diffusion to a feedback process is exploited for nerve signal transmission: repetitive signalling requires a resetting mechanism. The Hodgkin-Huxley model for this system essentially involves a voltage and an ion current (due to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> balances across the nerve membrane) which evolve in a phase plane containing a cubic-type nullcline intersected by a linear nullcline that is very similar to that for the BZ system.</p>

<h2 class="h2">4.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Patterns: diffusion-driven instabilities</h2>
<p class="noindent">In 1952, Alan Turing predicted theoretically that chemical systems showing feedback in situations where not all species diffuse with the same mobility might give rise to <i>spontaneous pattern formation.</i> An initially well-mixed, homogeneous solution would, then, evolve of its own volition to produce spatial gradients in the participating species, with local enhancements or depletions in the concentrations of some of the speqies. If such <i>diffusion-driven instabilities</i> arise in the BZ or iodate-arsenite systems, they would <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>give rise to local variations in colour that would reveal the <i>Turing patterns.</i> Turing suggested that this kinetic-diffusion process might underlie the spontaneous development of spatial form in morphogenesis, e.g., of a developing embryo. The mechanism has also been implicated in the spots and stripes marking animal coats and how these change with the size of the animal.</p>

<p class="indent">The main condition on the diffusion coefficients is that for the autocatalytic species must be sufficiently less than that for the reactant. For the iodate-arsenite system this would require <img src="../images/page51-24.jpg" alt="images"/>. Under normal circumstances, ions have diffusion coefficients that do not vary much from <a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Targets, spirals, and scrolls</a>one species to another, so Turning patterns have not been widely observed in chemical systems. Very recently, however, the first examples have been obtained by carrying out a variation of the iodate-arsenite reaction in a gel into which a complexing agent that binds I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
