<p class="noindent">The first two types of &#x2018;exotic behaviour&#x2019; arising from chemical feedback that we will consider are the related phenomena of <i>clock reactions</i> and <i>chemical waves</i>. The iodate-arsenite and iodate-bisulphate mentioned in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a> provide a good introduction, but the phenomena are observed in a much wider range of systems from gas to solid phases and into biology.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_2.1">
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Clock reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The classic clock reaction, discovered by Landolt in 1886, involves the autocatalytic iodate-bisulphite system. The reactants, in aqueous solution and with added starch indicator, are colourless. There is a long induction period, during which the iodide ion concentration increases slowly, followed by a rapid acceleration in the rate which leads to a sharp colour change. The effect is most spectacular and draws a gasp from even the most sophisticated audience. If the reductant is in stoichiometric excess, the colour fades again.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-9.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="margin-left:2em;">The Landolt clock can be demonstrated by mixing 0.02M solutions of KIO<sub>3</sub> (2.14 g in 0.5 dm<sup>3</sup>) and NaHSO<sub>3</sub> (0.95 g of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in 0.5 dm<sup>3</sup>); 50 cm<sup>3</sup> of each mixed with a few drops of 1% starch solution gives a clock time of approximately 1 minute. This can be lengthened by dilution. The bisulphite solution oxidizes in air over the course of several hours, so should not be prepared too far in advance of use.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The induction period <i>t</i><sub><i>ind</i></sub> depends on the initial concentrations of the reactants iodate and reductant:</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq2.1">
<img src="../images/page14-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">with <i>k</i> = 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> M<sup>2</sup>s. A solution that is initially 0.01M in each of the reactants has a 40s induction time. By varying the initial concentrations, the clock time can be adjusted over a wide range. The clock works equally well with arsenite as the reductant, although iodide ion normally then has to be added initially. The induction period is extremely sensitive to the initial concentrations of the iodide autocatalyst.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic origin of this clock behaviour can be discerned with reference back to <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>. The Landolt system is qualitatively well represented by the cubic curve (b). At the beginning of the reaction, at &#958; = 0, the rate is virtually zero because of the low iodide concentration. The rate at which the extent of conversion increases, and hence at which the system moves from left to right along the &#958;-axis, is determined by the height of the curve. Thus the system crawls only very slowly away from the origin, with the rate only increasing slowly at first. Once the reaction has had sufficient time to develop, however, the rate begins to increase dramatically and so the progress along the &#x03BE;-axis accelerates.</p>
<p class="indent">The iodate-reductant system can be simulated successfully using the empirical rate-law forms presented in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.3">Section 1.3</a>. <a href="#fig2.1">Figure 2.1</a> shows the evolution of the reactant <img src="../images/page14-2.jpg" alt="images"/>, autocatalyst I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and intermediate I<sub>2</sub> for an iodate-arsenite system with excess reductant. The clock has an induction <a id="page_15" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 15, Clocks and fronts</a>period of <i>c</i>. 15 minutes. With excess iodate, I<sub>2</sub> remains after the reaction event and the iodide concentration shows a peak before falling back to zero.</p>

<p class="indent">This computation can readily be repeated for different initial concentrations or pH, as indicated in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. At the expense of some approximation, however, the functional dependence of <i>t</i><sub><i>ind</i></sub> on <img src="../images/page15-4.jpg" alt="images"/>, etc., can be obtained analytically. The cubic autocatalysis model, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq1.13">Eqn (1.13)</a> was introduced in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a> and its similarity to the empirical rate law above, with <img src="../images/page15-5.jpg" alt="images"/> and B = I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, mentioned in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>.

<p class="indent">This allows the time for the iodate concentration to fall from its initial value <i>a</i><sub>o</sub> to any other value <i>a</i> to be calculated. The computed results in <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Clocks and fronts</a><a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> suggest that the colour change occurs when <i>a</i> = &#189; <i>a</i><sub>o</sub>, i.e., when half the original iodate has reacted. If we also neglect the term <i>b</i><sub>o</sub> as small compared with <i>a</i><sub>o</sub> or &#x00BD; <i>a</i><sub>o</sub> where possible, and note that the logarithmic term will generally provide only a small correction to the second term in the square brackets, we obtain the much simpler expression</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq2.4">
<img src="../images/page16-1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Thus the induction period should lengthen inversely with the initial iodate and iodide concentrations and as the inverse square of the H<sup>+</sup> concentration. These predictions are borne out in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>, although the dependence on [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>o</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup> deviates from linearity at high initial iodide concentrations. Substituting in the data from <a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>, <a href="#eq2.4">Eqn (2.4)</a> predicts <i>t</i><sub><i>ind</i></sub> = 27 minutes. In fact the quadratic channel is not negligible under these conditions, at least in the initial stages, so agreement to within better than a factor of 2 cannot be expected. Nevertheless, the iodate-arsenite system does indeed show the above functional dependence on [H<sup>+</sup>], <img src="../images/page16-2.jpg" alt="images"/>, and [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>o</sub> experimentally. We may also compare <a href="#eq2.4">Eqn (2.4)</a> with the empirical form <a href="#eq2.1">(2.1)</a>. The latter applies to systems in which no H<sup>+</sup> is added other than as <img src="../images/page16-3.jpg" alt="images"/>. If the dissociation constant <i>K</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> for the process</p>

<img src="../images/page16-4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">is small compared with <img src="../images/page16-5.jpg" alt="images"/>, then a simple calculation shows <img src="../images/page16-6.jpg" alt="images"/>. Provided [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>o</sub> remains constant in a sequence of experiments, then the two expressions are consistent.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Other examples of clock reactions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Clock-type behaviour is observed not only in solution phase reactions, but also in a wider context. In gas phase reactions involving the oxidation of simple hydrocarbon such as n-butane, long induction periods, perhaps of the order of days, are also frequently observed. Chemical autocatalysis, arising from chain branching, is again involved but thermal feedback can also play a part. When heat transfer from the reactor is sufficiently slow that the heat released by the reaction causes significant self-heating of the gaseous reactants, the sharpness of the final acceleration increases dramatically. As the reaction typically is chemiluminescent (via emission from electronically excited HCHO), a brief flash of light can be seen just as the reaction goes rapidly from low extents of conversion to completion at the end of the induction period. This behaviour is known as the <i>pic d&#x2019;arr&#x00EA;t</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Even longer induction periods arise in the clock reactions associated with thermal runaway. The most well-known example of such <i>thermal explosions</i> is the apparently sudden ignition of haystacks, possibly many months after assembly. In fact, this is a relatively common phenomenon, arising wherever cellulosic material, coal or many other oxidizable &#x2018;fuels&#x2019; are stored for extended periods in air.</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying cause of thermal runaway pan be illustrated with a simpler model. We can imagine a pile of some reactant surrounded by a <a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Clocks and fronts</a>reservoir at some fixed ambient temperature <i>T</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>, as sketched in <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. An exothermic reaction proceeds at some low, but nonzero rate. The resulting heat released causes heating of the reactant to some higher temperature <i>T</i>. For simplicity, the temperature within the reactant will be taken to be uniform, as though the system were well stirred. Now, two effects must be considered. First, the reaction rate, and hence the rate of heat evolution, will increase because of the raised local temperature. Secondly, as the material is hotter than its surroundings, there will be heat transfer to the reservoir, perhaps by Newtonian cooling so the rate of heat loss depends on the temperature difference &#x0394;<i>T</i> = <i>T</i> &#x2212; <i>T</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>. Depending on the size and shape of the pile, the ambient temperature and the exothermicity of the reaction, either the rate of heat loss will eventually grow to balance the rate of chemical heat evolution, giving rise to only small temperature differences, or the rate of heat evolution will always remain greater than that for heat transfer, in which case the temperature will continue to rise until and ignition occurs.</p>

The surroundings are held at a fixed temperature, but exothermic reaction increases the temperature within the reaction volume <i>V</i> to <i>T</i>. Heat transfer occurs by Newtonian cooling across the surface area <i>A</i> at a rate determined by the temperature excess &#x0394;<i>T</i> = <i>T</i> &#x2212; <i>T</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>, and the heat transfer coefficient &#x03C7;.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">These two situations can be illustrated graphically by means of a <i>thermal diagram.</i> The rate at which the temperature within the pile changes with time is governed by the <i>heat balance equation</i>, which can be written in the form</p>
<figure class="fig1a" id="eq2.6">
<img src="../images/page17-2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">where <i>c</i><sub>p</sub> is the specific heat capacity and &#x03C3; the density. The two terms on the right-hand side, &#x211C;(<i>T</i>) and &#x2112;(<i>T</i>) are the rates of chemical heat release and heat transfer per unit volume. In the heat release term, <i>Q</i> is the reaction exothermicity (= &#x2212;&#x0394;<i>H</i>), <i>c</i> represents the &#x2018;concentration&#x2019; of the reactant, whilst the group <i>Ae</i><sup><i>&#x2212;E/RT</i></sup> is the reaction rate constant written to show explicitly its temperature dependence. If the concentration term is treated as a constant, &#x211C; varies with the temperature inside the pile as shown in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>, following the Arrhenius form. The heat transfer term &#x2112; shows a linear dependence on the temperature rise, as indicated in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>. The slope is governed by <i>&#x03C7;</i><sup><i>S/V</i></sup>, where &#x03C7; is the heat transfer coefficient and <i>S/V</i> is the surface to volume ratio. Thus, the slope of the heat-loss term is determined by factors such as the size and shape of the pile. The intercept of &#x2112; on the temperature axis is given by the ambient temperature, <i>T</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>.</p>

<p class="indent">Two heat-loss lines are shown in <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>, corresponding to slightly different ambient temperatures. For the lower ambient temperature, <i>T</i><sub>&#x03B1;,1</sub>, the heat generation and heat-loss lines intersect at some temperature <i>T</i><sub>ss</sub> relatively close to <i>T</i><sub>a,1</sub>. This intersection represents a point of thermal balance, so &#x211C;(T<sub>SS</sub>) = &#x2112;(<i>T</i><sub>ss</sub>) and d<i>T</i>/d<i>t</i> = 0. For this case, <i>T</i> will increase from <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> and approach this intersection temperature exponentially. A small steady-state temperature excess will be established. This represents <i>subcritical</i> behaviour. The case with ambient temperature <i>T</i><sub>a,2</sub> is <i>supercritical</i>. &#x211C; and &#x2112; never intersect: the rate of heat evolution always exceeds the rate of heat loss, so d<i>T</i>/d<i>t</i> is always positive and the temperature within the pile increases steadily with time. At any given time, the rate at which the temperature is <a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Clocks and fronts</a>increasing is proportional to the difference between &#x211C; and &#x2112;.

<p class="indent">Clock reaction behaviour has also been observed in the polymerization of a mutant form of haemoglobin, associated with the disease sickle cell anaemia, to form a highly viscous gel. The apparent rate law here indicates a dependence of rate on somewhere between the 20th and 30th power of the initial haemoglobin concentration.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Supercatalysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Clock reaction behaviour is also observed in the reaction between chlorite and thiosulfate ions. In this case, however, the clock induction time appears not to be repeatable from experiment to experiment. Instead, the observed clock times are distributed statistically about a mean value, with the distribution and mean being reproducible from one series of experiments to another. The origin of this phenomenon is not completely clear, but has been termed <i>supercatalysis</i> to indicate an especially high degree of chemical feedback through the autocatalytic species H<sup>+</sup>. In fact, the formal kinetic order of this reaction is approximately 10, compared with the order of 5 for the Landolt system. A 1% error in dilution between successive experiments would thus give rise to a factor of (1.01)<sup>10</sup> = 1.1, i.e., of approximately 10% in the initial rate and may be expected to have similar implications on the observed clock time. The sickle cell haemoglobin clock also shows such a distribution of clock times.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the Landolt clock reaction, the reactants are usually well-mixed initially. Any addition of the autocatalyst I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is usually done with a swirl of the mixture to ensure an even distribution, so all parts develop at the same rate towards the final, equilibrium state. As a variation on this theme, the initiation may be performed in a different way, confined to a small localized region. For instance, reaction may be initiated at a point in a thin layer in a petri dish using a thin Pt electrode negatively biased with respect to the counter-electrode. This causes a local increase in [I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>] via electrochemical reduction of <img src="../images/page18-2.jpg" alt="images"/>. More simply, a small drop of relatively concentrated idodide solution can be added to the top of a test-tube containing the iodate-reductant mixture. In these cases, the clock reaction spreads away from the initiation site, giving rise to a spatially resolved clock or <i>chemical wavefront</i>.

The reactants ahead of any wavefront are thus effectively &#x2018;kinetically frozen&#x2019; in their initial state and rely on the diffusion of iodide from the wave to initiate the conversion to products locally. Once the reaction begins, locally, much more iodide is produced and this can then diffuse into neighbouring regions, initiating the clock reaction there. Thus, the wave is a combined reaction-diffusion process that converts the system from its initial state to its final equilibrium composition. This is the characteristic feature of a <i>front.</i> Other types of wave (<i>pulses</i> and <i>wavetrains</i>) will be introduced in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The evolution of the iodide concentration and the development of a pair of reaction-diffusion fronts is illustrated in <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>. A small input of the autocatalyst I<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is introduced close to the origin at <i>t</i> = 0. Reaction is initiated and the autocatalyst begins to spread: the initial &#x2018;top hat&#x2019; grows and widens. Eventually, all the iodate is consumed in the vicinity of the initiation site. The local concentration of iodide thus established slightly exceeds the initial iodate concentration, by an amount that depends on the initial input of iodide: this excess slowly decays by purely diffusional spreading over a longer timescale. The final three concentration profiles in <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a> reveal the outward propagating fronts. Ahead of each front is a region of unreacted iodate and no iodide: behind each front the composition corresponds to complete reaction. These profiles have been computed at equal time intervals. This reveals another characteristic feature of such reaction-diffusion fronts: <i>they travel at a constant velocity through the reaction mixture.</i> Typical wave speeds for the iodate-arsenite reaction are of the order of 1 mm min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. We may compare this with the timescale for simple diffusional spreading. For a simple one-dimensional configuration, the mean displacement due to diffusion after time <i>t</i> is given by <img src="../images/page20-2.jpg" alt="images"/> = 2(<i>Dt</i>)<sup>&#x00BD;</sup> where <i>D</i> is the diffusion coefficient. Typical values for <i>D</i> for small ions in aqueous solutions are of the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, thus the time taken for diffusion to cause spreading over 1 cm would be approximately 400 min. This is more than an order of magnitude slower than the progress of the reaction-diffusion front, which would cover 1 cm in approximately 10 min. The enhancement in velocity arises because only small amounts of the autocatalyst have to diffuse before the chemistry is stimulated into producing more. Reaction-diffusion processes are believed to underlie the signalling mechanisms in many biological systems which exploit this potential for enhanced propagation velocity.</p>

<p class="indent">Returning to the iodate-arsenite system, <a href="#eq2.12">Eqn (2.12)</a> predicts that the wave-speed will increase linearly with both the initial iodate concentration and with [H<sup>+</sup>]. The front thickness, however, will vary inversely with these concentrations, from <a href="#eq2.11">Eqn (2.11)</a>. For a system with <img src="../images/page22-2.jpg" alt="images"/> = 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> M, [H<sup>+</sup>] = 7.1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> M and D = 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, we have <i>c</i> = 0.66 mm min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and l<sub>d</sub> = 0.18 mm.

<p class="indent">For the circular wave initiated from a thin wire electrode and propagating outward in a petri dish, the initial wave-speed is usually slower than that predicted above (which effectively applies to a planar front). The influence of <i>curvature</i> on wave-speeds will be particularly important when we consider different types of chemical waves in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. A curved wavefront allows the autocatalyst diffusing ahead to become diluted by simple geometric spreading, thus reducing the chemical reaction rate, leading to a lower propagation speed. As the radius of the circular wave increases, however, the curvature decreases and eventually the wave front appears locally to be effectively planar, and the above wave-speed is achieved.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Oscillatory and nonplanar fronts</h2>
<p class="noindent">The simple one-dimensional wavefronts described above, propagating with constant speed and shape, arise for systems in which the reactant and autocatalytic species diffuse with roughly the same diffusion coefficient. In the case of nonisothermal flames, the equivalent case is that for which the molecular and thermal diffusivities are approximately equal. These are not unusual situations. However, there are also cases of interest in which the reactant and feedback (autocatalyst or heat) species diffuse at significantly different rates. This allows some additional phenomena.</p>
<p class="indent">For isothermal systems, the reactant and autocatalyst may have different mobilities if they have very different molecular sizes. The same effect arises if one of the species is immobilized by adsorption onto a solid phase (as occurs in chromatography or with ion-exchange resins, for example) or forms a complex with a larger ligand, especially, if that ligand can be immobilized in a suitable gel. In the Landolt system, iodide complexes with <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Clocks and fronts</a>cyclodextrin are distribyted through a polyacrylamide gel to effectively reduce its diffusivity: in the BZ system, the positively-charged catalyst can be adsorbed into a cation-exchange resin whilst the anionic reactant species BrO<sup>&#x2212;</sup><sub>3</sub>; remains free to diffuse. For flame systems with light fuels such as Hz, the molecular diffusivity is significantly higher than the thermal diffusivity: for heavier hydrocarbon fuels and for solid phase pyrotechnic systems, in which the fuel is effectively immobile, the opposite situation arises.</p>
<p class="banoindent2"><b>Feedback species with higher diffusivity: oscillatory wave speed</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If the thermal diffusivity is sufficiently higher than the molecular diffusivity and the reaction is sufficiently exothermic, the premixed laminar flame described above can cease to support a combustion front propagating at a steady speed and constant shape. Instead, the speed of the flame oscillates in time, with the flame constantly accelerating and decelerating. The flame never actually goes backwards (into the burnt products) but its forward speed varies continuously as it propagates into the unburnt reactants. The shape of the flame front also varies in time, as indicated in <a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. For some of the oscillatory period, the local temperature in the flame front can exceed the equilibrium adiabatic temperature rise. Whilst this local &#x2018;superheating&#x2019; is occurring, the flame advances more rapidly, driven by the enhanced diffusion of heat into the region ahead. However, this extra heat transfer enhances the reaction rate which leads to a depletion of the reactant concentration ahead of the flame. The development of a maximum in the temperature profile also leads to an additional heat loss process, cooling by conduction to the less hot products behind as well as to the cold reactant ahead. The superadiabatic temperatures cannot be sustained. The front slows as it passes through the depleted region before entering a region in which the reactant concentration remains high and the acceleration process and superadiabatic temperatures can develop again. Oscillating fronts of this nature have been observed experimentally in solid (&#x2018;gasless&#x2019;) pyrotechnic mixtures. Oscillatory fronts are also supported by higher orders of autocatalysis if the diffusion coefficient of the reactant is sufficiently small.</p>
<p class="banoindent2"><b>Feedback species with lower diffusivity: patterned fronts</b></p>
<p class="noindent">For the opposite case in which the reactant diffuses more rapidly than the autocatalyst or heat, the significant changes arise when waves propagating in two or three dimensions are considered. The important qualitative change in this case can be illustrated by considering propagation of a chemical front along a long, thin two-dimensional strip. The analogue of the one-dimensional fronts discussed above would here be a planar wave propagating in the <i>x</i>-direction so that there are no concentration gradients in the <i>y</i>-direction. However, if the diffusivities are sufficiently different and the feedback is sufficiently strong (cubic rather than quadratic), such planar fronts may become spontaneously unstable and a &#x2018;wiggly&#x2019; front emerges. <a href="#fig2.9">Figure 2.9</a> indicates the development of a nonplanar front for a case of cubic autocatalysis in which D<sub>A</sub>/D<sub>B</sub> = 5 (the Landolt system with <i>D</i><sub>IO3&#x2212;</sub>/<i>D</i><sub>I&#x2212;</sub> = 5).</p>

<p class="indent">The mechanism for this instability can be described in qualitative terms. Relative to a planar front, a portion of a nonplanar front in the autocatalyst concentration that is advanced and hence convex allows an enhanced geometrical spreading of the autocatalyst into the reactant ahead of the front zone, as indicated in <a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>. This dilutes the autocatalyst concentration and so tends to reduce the local speed. However, the same convexity allows an enhanced diffusion of reactant into thk reaction zone, tending to increase the local front speed. In the situation where DA &#x003E; DB, the second</p>

<p class="noindent">effect wins out and so the local speed is increased relative to that of a planar wave. This will tend to increase the degree of advancement of the convex segment of the front. Conversely, at a retarded segment, there is a geometrical concentrating effect on the diffusion of the autocatalyst, but a geometrical dilution of the reactant. If the latter is more significant, the local wave speed is reduced relative to that of a planar wave, leading to further retardation of that segment of the front. These discussions show that any Pertubation of the planar front can be reinforced by the system so that nonplanar fronts are established. This mechanism also lies behind the development of the cellular structure of many hydrocarbon flames. The same qualitative arguments show that if <i>D<sub>B</sub> &#x003E; D<sub>A</sub></i>, then the planar wave is stabilized to such spatial pertubations.
