<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this second Physical Chemistry Primer, Stephen Scott has produced an exhilarating, easy-to-read introduction to Oscillations, Waves and Chaos in Chemical Kinetics. This Primer will interest all students (and their mentors) who wish to appreciate the importance of nonlinear kinetics in a wide diversity of chemical phenomena.</p>
