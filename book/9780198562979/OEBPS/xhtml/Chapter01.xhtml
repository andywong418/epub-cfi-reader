<p class="noindent">The three basic heat transfer mechanisms, conduction, convection and radiation, are probably already familiar. In the context of heating a room by a hot water central heating system, (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>) all mechanisms are present. Heat is transferred into the room from the radiator both by direct <b>radiation</b> (infrared waves travelling straight out at the speed of light) and by the rising current of warm air. This last process is <b>natural convection,</b> since there is a flow of fluid and the buoyancy of the air itself causes the movement.</p>
<p class="indent">The hot water inside the radiator has come from the boiler under the influence of the pump, i.e. <b>forced convection.</b> If we wanted to consider the heat transfer processes from the water to the inside of the pipe, or to the inside of the radiator, then the heat transfer is forced convection. And what about conduction? Although confined to a physically small space in the figure, conduction is an essential link in the complete chain. The heat can only travel through the metal of the radiator by <b>conduction.</b></p>
<p class="indent">With the two different types of convection there are in total four types of heat transfer, and these form the subject of the four main chapters of this book, starting with conduction. Unfortunately practical problems do not normally divide neatly into purely conduction problems, purely forced convection, and so on. To help overcome this the convection heat transfer coefficient is defined early on in the conduction chapter, and included in examples and problems. However, the method that has been used to calculate the convection heat transfer coefficient is not given until later.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 Introduction</a><span class="space">&#160;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The symbols used for the various quantities are similar to those widely used in current textbooks and in research journals. The use of <i>k</i> for thermal conductivity and <i>h</i> for heat transfer coefficient goes back to Fourier in 1807. There has been a move recently to use different symbols. The problem arises in connection with thermodynamics (where <i>h</i> is commonly used for enthalpy). Since this is not a thermodynamics textbook we will keep to the symbols used by Fourier.</p>
<p class="indent">Although this text is intended to stand alone as an introduction to the subject, a couple of comments on its relation to other fields of study might be helpful. Certainly some facility with algebraic manipulation and with calculus is assumed.</p>
<p class="indent">A physical understanding of convection heat transfer is helped by prior study of the behaviour of the boundary layer, the thin layer of slow-moving fluid in immediate contact with the solid heat transfer surface. In many cases the boundary layer presents the main barrier to heat transfer. It does not follow, however, that thorough knowledge of fluid mechanics enables one generally to calculate convection heat transfer from first principles; empirical inputs are often needed and even in simple cases the calculation is complex. An example of what can be done starting from first principles, for a simple geometry and a simple type of flow, is given at the beginning of the natural convection chapter. The usual approach to convection is that direct measurements of heat transfer are needed as the starting point.</p>
<p class="indent">Another area of study that is considered to be closely related is that of thermodynamics. In particular a basic principle of heat transfer, that heat flows from a high temperature to a low temperature, is often stated to be a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Indeed it is, but the 2nd law is more powerful than that, since it is also concerned with the conversion of heat into work. The less general principle, that heat flows from hot to cold, was known before the 2nd law was formulated.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be stressed that part of the reason that the length of the book has been kept short is that alternative heat transfer coefficient correlations have generally been omitted. An advantage of having two or three correlations, all valid under the same conditions, is that they can all be applied to the same problem and the different answers compared. This is a very effective way of making the point that the error in any particular equation is probably 5 or even 10%. Since alternative methods of calculation are not, for the most part, given in this book, it is even more important to bear in mind that the error in any calculated heat transfer coefficient could be as high as 10%.</p>
