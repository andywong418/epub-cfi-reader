<h1 class="fmmain"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">For years I have maintained that many modern textbooks are too long. My intention in writing this book has been to cover the essential material of a text twice the length. Whether I have succeeded is for others to judge.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Obviously not all heat transfer topics can be covered in book of this size. Two phase heat transfer, and advanced radiation topics, are covered in other books in this same series. Numerical techniques of solving heat transfer problems have been omitted, on the grounds that, increasingly, computer programs will be available to solve numerical problems. The emphasis in this text is on heat transfer principles, not on heat exchangers.</p>
