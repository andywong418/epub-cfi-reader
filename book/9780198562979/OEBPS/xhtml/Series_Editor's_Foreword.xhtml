<p class="fm-no">The Oxford Chemisty Primers are designed to provide concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry and chemical engineering students. The principles of heat transfer are central to the understanding of almost all chemical processing operations and therefore lie at the heart of any undergraduate course in chemical engineering. This Chemical Engineering Primer introduces the essential concepts in heat transfer with particular focus on conduction, forced convection, and natural convection. The theoretical arguments upon which heat transfer calculations are based are clearly explained and their use illustrated with detailed worked examples.</p>
<p class="fm-in">This Primer will be of interest to all students (and others&#x0021;) who wish to obtain a practical and up-to-date understanding of heat transfer phenomena in chemical engineering.</p>
