<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this third Physical Chemistry Primer, Brian Cox has produced an authoritative and beautifully clear account of <i>Modern Liquid Phase Kinetics.</i> The Primer starts with essential material that is covered at an early stage in all undergraduate courses, which is followed by advanced material that will be of interest to the final year undergraduates. This Primer will be of lasting and broad value to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
