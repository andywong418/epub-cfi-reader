<p class="noindent">There are broadly two separate, although related, objects of chemical kinetics:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0.5em;">
<li style="margin-left:1em;"> the analysis of the mechanism by which a reaction occurs, i.e., the sequence of elementary steps giving rise to the overall reaction;</li>
<li style="margin-left:1em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;"> the determination of the absolute rate of the reaction or its individual steps.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Kinetics is concerned with the passage towards equilibrium, in particular with the details of the process whereby a system gets from one state to another and with the time required for the transition. The routes to equilibrium are manifold and the rates of chemical transformations constitute a more intricate problem than equilibria. If the speeds of forward and inverse reactions are known, equilibria can be calculated, but the converse proposition does not hold; infinitely numerous pairs of values of the rates are consistent with the same equilibrium constant.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemical primary processes always include a transition between two atomic or molecular states which are separated by a potential barrier. Due to the immense variety of chemical compounds and reactions, the time-range over which the processes occur covers more than 12 orders of magnitude. This has a significant effect on the study of chemical reactions, as the method adopted is often dictated by the reaction time. It is therefore of interest to consider briefly the time-scales characteristic of chemical and biological events, Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 (Eigen 1968).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-1.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The time-scale will be defined more quantitatively in terms of the time constant, <i>&#x03C4;</i>, and the half-life, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>, for a reaction in Chapters 5 and 2, respectively.</p>

<p class="indent">It is natural that the majority of kinetic investigations have been conducted for reactions occurring on convenient time-scales (seconds to hours)&#x2014;the study of both very slow and very fast reactions can occasion severe experimental problems. Rates of reactions with time constants of the order of days or longer, such as the ionization of weakly activated C&#x2013;H, N&#x2013;H, or P&#x2013;H bonds, are difficult to measure accurately except through the application of radiochemical techniques to tritiated substrates. The great sensitivity of liquid scintillation counting means that only a small percentage of the reaction need be monitored, and reactions with time constants as long as 10<sup><b>7</b></sup> s (100 days) are routinely measured.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-1.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Radioactive decay processes corresponding to lifetimes of radio isotopes of up to 10<sup>16</sup> s (1 billion years) can be measured by monitoring the emission of active particles: <sup>40</sup>K, for example, has a half-life of 1.3 billion years.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Reactions which occur rapidly by human standards pose somewhat different problems and have necessitated the development of new instruments and techniques. Without these, the limits of measurement are set by the response of the human eye, about one twentieth of a second, or by the speed of manual operations, which may arbitrarily be set at around a few seconds. The direct study of very fast reactions requires that we are able to initiate the reaction through sending an appropriate signal, and that the system in turn sends back a signal that enables us to see how it responds. The highest propagation velocities that we can achieve in condensed systems are (Eigen 1968, Porter 1968):</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0.5em;">
<li style="margin-left:1em;"> 10<sup>10</sup> cm s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> for electromagnetic signals (light velocity);</li>
<li style="margin-left:1em;"> 10<sup>5</sup> cm s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> for mechanical signals (sound velocity).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Thus, in principle, there should be no difficulty in initiating reactions rapidly using light pulses or electrical waves, and techniques for studying reactions with time constants down to one nanosecond are now routinely used. The fastest reactions that have been studied in solution are the protolytic reactions, in particular the formation of water from H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. Ultimately these and the most rapid biochemical processes are controlled by diffusion processes, which ensure that reaction times exceed 1 ns at concentrations of up to 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> M. <a id="page_3" class="page"><b>Page 3, Introduction</b></a>Extension to time resolution well below the nanosecond region has also been achieved, but such times relate to more &#x2018;physical&#x2019; than chemical elementary processes.</p>
<p class="indent">A singular feature of the results in Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 is the number of interesting and important chemical and biological processes which fall into the category of rapid reactions. The extension of kinetic studies into this region has greatly increased our understanding of these processes. To take one example, <a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> shows the lifetimes of exchange of water molecules at simple cations. Reactions involving complexation and transport of these cations, frequently occurring at rates controlled by the exchange or substitution of coordinating water molecules, are of widespread importance in biology. They range from the excitation of nerves by sodium and potassium ions, to the synthesis and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) coupled to ion transport and binding in membrane-bound enzymes. The reactions are characterized by great cation specificity, despite the high reactivities.</p>
<p class="indent">Between the limits of fast and slow reactions lies a large body of &#x2018;typical&#x2019; organic reactions&#x2014;hydrolysis, substitution, addition, elimination, condensation, etc. The rates of these reactions may generally be measured by more conventional means, using normal chemical and spectroscopic analytical techniques. Kinetic studies provide valuable practical information on the rates under given experimental conditions of reactant concentrations, temperature, and medium. More often, they are used to provide a basis for determining the mechanism by which a reaction occurs. From the conventional definition of physical chemists, the mechanism may be taken to mean the individual steps which go to make up the overall reaction, and modern kinetic techniques allow even the most rapid primary steps to be probed. However, a detailed elucidation of reaction mechanisms, which includes particularly the stereochemistry of reactions, requires a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic methods. The latter include stereochemical studies, the influence of isotopic substitution, comparison with closely related systems, detection or isolation of reaction intermediates, etc. (Moore and Pearson 1981).</p>
