<p class="noindent">The procedures described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a>-<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">4</a> show how a mechanistic picture of an electrode reaction may be deduced using voltammetric information. However, the molecular identity of the species involved, particularly intermediates, must often be indirectly inferred. To provide more direct characterization electrochemical studies are frequently employed in combination with spectroscopic measurements. The additional information obtained from spec- troelectrochemical measurements open the door to the investigation of a wide range of complex surface and homogeneous processes occurring in electro-chemical systems.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space"></span><b> Surface characterization using iow-energy electron diffraction, Auger, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The ideal characterization of electrode surfaces requires information at, or approaching, atomic resolution. This can be achieved by the interaction of light or electron beams with the sample surface; the wavelength of the probe usually defines the surface resolution that can be achieved.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are well-established procedures for the analysis of solid surfaces <i>in vacuo.</i> The three techniques are surface specific since each relies on the detection of electrons leaving the solid. The distance over which electrons may escape from a solid surface is of the order of 0.1-1.0 nm and therefore electrons detected due to interaction with the surface provide information about the first few layers of the sample surface. The three techniques are <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>essentially complementary in the information acquired and therefore a combi-nation of the three is optimally employed for the investigation of surface properties.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">LEED probes the long-range structural order of the surface through dif-fraction of electron beams incident on it, analogous to that of X-rays by bulk crystals. The method is particularly valuable in characterizing electrodes made of single crystals. Typically, as with the other two techniques, the surface is examined <i>in vacuo</i> before and after electrolysis. The presence of adsorbates may also be probed provided a sufficiently high coverage is present and that specific sites are occupied so as to create long-range order.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In XPS X-rays focused on the electrode surface induce the direct ionization of surface atoms and the energy of the emitted photoelectron fingerprints the atom from which it was emitted and provides information about the oxidation state of the latter.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Auger electrons may also be emitted as a result of X-rays impinging on a surface; the loss of a core electron may be followed by electronic rearrangment within the surface atom and the secondary loss of a less strongly bound &#x2018;Auger&#x2019; electron. The energy characteristics of the emitted Auger electron indicate the atomic composition of the surface.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">All three experiments share a common requirement for performance in ultra high vacuum (UHV, pressures of approximately 10&#x203E;<sup>10</sup> Torr) to preclude surface contamination by the atmosphere. Accordingly, considerable effort has been directed towards the development of techniques and instrumentation that allow the surface preparation, electrochemical experiment, and surface characterization to be performed under ultra clean conditions. <a href="#fig_5.2">Figure 5.2</a> shows a general schematic diagram of the apparatus used in such electrochemical surface studies which employs several clean chambers interconnected via vacuum seals.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>Typically, a single crystal electrode is placed into chamber 1 where it is cleaned by bombardment from a beam of argon ions directed at the surface. The freshly prepared electrode is analysed using the techniques discussed above: to provide information about the surface lattice structure and the levels of any impurities present at the surface.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The characterized electrode is then removed from the detection chamber to chamber 2 where the electrochemical experiment can be performed. A three- electrode cell is generally used under an inert atmosphere, such as ultra pure argon. The solvent is carefully purified before use and forms a protective barrier between any remaining levels of impurities present in the chamber and the electrode surface. Electrochemical experiments can then be performed on a well-characterized crystal surface. This may involve simple potential sweeps, which monitor the voltammetric response of the electrode or more complex processes such as upd or adsorption of molecules from bulk solution.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">After electrochemical experiments the electrode is removed from the elec-trochemical cell maintaining potentiostatic control and returned to chamber 1, where further surface measurements can be performed. These probe the effects of the electrochemical experiment on the surface structure and, in addition, reveal the identity of any material that may have been adsorbed on to the: electrode surface during the electrochemical experiment.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">An enormous variety of surface processes have been studied using the above approach. Two examples are discussed below.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In one such study (Hubbard 1989) the electrodeposition of lead from an aqueous trifluoroacetic acid solution on to a well-defined and characterized silver (111) surface was investigated. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a single crystal Ag(l 11) electrode in solutions containing approximately lO&#x203E;<sup>4</sup>M concentration of lead acetate and 10&#x203E;<sup>2</sup>M trifluoroacetic acid. A typical cyclic voltammogram obtained is shown in <a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. (5.3)</a>. On the reductive scan three lead upd peaks (1,2,3) were observed at -0.34, -0.36 and -0.38 V, followed, at potentials more negative than -0.54 V by the bulk deposition (4) of lead on to the surface. Reversal of the sweep at the point of the bulk deposition gave rise to a peak corresponding to bulk lead dissolution (4&#x00B4;), followed by three further voltammetric features corresponding to the dis-solution of the UPD processes (1&#x00B4;,2&#x00B4;,3&#x00B4;). Analysis of the charge contained in the peaks 1-3 allowed the packing density of lead to be calculated as &#x03B8; &#x003D; 0.58.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">After voltammetric study the electrode was removed from the electrolyte under potentiostatic control and transferred to chamber 1, where XPS, Auger electron, and LEED spectroscopic measurements were recorded.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The latter two techniques were used to confirm the voltammetric inference of lead deposition. An Auger electron spectrum (AES) is shown in <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a> and reveals peaks due to silver and, also, to smaller quantities of lead at the surface. In addition, quantities of oxygen were found to be present at the electrode, as noted in <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>). Analysis showed the surface packing density of oxygen to be approximately &#x03B8; &#x003D; 0.54. The AES signal indicated that the spontaneous conversion of lead to lead oxide takes place on the surface when the electrode is removed at open circuit from solution.<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Spectroelectrochemistry</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">On the basis of the AES measurements and from further electrochemical studies, the product of the open circuit oxidation reaction was proposed to be lead oxide.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Finally, LEED measurements were performed after the sample had been potentiostated just beyond -0.38 V. These revealed a (4 &#x00D7; 4) pattern and the structure of the lead oxide surface was consistent with that shown in <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5.</a></p>


<p class="indent3-ka">The combination of voltammetry with surface science has also been used to probe organic molecules chemisorbed at an electrode surface. A good example is that of 2,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzylmercaptan (DMBM) anchored to a platinum (111) surface (Hubbard 1988). DMBM was shown to undergo reversible oxidation/reduction in the adsorbed state;<a href="#fig_5.6"> Fig. 5.6</a> shows a cyclic voltammogram of DMBM in an acetonitrile solution. The forward and reverse peaks are symmetrical and the peak current occurs at near identical potentials for the oxidative and reductive processes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Preliminary surface structural inferences were made using the voltammet- ric data as follows. First, measurement of the charge passed in the cyclic voltammogram enabled the coverage, in terms of moles per unit area, to be calculated. Secondly, the size of DMBM was calculated using a molecular unit cell approach in which the covalent and van der Waals radii of the constituent atoms (<a href="#fig_5.7">Fig. 5.7(a)</a>) was used to estimate the area of each of the three faces (a, b and c) of the approximately box-shaped adsorbate. Finally by assuming that DMBM was attached as a monolayer over the whole surface of the electrode, a comparision of the observed coverage with that calculated for DMBM using each of the estimated facial areas showed that DMBM was attached to the electrode via face b.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">After voltammetric examination the electrode was transferred into the UHV chamber for surface characterization. Auger spectroscopy confirmed the identity of the attached material and the intensity of the Auger signal used (<a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>) to provide an independent estimate of the coverage of DMBM. The Auger data were found to be consistent with the voltammetric measurements and confirmed DMBM as bonded to the surface via face b.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The wealth of information available to the electrochemist from surface science techniques will be apparent. However, it will be recognized that all these techniques are of necessity performed outside the electrochemical cell. The <i>ex situ</i> aspect imposes limitations on the general applicability of these techniques and raises questions about the extent to which the process of transfer from cell to vacuum may influence the observations made. As a result experi-mental procedures have been developed to permit the <i>in situ</i> study of electrode processes. In the following sections some such techniques are illustrated.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2">	
<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space"></span><b>In-situ atomic scale imaging of the electrode/ electrolyte interface using scanning tunnelling microscopy.</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The basic principles of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) were iden-tified in 1983 by Binnig and Rohrer. The major feature is the ability to image conducting surfaces at atomic resolution using a sharp &#x2018;tip&#x2019; which is scanned across the substrate (<a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>) using a piezoelectric translator which defines the distance between the probe and the surface. A voltage is applied to the tip so that a tunnelling current flows between it and the surface. This tunnelling current is <i>extremely</i> sensitive to the separation of the two conductors and it is this sensitivity that provides the key to the resolving power of the experiment. In particular the STM can respond to changes of 0.01&#x00C5; in vertical separation between tip and surface, so that individual atoms are visible in the latter as it is scanned.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_5.9" style="margin-left:3em">

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="margin-left:-3em">
<p class="noindent"><b>Fig. 5.9</b> Schematic of STM apparatus.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Typically, in experimental practice, as the probe is scanned laterally across the sample the tunnelling current is maintained at a constant value by the use of a carefully designed electronic feedback loop. The frequency of response of the feedback loop greatly exceeds that of any vibrations present in the surroundings so that the latter do not interfere with the experiment. As the probe encounters a change in surface topography the tunnelling current alters and the feedback loop then acts to re-establish the original tunnelling current. This is achieved by altering the voltage between tip and sample. This change in voltage is recorded and used to create an image of the surface (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>). The probe is fully scanned across the surface in the <i>x</i>-direction and then moved a small distance in the y-direction before a further scan is performed. The result <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>is a pattern that represents the surface topography of the sample at atomic scale resolution. The absolute resolution in the &#x0240;-direction is 0.01&#x00C5;. The lateral resolution is dependent on the tip diameter. To obtain atomic resolution in this direction the current flowing to or from the tip must come from only one atom. It is often found that at the tip of the probe the required single atom exists and atomic resolution is achievable.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fig. 5.10</b> Schematic of an image obtained using the STM technique.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Initial STM experiments were performed at gas/solid interfaces. However, it soon became apparent that the technique could equally well be employed in fluid media without a significant loss in resolution. In the late 1980s, STM was applied to electrochemical investigations and a schematic diagram of a typical cell used is shown in <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9.</a> The probe tip and solid substrate are subject to individual potentiostatic control but the experiment otherwise proceeds as outlined above. The electrochemical environment can cause additional difficulties if the voltage applied between the probe tip and the electrode induces electrolysis, which can mask the tunnelling current. To minimize this problem the tip ( except its very end) is coated in a non-conducting wax or polymer to reduce the area available for electrolysis.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">An elegant example of electrochemical STM has recently been reported by Weaver (1992) where the oxidation of sulphide on a gold (111) surface is monitored as a function of potential at the atomic/molecular level. <a href="#fig_5.11">Figure 5.11</a> shows an STM image of the Au (111) surface in an aqueous solution containing Na<sub>2</sub>S, where the electrode is potentiostatted at a voltage insuffi-cient to induce sulphide electro-oxidation. The image recorded shows an adlayer of adsorbed sulphur on the gold surface.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">When the electrode potential was altered to 0V (vs SCE), which is sufficient to induce electro-oxidation, a substantially altered image was observed (<a href="#fig_5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>). A close inspection of the image reveals a series of structures on the surface each of which appear to have eight individual tunnelling current maxima. The authors interpreted each of these maxima as individual sulphur atoms on the surface, implying that the S<sub>8</sub> species had been formed at the electrode. This type of behaviour had been implicated from previous Raman experiments performed under similar conditions where the spectra recorded indicated the formation of S<sub>8</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The use of tiny probe tips to interrogate solid/liquid interfaces is not con-fined to the STM experiment. For example, atomic force microscopy, uses a similar experimental arrangement as STM but measures the variation in the force (of the order of 10<sup>-9</sup> N) between the probe and the substrate. A further variation is that of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) which is considered next.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space"></span>	<b>Scanning electrochemical microscopy</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has recently been described (Bard 1989) as a new method for imaging surfaces in solution. A schematic diagram of the important components of the apparatus is shown in <a href="#fig_5.13">Fig. 5.13.</a> Note that the substrate and probe form part of an electrochemical cell together with reference and auxiliary electrodes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The imaging can be described by considering a simple electrode reaction which is induced to occur at the microelectrode</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:8em">
<img src="../images/eq_75_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>

<p class="noindent">The species A is present in the solution phase above the substrate and the potential of the probe is held at a value that induces the diffusion-limited conversion of species A to species B. The current flowing at the probe rapidly establishes a steady-state value, and, if the tip-substrate distance is sufficiently large, the resulting concentration profile around the probe is hemispherical (<a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>). However, as the probe is lowered towards the surface the concentration profile around the probe tip is perturbed by the substrate below and the observed current is altered from the unperturbed value.</p>



<p class="indent3-ka">The technique can be used to investigate both conducting and non-conducting solids. In the case of a non-conducting solid, when the probe <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>approaches the surface, diffusion of the reactant to the probe is partially blocked by the sample and the current detected at the electrode decreases. This is termed hindered diffusion (<a href="#fig_5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>). For the case where the sample is conducting the potential of the substrate is set so that any B that reaches the surface is electrochemically transformed to A. Consequently, more A is pro-duced than for the corresponding situation in bulk solution and the current detected at the probe increases. This is termed feedback diffusion (<a href="#fig_5.16">Fig. 5.16</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">At sample-probe distances up to several times the radius of the microelec-trode probe the current detected at the probe is very sensitive to distance. By scanning the probe tip over the sample at a constant height and simultaneously recording the current a topographical image of the surface can be obtained.</p>

</figure></figure></figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">As the technique may be used with a wide range of electroactive species (A/B) it is possible to chose materials that may interact with the surface. The technique can therefore also be used to investigate the chemical properties of the substrate surface. For example, the species A may be capable of reaction at the substrate surface, depleting the concentration of A near the probe. A drop in the measured current can then be interrogated to ascertain the nature of the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">An illustration of the versatility of this device is shown in <a href="#fig_5.17">Fig. 5.17(a)</a>. In this mode the SECM is employed as a microstructure fabrication tool. A current is passed between the tip of an ultra microelectrode and a metal substrate. The electrodes are separated by a NAFION film (NAFION is a conductive polymer). The current that passes through the film is essentially controlled by <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>the area where the microelectrode touches the film. When an appropriate potential is applied to the ultra microelectrode a reduction reaction is induced at the electrode/film interface with the &#x2018;complementary&#x2019; process occurring at the substrate. The result is electrochemical deposition at the nafionfilm/ microelectrode interface and etching at the metal substrate. Careful positioning of the probe enabled the production of thin metal lines on the film (<a href="#fig_5.17">Fig. 5.17(b)</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">One of the first <i>in situ</i> combined electrochemical/ spectroscopic techniques to be investigated employed UV/visible detection. Solution-phase spectra of organic radicals generated at an electrode were recorded. Typically, organic intermediates/products possess additional absorption bands not observed in the parent molecule. These arise since new electronic transitions are possible once the parent molecule has undergone electron injection or removal. The new bands can be used to fingerprint the electrogenerated species. By way of example (<a href="#fig_5.18">Fig. 5.18</a>) shows the absorption spectrum of anthraquinone and the corresponding radical anion generated at a gold electrode.<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Spectroelectrochemistry</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Early research (Kuwana 1964) used optically transparent electrodes such as antinomy-doped tin oxide deposited on a silica substrate. The electrode allows the analysing beam of a UV/visible spectrometer to pass directly through the electrode and the cell before detection in the usual manner, as shown in <a href="#fig_5.19">Fig. 5.19.</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In addition to the gathering of spectra, useful information may be gleaned if the intensity of absorbance is monitored at a fixed wavelength as a function of time after the electrode is subjected to a potential step or pulse. For example, suppose the electrode potential is jumped from a potential where no current flows to one at which some electrogenerated product is formed. The current flowing is initially very large but gradually drops as parent material is consumed (see Section 3.6). The spectroscopic signal intensity recorded from the electrogenerated product gradually grows with time until a steady state is obtained (<a href="#fig_5.20">Fig. 5.20</a>). The shape and size of the intensity/time profile is char-acteristic of the reactivity of the product and such measurements may be used to give estimates of the lifetime of electrode intermediates.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.6<span class="space"></span><b>Infrared spectroscopy</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Compared to UV/visible spectroscopy the use of infrared (IR) spectroscopy presents additional difficulties. Specifically the overall sensitivity of IR is lower than UV/vis and the solvents used in electrochemical experiments (such as water) often possess molecular vibrations that give rise to strong absorption bands in the IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. To overcome these limitations a sensitive technique was developed called electrode modulated infrared spectroscopy (EMIRS). Light reflected from an electrode contained in a thin layer cell is detected and this providesinformation about<a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Spectroelectrochemistry</a>species close to, or adsorbed on, the electrode surface. The thin layer cell (<a href="#fig_5.21">Fig. 5.21</a>) reduces the path length of the analysing beam in the solution and therefore lowers absorption signals due to the solvent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">However, to gain adequate sensitivity towards electrode-related material, the electrode potential is pulsed between a potential at which no electrode reaction occurs and a value that induces electrochemical reaction. As a result the spectroscopic signal due to the species of interest fluctuates with a frequency identical to that of the potential pulse. In contrast, the signal due to the solvent or bulk solution species remains effectively constant. This provides a method for discriminating between electrogenerated and other species, and by constraining the detection to signals with the frequency of the potential pulse the resulting spectra reflect solely products of the electrode reaction. After analysis of the data it is possible to detect sub-monolayer quantities of material adsorbed at the electrode surface or in a region of solution near the electrode.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In a typical application (Berwick 1980) EMIRS has been employed to probe the adsorption of indole on a platinum electrode. Indole adsorbs on to platinum at around 0 V but can be desorbed at about 1.2V (versus a Ag/Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup> reference electrode). Pulsing the potential between these values enabled an absorption spectrum to be recorded of the adsorbed molecule. The latter differed from corresponding solution-phase spectrum only in the N&#x2014;H stetching region. It was consequently inferred that the indole was bound to the electrode surface via an interaction with the nitrogen atom.</p>

<p class="noindent">The identification of electrochemically generated species has also been per-formed using luminescence techniques. In this technique a conventional spec-trometer is used in conjunction with a flow cell so that electrogenerated intermediates are swept away from the electrode and the luminescence analysed downstream of the electrode (<a href="#fig_5.24">Fig. 5.24</a>). The luminescence from the sample is detected at 90&#x00B0; to the excitation source.

<p class="noindent">The value of electron spin resonance (ESR) in the investigation of electro-chemical processes arises from the fact that the technique is exclusively sen-sitive to molecules that possess unpaired electrons and are therefore paramagnetic. The electron has two spin states (&#x00B1;1/2), which, when placed in a magnetic field become non-degenerate, and it is possible for the electron to absorb energy and jump from the lower to the higher energy spin state. This energy gap corresponds to microwave frequencies in the typical fields employed by X-band spectrometers.</p>
