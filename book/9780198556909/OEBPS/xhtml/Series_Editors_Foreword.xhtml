<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Adrian Fisher has produced a clear and concise introduction to the important topic of <i>Electrode Dynamics</i> assuming no prior knowledge of the area and with a minimum of mathematics. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry (and their mentors).</p>
