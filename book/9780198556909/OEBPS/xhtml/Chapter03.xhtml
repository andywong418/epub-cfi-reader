<p class="noindent">The measurement of electrode currents as a function of the voltage applied to the electrolysis cell can provide remarkably detailed information about the mechanism of the cell reaction of interest. The concepts introduced in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> provide the basis for the rationalisation of such voltammetric experiments.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.1         <b>The experimental measurement of current/voltage</b></h2><h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:-0.7em;margin-left:3.8em"><b> characteristics</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The simplest approach to the measurement of current/voltage characteristics involves the use of two electrodes. One is termed a working electrode and this is where the reaction of interest occurs. The second is a reference electrode, which should provide a stable and fixed potential so that when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes the drop in potential between the working electrode and the solution, &#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>, is precisely defined. This difference is the driving force for electrolysis to occur at that interface, and the dependence of the current on this quantity was discussed in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The simple two-electrode arrangement (see <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>) is perfectly acceptable for the measurement of current/voltage curves where only a tiny current is passed. For example, it is ideal for microelectrode studies. However, for larger electrodes a difficulty arises. Consider a voltage, <i>E,</i> applied between a large working electrode and a reference electrode and assume that a finite current is flowing between them. Then,</p>

<p class="noindent">Notice that <i>E</i> is split into three terms. The first of these, (&#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>), is the driving force for electrolysis at the working electrode/solution interface. The second describes the voltage drop, <i>iR,</i> in solution due to passage of current <i>i</i> between the two electrodes. <i>R</i> is the electrical resistance of the intervening solution. The third term, (&#981;<sub>s</sub> - &#981;<sub>REF</sub>) is the potential drop at the reference electrode/solution interface and is fixed by the chemical composition of the chosen reference electrode.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The aim of any voltammetry experiment is to measure <i>i</i> as a function of <i>changes</i> in the quantity (&#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>).

<p class="noindent">Consequently, changes in the applied potential <i>E</i> are directly reflected in the driving force, (&#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>), as desired, and voltammetry is meaningful with two electrodes. With large electrodes, however, <i>iR</i> is no longer negligible and so changes in the applied potential are not confined to changes in (&#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>). In particular they alter the <i>iR</i> term since the current flowing through the cell will also be induced to change. Moreover, the passage of large currents through the reference electrode can change its chemical composition and so the third term, (&#981;<sub>s</sub> - &#981;<sub>REF</sub>), may no longer be constant. It can be concluded that two- electrode experiments with other than tiny currents will be impossible to interpret using the relations established in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> since the current will not be readily related to the potential drop at the working electrode/solution interface (&#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">To circumvent this problem it is usual to conduct voltammetric experiments using a three-electrode system in which an auxiliary or counter electrode is used, in addition to the other two. These are controlled by electronics (a potentiostat) which ensures that current only flows between the working and auxiliary electrode. The potential of the working electrode is held relative to the now stable reference electrode and the electronics ensure that no current passes through the reference arm of the circuit. <a href="#fig_3.1">Figure 3.1</a> shows a typical three-electrode arrangement for an RDE experiment.</p>

<p class="noindent">The working electrode is held in the main chamber along with the reference electrode.

<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> the terms &#x2018;reversible&#x2019; and &#x2018;irreversible&#x2019; were used to characterize two extremes of behaviour of the electrode kinetics of the A/B couple.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Linear-sweep voltammetry</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Linear-sweep voltammetry (or its close relative, cyclic voltammetry, discussed below) is invariably the first technique employed in any electrochemical investigation since it is easy to perform and provides quick and useful information about the system under investigation. The experiment is con-ducted in stationary solution and so relies only on diffusion to transport mate-rial to the electrode surface.

<p class="noindent">The form of the current/voltage behaviour can be understood as follows, on the initial assumption that the A/B couple has irreversible electrode kinetics. Initially, no current is passed since the applied potential is not great enough to induce electron transfer. But as the potential is swept to more reducing</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a>potentials it reaches values that are capable of inducing the reduction of A to B at the electrode, and current starts to pass. As <i>E</i> (and so &#981;<sub>m</sub> - &#981;<sub>s</sub>) is made more negative, the electrochemical rate constant, <i>k</i><sub>red</sub>, for the reduction of A becomes greater as suggested by <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.21">eqn 1.21</a> and, initially, the current rises approximately exponentially with potential (or time). As even more negative potentials are reached, the rise becomes less than exponential and ultimately a maximum is reached, after which the current falls off.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">At first sight the occurrence of a maximum appears paradoxical since <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.21">eqn 1.21</a> predicts <i>k</i><sub>red</sub> should increase steadily with <i>E.</i> However, the current flowing reflects not only <i>k</i><sub>red</sub> but also the surface concentration, [A]<sub>0</sub>, of the reactant <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.7">eqn 1.7</a>. As the potential is swept to more negative valuesalthough <i>k</i><sub>red</sub> increases, [A]<sub>0</sub> steadily decreases as electrolysis consumes A, which is only partially replenished by diffusion of fresh A from bulk solution. The maximum in the current/voltage curve then reflects a balance between an increasing heterogeneous rate constant and a decrease in surface concentration. The maximum current is known as the <i>peak current</i>, <i>i</i><sub>p</sub>. Once the peak current is attained the magnitude of the current flowing is simply controlled by the rate at which fresh A can diffuse up to the electrode surface. The fall in current arises since, as electrolysis proceeds, the zone around the electrode in which A is depleted becomes thicker and so new A has further to diffuse to the electrode. Algebraically, the fall in current can be accounted for in terms of <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq_2.4">eqn 2.4</a> and a steadily increasing diffusion layer thickness resulting from progressive electrolysis of the solution. Thus the part of the linear-sweep voltammogram at potentials more negative than that corresponding to <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> simply reflects the rate at which A can diffuse in solution, whereas the part of the current/voltage curve that precedes the peak is controlled by the electrode kinetics.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_3.3">Figure 3.3(a)</a> shows a voltammogram for the case where the A/B couple now has reversible electrode kinetics. Also shown is the irreversible voltam-mogram previously discussed. Notice that in the reversible case appreciable currents flow when the electrode attains a potential more negative than <i>E</i><sub>e</sub>. In other words, as soon as the reduction becomes thermodynamically viable it takes place as a result of the rapid electrode kinetics implicit for a reversible couple. In contrast no currents, flow in the irreversible case until the potential<a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a> is considerably more negative than <i>E</i><sub>e</sub>. In the terminology of <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> an overpotential (&#x2018;over&#x2019; and above the thermodynamic potential) has to be applied to drive the reduction of A to B. Hence <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> occurs at more negative potentials in irreversible systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Two other important points of comparison between reversible and irre-versible voltammograms emerge:</p>
<p class="noindent">(a) In the reversible case, the peak potential, <i>E</i><sub>p</sub>, is constant and independent of sweep rate, whereas for irreversible reductions systems <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> shifts to more negative potentials at faster sweep rates.

<p class="indent3-ka">The above differences reflect the contrasting electrode kinetics of reversible and irreversible systems. In the case of a reversible system the electrode kinetics are such that for potentials near <i>E</i><sub>e</sub> both <i>k</i><sub>red</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>ox</sub> are large. In fact as a result of this the concentrations of A and B <i>at the electrode surface</i> are effectively in equilibrium with their ratio predicted by the Nemst equation. In contrast, electrolysis in irreversible systems proceeds with negligible back reaction. However, for any system, reversible or not, <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> is directly proportional to the concentration of A and increases with voltage sweep rate. <a href="#fig_3.4">Figure 3.4</a> illustrates this dependence for the case of a reversible system, and <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> varies as the square root of the sweep rate.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The increase of <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> with <i>v</i><sub>s</sub> may be interpreted as follows. Recall that <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> shows the flux of material reacting at the electrode surface and that near <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> this is controlled by the rate of diffusion of A. Specifically, Fick&#x2019;s first law <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#eq_2.1">eqn 2.1</a> indicates that <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> reflects the concentration gradient of A near the electrode, which in turn is controlled by the diffusion layer thickness. If the<a id="page_31" class="page">Page 31, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a>electrode potential is swept more rapidly, relatively less time is available for electrolysis and the depletion of A near the electrode is reduced, resulting in a thinner diffusion layer and hence a steeper concentration gradient.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Cyclic voltammetry</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Linear-sweep voltammetry can be extended so that when the potential reaches the value <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> the direction of sweep is reversed and the electrode potential is scanned back to the original value, <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> <a href="#fig_3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>.

<p class="indent3-ka">The shape of the voltammogram on the forward sweep is identical to that described above for the case of linear-sweep voltammetry and depends on the reversibility of the A/B redox couple. However, on reaching <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> the potential is then swept back, oxidizing species B, formed at the electrode during the forward scan to species A. A current in the opposite sense to the forward scan, is observed due to oxidation of B to A. This current increases initially since a high concentration of B is present in the diffusion layer and the kinetics for the conversion of B to A become more favourable as the potential becomes more positive. Gradually, all of B present in the diffusion layer is reconverted to A and the current drops to zero.</p>

Notice that for B to be reconverted into A an appreciable overpotential is required and the reverse peak only appears at potentials very much more negative than <i>E</i><sub>e</sub>. The size of the reverse peak relative to the for ward peak will depend on the voltage sweep rate. As for linear-sweep voltammetry, the potentials of both the forward and reverse peaks are voltage sweep- rate dependent and this contrast with the reversible case is diagnostic of the nature of the electrode kinetics.</p>

<p class="noindent">Regardless of reversibility, the absolute magnitudes of the peak currents for both forward and reverse scans depend on the voltage sweep rate. <a href="#fig_3.8">Figure 3.8</a> shows this dependence for a reversible system where the ratio of the forward and reverse peak currents is unity, but <i>i</i><sub>p</sub> for both peaks varies with <i>v</i><sub>s</sub><sup>1/2</sup>. The explanation is essentially the same as given in the preceding section.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Note that the terms &#x2018;reversible&#x2019; and &#x2018;irreversible&#x2019; refer to limiting cases, according to whether the electrode kinetics are fast or slow relative to the mass transport conditions of the electrode of interest. Intermediate cases (quasi-reversible behaviour) exist. The surface concentrations of A and B now depend on both the forward and reverse electron transfer rates and the rate of mass transport; <a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7</a> also shows the behaviour of a quasi-reversible electrochemical reaction. A reverse peak of similar magnitude to the forward peak is observed on the reverse sweep, but, unlike the case of reversible kinetics the separation of the two peaks is dependent on the scan rate and the peak current is not proportional to the square root of the scan rate. Only a tiny peak will be seen unless a very fast scan rate is used because the electrode has to be taken to very oxidising potentials so as to &#x2018;drive&#x2019; the B&#x2192;A reaction. Otherwise, almost all the B formed in the forward scan will diffuse into bulk solution and be unavailable for re-oxidation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Immediately following the step, a large current is detected which falls steadily with time. This arises since the magnitude of the current is controlled by the rate of diffusion of A to the electrode. The concentration gradients shortly after the step are extremely large since there has been little time for any depletion of the electroactive material. Consequently, the currents flowing are very large initially. Gradually, as depletion occurs, the diffusion layer thickness increases and the current decreases : ultimately to zero, as shown in <a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>.

The voltammograms resulting from such experiments are considered next and a typical rotating disc current/voltage curve for the reduction of A to B is shown in <a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a> In normal practice such voltammograms are recorded using slow voltage scan rates (less than 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> is typical). Under these conditions no peak is seen, in contrast to the cyclic voltammetry experiment. This can be rationalized again by considering a potential scan between the limits <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> previously considered. Initially, the electrode potential is insufficient to induce the reduction of A. As it is made more negative, electrolysis
<a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a>starts and the current rises, approximately exponentially as in cyclic voltam-metry. For more negative potentials the current rises to a maximum value (the transport-limited current). This current is maintained at subsequent negative potentials because the presence of a convective flow supplements the supply of electroactive A from bulk solution to the electrode surface. This constant replenishment ensures that a steady current is maintained. The magnitude of this is controlled by the extent of convective transport to the electrode (the term transport-limited current) and depends on the speed at which the electrode is rotated, for the case of the rotating disc electrode. <a href="#fig_3.11">Figure 3.11</a> shows a series of voltammograms recorded for a reversible electron transfer reaction at different rotation speeds. The limiting currents can be analysed as described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.5">Section 2.5</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_17">p. 17</a>). The rising part of the current/voltage curves in <a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a> reflects the electrode kinetics of the A/B couple and suitable analysis permits the reversibility, or otherwise, of the couple to be inferred.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Coupled homogeneous reactions</b></h3>

<p class="noindent"><a href="#eqn_3.2">Equation 3.2</a>, which describes the mass transport of species A, is identical to that for a chemically stable species since it is not lost by any homogeneous reaction. The diffusion equation for species B, however, must be modified as species B now undergoes a homogeneous first-order decay at a rate K<sub>EC</sub>[B]. The diffusion equation contains a term on the right-hand side that quantifies the loss of species B.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Typically, cyclic voltammetry is the first experimental technique used when investigating the reactivity of a new molecule. The technique is quick and easy to perform and establishes the basic voltammetric response of the system. If the species generated are unstable then the current/voltage characteristics differ from those described for the case of a stable, reversible electron transfer (<a href="#sec_3.2">Section 3.2</a>). Some examples of simple electrode mechanisms are now considered.</p>




<h3 class="h3"><b>The EC reaction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">For the EC reaction species B, formed at the electrode, is unstable and decays with a rate constant <i>k<sub>EC</sub>.</i> If <i>k<sub>EC</sub></i> is significantly fast then as soon as B is formed at the electrode it is lost through homogeneous reaction. The cyclic voltammetry observed in this situation differs from that of a stable electrode reaction. The forward voltammetric sweep reducing A to B, is similar to that detected for the reversible, stable cyclic voltammogram. However, as the potential is swept back from <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> to <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> the reverse peak due to the re-oxidation of B to A is lost, since B has been destroyed through homogeneous reaction (<a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>). This is now a chemically irreversible system (as opposed to the irreversible electron transfer noted in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> which occurs because a high enough overpotential cannot be reached to drive species B back to A electro chemically).</p>

<figcaption class="aside1"><b>Fig. 3.13</b> Cyclic voltammograms showing the influence of chemical reaction on the observed voltammetric behaviour.</figcaption></figure></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">For the situation where <i>k<sub>EC</sub></i> is very slow, then little or no difference from the stable cyclic voltammogram is detected (<a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>) as B is not significantly depleted by reaction. Intermediate reaction rates result in cyclic voltammograms where the height of the reverse peak varies reflecting the stability of species B (<a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>). The relative heights of the back peaks can then be used to estimate the rate of reaction in solution.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The analysis of the reaction kinetics must, however, account for the influ-ence of the potential sweep rate. For example for a reaction that has an inter-mediate <i>k<sub>EC</sub></i> rate as the scan rate is increased the time for the reactive species to decay is reduced and a larger back peak is detected on the reverse sweep. The concept of time-scale is therefore an important aspect of an electrochemical investigation and, in particular, the successful analysis of data from cyclic voltammetric measurements must account for this. From <a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a> it is clear that not only does the relative height of the back peak depend upon scan rate, so does the position of the reduction wave on the forward sweep shifts. <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a>In particular, as the rate constant increases the wave shifts anodically and it  becomes easier to reduce species A. This can be rationalized by recalling the Nemst equation (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.3">eqn 1.3</a>), which predicts the ratio of equilbrium surface con- centrations of A and B at a particular potential for an electrochemically reversible electrode reaction. The homogeneous reaction removing B perturbs the surface equilibrium, and, in order to try and restablish the equilibrium concentration at the electrode surface, the reaction is driven towards the right- hand side, producing more B. This replenishes some B lost by reaction and causes an anodic shift in the wave.</p>

<p class="noindent">The initial electrochemical and homogeneous chemical steps are identical to the EC reaction. However, the product formed by the homogeneous chemical<a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a>reaction C is now also electroactive. The reduction of the new product C to D usually occurs at a different potential (either higher or lower) than that of the A to B process. The case where C is more difficult to reduce than A is described with reference to cyclic voltametry measurements. The situation where C is more easily reduced than A is described by reference to coupled convection-diffusion measurements.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">When A is more easily reduced than C then the cyclic voltammogram recorded has two separate electrochemical features (<a href="#fig_3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>). On the reductive sweep a peak is detected due to the simple A to B electrode reaction, then, at more negative potentials a further voltammetric wave is observed (the magnitude of which is dependent upon the rate constant kECE) due to the reduction of C to D. When the sweep is reversed two peaks are detected (again the magnitude of the detected current depends upon the rate constant k<sub>ECE</sub>). The first corresponds to the oxidation of D to C and the second to the oxidation of B to A (<a href="#fig_3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>). The relative heights of the observed peaks is a function of the homogeneous kinetics and potential scan rate. Analysis of the relative peak heights provides information about the magnitude of the rate constant k<sub>ECE</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Further information about ECE reactions can be obtained from the use of hydrodynamic voltammetry, such as RDE experiments. In particular, the ability to control the mass transport rate by simply altering the rotation speed enables the reaction to be probed over a wide range of mass transport rates.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The current/voltage characteristics for an ECE mechanism where the reduction of C is easier than that of A, is shown in <a href="#fig_3.17">Fig. 3.17</a>. The enhancement of current over the simple one-electron occurs since the current voltage curve now contains the current for both the A to B and the C to D reductions.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The measured N<sub>eff</sub> is dependent on both the homogeneous rate constant
and title rotation speed. The influence of the rotation speed occurs as convec
tion draws reactant to the electrode surface and then sweeps away products
from the electrode reaction. For a current to be detected from the reductive
process of C to D, B must decay faster than it is lost by the mass transport
from the electrode interface. This effect can be best clarified by considering
the limits of kinetic behaviour at a single rotation speed. First, if <i>k<sub>ECE</sub></i> is small,
then B is removed from the electrode before it can decay to C, and so no con
tribution from the reduction of C to D is detected in the current voltage curve;
<i>N<sub>eff</sub></i> is therefore 1. If <i>k<sub>ECE</sub></i> is very large, then as soon as B is formed electro
chemically it is converted almost instantaneously to species C which can then
be further reduced at the electrode to D, before mass transport can remove it
from the electrode. The transport-limited current detected at E2 therefore cor
responds to a two electron process, i.e. the reduction of A to B and then C to
D, and N<sub>eff</sub> is therefore 2. For intermediate rate constants only partial conver
sion of B to C occurs before removal of species B from the electrode surface
and the measured <i>N<sub>eff</sub></i> drops below the possible maximum of 2.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The EC&#x2019; Mechanism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The final process to be considered in detail is the EC&#x2019; reaction, where the prime (&#x2019;) represents a catalytic process. Catalytic reactions have received considerable attention since they often represent a clean and efficient method of enhancing chemical reactivity. The advantages of catalytic processes make them particularly useful industrially, where they can produce considerable cost improvements. The EC&#x2019; mechanism can be summarized as</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:4em">
<img src="../images/page_40_1.jpg" alt="images" style="margin-left:6em"/></figure>

<p class="noindent">The catalytic process occurs as the product of the electrode reaction, B, reacts with a substrate molecule Y in solution. The result of this reaction is that B is oxidized back to the starting material A (the catalytic cycle) and Y is converted to products.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_3.19">Figure 3.19</a> shows a typical cyclic voltammogram for differing quantities of substrate Y, the dashed line shows the behaviour when no substrate is present. An enhancement in the current is detected as the homogeneous reaction regenerates A, which can then be reduced again to B, at the electrode. The size of the catalytic current detected is dependent on the quantity of substrate present in solution and the rate of the reaction between B and Y.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Voltammograms recorded at the RDE also show a catalytic enhancement in current. Analysis of the reaction again occurs by interpretation of <i>N<sub>eff</sub> </i>meaurements as a function of the rotation speed. Unlike the ECE mechanism, however, it is not possible to generate a universal working curve describing the relationship between <i>N<sub>eff</sub></i> and rotation speed. This is because the size of the enhancement for any rotation speed is dependent upon the ratio of [A]/[Y]. Consequently, analysis of EC&#x2019; mechanisms is either performed so
<a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a>
that the substrate is in large excess and the reaction acts in a pseudo-first- order manner, or computational models are employed to predict the particular behaviour for a given [A]/[Y] ratio.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In the above sections just a few simple examples of possible electrolysis mechanisms have been discussed. There are, however, a huge range of other possible schemes that may occur. For example, an electrochemically inactive material may undergo homogeneous reaction forming a product that is elec-troactive. This type of process is termed a CE reaction and can be described by the following reaction scheme</p>
<figure class="fig1"  style="margin-left:8em">
<img src="../images/page_41_1.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="noindent">Further complex mechanisms can be drawn, involving second-order steps such as disproportionation, or the EC<sub>2</sub> process where species B decays via a bimolecular reaction:</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:9em">
<img src="../images/page_41_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="noindent">More esoteric still are square sequences where all the species are electrochemically active and equilibrium exists between various components in the system</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="margin-left:9em">
<img src="../images/page_41_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">Most of these complex processes can now be analysed using relatively simple computational simulations or analytical theory.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Processes such as the ECE mechanism show how multiple electron transfers can occur through homogeneous reaction. The next section describes a slightly different situation, where again a multiple electron transfer occurs but were the reactant is able to change oxidation state by more than one. This means that no homogeneous reaction is required to provide a pathway for more than one electron transfer.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Multiple electron transfer reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ability to alter the oxidation state of a molecule by more than one is most often encountered in organic electrochemistry and the electrochemistry of inorganic metals (e.g. T1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/T1<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>). The simplest multiple electron transfer reaction is the two-electron transfer (EE) reaction. Conceptually, the EE process can occur in two ways, either from a one single step involving both electrons or as the result of two consecutive one-electron steps</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">The consecutive pathway is the route most commonly observed in multiple electron transfer processes. Simplistically, this may be rationalized, as it is easier to overcome two small activation barriers than one large one.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Depending upon the relative values of <i>E&#x00B0;<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>E&#x00B0;<sub>2</sub></i> the electron transfers can occur at the same or different potentials.<a href="#fig_3.20"> Figure 3.20</a> shows the cyclic voltam- mogram of a molecule that is capable of undergoing two consecutive, reversible, electron transfer steps, separated by a potential value &#x0394;<i>E.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Electrosynthesis</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The discussion of electrolysis mechanisms has already shown that a range of complex electrode reactions is possible. In particular, the ability of electrochemical processes to create highly reactive and unusual chemical species in an efficient, selective, and well-controlled manner offers many synthetic possibilities. In the laboratory electrosysnthesis experiments are performed in cells not unlike those described earlier for the RDE (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>). Although a larger electrode is often used and is solution agitation increased by stirring. Industrially, with the significantly larger quantities involved, the electrode is usually employed in the form of a packed bed which has a high surface area. The solution can access this electrode bed easily and this enables efficient rates of conversion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The use of electrochemistry as a synthetic tool was appreciated from the early days of electrochemical studies and before the 1920s electrochemistry had been employed to perform some difficult functional group inter-conversions. As time has progressed techniques have been extended and now electrochemical reactions have become an accepted, if not fully exploited, synthetic tool. Electrosynthesis has been used in both oxidative and reductive modes to bring about a wide variety of synthetic processes. For example

<h3 class="h3"><b>Heterogeneous reactions</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">The chemical reactions involved in electrolysis meachanisms have so far been confined to the homogeneous phase. However a significant range of het-erogeneous coupled chemical reactions can occur. The type of surface processes that occur are electrode/electrolyte interactions (these are considered in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>) and substrate adsorption/desorption, which can also be coupled to mass transport.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the following sections the voltammetric response of adsorbed material is discussed and this is followed by a description of some applications of the investigations of such processes.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Surface-adsorbed species</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Consider the voltammetric behaviour of a molecule uniformly adsorbed on to an electrode surface, which is capable of undergoing a reversible one-electron transfer. The resulting cyclic voltammogram shows two peaks (<a href="#fig_3.21">Fig. 3.21</a>). On the forward (reductive) scan a peak is observed corresponding to the reduction of adsorbed A to form B, which remains adsorbed to the surface. On the reverse sweep a current in the opposite sense is observed and adsorbed B is reconverted to adsorbed A. Several differences are apparent compared to the solution-phase voltammogram for a stable, reversible, one-electron transfer (see <a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">First, both forward and reverse peaks are now symmetrical and the current drops back to zero at potentials significantly greater than El. The absence of a current at potentials greater than the reduction potential of A occurs simply because only a limited quantity of A exists on the surface. Once this has been converted to B no further electron transfer can occur. (For the solution phase reaction fresh reactant is continually transported to the electrode by diffusion from bulk solution.) The symmetry of the voltammetric peaks occurs since the electrode reaction is now controlled only by electron transfer kinetics (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.21">eqn 1.21</a>) and not by a coupled problem of diffusion and electron transfer. This also explains why the maxima of the forward and reverse peaks now coincide. The areas of the two peaks are identical and provide a direct measure of the amount of charge required to perform the electrochemical reaction and, therefore, the quantity of material adsorbed on to the surface. An example of this type of behaviour is given by the adsorption of 2,5-dihydroxy-4-methyl- benzylmercaptan (DMBM) on to a platinum (111) surface, <a href="#fig_3.22">Fig. 3.22</a>. DMBM is known to strongly adsorb to electrode surfaces and has been used in spec-troscopic studies (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). The observed voltammetry shows the ideal behaviour noted for a stable one-electron transfer reaction.</p>

<p class="aside">Data taken from Hubbard (1989).</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">Deviation from ideal behaviour will occur if the surface-adsorbed species is not stable in either its charged or uncharged forms, or is desorbed for some reason during the potential cycling. Any deviation in the voltammetric behav-iour can then be used to probe the stability and nature of the bond to the surface. For example, if, after initial electrochemical reaction, the species slowly desorbs, then a reduction in the reverse peak height would be observed. Variation of scan rate in an analoguous way to the homogeneous approach may then enable an estimate of the kinetics of desorption.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Electrochemical studies of surface processes can also be extended to the investigation of adsorption on to single crystal faces. It has been demonstrated that, depending upon the site of adsorption, hydrogen bound to the surface can be oxidized at different potentials (<a href="#fig_3.23">Fig. 3.23</a>). These ideas were also examined initially by surface techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger spectroscopy. There remains considerable debate on various aspects of these studies and interested readers should consult the recent review by Parsons and Ritzoulis (1991) for further details.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">More recently scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has been employed to identify particular crystal planes accessible to adsorption on the surface.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Modified electrodes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">An electrode can be chemically modified, by the immobilization of a layer of material on to its surface. The modified electrode then takes on the surface character of the immobilized material and can be used to perform electro-chemical experiments. Modified electrodes are found in a wide range of applications, since they offer novel properties such as the ability to hold charge (as in a battery), induce novel specific reactions, act as organic semiconductors and catalyse reactions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Polymer-coated electrodes are just one example of modified electrodes and these are discussed as an example of some of the possibilities available from such an approach. Polymer-modified electrodes can be broadly divided into three main categories.</p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-left:1.8em;text-indent:-1.6em;width:65%">(a)	<i>Electronically conducting polmers.</i> These polymers possess <i>n</i> states and are generally conjugated materials, they are often termed &#x2018;organic metals&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_3.24">Fig. 3.24(a)</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a>Each of these categories possess a number of common features. All are electroactive and thus can be either reduced or oxidized, depending on the electrode potential. They have the ability to pass electrical current and are generally mechanically semi-rigid. This last parameter is significant since the electroactive polymer is usually a thin film deposited on the electrode surface.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Production of these modified electrodes can be performed by a variety of techniques. In the case of electronically conductive polymers, the most com-mon approaches are via casting from solution or direct electropolymerization. The result is an electrode coated in a thin film of electroactive polymer (<a href="#fig_3.25">Fig. 3.25</a>). Once chemically modified the electrode is capable of substantially altered reactivity in comparison to the bare electrode. By way of example, consider the reactivity of vitamin B<sub>l2</sub>, which is known to be an extremely effective catalyst in biological systems. The modification of a carbon paste electrode with a polymer incorporating vitamin B<sub>12</sub> has been used to facilitate the reductive, Michael addition of ethyl iodide to acrylonitrile (<a href="#fig_3.26">Fig. 3.26</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Metallic deposition on electrode surfaces</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Metallic cations exist in solution with a surrounding solvation shell and can be adsorbed on to electrode surfaces, typically when the electrode surface possesses a net negative excess charge. Depending upon the potential of the electrode, cations can be reduced to lower oxidation states or discharged com-pletely on the electrode, forming metal atoms on the surface in mono/sub- mono layer quantities. This deposition can occur at potentials positive of that predicted by the Nemst equation for bulk deposition processes. This effect is termed underpotential deposition (upd) and arises primarily from a difference between the chemical potential of the electroactive species in bulk solution and that absorbed on the electrode surface. This occurs as a result of the stronger interactions between the electrode/deposited metal than the metal/bulk metal. The difference in the potential between bulk deposition and surface deposition gives an indirect measurement of the binding energy of the deposited metal to the electrode.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Of particular interest are the resulting electrical properties of the upd layer (and therefore electrode), which differ significantly from those of the original<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Voltammetry: the study of Electrolysis mechanisms</a> electrode material. The upd layer can also alter the nature of the potential dis-tribution across the electrode/electrolyte interface.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Experimentally it is possible to monitor deposition effects using voltam- metric means such as cyclic voltammetry, or by spectroscopic analysis (see<a href="Chapter05.xhtml"> Chapter 5</a>). This gives direct information about the nature of the surface structure, both before and after the deposition process.<a href="#fig_3.27"> Figure (3.27)</a> shows an elegant example of the deposition of a metal on to the electrode surface. Considering, initially, only the forward sweep. As the potential is swept grad-ually, to more negative values a small, sharp peak is observed due to the deposition of a monolayer of lead on to the silver surface as a result of the upd processes. The larger feature at more negative potentials corresponds to the bulk deposition process and the electrode surface now possesses a bulk metal layer. The metal deposited at negative potentials can however be removed from the surface by sweeping to increasingly positive potentials. As the potential is increased the &#x2018;bulk&#x2019; metal deposited on the surface is re-oxidized and dissolves back into solution.

<p class="noindent"><i>Corrosion</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Corrosion has been extensively investigated owing to the huge financial cost incurred by corrosion damage each year. In all cases corrosion occurs because of the instability of a material in relation to the environment around it. Corrosion generally occurs by the interaction of a substate surface with the environment, typically by a range of physical, chemical, or electrochemical interactions. The overall result of corrosion is the modification or degradation, of the surface. This degradation is often unpredictable and cannot necessarily be understood by simple thermodynamic properties. For example, the oxidation of aluminium to form A1<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is more thermodynamically favourable than title oxidation of iron to Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, yet aluminium is much more stable in general usage than iron (which is well known to rust). This can be rationalized, however, as aluminium forms a thin oxide layer at the surface of the metal which protects the surface from further oxidation.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The complexity of this particular area precludes a thorough review of the mechanisms that can occur. However to illustrate some of the ideas, the corrosion of metals in contact with water is considered.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Metallic corrosion generally occurs through oxidation of metal at the substaite surface</p>

<p class="noindent">Provided a high enough solution conductivity exists this reaction can be driven typically by a reaction, such as</p>

<img src="../images/page_47_3.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>
<p class="noindent">The oxidized metal can then either dissolve into the water or react with hydroxide at the surface to form an oxide or hydroxide layer across the<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a>surface. The formation of this surface layer can sometimes help to protect the metal below, making the material passive to further corrosion.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Electrochemical methods can be used to investigate corrosion. Perhaps the simplest approach is to monitor the metal</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">potential as the corrosion process occurs, at open circuit. The corrosion potential,E<sub> corrosion</sub> established can vary with time as the nature of the surface is altered by reaction.</p>

<figcaption class="aside1"><b>Fig. 3.28</b> Schematic of the voltam- metric response of a metal undergoing corrosion.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Further information regarding corrosion processes can be obtained by recording the response of the metal to an applied potential. <a href="#fig_3.28">Figure 3.28</a> shows a schematic example of the voltammetric response of a metal that is capable of forming an oxide film which makes the metal passive to further corrosion. Initially as the potential is swept to positive potentials the metal begins to be oxidized (e.g. Fe to Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>). The oxidized metal may then react with hydroxide in solution and start to form a film of oxide across the surface. At significantly oxidizing potentials the surface is completely covered by the oxide layer and the current drops abruptly as no further reaction can occur. The metal has then formed a coat which is non -conducting and therefore no current is observed in the voltammogram. At extreme positive potentials the film is finally destroyed by evolution of 0<sub>2</sub> at the electrode, enabling current to flow again. The kinetics of the corrosion process may be obtained using Tafel analysis over the region of corrosion potentials (<i>E<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>E<sub>2</sub>).</i> Although such techniques can provide mechanistic and kinetic information about the corrosion process, some care must be exercised when analysing such data, as the current detected at a given potential may arise from a series of complex processes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A further technique available for the investigation of corrosion processes is a.c. impedance spectroscopy. This technique can be used to provide information about film thickness, conductivity, and reactions at the interface. The principles behind a.c impedance and its use to investigate reactions are described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4.</a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Photoelectrochemistry</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Photoelectrochemistry can be split into two separate areas. First, light is absorbed into the electrode (typically a semiconductor) and this can induce changes in the electrode&#x2019;s conduction properties, so altering its electrochemical activity. Secondly, light is absorbed in solution by electroactive molecules or their reduced/oxidized products induce photochemical reaction and modification of the electrode reaction. In this section this second area is described, the photochemistry of semiconductor electrodes is detailed in<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4.</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Early experimental investigations employed an RDE apparatus with UV/visible transparent electrodes (e.g. tin oxide films). Photochemical excitation was achieved by shining the light source through the back of the transparent electrode. The photoelectrochemical reaction was monitored by comparison of the voltammetric response under &#x2018;dark&#x2019; (non&#x002D;irradiated) and irradiated conditions. Any difference detected in the current from the dark and light is called a photocurrent. The photocurrent can then be analysed <a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Voltammetry: the study of electrolysis mechanisms</a>using similar approaches to the investigation of electrode reactions as described in <a href="#sec_3.3">Section 3.3 </a>(<a href="#page_33">p. 33</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Using a similar procedure the photoelectrochemical mechanism for the expulsion of iodide from 1&#x002D;iodoanthraquinone (<a href="#fig_3.29">Fig. 3.29</a>) has been investigated. A combination of spectroscopic detection and photocurrent measurements were required to elucidate the reaction mechanism and consequently a channel electrode was used. 
<a href="#fig_3.30">Figure 3.30</a> shows the results for a typical cur&#x002D; rent/voltage scan under steady&#x002D;state mass transport conditions. The solid line shows the voltammetric behaviour of 1&#x002D;iodoanthraquinone, which in the &#x2018;dark&#x2019; undergoes a reversible one-electron reduction to the radical anion. When the electrode is irradiated with light at 560 nm, corresponding to the wavelength of an absorption band in the radical anion (but not the parent molecule), then an enhancement of the current is detected (shown by the dashed line). Chopping the light source on and off as the potential is swept to more reductive potentials the current is observed to jump rapidly between the solid and dashed lines, strongly indicating a photochemical rather than thermal reaction. Measurement of the photocurrent as a function of the mass transport rate enabled a unique mechanistic scheme for the reaction to be proposed (<a href="#fig_3.31">Fig. 3.31</a>).</p>
