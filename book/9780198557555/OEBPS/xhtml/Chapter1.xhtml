<h2 class="h2">1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The electromagnetic spectrum</h2>
<p class="noindent">The development of non-destructive spectroscopic methods of analysis which can be carried out on small amounts of material has provided the fundamental thrust behind the burgeoning of organic chemistry during the latter half of this century. Identification of unknown molecules of high complexity can now be carried out more or less routinely on samples ranging from several nanograms to a milligram of material, and in many cases it may not even be necessary to obtain pure samples.</p>
<p class="indent">Four techniques are used routinely by organic chemists for structural analysis. <b><i>Ultraviolet spectroscopy</i></b> was the first to come into general use during the 1930s. This was followed by <b><i>infrared spectroscopy</i></b> in the 1940s, with the establishment of <b><i>nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</i></b> and <b><i>mass spectrometry</i></b> during the following two decades. Of these, the first three fall into the category of <b><i>absorption spectroscopy</i>.</b> As this term suggests, these analytical techniques involve absorption of specific energies of <b><i>electromagnetic radiation</i></b> which correspond exactly in energy to specific excitations within the molecule being examined. Generally therefore, it follows that knowledge of the transitions which may be induced by absorption of a certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be used to infer structural features.</p>
<p class="indent">In the classical treatment, electromagnetic radiation can be considered as a propagating wave of electrical energy with an orthogonal magnetic component oscillating with exactly the same frequency (<a href="#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Following this approach, electromagnetic radiation can be described by either its <b><i>frequency</i></b> or <b><i>wavelength</i>.</b> These values are inversely proportional to each other being related by the following equation:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">&#x03BB; = wavelength of the radiation<br/>&#x03BD; = frequency of the electromagnetic radiation<br/><i>c</i> = speed of light 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>8</sup> ms<sup>&#8722;1</sup></p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Introductory theory</a>The shorter the wavelength (or higher the frequency) of electromagnetic radiation, the higher its energy and <i>vice versa</i>. Organic molecules absorb different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and undergo energetic transitions as a consequence of energy transfer. However, the classical treatment does not give us the full picture of the energy transfer process. In the quantum mechanical description, electromagnetic radiation can be considered to be propagated in discrete packets of energy called <b><i>photons</i></b>. These photons possess very specific energies and are said to be <b><i>quantized</i></b>. The energy of each photon is derived by the relationship:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;"><i>h</i> = Planck&#39;s constant 6.626 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#8722;34</sup> Js</p>
</aside>
<p class="center"><i>E = hv</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This description, involving quanta of energy makes it easier to appreciate the fact that transfer of energy does not occur over a continuous range, but only if the energy being transferred exactly matches that of the transition being carried out&#8212;in other words if the energy of the quantum of electromagnetic radiation corresponds exactly to the energy of the transition. Thus, excitation of an organic molecule involves absorption of specific quanta of electromagnetic radiation. This quantized energy is transferred to the molecule causing it to become promoted to a higher energy level, with the exact nature of the excitation depending upon the amount of electromagnetic energy absorbed. However, in any event, the photon of electromagnetic radiation will only be absorbed by a molecule if the energy it possesses corresponds <i>exactly</i> to an energy difference between two states of the molecule. This relationship is described by a simple extension of the above equation:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">&#x0394;<i>E</i> = the difference between the higher and lower states of the absorbing species.</p>
</aside>
<p class="center">&#x0394;<i>E</i> = <i>hv</i></p>
<p class="noindent">While, in theory, any photon corresponding to any possible transition within the molecule might be absorbed, the vast majority of the molecules being irradiated will exist initially in the unexcited <b><i>ground state</i></b> and the easiest, most efficient, absorption process will be that involving the lowest energy input, elevating the molecule to its <b><i>first excited state</i>.</b> Hence the strongest absorption of electromagnetic radiation will occur at an energy corresponding to transitions from the molecule in its ground state to the first excited state of the transition.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be seen from this idealized and very simplified consideration that absorption spectra provide two kinds of information which can enable the electronic and structural characteristics of the molecule to be unravelled. Firstly, the <b><i>absorption wavelength</i></b> or <b><i>frequency</i></b> gives the energy associated with a particular excitation which can be related to the functional group responsible for absorption. Secondly, the <b><i>absorption intensity</i></b> reflects both the ease of the transition (which once again can provide information about the functionality undergoing excitation) and the concentration of the absorbing species.</p>
<p class="indent">Organic chemists often calculate the absorption intensity in ultraviolet spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a>), but largely ignore it in infrared spectra (<a href="Chapter3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>) other than a cursory description of absorptions as &#8216;strong&#8217; or &#8216;weak&#8217;. In proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy however, signal intensity is a key piece of information relating to the relative number of protons in the molecule responsible for the signal (<a href="Chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">5</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Absorption spectroscopy</h2>
<p class="noindent">The transitions effected on absorbing a photon of a given wavelength are summarized in <a href="#fig1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> and the regions of most interest to organic chemists for spectroscopic analysis are highlighted.</p>
<p class="indent">Increasing energies of electromagnetic radiation may cause <b><i>rotational, vibrational</i></b>, and <b><i>electronic</i></b> transitions to occur within a molecule and some of these frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum are of greater utility to organic chemists than others for spectroscopic analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x03B3;-Rays and X-rays are so energetic that they simply cause electrons to be ejected from the molecule resulting in bond rupture, so their absorption provides little detailed structural information that could be of use to organic chemists (X-ray <i>diffraction</i>, of course, is a very powerful tool for structural analysis but is a quite separate technique). Similarly the vast number of possible rotational excitations which exist within organic molecules of the structural complexity usually encountered means that the far infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum do not usually provide the organic chemist with useful information.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">Ultraviolet / visible radiation causes electronic excitation.</p>
</aside>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption style="width:100%"><b>Fig. 1.3</b> The electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Note</b> the wavelength scale is logarithmic.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum is sufficiently energetic to cause bonding electrons to be excited into higher energy orbitals. In organic molecules, this is a diagnostic feature for <b><i>conjugated</i></b> double bonds where the derealization of &#x03C0;-electrons over <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Introductory theory</a>the whole system causes a decrease in the energy gap between the <b><i>highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)</i></b> and the <b><i>lowest unoccupied molecular orbital</i></b> <b>(<i>LUMO</i>)</b>. Increasing conjugation permits excitation by progressively lower frequency (longer wavelength) radiation (<a href="Chapter2.xhtml#ch2.1">Section 2.1</a>). Structural features of organic molecules which lead to absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region are often referred to as <b><i>chromophores</i>.</b></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;"><b><i>Chromophores</i></b> result from the presence of conjugation.<br/><br/>Infrared radiation causes vibrational excitation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The lower frequency infrared radiation cannot promote electronic excitation, but is sufficiently energetic to cause bonds to deform. The energy required to stretch or bend a bond depends upon its force constant and this is in turn dependent upon the constituent atoms and whether they are singly or multiply bonded. Consequently, infrared spectroscopy provides insight into the construction of organic molecules without the prerequisite for conjugation.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;">Radio frequency radiation causes nuclear spin transitions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Undeniably the electromagnetic radiation of most use to the organic chemist lies in the radiofrequency region of the spectrum. Here the extremely low energy radiation is just right to cause nuclei of elements having a <b><i>magnetic moment</i></b> to undergo transitions between nuclear spin states when they are placed in a strong magnetic field and the technique is termed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Only nuclei which possess <b><i>nuclear spin</i></b> can be detected using this technique and the commonest nucleus with this property in organic molecules is the hydrogen nucleus. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the single most important analytical tool available to the organic chemist. Although the major isotope of carbon (<sup>12</sup>C) does not possess nuclear spin the <sup>13</sup>C isotope, constituting 1.11% of natural carbon, does have spin and provides the means of investigating the carbon framework of molecules. However, the low natural abundance of the isotope, together with the low sensitivity of the technique for this nucleus means that <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy has only become routine with the greater sensitivity available with <b><i>Fourier transform</i></b> spectrometers (<a href="#ch1.3">Section 1.3</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Absorption intensity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Three factors affect the intensity of absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The <b><i>transition probability</i></b> in its most general definition is a measure of the likelihood that any specific transition will take place and is commonly simplified into <b><i>allowed</i></b> and <b><i>forbidden</i></b> transitions. Consideration of the theory is beyond the scope of this book, but we will come across allowed and forbidden transitions in ultraviolet spectroscopy.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">The term <b><i>forbidden</i></b> in this context actually means strongly disfavoured.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The remaining two factors reflect the quantities of species capable of carrying out the absorption. At a sub-molecular level, if there are two possible transitions of equal probability, then the species with the greatest population will give rise to the strongest absorption. At a supra- molecular level, the intensity of absorption will be dependent upon the number of molecules through which the radiation must pass. This is related to both the <b><i>concentration</i></b> and <b><i>path length</i></b> of the sample. Initially, it might seem that doubling either of these values would result in a doubling of absorption intensity but this is not the case. If a sample absorbs 50% of the incident radiation then, if the path length is doubled, the additional sample will absorb 50% of the remaining radiation arriving at it. However, this corresponds to only 50% of the original<a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Introductory theory</a> incident radiation and so the additional sample is only absorbing 25% of the original incident radiation (<a href="#fig1.4">Fig. 1.4</a>). Doubling concentration has the same effect and the argument is equivalent.</p>
<figure id="fig1.4"><img src="../images/he_9780198557555_graphic_0004.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="width:100%"><b>Fig. 1.4</b> Schematic illustration of effect of doubling path length upon absorption intensity</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">However the situation above only applies if every species capable of carrying out the absorption actually does so&#8212;in other words the solution is sufficiently dilute that no molecule is in the shadow of another. Under these circumstances the relationship between concentration, path length of the sample and the absorption is given by the <b><i>Beer-Lambert Law</i></b>:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:100%;"><i>I</i> = transmitted radiation<br/><i>I</i><sub>o</sub> = incident radiation<br/>&#x03B5; = extinction coefficient<br/><i>c</i> = sample concentration<br/><i>l</i> = path length of the sample</p>

<p class="noindent">The new term in the above expression, the <b><i>extinction coefficient</i></b> (&#x03B5;) is a numerical reflection of the transitional probability and is constant for any given transition. If the transition is allowed, the extinction coefficient for the absorption will be large and <i>vice versa</i>. We will come across the Beer- Lambert expression in the analysis of ultraviolet spectra when sample strengths are so dilute that the above absorption condition is effectively met.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch1.3">
<h2 class="h2">1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The spectrometer and data acquisition</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to help with the understanding of absorption spectroscopy, it is useful at this stage to take a general overview of the instrumentation used to obtain the analyses. In absorption spectroscopy all spectrometers share several common features and consist of the following components:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>1.&#160;The <b><i>radiation source</i></b></li>
<li>2.&#160;The <b><i>monochromator</i></b> (continuous recording instruments)</li>
<li>3.&#160;The <b><i>sample container</i></b></li>
<li>4.&#160;The <b><i>frequency analyser</i></b></li>
<li>5.&#160;The <b><i>detector</i></b></li>
<li>6.&#160;The <b><i>recorder</i></b></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The specific construction of the instrument depends upon the electromagnetic radiation being used and the compound being analysed and a more detailed description of each spectrometer will be given at the introduction to each technique.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Continuous recording spectrometers</h3>
<p class="noindent">The simplest way of recording absorption spectra, both conceptually and in the construction of the instrument, involves irradiating the sample<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Introductory theory</a> sequentially through the wavelength range and recording the difference in intensities between the incident radiation, or a reference beam, and that passing through the sample. This output is charted directly on calibrated paper. The position of absorption gives information about the nature of the absorbing species while the intensity of the absorption is dependent upon both the ease of the transition to the excited state and the concentration of the sample as previously discussed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fourier transform spectrometers</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">In Fourier transform NMR spectrometers, the sample is subjected to a broad pulse of radiation covering the whole of the frequency range. The absorbed frequencies which are re-emitted as the excited molecules decay back to their ground states are recorded together and the complex signal broken down to its component frequencies by subsequent computer assisted manipulation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Instead of progressively irradiating and analysing differences in intensity between incident and transmitted radiation through the spectral region (the continuous mode of recording spectra described above), Fourier transform analysis involves irradiating the sample with the whole spectral bandwidth at one go and then detecting all frequencies simultaneously as a complex interference pattern. In FT&#8211;IR the resulting <b><i>interferogram</i></b> corresponds to the frequencies that pass through the sample and are not absorbed; whereas in FT&#8211;NMR the detected signal, referred to as the <b><i>free induction decay</i></b>, arises from excited species re-emitting the absorbed frequencies. In either case, digital sampling and submitting the data to Fourier transform analysis permits all the absorption frequencies to be extracted afterwards by computer.</p>
<p class="indent">As a macroscopic analogy to illustrate the difference between continuous scanning and Fourier transform modes of spectroscopic analysis, it is useful to consider two methods for obtaining the resonant frequencies of a bell. One method would be to use a range of tuning forks, each having different frequencies, apply them, one at a time to the surface of the bell and note which ones cause the bell to resonate. Alternatively, the bell could be struck, exciting all the resonant frequencies at once, and the resulting ringing emitted by the bell recorded and submitted to computer aided Fourier transform analysis. The latter approach is much faster than the continuous sampling method for acquiring data, but it leaves the problem of analysis until later.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">The Fourier transform approach to spectroscopic analysis improves spectrometer sensitivity and is sometimes referred to as <b><i>Fellget&#8217;s advantage</i>.</b></p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Exciting all the resonant frequencies of a molecule and acquiring the emission spectrum leads to massive time saving compared to the continuous recording modes and means that multiple scanning is practical, giving spectacular improvements in signal-to-noise ratios and spectrometer sensitivity. This has revolutionized NMR spectroscopy, especially <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis where the sampling is several thousands of times faster.</p>
<p class="indent">To record and interpret spectra, it is not necessary to understand in detail the means by which the complex signal of emitted frequencies is converted into a recognizable spectrum; but we do need to understand the relationship between the two sets of data. Mathematical manipulation of the interference pattern of various superimposed sine and cosine frequencies displayed in the <b><i>time domain</i></b> by the Fourier transform extracts the components and gives a <b><i>frequency domain</i></b> spectrum of the relative intensity of each signal plotted against its frequency (<a href="#fig1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">Fourier transform analysis of the interference signal converts the time domain spectrum to the frequency domain spectrum.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Consider sine waves oscillating at frequencies of 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 200 Hz respectively. Carrying out Fourier transform on each of these time domain oscillations gives frequency domain spectra, each of which <a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Introductory theory</a>consists of a single peak occurring at the frequency of the sine wave (<a href="#fig1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>a&#8211;c). Progressively combining the time domain frequencies gives an increasingly complex interference pattern which nevertheless can be subjected to Fourier transform analysis to extract all the component frequencies (<a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>a, b). However, these examples do not represent what actually happens during spectroscopic analysis as they have constant amplitude. In NMR, the signal emitted by the excited spins decreases in amplitude as the nuclei relax back to their ground state (<a href="#fig1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>c). Nevertheless, despite the fact that the interference pattern dies away, it can still be transformed to obtain the frequency domain signal. A fuller consideration of this technique will be given in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

</aside>
<h3 class="h3">Resolution</h3>
<p class="noindent">An important feature of any spectrometer&#8217;s performance is its <b><i>resolving power</i></b>; in other words the ability of the instrument to distinguish between two particular frequencies or wavelengths of absorption. No molecular absorption of electromagnetic radiation takes place at a single frequency, so there will always be a spread of frequencies associated with any specific absorption process. This spread may be very narrow, such as in the case of gas-phase ultraviolet spectra of simple molecules and NMR signals, or it may be particularly broad, such as in solution phase ultraviolet spectra or infrared spectra. The degree of broadening depends upon various factors, some of which are a consequence of the molecular environment of the species under examination and are largely not under our control. These give rise to the <b><i>natural linewidth</i></b> which is a degree of resolution which no instrument, no matter how precise, can surpass. However, some effects are due to the construction and mode of operation of the spectrometer and this <b><i>resolving power</i></b> may be amenable to modification.</p>

<p class="indent">Line-broadening effects largely beyond our control have their origin in the fact that analysis is carried out on the bulk sample which consists of a range of slightly different absorbing species, no matter how much care is taken to ensure sample homogeneity. For example, intermolecular associations, notably by ionic, dipole or hydrogen bonding interactions, result in mixtures of monomers, dimers and higher oligomers. Associations of this nature can be controlled to some extent by diluting the sample. This will decrease the degree of self-association, although a price has to be paid in decreasing signal strength. This does not remove solvation effects however and, apart from attempting to modify these by<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Introductory theory</a> changing the solvent, there is little to be done. Organic chemists rarely obtain gas-phase spectra.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if such association effects are removed or standardized, there will still be signal broadening due to random intermolecular collisions which cause deformation of the molecules. <b><i>Collision broadening</i></b> may be minimized by analysing solid samples but this is usually not an option for the types of analysis we will be considering. Another effect due to random molecular motion which is most marked in the gas phase but also has influence in solution is <b><i>Doppler broadening</i>.</b> This results from the direction of molecular motion in relation to the analyser causing shifts to slightly higher or lower frequencies of the true absorption frequency.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if it were possible to analyse an individual molecule, it is impossible to isolate a specific transition totally from other molecular transitions. For example, the vibrational frequency of a carbonyl group in a molecule is to some small extent modulated by other vibrational frequencies within the molecule as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, even with a stationary isolated absorbing species, energy levels are not perfectly defined, as <b><i>Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle</i></b> tells us that a system remaining in a fixed energy for a time &#x0394;<i>t</i> sec will have a degree of uncertainty of the energy of that state which is defined by the following equation:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">&#x0394;<i>E</i> = degree of uncertainty of the energy level.</p>
</aside>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mi>E</mi><mo>&#x00D7;</mo><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>&#x2248;</mo><mfrac><mi>h</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>&#x03C0;</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>&#x2248;</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>&#x2212;</mo><mn>34</mn></mrow></msup><mtext>Js</mtext></math></p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the ground state energy of a system <i>is</i> sharply defined as, in the absence of external influences, the system would stay there for infinite time and therefore &#x0394;<i>E</i> = 0. However, all other energy states have uncertainty relating to their lifetime and consequently there will be an uncertainty in the transition energy, and hence frequency of absorption of radiation, which is described by:</p>
<p class="equ"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mtext>&#x03BD;&#160;=&#160;</mtext><mfrac><mrow><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow><mi>h</mi></mfrac><mo>&#x2248;</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mtext>&#x03C0;</mtext><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac></math></p>
<p class="noindent">It turns out that, despite the short lifetimes of electronically and vibrationally excited species the degree of uncertainty, &#x0394;&#x03BD;, is small compared to the frequency of the transitions. However, with electron and nuclear spin transitions, the small energy differences between states give rise to uncertainties which are more significant in relation to the lower frequency radiation causing the transitions.</p>
<p class="indent">If all of the above effects contribute to a certain blurring of the absorption which we can do little to affect, there are nonetheless some features relating to the spectrometer over which we do have some control.</p>
<p class="indent">In continuous scanning ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers the major controlling elements on the resolving power are the quality of the optical arrangement and the <b><i>slit width</i>.</b> Using diffraction gratings, much better dispersion of the radiation is possible compared with prism based optics and the limiting factor is usually the slit width of the spectrometer. The slit width refers to the size of the sampling window of the spectrometer. Obviously, the narrower the slit width, the higher the resolving power of the instrument and this is illustrated in <a href="#fig1.8">Fig. 1.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if the slit becomes too narrow, insufficient energy will reach the detector and the signal-to-noise ratio becomes unacceptable. Using<a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Introductory theory</a> more sensitive detectors permits narrower slit widths and hence better resolving power of the spectrometer but always a compromise must be reached.</p>

<figcaption style="width:100%"><b>Fig. 1.8</b> Dependence of resolution upon slit width in continuous recording IR and UV spectrometers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In Fourier transform instruments, the smaller the difference between two frequencies, the longer it is necessary to record the free induction decay in order to resolve the component frequencies. As an approximation, a resolution of &#x0394;&#x03BD; requires the emission signal to be sampled every <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>&#x0394;</mi><mtext>&#x03BD;</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> seconds and this period is known as the <b><i>acquisition time</i>.</b> However, there is a limit to this time as, once the emission has decayed, no further information can be acquired (<a href="#fig1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p class="indent">This requirement does not cause problems with infrared spectrometers because the resolution required means that a few milliseconds suffice for the acquisition time However, NMR spectra are commonly recorded with a resolution of 0.3 to 0.5 Hertz which requires acquisition times in the order of 2 to 3 seconds. Once again, it is necessary to strike a compromise between resolution and sensitivity, because longer acquisition times mean fewer scans in any given time period. Evidently, acquiring for longer than the decay time of the FID cannot lead to further enhancement of resolution as there is no more emission signal to record and so the rate of decay of the signal places a limiting value on the resolving power of the spectrometer.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Computation</h3>
<p class="noindent">With the advent of cheap but powerful computing capability, new instrumentation techniques have become available which speed up the processes of data acquisition and manipulation, and also make it possible to obtain high quality spectra from progressively smaller amounts of material (particularly important for NMR spectra). Computers render possible the following processes:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;"><b><i>Noise</i></b> is the term applied to random signals recorded by the spectrometer.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">(i) <b><i>Spectrum summation</i>.</b> This is used for analysing weak samples to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Noisy spectra can be improved by adding together the data from repeated analyses of the same sample. Noise, being random, will tend to average out; whereas the peaks will always be additive. It turns out that the intensity of a peak increases at a rate proportional to the square root of the number of spectra recorded. In other words, it is necessary to record 100 spectra of the same sample to obtain a ten-fold improvement in signal-to-noise. This is often known as <b><i>CAT scanning</i></b> (Computer Averaging of Transients) and is most time efficient and now routine in the FT mode.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) <b><i>Fourier transform spectroscopy</i>.</b> When combined with CAT scanning this method of data acquisition has become the dominant technique in NMR spectroscopy and is becoming so in infrared spectroscopy. Quite apart from multiple transient averaging, Fourier transform analysis permits many complicated irradiation protocols, which will only be discussed briefly in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>, but which permit extremely powerful extensions of the basic NMR data acquisition.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) <b><i>Manipulation of the spectrum</i></b>. Functions such as expansion and contraction of abscissas, noise smoothing, baseline corrections and database searches are commonly available facilities.</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) <b><i>Difference spectra</i></b>. This is useful for subtraction of known peaks due to an impurity or solvent and also in <b><i>nuclear Overhauser effect</i> (<i>NOE</i>)</b> difference NMR spectroscopy (<a href="Chapter5.xhtml#ch5.3">Section 5.3</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Mass spectrometry</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far in this introductory chapter we have only considered aspects relating to absorption spectroscopy. The fourth method of analysis frequently used by organic chemists, and arguably as important an analytical tool as NMR, is <b><i>mass spectrometry</i>.</b></p>
<a id="page_11" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 11, Introductory theory</a>
<p class="indent">As its name suggests, this technique allows measurement of the relative molecular mass of molecules and therefore provides vital information not available by spectroscopic methods. Quite apart from the fact that this technique does not involve absorption of electromagnetic radiation (note the terminological distinction of <i>spectro<b>metry</b> versus</i> spectro<b><i>scopy</i></b>), it differs from the other three techniques by analysing sample molecules one at a time rather than the bulk sample.</p>
<p class="indent">Mass spectrometry enables the molecular weight of quite large and complicated molecules to be obtained. In addition, the fragmentation of the excited species produced by ionization of the subject molecule, frequently gives very important clues to its composition. Therefore, mass spectrometry complements absorption spectroscopy by providing us with important information about the mass of the intact molecule and additional details about its construction. We will consider this technique in more detail in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we have been introduced to the four types of analytical technique most frequently used by organic chemists in structural analysis. In addition, we have considered in a very qualitative way the physical basis behind absorption spectroscopy and some of the principles behind the instrumentation. We will now proceed to consider each of the four techniques in more detail. Each chapter will start with a qualitative treatment of the theoretical principles and and then go on to analysis of the data. At the end of each chapter will be a series of exercises to help assess your understanding of the topics covered and there will be lists of additional sources of information for more detailed or theoretical coverage.</p>
<p class="indent">In this introduction to organic spectroscopy it has been necessary to make somewhat arbitrary decisions about which techniques will be treated and which will be left out. Three types of absorption spectroscopy (ultraviolet, infrared and NMR spectroscopy), together with mass spectrometry, normally provide the organic chemist with sufficient analytical power to determine the structure of even the most complex organic molecule and will be the only techniques considered. Furthermore, the sections on NMR spectroscopy will be limited to <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, although nuclei such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F and <sup>31</sup>P may also be of interest to organic chemists. Likewise, we will not consider electron spin resonance spectroscopy, a means of detecting species which possess an unpaired electron, nor will we discuss chiroptical techniques such as circular dichroism and optical rotary dispersion. However, we must not forget that such techniques are available, and at times necessary, and those wishing to have a simple introduction to any of the areas not covered by this book are directed to the <i>Further reading</i> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Equally, the confines of this introductory book mean that it has not been possible to include a problem section involving structural elucidation using the range of spectroscopic techniques and you are recommended to consult the texts in reference 4. These contain a series of exercises which should be within your scope after having read this book.</p>
