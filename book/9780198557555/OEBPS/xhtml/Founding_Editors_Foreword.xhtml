<p class="fmnoindent">The deduction of chemical structure from spectroscopic data is an essential skill required of all organic chemists, which is acquired mainly by the practice of interpreting original data. Laurence Harwood and Tim Claridge provide in this primer the basic knowledge, in the four most important areas of spectroscopy, which will allow students to start interpreting their own data and hence gain this essential skill.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be covered in an 8&#8211;10 lecture course. In this primer the authors introduce students to this enormous area of basic structural analysis in a logical and easy to follow fashion. This primer will be of interest to apprentice and master chemist alike.</p>
