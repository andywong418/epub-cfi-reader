<p class="fmnoindent">The need to determine the structures of molecules efficiently lies at the heart of chemistry and the great strides made in the various techniques of spectroscopic analysis have been the root cause of the explosive burgeoning, particularly of organic chemistry, during the latter half of this century. In response to the chemist&#8217;s desire to analyse ever smaller amounts of structures of increasing complexity, the advance of instrumentation and spectroscopic techniques shows no sign of slowing. To the newcomer, the task of selecting a starting point within the bewildering array that falls under the heading of &#8217;spectroscopy&#8217; must appear very daunting indeed. The aim of this book is to provide a straightforward introduction to the basic principles, operation, and analyses possible using four of the spectroscopic techniques most routinely used by organic chemists&#8212;ultraviolet, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Our thanks go to Dr Robin Aplin for helpful comments on the chapter on mass spectometry and Dr Katya Vines for proof-reading the manuscript.</p>
<p class="fmindent">We would like to dedicate this book to the memory of Andy Derome, our friend and colleague, whose tragic and untimely death at the age of 33 in 1991 cut short the career of someone who had established himself as one of the leading exponents of NMR spectroscopy in the world at the time. We are all the poorer for his passing away.</p>
