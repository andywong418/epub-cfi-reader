<p class="noindent">Having dealt with techniques which involve the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, we will now consider a totally different type of analysis which enables the mass of the molecule to be determined and also provides further information about how it is constructed.</p>
<p class="indent">In the basic mass spectrometric experiment (first demonstrated by Wien in 1898), individual molecules of a sample are bombarded with high energy electrons which cause the ejection of one or more electrons from the substrate on impact. The technique is known as <i><b>electron impact ionization</b></i> (<a href="#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The positively charged ions are then accelerated along an electrical potential and pass through a magnetic field which causes them to be deflected to an extent which is dependent upon the charge on the molecule and the magnetic field strength and is inversely dependent upon the momentum (and hence the mass) of the positively charged species (<a href="#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). The actual relationship is:</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">For the experiment to work there must be no intermolecular exchanges of energy and so extremely high vacua (<i>ca</i> 10<sup>&#8211;6</sup> torr) are required. Measurement of <i>m/z</i> permits the mass of each charged species to be ascertained if the charge is known. In such an arrangement the highest <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Mass spectrometry</a> <i>m/z</i> will correspond to the singly charged intact molecule (the <i><b>molecular ion</b></i>) and gives the molecular mass directly. Sometimes however, peaks of non-integral mass are detected and these correspond to multiply charged species. In mass spectrometry, individual ionized molecules are measured in contrast to UV, IR, or NMR spectroscopy in which the bulk sample is analysed. Consequently it is possible to distinguish molecules containing different isotopes such as <sup>35</sup>C1 and <sup>37</sup>C1.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to producing the intact radical cation, impact of an electron may cause sufficient energy to be transferred to the vibrational modes of the molecule that it undergoes bond rupture, giving rise to cleavage fragments which themselves may still possess sufficient vibrational energy to undergo subsequent fragmentation (<a href="#fig6.3">Fig. 6.3</a>). Those fragments which retain the positive charge will also be deflected in the magnetic field but to a greater extent than the intact ions due to their lower mass.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The signal generated at the detector is dependent upon the number of ions of any particular mass arriving at the analyser. It follows therefore that the most intense signals in a mass spectrum will arise from the cleavages which occur most readily. Such cleavages are likely to occur at weak bonds, or to give stabilized fragments, and so inspection of the more intense fragmentation peaks can give us insight into the structure of the molecule. The mass spectrum of a compound is usually displayed as a bar chart of ion intensity against increasing integral mass, with the strongest peak (the <i><b>base peak</b></i>) normalized to 100% intensity (<a href="#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">One of the great advantages of mass spectrometry is that it requires extremely small amounts of material (a nanogram can be sufficient) and so can be considered effectively to be a non-destructive method of analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic instrument which analyses the ions using a magnetic field is referred to as a <b><i>single focusing mass spectrometer</i>,</b> but a common alternative arrangement uses an <i><b>electrostatic field</b></i>, either before or after passage through a magnetic analyser, when the spectrometer is referred to as <i><b>double focusing</b></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to <i><b>electron impact ionization</b></i>, a useful commonly encountered ionization technique is <i><b>chemical ionization</b></i> where the substrate is bombarded with positively charged atoms or molecules instead of electrons (<a href="#ch6.3">Section 6.3</a>). This milder technique means that molecules which are unable to survive the very rigorous conditions of electron impact intact may still yield information about their molecular weight. Commonly ammonia is used as the source of primary ions<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Mass spectrometry</a> resulting in addition of H<sup>+</sup> and NH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> to the substrate molecule to give <i><b>quasi&#8211;molecular ion</b></i> peaks at M + 1 (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>) or M + 1 and M + 18 respectively.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this simplest arrangement (<a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>), samples having an appreciable volatility are introduced by connecting an ampoule to an inlet reservoir. Less volatile materials are introduced directly into the ionization chamber on the end of a probe which can be heated. Electron impact ionization is carried out using a beam of high energy electrons (<i>ca</i> 70 eV). Ionization is possible with electrons of about 10 eV and the excess energy is transferred to vibrational modes of the molecule and results in fragmentation of the ionized species. The positively charged species so produced are accelerated under a 4&#8211;8kV potential and focused into a tight beam. The collimated beam is then passed through a strong magnetic field placed at right angles to the line of flight of the ions. Lighter ions are deflected more than heavier ions, the separated ion beams are individually detected and the intensity of each beam measured <b>(<i>relative abundance</i>)</b>. The ion beams are focused onto the detector by varying the magnetic field strength; sweeping the magnetic field permits a mass range to be surveyed.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This instrument has an electrostatic analyser placed in series with the <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Mass spectrometry</a>magnetic analyser (<a href="#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>). The electrostatic analyser refocuses the small energy spread to be found within any collection of ions having the same mass. The resolution of the instrument is enhanced still further by using narrower slits before the collector. Although this has the effect of reducing sensitivity, it means that molecular masses can be measured with an accuracy of 1&#8211;2 ppm. Consequently it is possible to determine molecular composition without the necessity for combustion analysis, permitting distinction between two molecules having the same integral molecular mass but different composition (<a href="#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Quadrupole mass spectrometer</h3>
<p class="noindent">This arrangement uses four voltage carrying rods about 10&#8211;30 cm long (the <i><b>quadrupole</b></i>) running the length of the flight path of the ions. Ions travel with constant velocity parallel to the rods but, as a result of the application of direct current and radio-frequency voltages to the rods they acquire complex oscillations in their path (<a href="#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>). For any <i>m/z</i> ratio there is a <i><b>stable oscillation</b></i> which permits ions to traverse the whole length of the analyser without hitting the rods and being lost. In other words, under any set of applied dc and rf voltages, only ions of a particular <i>m/z</i> ratio will be collected and analysed. Mass scanning is carried out by varying the two applied voltages while keeping their ratios constant.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">This type of spectrometer works on the principle that all singly charged species subjected to the same potential difference will achieve the same translational energy as measured in electron volts. However, lighter <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Mass spectrometry</a>particles will be accelerated faster than heavier ones and will thus have a shorter <i><b>time-of-flight</b></i> over a particular distance. The particles are allowed to pass through a field-free region and are analysed by their arrival time at the detector (<a href="#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>). As the time differences are in the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup> s, fast electronics are necessary for adequate resolution, but it is difficult to achieve better than about 2 mass units.</p>
<h3 class="h3">On-line chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS and HPLC&#8211;MS)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Coupling a mass spectrometer to the effluent of a gas or liquid chromato- graph combines the powerful analytical capability of mass spectrometry with the high degree of separation possible with gas chromatography (usually capillary gas chromatography) or high performance liquid chromatography. Commercial instruments commonly use a spectrometer based upon a quadrupole mass filter due to the ruggedness of this particular design.</p>
<p class="indent">With on-line chromatography-mass spectrometry, it is necessary to separate the molecules to be analysed from the carrier gas or elution solvents&#8212;the chromatography column is at a positive pressure; whereas the mass spectrometer operates at 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> torr. Thus the crucial part of such a set-up is the <i><b>interface</b></i> between the two instruments which must permit passage of the sample without compromising the throughput of the chromatography system or the high vacuum requirements of the mass spectrometer. The problems are particularly acute with HPLC&#8211;MS when large quantities of solvent must be stripped off but this technique pays the dividend of permitting analysis of mixtures of involatile components.</p>

<figcaption style="width:120%;"><p class="noindent2"><b>Fig. 6.11</b> Schematic of a jet molecular separator.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">One example of an interface commonly used in packed column GC&#8211;MS is the <i><b>jet molecular separator</b></i> (<a href="#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>). In this arrangement, the effluent gases from the GC exit through a fine outlet and impinge onto a sharp edged collector nozzle a short distance from the outlet. The lighter components of the effluent (the carrier gas) diffuse more rapidly to the periphery of the jet and are not collected, but pumped away; whereas the heavier components selectively pass into the spectrometer to be analysed.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true to say that the scale of problems encountered with HPLC&#8211;MS means that there is no universal interface for all situations. The first to become commercially available was the <i><b>moving belt interface</b></i> which, as its name implies, involves deposition of the HPLC effluent onto an endless belt relaying sample to the ionization chamber through a series of vacuum chambers to remove the majority of the solvent (<a href="#fig6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>). Residual solvent is removed by gentle heating before the residual sample is flash- vaporized from the belt surface into the ionization source. On return to the HPLC effluent jet to receive more sample, the belt is cleaned to avoid contamination with residues of the previous deposition.</p>

<p class="indent">The moving belt interface has now been largely superseded by the <i><b>thermospray interface</b></i> which is especially useful for analysis of polar materials with aqueous eluents (<a href="#fig6.13">Fig. 6.13</a>). In this arrangement, the effluent from the HPLC column is heated and forced through a fine jet into an evacuated chamber to give an aerosol. This results in simultaneous volatilization and ionization of the droplets by buffer (commonly ammonium acetate) present<a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Mass spectrometry</a> in the mobile phase. Statistically, some droplets develop an excess positive charge and some an excess negative charge. Solvent is pumped off concentrating the charges onto the sample and the positively ionized components directed into the mass spectrometer by the repelling electrode.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Ionization techniques</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Electron impact (EI)</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this conceptually simplest technique, the sample is bombarded with a beam of high energy (<i>ca</i> 70 eV) electrons which, on impact, transfer about 20 eV of energy to the molecule leading to ejection of electrons to give positively charge species (<a href="#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>). As mass spectrometers are designed to record species possessing a single positive charge, the largest fragment corresponds to the radical cation M<sup>&#x2022;+</sup> and gives the molecular weight of the substance. As ionization requires about 15 eV energy, the 5 eV or so of excess</p>

<figcaption style="width:110%;"><b>Fig. 6.14</b> Electron Impact ionization.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">energy transferred by the impacting electron passes into the vibrational modes of the radical cation. This causes the radical cation to fragment giving smaller species and those retaining a charge may also be analysed and detected.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Chemical ionization (CI)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many compounds are too labile to stand up to impact by 70 eV electrons without total fragmentation Consequently, analysis of such materials using EI would result in no molecular ion being detected. In the chemical ionization procedure, the sample is introduced into the ionization chamber at about 1 torr pressure together with a carrier gas such as hydrogen, ammonia or methane. It is the carrier gas which is ionized selectively by the high energy electrons, as it is present in excess. The initial radical cations <b>(<i>primary ions</i>)</b> react with further neutral molecules of the carrier gas to give <i><b>secondary ions</b></i>. It is these secondary ions which, having a longer lifetime, can react with molecules of the sample to give <i><b>quasi-molecular ions</b></i>. The scheme of <a href="#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a> shows the overall process using ammonia as the ionizing reagent, as it is commonly used for CI.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, with CI analysis, M + 1 and M + RH peaks (where R = the reagent gas) are recorded, with the M + 1 peak usually being the<a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Mass spectrometry</a> dominant peak. As the ions have been produced by a chemical reaction and not by direct electron impact, they do not have a great excess of energy to transfer to vibrational modes and fragmentations of the ionized species are minimal. Consequently, mass spectra recorded using CI usually have the M + 1 peak as the strongest peak <b>(<i>base peak</i>)</b> with fewer fragment peaks (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>).</p>

<figcaption style="width:110%;"><b>Fig. 6.15</b> The chemical ionization pathway.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 class="h3">Field ionization and desorption (FD)</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is used for very non-volatile samples which will not stand up to the heating necessary to increase their volatility (mass spectrometry relies upon the molecule having a slight vapour pressure). The sample is placed directly onto a fine wire on a modified inlet probe held at + 8 kV at, or slightly above, room temperature. The wire possesses fine dendritic growths along which the molecules are subjected to local, extremely high, electrical potentials of up to 10<sup>10</sup> V m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This results in abstraction of electrons from the molecules into unfilled orbitals of the metal and the positive ions so produced are immediately expelled from the probe by Coulombic repulsion without the need for excessive external heating. In this manner, the ions produced have little excess energy and spectra recorded using this technique usually only show the molecular ion or MH<sup>+</sup> and sometimes MNa<sup>+</sup> peaks due to intermolecular interactions occurring close to the surface of the probe. The technique can be used to analyse molecules having molecular weights up to about 10 k dalton.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and fast atom<br/>bombardment (FAB)</h3>
<p class="noindent">These are mild ionizing techniques for large polar molecules such as peptides and are based upon an indirect ionization approach. In SIMS, argon is first ionized by electron impact and the beam of Ar<sup>&#x2022;+</sup> directed towards the sample causing ionization on collision. In FAB, the substrate is dispersed in an involatile matrix such as glycerol and is ionized by impact with high energy xenon atoms obtained by passing Xe<sup>&#x2022;+</sup> ions, accelerated to about 10 keV, through more xenon gas (<a href="#fig6.16">Fig. 6.16</a>). The xenon radical cations pick up an electron, becoming xenon atoms with high translational energy, while the Xe<sup>+</sup> ions also formed are removed electrostatically. The <i><b>fast atoms</b></i> so produced are allowed to impact on the sample to be analysed.<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Mass spectrometry</a> Ionization occurs by transfer of translational energy from the accelerated xenon atoms, with minimal transfer to vibrational modes of the substrate and hence reduced fragmentation of the ionized molecules. The relatively polar medium of the glycerol acts as an ionizing solvent and favours ion formation. In addition, as the ions take some time to diffuse to the surface, the ion stream may last for up to 30 minutes as opposed to about 2 seconds for normal ionization techniques. Usually MH<sup>+</sup> is seen together with MNa<sup>+</sup> and MK<sup>+</sup> from inorganic impurities in the matrix. Protonated glycerol derived ions dominate the spectrum at <i>m/z</i> 92<i>n</i> + 1 corresponding to (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>H<sup>+</sup>, but these ions do not interfere for the types of molecule studied with this technique. Fragment ions are useful, particularly when the technique is used for protein analysis as the fragments may be used to sequence the peptide chain.</p>

</aside>
<h3 class="h3">Miscellaneous desorption techniques</h3>
<p class="noindent">Several techniques have been developed to deliver a rapid pulse of energy to the sample which results mainly in breaking intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds rather than cleaving covalent bonds within the molecule. The energy may be delivered by impact of extremely energetic ionized particles such as <sup>142</sup>Ba<sup>18+</sup> and <sup>106</sup>Xe<sup>22+</sup> resulting from fission of <sup>252</sup>Cf <b>(<i>plasma desorption</i>)</b> or a very finely focused laser beam <b>(<i>laser desorption</i></b>, particularly <b><i>matrix assisted laser desorption</i>)</b> and causes simultaneous vaporization and ionization of the material. These procedures permit molecules having masses up to 25 k dalton to be analysed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Electrospray</h3>
<p class="noindent">Macromolecules, such as proteins, would be decomposed by any attempt to volatilize or ionize them under usual conditions. Electrospray enables molecules to be taken directly from a solution to the gas phase ionized state by passing the solution through the exit of a fine needle held at an electrical potential around 4 kV (<a href="#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>). The solution disperses into a fine mist of ionized droplets which quickly lose their solvent, leaving behind an aerosol of protonated sample which is then desorbed into the gas phase and interfaced with the vacuum for mass spectrometric analysis. Fragmentation is not observed under such mild conditions and it is possible that even the tertiary structures of some proteins are retained. In principle, the mass range available by such a technique is limited only by the capabilities of the instrument and proteins up to 150 k dalton may be analysed fairly routinely.</p>
<p class="indent">As each molecule of the substrate may possess a variable number of protons, a series of <i>m/z</i> peaks is recorded and from this the true mass may be obtained by computer analysis. This technique is probably the &#8216;softest&#8217; ionization procedure available and permits molecular weight determinations of large molecules with accuracies of better than 0.01%.</p>

<p class="noindent">As already discussed, the primary information given by mass spectrometry is the molecular weight of the substance as the spectrometer<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Mass spectrometry</a> measures <i>m/z</i>. However, deciding which peak actually is the molecular ion is not necessarily straightforward and depends upon the ionization technique. Only EI leads to M<sup>&#x2022;+</sup> being recorded; if softer ionization techniques such as CI, FAB or electrospray are being used we measure MH<sup>+</sup>, MNH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> or MNa<sup>+</sup> depending upon the technique used (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>a).</p>
<p class="indent">Mass spectrometry measures individual atoms and so this enables the isotopic constitution of the sample to be measured. While very few elements (F, I, P) are truly monoisotopic, many other elements (H, N) of interest to the organic chemist can be considered to be effectively monoisotopic, due to the low abundance of other isotopes. However, there are some elements (C, Br, CI, S, Si) of which the isotopic composition has an important bearing on the peaks observed around the molecular ion.</p>

<p class="indent">Carbon is roughly 99% <sup>12</sup>C and 1% <sup>13</sup>C. Consequently, in a molecule containing 10 carbon atoms, there is statistically a 10% chance that one of the atoms will be <sup>13</sup>C. Therefore, the M<sup>&#x2022;+</sup> peak will be accompanied by a peak at M +1 having 10% intensity due to the those molecules containing one <sup>13</sup>C atom. For such a molecule the peak at M + 2 is usually too small to be detected and does not cause confusion, but it is important to be aware that moderately sized molecules containing C, H, N and O have a molecular ion which is the major peak within the cluster of the peaks found at the highest mass in the spectrum. For larger molecules this identification problem becomes more complicated; although, for molecules with molecular weights greater than 10 k dalton the level of imprecision is of lesser importance.</p>
<p class="indent">Two important situations arise with bromine and chlorine. Bromine consists of two isotopes, <sup>79</sup>Br and <sup>81</sup>Br, in approximately 1 : 1 ratio. Molecules containing one bromine atom show a molecular ion which consists of two peaks of roughly equal intensity separated by two mass units. Patterns resulting from two and three bromine atoms in a molecule are shown in <a href="#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>. The relative intensities of peaks for such di-isotopic systems can be calculated using the binomial expansion (<i>a + b</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>. Chlorine has two isotopes <sup>35</sup>C and <sup>37</sup>C in about a 3 : 1 ratio. Molecules containing a chlorine atom show a molecular ion consisting of 2 peaks separated by two mass units with the higher peak about one third the intensity of the lower mass peak (<a href="#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a> and <a href="#fig6.20">6.20</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">There is always the possibility that the molecule is too unstable if the analysis has been carried out under EI ionization conditions and never gives a molecular ion, the highest peak observed being due to a fragment (<a href="#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>b). Suspect this particularly if there are fragment ions having between 3&#8211;14 mass units less than the apparent &#8216;molecular ion&#8217;. Commonly encountered organic molecules are not capable of readily losing fragments within this range and what is in fact being observed are different sets of fragment ions arising from an unobserved molecule which has undergone total fragmentation before analysis.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>The &#8216;nitrogen rule&#8217;</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nitrogen is the only commonly encountered odd valency element possessing an even atomic weight in organic molecules. Any compound<a id="page_79" class="page">Page 79, Mass spectrometry</a> containing one or an odd number of nitrogen atoms will have an odd molecular weight; conversely, compounds lacking nitrogen or containing even numbers of nitrogens have an even molecular weight. An odd molecular ion in a spectrum obtained under conditions of electron impact ionization should therefore alert you to the fact that the substance possibly contains nitrogen but don&#8217;t forget that it might simply be that you are not observing the molecular ion but a fragment peak instead. Of course, the inverse applies to spectra obtained under chemical ionization conditions if we consider MH<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fragmentation pathways</h2>
<p class="noindent">The occurrence of fragment ions within the mass spectrum provides useful information about the constitution of the molecule as fragmentations often occur at labile bonds or to give particularly stable fragments. Fragmentation may involve cleavage of a single bond or cleavage of two bonds.</p>
<h3 class="h3">One-bond cleavages</h3>
<p class="noindent">Radical cations may fragment by either heterolytic bond cleavage to give a cation and a radical or by homolytic cleavage to generate a new radical cation.</p>

<p class="indent">This leads to the <b><i>even electron rule</i>,</b> a guideline which states that even- electron species do not fragment to odd-electron species. In other words, a cation will not fragment to form a radical and a radical cation. One-bond cleavage gives fragments which are valence unsatisfied. Compounds or fragments with an even molecular weight give one-bond cleavage fragments which are odd and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Two-bond cleavages</h3>
<p class="noindent">These cleavages result from chemical reactions of the radical cation. Even molecular weight compounds give even molecular weight two-bond cleavage fragments and <i>vice versa</i>, again making these cleavages easy to identify.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Metastable peaks</h3>
<p class="noindent">These are a result of fragmentations occurring in the <i><b>fieldfree region</b></i> of the spectrometer, which is the area outside the ionization chamber but before the magnetic analyser, and means that fragmentation occurs after some initial acceleration of the original charged fragment has already taken place. The excess momentum is passed on to the daughter ions and means that they possess a higher velocity than they would have achieved if they had been formed before acceleration. They are not shown on &#8216;bar&#8217; spectra (which only give integral peaks) but can be seen on photographically recorded spectra. They are broad and occur at non-integral positions in the spectrum. The relationship between the daughter and parent ions is expressed by the equation shown in the margin.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Metastable peaks are relatively uncommon, as their observation requires fragmentation to occur in the field-free region between the ionization chamber and the magnetic analyser. Any faster and the daughter ion is formed in the ionization chamber to give the normal fragment; any slower and the fragmentation occurs in the analyser and the fragment does not reach the detector. This requires fragmentations occurring with lifetimes of around 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> &#x2192; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>s. Of course, merely knowing the mass of the metastable peak (<i>m</i>*) is insufficient to arrive at unambiguous values for the parent and daughter ions <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>. However it is possible to obtain the masses of the parent and daughter peaks by inspection as they usually occur as strong peaks in the spectrum. Alternatively, computer analysis of spectra makes the calculation simple.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fragmentations are particularly favoured at weak bonds or to produce stable fragments and you should refer to <a href="Appendices.xhtml#app4">Appendix 4</a> for lists of common fragmentations and fragment ions. Usually it is obvious when simple substituents such as alkyl groups are lost, but there are several important cleavages which should be remembered.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Tropylium ion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Organic substrates containing a benzyl group show a strong peak, usually the base peak at <i>m/z</i> = 91 due to a one-bond cleavage. This is normally accompanied by a second peak at <i>m/z</i> = 65 resulting from loss of ethene in a two-bond cleavage step.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3">Acylium ions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Compounds possessing acyl groups give strong fragment ions corresponding to the acylium cations. For example acetates and methyl ketones give a strong peak at <i>m/z</i> = 43 and benzoates and phenyl ketones a strong peak at <i>m/z</i> = 105. These species are usually accompanied by peaks corresponding to subsequent extrusion of carbon monoxide (<a href="#fig6.21">Fig. 6.21</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Favourable bond cleavages</h3>
<p class="noindenta"><i><b>Reverse Diets&#8211;Alder.</b></i> This commonly occurs with cyclohexene derivatives and the charged fragment is usually the diene.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Loss of small neutral molecules</h3>
<p class="noindent">Generally, elimination of small, neutral molecules occurs readily. In particular, alcohols lose water to give M&#8211;18, acetates lose acetic acid to give M&#8211;60 and halides lose HX. In this latter case, it will be observed that the characteristic isotope pattern of the molecular ion due to the presence of chlorine or bromine disappears in the fragments which are halogen free.</p>
