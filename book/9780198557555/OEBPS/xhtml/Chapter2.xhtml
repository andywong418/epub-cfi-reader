<p class="noindent">In a historical context, the introduction of UV spectroscopic analysis during the 1930s was an important milestone in analytical chemistry as it demonstrated the advantages of non-destructive analysis. The vast savings in time and the ability to work with much smaller samples of material demonstrated the power of spectroscopic analysis to organic chemists who wanted to use the technique in a diagnostic manner without being concerned with the full details of the physical background. This paved the way for the development and acceptance of the other techniques. It is worthy of note that, powerful as it seemed at the time, UV spectroscopy is rarely used as a first means of analysis nowadays. Its use is commonly restricted to very specific areas of chemistry dealing with compounds, such as dyestuffs, which have important absorption characteristics in this range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite this, it is worthwhile considering UV-visible spectroscopy first as it provides us with a simple introduction to the major principles of absorption spectroscopy.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindent">Absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the UV&#8211;vis region transfers the right amount of energy to cause transitions in the electronic energy levels of the bonds of a molecule and results in excitation of electrons from the <b><i>ground state</i></b> into an <b><i>excited state</i></b> (<a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>). However, as discussed in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>, absorption will only occur if the energy of the photon corresponds exactly to that of the transition. We will see that higher energy, shorter wavelength, light is necessary to excite &#x03C3;-bonds than &#x03C0;-bonds as there is a larger energy difference between the <b><i>bonding</i></b> and <b><i>antibonding</i></b> &#x03C3;-orbitals compared with the bonding and antibonding &#x03C0;-orbitals. In spectroscopic nomenclature the structural features of a molecule responsible for absorption of UV light are referred to as <b><i>chromophores</i>.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Molecules absorb UV radiation in the region below about 150 nm as these wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation have energies corresponding to those required to cause excitation of electrons in the &#x03C3;-bond framework. Consequently molecules in the atmosphere will absorb this radiation, and therefore analysis in this region requires special vacuum techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">In standard UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy analysis is carried out on a dilute solution of the sample and referenced to a sample of pure solvent. In this situation, with the solvent present in a vast excess, the tail of the solvent &#x03C3;-bond absorption peak will impinge into the measurable range of the UV spectrometer and totally swamp any absorptions due to the dissolved compound under investigation, as the spectrometer becomes insensitive when attempting to subtract two extremely strong absorptions. <b><i>Solvent</i></b><a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy</a> <b><i>end absorption</i></b> may extend up to about 240 nm, depending upon the solvent. Certainly any peaks observed below 220 nm must be regarded with caution. Some common solvents and their transparency ranges are given below.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;">The ultraviolet range is generally considered to be 200&#8211;330 nm and the visible range 330&#8211;700 nm. Of course, if the sample is not coloured, there is no need to record the visible region of the spectrum.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In addition to considering solvent, it must be remembered that ordinary glass is opaque to wavelengths below 300 nm. UV analysis is carried out in special quartz vessels <b>(<i>cuvettes</i>)</b> which are transparent down to about 170 nm, but visible spectra may be obtained using glass or plastic cuvettes.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrons in rc-bonds and lone pairs require less energy than a- bonding electrons for excitation to their antibonding orbitals and absorb at longer wavelengths. An isolated double bond absorbs UV-radiation at about 190 nm and lone pairs are excited by wavelengths between 185&#8211;195 nm. The table below lists the important fundamental chromophores and the types of electronic transition they undergo. With the exception of the <b><i>symmetry forbidden</i></b> n &#x2192; &#x03C0;* transition, none occur within the recording range of standard instruments.</p>

<p class="indent">However, when two rc-orbitals are combined to form a <b><i>conjugated</i></b> diene <a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy</a>the &#x03C0;-electrons become delocalized over the whole &#x03C0;-framework giving rise to a resonance hybrid structure. The energy gap between the <b><i>highest occupied molecular orbital</i> (<i>HOMO</i>)</b> of this resonance hybrid and the <b><i>lowest unoccupied molecular orbital</i> (<i>LUMO</i>)</b> is smaller than in the isolated alkene. Consequently, excitation occurs with a longer wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Considering <a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a> showing the molecular orbitals for an alkene and a conjugated diene allows us to see how conjugation leads to a lowering of the HOMO-LUMO gap compared with the isolated system.</p>

<figcaption style="width:100%"><b>Fig. 2.4</b> The molecular orbitals of ethene and butadiene. Note how conjugation reduces the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy difference.</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">The term <b><i>chromophore</i></b> originates from the fact that conjugation was recognized to be responsible for making compounds coloured (the absorption reached into the visible region of the spectrum) but it now applies to any conjugated system resulting in absorption of UVor visible light.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Inclusion of additional &#x03C0;-bonds and extending the degree of conjugation progressively narrows the gap between the energy of the HOMO and the LUMO. As a result, the wavelength of radiation required for excitation becomes longer as the degree of conjugation increases. It is conjugated systems such as polyenes and poly-ynes, referred to as <b><i>chromophores</i></b>, that give rise to diagnostic absorptions in the UV-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">The diagnostic absorptions result from &#x03C0; &#x2192; &#x03C0;* and n &#x2192; &#x03C0;* transitions in conjugated systems. Aromatic and heteroaromatic systems are commonly encountered examples of conjugated &#x03C0;-systems and such structures are particularly useful chromophores. It is with such conjugated systems that UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy comes into its own.</p>
<p class="indent">The non-bonding electrons of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur can also become involved in resonance and will extend conjugation in these systems. An <b><i>auxochrome</i></b> is any group, such as OR, NR<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, or CO<sub>2</sub>R, which is capable of extending the basic chromophore. This synergistic effect is due to the ability of such substituents to undergo resonance derealization involving the polyene system and so reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap still further.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:120%;">Although absorptions in UV-vis solution spectra are broad, the <b><i>wavelength at maximum absorption</i></b> (&#x03BB;<sub><b>max</b></sub>) is quoted for each absorption.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Representative spectra shown in <a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a> demonstrate how increasing conjugation in a series of related structures gives rise to increase in the wavelength of maximum absorption (&#x03BB;<sub>max</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">As well as defining the lower wavelength limit of analysis, the solvent in which the UV spectrum is measured can have an effect on the position of &#x03BB;<sub>max</sub>. The <b><i>Franck-Condon principle</i></b> states that, during electronic excitation, atoms do not move, but electrons&#8212;including those of the solvent&#8212;may reorganize themselves. Most transitions lead to excited states which are <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy</a>more polarized than the ground state. If the solvent is polar, the excited state can be more readily stabilized by dipole-dipole interactions than the ground state. The reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap means that excitation occurs more readily than in apolar solvents, resulting in a 10&#8211;50 nm shift to longer wavelength (lower energy) in ethanol compared with hexane. Such shifts are referred to as <b><i>bathochromic shifts</i></b> or <b><i>red shifts</i></b> as the &#x03BB;<sub>max</sub> moves towards the red end of the spectrum.</p>

<p class="indent">Exceptions are those absorptions due to the n &#x2192; &#x03C0;* transition of carbonyl groups when the ground state can hydrogen-bond with solvents more readily than the excited state. Electronic excitation therefore requires more energy in hydrogen-bonding solvents compared with apolar solvents and, in these instances, the wavelength of light absorbed shows a shift of about 15 nm to shorter wavelength. This <b><i>hypsochromic shift</i></b> or <b><i>blue shift</i></b> is a consequence of the transition requiring higher energy electromagnetic radiation in a more polar solvent.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Recording and interpreting UV&#8211;vis spectra</h2>
<p class="noindent">UV spectroscopy gives two important pieces of information. One is the position of absorption (&#x03BB;<sub>max</sub> nm) which we have already encountered. This gives information on the energy (&#x0394;<i>E</i>) of the electronic excitation taking place and, as a result of a great number of empirical correlations, information on the actual chromophore responsible for the absorption.</p>
<p class="indent">The second value is the <b><i>molar absorptivity</i></b>, also known as the <b><i>molar extinction coefficient</i></b> (&#x03B5;). This value, which is a constant for a given molecule at a given wavelength, is a measure of the ease of the transition caused by the absorption of the radiation. If a particular electronic transition requiring a certain energy of incident radiation can take place readily then the light will be absorbed strongly and the &#x03B5; value will be high. If the transition does not occur readily then the &#x03B5; value will be low. Such electronic transitions are often distinguished as <b><i>allowed</i></b> and <b><i>forbidden</i></b> transitions (although for forbidden read &#8216;strongly disfavoured&#8217;) and may be predicted on the grounds of symmetry correlations of the ground state and excited state of the molecule. For example, &#x03C3; &#x2192; &#x03C3;* and &#x03C0; &#x2192; &#x03C0;* transitions are &#8216;allowed&#8217;; whereas n &#x2192; &#x03C0;* transitions are &#8216;forbidden&#8217;. However, for analysing UV&#8211;vis spectra we simply need to be aware that allowed processes have &#x03B5; values of greater than 10<sup>3</sup> and forbidden processes have &#x03B5; less than 100. Substituents which increase the extinction coefficient of the basic chromophore are said to have a<a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy</a> <b><i>hyperchromia effect</i></b> whereas those decreasing the extinction coefficient have a <b><i>hypochromic effect</i></b> (p. 19).</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;"><b><i>Hyperchromic</i></b> substituents increase the extinction coefficient.<br/><b><i>Hypochromic</i></b> substituents decrease the extinction coefficient.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Of course, comparison between &#x03B5; values for different compounds is only valid if the analyses are run with solutions at the same molarity, increasing the amount of sample present will naturally increase the ability of the solution to absorb incident radiation. The relationship between the molar absorptivity, &#x03B5;, and the concentration of chromophore (in mol L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) is expressed by the <b><i>Beer&#8211;Lambert Law</i>:</b></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2" style="width:110%;"><i>I<sub>0</sub></i> Intensity of incident light<br/><i>I</i> = intensity of transmitted light<br/>&#x03B5; = molar absorptivity<br/><i>c</i> = concentration in mol L<sup>-1</sup><br/><i>l</i> = path length of absorbing solution in cm.<br/><i>A</i> = <b><i>absorbance</i></b> = log(<i>I<sub>0</sub></i>/<i>I</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">The equation is often stated as:</p>

<p class="noindent">Note that the formula results in the molar absorptivity having the rather absurd units of cm<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> but, by convention, these are never stated.</p>
<p class="indent">UV&#8211;visible spectrometers record absorbance directly and the standard cuvette is designed to give a path length of 1 cm. Thus determination of &#x03B5; is a straightforward exercise as the equation becomes:</p>

<p class="center">&#x03B5; = <i>A/cl</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The derivation of this relationship assumes that all molecules contribute to absorption of the incident beam and that no absorbing molecule is in the shadow of another. For the sorts of very dilute concentrations used in UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy this is a valid assumption (<a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">The instrument</h3>

<figcaption style="width:100%;"><b>Fig. 2.8</b> Optical arrangement of a double beam UV&#8211;visible spectrometer (Adapted and reproduced with permission of Perkin Elmer).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">UV&#8211;visible spectrometers operate on the &#8216;double beam&#8217; principle, with one beam passing through the sample and the other passing through a reference cell (<a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>). The spectrometer has two lamps, one emitting light in the range 200&#8211;330 nm (UV) and the other in the range 330&#8211;700 nm (visible). The light emitted by the source first passes through a diffraction grating <b><i>monochromator</i>,</b> which breaks down the light into its component wavelengths in the same way as a prism. This light is then divided by curved mirror optics into two beams of equal intensity, one of which passes through the sample, the other through the reference <a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy</a>containing pure solvent. Each beam is then focused onto a <b><i>detector</i></b> which measures the ratio of the intensities of the two beams and the difference is automatically converted and plotted out as the absorbance. Instruments usually have a full scale deflection for <i>A</i> = 2, which means that the strongest ratio of <i>I</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>I</i> that the instrument can tolerate is 100.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Recording the spectrum</h3>
<p class="noindent">The UV spectrum of a compound is recorded as a dilute solution in a 1 cm<sup>2</sup> cross-section quartz cuvette (glass is opaque to UV below about 300 nm). The sample is placed in the analysis beam path and a matched cuvette containing pure solvent is placed in the reference beam path. The spectrometer records the difference in intensities of the radiation passing through each of the cuvettes in order to give a measure of the light absorbed by the dissolved substance under analysis. The substance must be soluble in the solvent, but thought must be given to any possible solvent shifts and &#8216;cut off due to solvent end absorption (<a href="#ch2.1">Section 2.1</a>). Frequently it may be necessary to record spectra over a range of different concentrations in order to bring various peak intensities within the measurable range of the spectrometer.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Appearance of the spectrum</h3>
<p class="noindent">Due to the presence of variously solvated and associated species, UV&#8211;visible spectra recorded in solution are generally poorly resolved and consist of one or more broad humps, sometimes with some poorly defined fine structure. Often peaks of different intensities will coalesce so that the smaller peak appears as a shoulder on the larger one.</p>
<p class="indent">Whilst in theory it should be possible to cancel out the solvent absorption, the detector cannot handle small differences in very large values and so erratic results tend to be observed at the 200&#8211;210 region which can be mistaken for peaks by the unwary. These spurious peaks can be easily detected as they do not diminish in height on diluting the sample and re-recording the spectrum; whereas genuine peaks will become progressively smaller. A discontinuity may be noticed in the trace at 330 nm when the radiation source switches from the UV lamp to the visible lamp and may be ignored.</p>

The major peak is termed the <b><i>K-band</i>.</b> The latter, forbidden absorption is called the <b><i>B-band</i></b> and shows fine structure due to excitation of vibrational energy levels due to &#8216;ring breathing&#8217; vibrations of the benzene ring; although the so called 0 &#x2192; 0 transition (the transition between the vibrational ground state levels of the electronic ground state and the excited state) is not observed within this set of peaks. However, substitution of the ring or the presence of a heteroatom in the ring, such as in pyridine, lowers the symmetry further and the 0 &#x2192; 0 transition is then observed.</p>
<p class="indent">Substituting the benzene ring with conjugated substituents (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>H or CH = CHCO<sub>2</sub>H) or electron donating groups (e.g. NR<sub>2</sub>, OR) extends the chromophore and results in a bathochromic shift of the peaks although generally not in a predictive manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Two special situations worthy of note occur with hydroxybenzenes (phenols) and aminobenzenes (anilines) as these show very characteristic behaviours on treatment with base and acid respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Adding base to a phenol causes a marked bathochromic (red) shift of the absorption maximum as the lone pair on the oxygen becomes more available for derealization into the aromatic nucleus (<a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>a).</p>

<p class="indent">Conversely anilines show a marked hypsochromic (blue) shift of the absorption maximum upon acidification as the lone pair is no longer available for derealization in the protonated anilinium species (<a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>b).</p>
<p class="indent">When electronically &#8216;complementary&#8217; substituents (in other words, when one group is mesomerically electron-donating, such as NH<sub>2</sub>, OH, OR, and one group is mesomerically electron-accepting, such as NO<sub>2</sub>, COR, CO<sub>2</sub>R) are present on the ring in a 1,4-relationship to each other, a very pronounced bathochromic shift and hyperchromic effect is noted on the main absorption band (<a href="#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">This effect is due to extension of the chromophore by resonance derealization across the aromatic ring. However, when complementary substituents are 1,2- or 1,3- to each other this bathochromic effect is not noticeable although the hyperchromic shift remains (<a href="#fig2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly with non-complementary substituents there is generally little bathochromic effect even when the groups have a 1,4-relationship (<a href="#fig2.14">Fig. 2.14</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of substituted aromatics possessing a carbonyl substituent and an electron donating substituent, rules have been formulated to predict the strongest band in the UV&#8211;vis spectrum (there are usually at least two peaks). These rules are given in <a href="Appendices.xhtml#app1">Appendix 1</a> (p. 88).</p>
