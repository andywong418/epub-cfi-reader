<h1 class="fmmain"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fm-no1">Despite the fact that many chemists and chemical engineers who work in the fine chemicals industry are involved in chemical process development, there are very few textbooks dealing with the subject. Two excellent recent texts cover the subjects of route selection and process optimisation from the viewpoint of the organic chemist. This Primer describes a complementary approach with an emphasis on understanding the physicochemical aspects of process optimisation and scale-up. It crosses the boundary between chemistry and chemical engineering, and seeks to show how these disciplines must be integrated to provide a comprehensive approach to the subject.</p>
<p class="fm-in">Two other Primers complement this text, and we commend them to those readers who find this volume useful.</p>
<p class="fm-in">We thank many of our colleagues for constructive criticism and ZENECA for providing such interesting employment and for permission to publish.</p>
