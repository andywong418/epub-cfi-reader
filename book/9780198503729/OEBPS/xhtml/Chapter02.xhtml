<h1 class="mainx">2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Strategy for process development</h1>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">In this Chapter some fundamental concepts and definitions relevant to process development are provided, and our framework for designing a process investigation is shown.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.1">
<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>A physicochemical approach to process development</h2>
<p class="noindent">Successful and efficient process development involves the study of a number of key aspects of the process, and allows design and development to be based on sound fundamental understanding rather than empirical rules of thumb. Key to achieving the objectives are an understanding of both the reaction and product recovery (workup) stages.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of the information required to understand the reaction stage can be gained by answering the following questions:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Reaction profiles</b> - how do the concentrations of reactants and products change during operation of the proposed process?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Pre-equilibria</b> - what equilibria affect the concentrations of the reacting species?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Competing reactions</b> - what are they, and what are their rates relative to that of the main reaction? What factors affect their rate?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span>What <b>impurities</b> are present in the starting materials and what is their fate in the process?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Reactor configuration</b> - what is preferred?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Bulk and micromixing effects</b> - is the chemical selectivity dependent on reactor mixing and dynamics?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>For multiphase systems</b> - What are the relevant distribution coefficients or solubilities? Is mass transfer or chemical reaction rate limiting? Is the agitation system providing adequate interfacial contact between the reacting phases?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Reaction modelling</b> - would a mathematical model help understanding?</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space"></span><b>Scale-up</b> - what additional understanding is necessary to ensure that the process will work on the manufacturing scale?</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.2">
<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reactor configuration</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the laboratory the most common method of conducting a reaction is to mix the reactants and wait for reaction to complete, often assisted by heating. This is termed batch, or sometimes &#x2018;all in&#x2019; batch operation (<a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>). There are two main reasons why this method may not be feasible on the large scale:</p>
<p class="numlist">1.<span class="space"></span>For an exothermic reaction it may not be possible to remove the heat safely. This will depend on the heat and rate of reaction, and on the heat <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a>removal capabilities of the vessel. Because the surface area : volume ratio is much less on the large scale (assuming same geometry), heat removal is likely to be much less efficient, unless special attention is paid to providing additional surface area.</p>
<p class="numlist">2.<span class="space"></span>If it is required to control a reaction parameter which changes as a result of chemical reaction e.g. pH in a reaction which generates acid, then a simple batch reaction is not the best way to proceed, because, in the event of any failure of the control or feed system, the reaction can no longer be controlled. In large scale chemistry it is essential that the chemist, not the chemicals, is in control.</p>
<p class="noindent">When, as is common, batch operation is not feasible, the preferred method of operation is to add one (or more) reagents over a period of time to the substrate which is already in the vessel This is known as <i>semi-batch </i>operation.</p>
<p class="indent">Choice of the order of addition is usually, but not always, fairly obvious. Where one reactant is unstable under the reaction conditions, but can be kept stable otherwise (a diazonium salt solution is one example), it should be kept under stable conditions and gradually fed to the reactor. If over reaction can occur by addition of one reagent to another, then the problem may be mitigated by reversing the order of addition.</p>
<p class="indent">An example is in the nitration of an organic substrate with nitric acid, using sulphuric acid to act as a desiccant in order to maintain the acidity of the reaction mass. Nitration reactions are widely used in the synthesis of aromatic amines. A typical example is shown in (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">They are highly exothermic reactions (&#x2206;H &#x007E; &#x2013;170 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and the adiabatic temperature rise is typically of the order of several hundred degrees. In order to achieve safe operation it is necessary to add the nitric acid slowly under conditions where it reacts immediately, so as to have a controlled heat output. Cooling is applied either to the reactor jacket, <i>via </i>an internal cooling coil, or both. With highly reactive substrates addition to the nitric acid is not possible: dinitration will usually occur, because the initially nitrated product is formed in the presence of a large excess of the nitrating species.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Batch or semi-batch reactors are very versatile, in the sense that they can be used for reactions with a wide range of chemical reaction rate constants, with the ability to carry out multiple consecutive operations in the same vessel. For this reason they are by far the most commonly used in multistage chemical manufacture. Continuous reactors may consist of a stirred vessel into which reactants are continuously fed and removed (<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>), a series of such vessels, or a pipe into which reactants are fed at one end usually via a <a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a>mixing device (<a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>). Where continuous reactors are used it is rare to have a multiproduct unit, because the residence time and mixing requirements usually vary too much to permit this, and because separate (although smaller) vessels are required for each separate process stage.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Yield, conversion and selectivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Conversion means the fraction or percentage of the charged raw material which is consumed in the reaction. Chemical selectivity is the proportion of desired product formed from a given amount of starting material converted. The yield of a chemical reaction is the fraction or percentage of the desired product based on the amount of starting material charged. Definitions are shown in <a href="#tab2.2">Table 2.2</a> for a reaction of <b>n</b> mols of starting material <b>A</b> which gives <b>p</b> mols of product <b>P</b> and <b>s</b> mols of by-product <b>S</b> (<a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reaction profiles</h2>
<p class="noindent">Reaction profiling is a very powerful tool in process development. It is the measurement of the composition of a reaction for the reactive components, intermediates and products as the reaction proceeds. There are several forms that this information can take, depending on the reactor configuration. For a batch reaction, concentration <i>vs </i>time profiles are determined. For semi-batch reactions, which usually involve relatively rapid reactions, the reactions are substantially complete by the time addition of the reagent is complete. In these cases, concentration changes are measured versus the amount of the reactant which has been added. For continuous reactions, either plug flow or continuous stirred tank, the variable is residence time. For processes which are strongly catalysed, understanding the nature of the catalyst throughout the process may be a key part of this work. Not infrequently many subtleties are uncovered which are undreamed of at the start of the investigation.</p>

<a id="page_7" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 7, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Some reaction profiles for batch reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some idealised examples of reaction profiles are shown in <a href="#fig2.5">Figures 2.5</a>, <a href="#fig2.6">2.6</a> and <a href="#fig2.7">2.7</a> for &#x2019;all-in&#x2019; (or batch) reactions. A simple case is a first order reaction proceeding cleanly to completion (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>). In this case, increasing the reactant concentration will have no effect on the time for a given proportion of the reactant to convert to product. This is rarely seen, but a second order reaction, where the rate is proportional to the concentration of each of two reactants is quite common. Second order reactions show a long &#x2018;tail&#x2019; (<a href="#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>), which in practice can be inconvenient. In this case, when equal concentrations of reactants are used, doubling the concentration will halve the time for a given fraction to react.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of quite a small excess of one component has a major effect on the time needed to complete a second order reaction (<a href="#tab2.3">Table 2.3</a>), and this technique is frequently used in order to achieve an acceptable reaction time, or, sometimes, to ensure that an expensive component is completely converted to product. The cheaper or more easily removable component will normally be used in excess.</p>

<p class="noindent">Over-reaction of a desired product due to an excess of the reagent might normally be expected to be seen towards the end of a reaction, but this can be difficult to see from a concentration/time profile. <a href="#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a> shows a typical example. Plotting the data in the form shown in <a href="#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a> can be more informative.</p>
<p class="indent">When a product is formed <i>via </i>an intermediate then some knowledge of the possible side reactions of the intermediate is needed. For example, catalytic reduction of a nitrile is a method of producing primary amines. The process goes <i>via </i>an intermediate imine which can be diverted to a secondary amine by reaction with the desired primary amine (<a href="#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>)</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Reaction profiles for semi-batch reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a reaction is being operated under semi-batch conditions, reaction is occurring during the addition of reactants. The concept of a reaction profile is therefore different from that described for batch reactions. Nonetheless, useful information can still be gained from sampling semi-batch reaction. Two techniques can be used.</p>

</aside>
<p class="noindentt"><i>Samples are taken at intervals throughout the addition and analysed</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is often found that the reaction selectivity changes throughout the addition of a reactant; this information can be just as useful as the reaction profiles shown for the batch reactions. These reaction profiles are plots of composition <i>vs </i>amount of reactant added.</p>
<p class="indent">By-product formed in parallel with the main product, such as an isomeric nitration product, will be found in constant ratio to the main product. <a href="#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a> shows this case.</p>
<p class="indent">A common occurrence is poor selectivity early on in the reactant addition, caused by some impurity in the component in the vessel. The profile is shown in <a href="#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>. For example, hydrolysis of a starting material due to a trace of water could be a cause of this problem. A consecutive reaction product formed by the further reaction of the desired product will normally increase only towards the end of the addition (component D in <a href="#fig2.11">Fig 2.11</a>), Unusual effects occur when the rate of <i>both </i>reactions are faster than the rate of mixing of the reactants. In this case by-product D will be seen throughout the reagent addition. This case could be confused with a parallel reaction but for the stoichiometry, which shows that something unusual is occurring. There is further discussion of this aspect in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Catalytic reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">For a reaction which only proceeds in the presence of a catalyst, an understanding of how the catalyst works can be of great assistance in process optimisation. For example, in a Kharasch addition catalysed by a redox metal couple the catalysis is provided by the low valent metal (<a href="#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>).<a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a></p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig2.12">
<img src="../images/Fig2.12.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.12</b> Catalytic cycle in a Kharasch reaction</figcaption></figure>
<p class="noindent">The redox cycle is broken by side reactions such as radical dimerisation which means that the metal is gradually transformed from the catalytic low-valent state to the higher oxidation state, which is inactive as a catalyst. Once this is understood, methods can be found to ensure that a sufficient proportion of the metal remains in the low-valent state e.g. by adding a reducing agent.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Sampling</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to get useful information about a process it is necessary to take samples which represent the state of the reaction under investigation. This might seem obvious, but quench procedures need to be carefully thought out so as not to change the composition in a significant way. It is important not to put the samples through a workup procedure which could remove some components. It may not be possible to diagnose the state of a reaction mass reliably if, for example, the product is crystallised and isolated before analysis, as the isolation itself may remove impurities.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.5">
<h2 class="h2">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Purification and Work-up</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is a tendency to focus attention on the reaction stages in order to provide a high yield or highly selective process. The science involved in developing efficient workup processes is less familiar to many development chemists and engineers. Clearly a high selectivity is important. Minimising by-product formation keeps materials costs down and reduces waste which usually requires disposal to effluent treatment. In complex organic synthesis, a high conversion is also often important to achieve a high yield because of the difficulty of separating the reagents from the products, and recovering them for recycle. However, it should not be assumed that this is <i>always </i>the case. In large tonnage petrochemical and inorganic chemical manufacture high selectivity and low conversion are common with feed separation and recycle, particularly in continuous operation.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>To isolate or not?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a chemical route to a complex organic molecule is invented by a research department, it will commonly have a large number of reaction stages, with purification of intermediates following each reaction stage. This is necessary because the reaction stages will not have been optimised. At each <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a>reaction stage there could be a large number of by-products produced by the large number of potentially reactive sites on the molecule, which complicates the separation. Many species present will be of unknown composition and may well have similar properties to the desired reaction product. The challenge for the development team is to produce a robust and operable <i>total process </i>to manufacture to the desired purity. The process includes all stages, both reaction and isolation, and should achieve the optimum cost. Note that the cost includes equipment (capital), materials and equally important, the cost of waste treatment. The process will also have to be registered under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulations and will therefore have strict limitations imposed upon allowable emissions.</p>
<p class="indent">It will therefore be important to <i>minimise </i>the number of purification stages as generally they produce waste streams for treatment or recovery, require a lot of expensive equipment and intermediate storage. They also almost invariably introduce a yield loss. It is not possible to give general guidance on when to use intermediate isolation. <i>The key to an informed decision is an understanding of the effect of impurities on downstream stages. </i>However it can be stated that, as opposed to route invention, the norm in development would be <i>not </i>to isolate unless absolutely necessary. The exception would be when deliberately using reaction conditions which give a low conversion, possibly to achieve a high selectivity, which would then require separation of reaction products and unreacted feeds for recycle.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Selection of isolation technology</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A key part of process development is selection of the best isolation technology and the development of the isolation stages to be robust, cost effective and operable at full scale. The most common isolation technique used in research or route invention is crystallisation, often from a solvent, followed by filtration, washing and possibly further recrystallisation. Whilst it is a good technique for producing high purity, particularly with multiple recrystallisations and multiple solvents, it is one of the more expensive. It requires a lot of equipment, potentially incurs considerable yield loss and generates significant quantities of effluent or waste streams for treatment. Multiple crystallisation and washing also involves handling solids which is potentially problematic at large scale.</p>
<p class="indent">For robust operation, it is preferred to avoid handling solids, because solids handling equipment generally involves a lot of mechanical machinery which will require maintenance, large scale equipment trials and some uncertainty in how it will perform at full scale. The uncertainty comes from the interaction between the solid properties and the equipment performance. For example, the ability of a material to wash free of impurities will depend upon the physical form, which can be difficult to predict from small scale experiments. It could therefore be possible to have a very simple crystallisation in the laboratory followed by a filtration on a filter paper and a wash with solvent from a wash bottle, whereas at full scale the form produced could be very difficult to separate on realistic sized equipment, require extreme amounts of solvent to wash and involve a large yield loss.<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 2 Strategy for process development</a></p>

<p class="indent">In order of preference from the point of view of equipment cost, robustness of operation, and potential for yield loss and generation of effluent, the preferred common isolation technologies are shown in <a href="#tab2.4">Table 2.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several other isolation and purification technologies which can be useful in specific circumstances. Membranes can achieve separation by molecular size, for solutes, or particle size for suspensions and colloids. Adsorption and chromatography achieve selectivity in the same way as analytical chromatography, by selective molecular interaction with the adsorbent. Absorption can achieve selectivity from a gaseous or vapour phase by selective dissolution in the absorbing liquid.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Final product purification</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The product will be required to meet a specification, which will be determined by the samples submitted for registration with the appropriate authorities. The specification will include reference to the chemical composition but may well also include physical aspects of the product, for example, in the case of a solid, polymorphic form and particle size. The registration could be based on samples generated for clinical trials, application trials or toxicological testing. It is important during development not to base the specification on samples which are unrealistically pure, Setting a specification which is more pure than the application requires may make it very difficult to manufacture in-specification product at full scale.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier comments concerning technology selection apply to also to the final product purification. In this case however, it is likely that a combination of a number of technologies will be required to meet all aspects of the specification. When the product is a solid, a significant amount of attention will have to be paid to ensuring that the physical aspects of the specification are achievable. Pilot scale equipment trials will probably be required. These trials will require a significant amount of product and must be planned well in advance, especially for a multi-stage synthesis, in order that the material can be made available within the timescale of the development programme.</p>
