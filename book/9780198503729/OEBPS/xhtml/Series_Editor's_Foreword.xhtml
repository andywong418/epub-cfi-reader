<p class="fm-no1">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognised as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fm-in">In this Physical Chemistry Primer John Atherton and Keith Carpenter present an introductory account of the physicochemical basis of process development. The primer clearly explains and illustrates the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is vital knowledge for any would-be practising industrial chemist. This Primer will be of interest to all students of science (and their mentors).</p>
