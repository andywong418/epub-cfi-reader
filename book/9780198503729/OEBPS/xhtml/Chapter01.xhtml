<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The focus of this book is on the development of manufacturing processes for fine chemicals: those complex organic chemicals required as intermediates or active ingredients for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals or &#x2018;specialty&#x2019; chemicals. <a href="#fig1.1">Figs 1.1</a>&#x2013;<a href="#fig1.4">1.4</a> show some examples of the types of compounds which are made. Process development is an essential part of the chain of events preceding the introduction of a new chemical product to the market place. It is the link between the research department, who discover the new compound, and the manufacturing departments, who make the product for sale.</p>

<p class="noindent">Process development has a number of objectives.</p>
<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space">&#160;</span>Converting a research synthesis into a viable manufacturing process.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">In the discovery of new products the chemists involved will make their compounds by whichever synthetic route is most convenient on the laboratory scale. This may involve the use of several techniques which may not be economic on the manufacturing scale. Examples of such techniques include the use of expensive reagents such as metal hydrides, the use of solvents which are toxic or difficult to recover, chromatographic separations, and multiple solvent extractions. Typically, many thousands of compounds will be synthesised during the discovery phase for each one which reaches the development stage. Design of the synthesis at the discovery stage will not take into account materials costs, yield, equipment capital costs, nor the amount and nature of waste material generated. Direct implementation for manufacture of the &#x2018;discovery route&#x2019; will rarely be possible. Costs of materials and capital cost requirements will probably be much too high to be economic, and the quantity of effluent will probably be unacceptable. It is the job of the process development chemist to chose the most cost effective route for the selected compounds, and to develop the chosen route to give a process which meets a range of requirements. Process development is thus a key part of the product development strategy. It makes the difference between having a synthesis which is commercially viable rather than one which is not. Skilled process development can also result in materials savings, over the lifetime of a large product, in the region of &#x00A3;0.1&#x2013;1Bn <i>vs</i> direct implementation of the processes used at the product discovery stage.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Major financial savings result from expert process development.</p></aside>
<p class="indent">A manufacturing process must meet financial, environmental, health and safety targets in order to be viable. Quality is of primary importance. It is <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 The scope of process development</a>essential that product meets the specification defined by the user, otherwise it will be unsaleable. The projected materials costs will be based on yields estimated from the laboratory development work. For the product to be a financial success these yields must then be achieved on the full scale. The operating cost and sales volume will be based on a plant design capacity. In order to achieve the design capacity and meet forecast demand, the process must operate in a trouble free manner. It must be capable of routine operation without intervention by skilled chemists. Safety and health targets based on legislation and corporate standards must be met. Process effluent must be kept to a minimum and rendered acceptable for disposal.</p>
<p class="indent">Process development for a new product usually starts after a chemical route to a required compound has been selected, but the procedure can be iterative, in that improved process understanding may lead to improved performance and thus influence the relative merits of alternative manufacturing routes.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The approach to process development</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to be able to optimise processes on the laboratory and manufacturing scale, the scientists involved in process development must have an appreciation of the physico-chemical principles underlying synthesis. The topics discussed here are only part of the total work needed to take a process from laboratory to full scale. The development is an interdisciplinary activity involving a team of chemists and chemical engineers. This team will have very many aspects to consider, including: costs and supply of raw materials; toxicity and safe handling of materials and product; specification of the most cost effective equipment; specification and testing of materials of construction; evaluation of chemical and operational hazards and specification of safety protection systems; minimising the waste material generated, and defining the recycle, safe disposal or destruction of such waste as is produced; design and costing of the process plant; as well as resource planning of people, laboratory equipment and semi-technical scale equipment trials. It is hardly surprising that, faced with this seeming mountain of topics which are not related to the science of the process, finding time to think about the intricacies of the process chemistry can be difficult. This Primer is intended to provide a framework for thinking about the science underlying process development.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Statistical design in process development</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Statistical techniques are widely used in process development. This involves design of a set, or sets, of experiments in which those variables which are considered to be important are systematically changed. Analysis of the results permits identification of the most important variables and of the optimum processing conditions. Acceptance of the need for the technique admits that the variables contributing to process performance are insufficiently understood to permit a process design from first principles. For the statistical approach to be effective the relevant parameters must be investigated. A knowledge of the physicochemical principles underlying the process is of great help in selecting the variables to be evaluated in a statistically designed set of experiments.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>A &#x2018;total technology&#x2019; output</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The output from the process development exercise is a <i>total process</i>. It includes handling feed materials, reaction stages, purifications, recycles, treatment of waste streams, and possibly product formulation, packaging and storage. The focus of this Primer is on the chemical transformations and product isolations which are at the heart of process performance and where solutions to many of the problems require constant interaction between chemical engineers and chemists. It is intended to contribute to bridging the knowledge gap between the synthetic chemists and the chemical engineers involved in process development. If it helps them to understand each others priorities and expertise, and to see the solution to a problem as a shared objective, it will have gone a long way to achieving its goals.</p>
