<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">A laboratory multi - stage synthesis will often start from purified materials and include isolation and purification of intermediates at each stage. In contrast, in order to reduce waste for treatment and to contain equipment costs within reasonable limits, an industrial process will have fewer isolation stages and operate with crude intermediates as far as possible. The most popular isolation technique in a laboratory process is multiple crystallisation. At full scale crystallisation is still a very common technique, but by no means always the best. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#tab2.4">Table 2.4</a> lists the most common isolation technologies, distillation, liquid extraction, precipitation and crystallisation with comments. In this chapter they are discussed in turn. They are not described in detail, but the basic principles are explained in order to highlight the important issues and provide guidance for process development.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec9.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>9.1 Distillation</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Distillation is a very good purification technique, where applicable, but there are often reasons why it cannot be applied. The basic requirements for a good separation are:</p>
<p class="numlist">1.<span class="space"></span>A significant difference in volatility between the product and the impurities to be separated. A good indicator is difference in boiling point, a difference of the order of 15 &#x00B0;C is required.</p>
<p class="numlist">2.<span class="space"></span>The distillation temperature and pressure are easily achievable. The upper temperature limit will often be set by the thermal decomposition or potential instability of the mixture. Temperatures in excess of 300&#x00B0;C would not normally be encountered in fine chemicals distillation. Pressures are usually between 20 bar pressure and 30 mbar vacuum.</p>
<p class="numlist">3.<span class="space"></span>The bottom product (heavy) is a liquid at the distillation temperature and pressure. It is possible to operate with a solid or high viscosity bottoms product, but considerably more difficult.</p>
<p class="numlist">4.<span class="space"></span>The mixture does not form an azeotrope at a composition between the starting mixture and the purity to be achieved.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">An azeotrope is a mixture where the vapour has the same composition as the liquid, therefore on boiling, the composition will not change.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the product has a high boiling point, distillation under vacuum or steam stripping are often used and are described in the following sections.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h4 class="main3"><i>Basic principles</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The basis for distillation is that when a mixture is boiled, the vapour is richer in the more volatile, light components and the liquid richer in the less volatile heavies. The simplest form of distillation would have the mixture in a still, the vapours condensed and collected and the residue retained in the still. If the difference in volatility between the product and impurities is narrow, fractional distillation will be required. If the vapour is condensed and the resulting liquid reboiled, the vapour will be richer again in lights and so on. <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Chapter 9 Product isolation and work-up</a>The normal representation is illustrated in <a href="#fig9.1">Fig. 9.1</a>, for the simple case of a binary mixture, in this example benzene and toluene.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The mole fraction of light component in the vapour (benzene) is plotted against the mole fraction in the liquid. This is the vapour - liquid equilibrium line. The illustration is for a simple ideal case. The steps show the path followed by taking the vapour from point <b>A</b>, condensing it, then vapourising that liquid and collecting the vapour, then condensing, reboiling again until reaching point <b>B</b>, the purified light component.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice the consecutive vapourisation and condensation is achieved in a column, illustrated in <a href="#fig9.2">Fig. 9.2</a>. The vapour passes upwards and the liquid downwards. Industrial columns are usually in the range 0.3 to 10m diameter and 3m up to 75m high. The equilibrium between the liquid and vapour is achieved at each stage throughout the column height by mixing caused by packing or trays. There are many different designs of internals suitable for the whole range of operating conditions, throughput rates and materials. The degree of purification achievable is determined by the number of equivalent equilibrium stages, called theoretical stages, and the amount of condensed overhead vapour returned down the column, the reflux. The height of packing or the number of real trays can be related to the number of theoretical stages required.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest separation is a boil over from a still. This has one stage, no packing and no reflux. Columns for more difficult separations can have many stages, for example 20 to 30 would not be uncommon, and can have a high <i>reflux ratio</i>, up to 25.</p>

<p class="indent">Distillations can be batch or continuous. Very large scale petrochemical operations are continuous. Smaller scale production, less than around 1000 -2000 te an<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> tends to be batch. A continuous column will operate at steady state. It will produce top and bottom product streams and have the feed at an intermediate position part way up the column. Intermediate product streams may also be taken off at different column heights when separating a complex mixture.</p>
<p class="indent">The focus of this primer is on complex organic chemical manufacture which normally will use batch operation because of the relatively low production rates. A batch distillation will start with the batch charge in the still. The batch will be heated to boiling and the vapour passed up the column to contact with the liquid reflux returning. The top product, called the distillate, is taken off as illustrated. Initially the distillate will be rich in the light components, gradually containing more of the high boilers as the distillation progresses. Similarly the concentration of heavies in the reboiler and the reboiler temperature will rise. There are several ways to operate the column. It can operate at constant distillate purity but reducing distillate rate, by increasing the reflux ratio, or constant rate but accepting increasing higher boilers in the distillate at constant reflux. Intermediate purity products can also be taken.</p>

In this example the reflux ratio is 15 and there are 7 theoretical stages required to produce a distillate exceeding 90% benzene from a mixture of 10% benzene in toluene. As the batch distillation proceeds, for the example of constant reflux, the operating line retains the same slope, but gradually moves to the left as the benzene content in the reboiler reduces. The benzene content in the distillate will fall. For the case of increasing reflux ratio, the benzene content in the distillate will remain constant, but the slope of the operating line will increase to approach the 45&#x00B0; line as the distillate rate reduces. At this point the column is at total reflux, the reflux ratio is infinite and there is no distillate offtake.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Steam stripping</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">For organics which are immiscible with water a useful technique to reduce the distillation temperature is to use steam stripping, by injecting steam or water directly into the still. This is an alternative to applying vacuum to reduce the temperature, but works in the same way, by reducing the partial pressure of the organic vapour. In the example, the mixture of 90% toluene, 10% benzene, would boil at 106&#x00B0;C at atmospheric pressure, but with steam injected, the mixture will boil at 82.3&#x00B0;C Steam and the benzene rich vapour would be taken over the top, condensed to form two liquid phases and the lighter organic phase separated by gravity.</p>

This system has an azeotrope at the composition <i>x<sub>A</sub></i>, where the liquid and vapour have the same composition. <i>A mixture exhibiting azeotropic behaviour cannot be separated by a simple distillation</i> as the vapour and liquid will reach the same composition and further boiling has no effect. More complex distillation schemes involving other added components or changes in pressure are required.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Laboratory practice</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Vapour - liquid equilibrium data are often not available for complex organic molecules and must be estimated, often by methods based on structure and group contribution. As well as the uncertainty in the vapour pressure for the individual compounds, there can be interactions between them which cause deviations from ideal behaviour for the mixture. It is therefore usually necessary to carry out laboratory experiments to determine or confirm the equilibrium data. A simple boil-over test is often sufficient, boiling a sample and collecting samples of the overhead vapour. The liquid in equilibrium in the still can be sampled or the composition calculated by mass balance. For operation under vacuum, it is necessary to set up a sampling system which will allow the distillate to be sampled without affecting the column pressure. <i>It is also necessary to ensure no reflux, by lagging the apparatus extremely well or even heating the vapour offtake</i>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.2 Liquid extraction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Liquid extraction operates by the selective partition of the material to be separated into an immiscible phase which can then be separated, usually by gravity but also possibly by centrifugation. The solvent selection will be based on the equilibrium partition and the ability to separate. The equilibrium partition and the effects of pH, salts and phase transfer catalysts are described in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The ease of separation can be affected by the physical properties and the equipment design, as described in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. A number of simple rules of thumb summarised in <a href="#tab9.1">Tables 9.1</a> and <a href="#tab9.2">9.2</a> should prove useful:</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">For a good separation, it is obviously essential for the solvent to be immiscible. Godfrey (1972), Chemtech, June, 359, has provided a simple approach to predicting miscibility from a miscibility number, which can be a useful indicator.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Multi-stage extraction</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">For materials which do not partition well, multi-stage extraction can be used. The normal technique for designing a multi-stage extraction unit would either be a column or a series of mixer - settlers, operated semi-continuously. The mixer settler system is more robust and has greater flexibility. <a href="#fig9.6">Fig. 9.6</a> is a schematic of a mixer - settler unit with 2 stages.

Monochlorobenzene is heavier than water, hence the lower front is produced by water drops settling upwards, leaving clear liquid behind. The upper front is created by water drops coalescing with the interface. The shapes of the coalescing and settling &#x201C;fronts&#x201D; are quite distinctive. The slopes of the lines are used to design the large scale unit, by ensuring that the superficial velocity of the dispersed phase at full scale, i.e flowrate /cross sectional area, is lower than the settling velocity determined from the slope of the fronts from the laboratory test.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.3 Crystallisation and precipitation</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Crystallisation is probably the most well known and common laboratory technique for purifying materials. The material can be crystallised from solution or from a melt. For solution it will be driven by causing the concentration in solution to exceed the solubility, either by removing solvent, for example by evaporation, or by reducing the solubility, for example by cooling or by changing the chemical nature of the material to be isolated to a less soluble form, or by changing the nature of the solvent. For melt it will be driven by taking the material to a temperature below the melting point. The objective is to leave the impurities behind in solution or a melt phase and separate off the purified solid.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually the pure crystalline solid is separated by filtration or centrifugation, washed and often dried. The objectives of the crystallisation are therefore to produce a solid of the right purity and of a particle size, size distribution and morphology which can be separated and washed easily. Usually this means a narrow size distribution of regular crystals with similar dimensions on all planes and preferably no smaller than 20 to 50 &#x03BC;m (Wood (1997)). <i>Thin plate-like crystals and very small particles will not separate at all well</i>.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Basic principles</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Crystallisation involves two processes, nucleation and growth. Nucleation is the formation of small particles, nuclei, which then grow into larger crystals. The number of nuclei formed determines the number of crystals formed which will grow (primary crystals), thus control of nucleation is essential for control of the crystal size and distribution. The final population of solid particles can contain both primary crystals and crystal fragments generated by attrition, breaking fragments from existing crystals. Therefore control or prevention of attrition is also necessary for control of the particle size.</p>
<p class="indent">Nucleation can occur without any crystals present, known as <i>primary nucleation</i>, or derived from existing crystals, <i>secondary nucleation</i>. Primary nucleation can be homogeneous, caused purely by molecules coming together in the liquid state, or heterogeneous caused by insoluble impurities or foreign <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 9 Product isolation and work-up</a>bodies even trace quantities, or by a suitable surface. An important concept in controlling nucleation in any crystallisation is the <i>metastable zone</i> illustrated in <a href="#fig9.8">Fig. 9.8</a>. A solution at point A, when cooled will begin to supersaturate at the solubility curve, point B. On continued cooling it will not crystallise, but will increase in super saturation up to point C where nucleation begins. Similarly a more dilute solution, point D, will begin to nucleate at a lower temperature, at point E. The curve passing through C and E is the boundary of the metastable zone. This is not a well defined boundary, as the onset of nucleation is very difficult to define and can be rather unpredictable. However, it is very important to understand that <i>a supercooled or supersaturated system can exist in a thermodynamically unstable state without crystallising, even for many years</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">It is also important to appreciate the effect of cooling rate on nucleation, hence particle size. A solution rapidly cooled to point F, will have had very little time, if any, for growth, hence will nucleate at F with a very high level of supersaturation. This will result in an extremely high number of nuclei, therefore a very large number of very small crystals, which may produce a high viscosity slurry or be totally unsuitable for separation. Similarly, a large number of nuclei formed by reaching the metastable zone boundary rapidly and continuing to cool can lead to multiple nucleation events, illustrated in <a href="#fig9.9">Fig. 9.9</a>. Conversely a slow cooling rate will allow the nuclei first formed to grow, hence the concentration in the liquid phase to fall, resulting in a very controlled degree of supersaturation and a small number of large crystals. The ideal cooling profile for controlled growth of the largest particles is to control the degree of supersaturation within the boundary of the metastable zone, <a href="#fig9.10">Fig. 9.10</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The nucleation rate increases as the undercooling increases, but not without limit. It reaches a maximum and then falls off again, as the viscosity of the system and the mobility of the molecules reduces at low temperatures (<a href="#fig9.11">Fig. 9.11</a>). It is therefore possible for some materials to form an amorphous glassy state. Glass itself is the most common example, but large organic molecules are also prone to this behaviour.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondary nucleation takes place when crystals are present in the system and can occur at much lower supersaturation than is the case for primary nucleation. It can be also more reproducible and leads to the practise of seeding a supersaturated crystallisation mass to induce nucleation and growth. For a mixture of similar molecules, it is possible to induce nucleation of one species, for example one isomer in the presence of another, by seeding, and allow separation by crystallisation.</p>
<p class="indent">Crystal growth proceeds by the inclusion of material from the liquid phase into the crystal lattice. For a solution, the rate depends on the area available to grow on, the temperature and the level of supersaturation. There is also an effect of mass transfer resistance around the crystals. For a melt, the driving force is the degree of supercooling. There is also a heat transfer resistance to removing the heat of crystallisation from the surface region. In practise in both systems, growth is generally represented by overall growth rate equations which allow the overall rate of mass deposition per unit area to be calculated.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>The effect of impurities</i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The very purpose of the crystallisation is to leave the impurities behind in the liquid phase. However, it is not uncommon for some specific impurities to be included in the growing crystal. In particular, <i>molecules which have the same functional groups and similar shape to parts of the crystallising material can tend to be included</i>. There is an obvious implication for the ability to achieve the desired purity, if a key impurity is included. A simple laboratory procedure to establish whether this is the case is to take <i>well washed</i> crystals, analyse them and establish which impurities are present at high levels relative to others and relative to their concentration in the liquor. It is also possible for relatively insoluble impurities to supersaturate and crystallise in their own right, forming a mixture of crystals rather than being included in a single crystal form. Microscopy should reveal whether there is more than one crystal form present. A knowledge of the relative solubilities is a good indicator. An analysis of the solid phase through time in a batch crystallisation should reveal whether there is a rapid appearance of the impurity, indicating nucleation in its own right and a comparison of the solid composition with liquor should reveal whether it appears upon exceeding a solubility limit.</p>

<h4 class="main3"><i>Crystal form</i></h4>
<p class=" noindent">Impurities can also have a very serious effect on crystal form. <a href="#fig9.12">Fig. 9.12</a> illustrates the effect of different linear growth rate at different crystal faces on shape. The organisation of the molecules within the crystal lattice causes each face to be dominated by different functional groups. Impurities can therefore interact specifically with one face, inhibiting growth in one plane but not in others. The result can be a change of crystal shape, for example from cubes to plates or needles. In this way a separation which may have been rapid with regular crystals formed from pure material, may become impossible with even trace quantities of growth inhibiting impurities present. A full scale process will be more prone to generating impurities, and therefore the process development must involve a study of the effects of potential impurities on crystal growth.</p>
