<h1 class="main">6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Homochiral thromboxane antagonists</h1>
<p class="noindent">The earlier series of thromboxane antagonists had been developed as racemates (still retaining the <i>cis</i> relative stereochemistry about the dioxan ring) mainly due to the fact that whilst ICI 192605 racemate is a highly crystalline solid, the active single (&#8211;) enantiomer is a non-crystalline oil. This would give rise to obvious purification and formulation difficulties.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Racemic and single enantiomer pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p class="noindent">Pharmaceutical compounds are designed to interact beneficially with living biological systems. Biological systems are homochiral, being made up from homochiral amino acids and sugars. It therefore follows that different enantiomers are likely to have different biological effects. Broadly three types of activity are observed.</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li style="width:70%;">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>All the desired activity resides in one enantiomer; the opposite enantiomer is inactive. This is a commonly observed effect. It follows therefore that separation of the racemate into a single enantiomer should lead to a more potent pharmaceutical agent, which in principle is also less toxic.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Enantiomers differ in potency. This also is a fairly commonly observed effect. Most of the activity resides in one enantiomer, and the opposite enantiomer exhibits weaker activity. This is explained by some binding, but weaker binding, occurring between the active biological site and the less active enantiomer.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">(c)<span class="space">&#160;</span>Both enantiomers are equipotent. This is rarely observed and not expected since activity depends on the pharmaceutical agent interacting with a homochiral biological site. It is usually indicative of in vivo racemisation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Thus there is a strong case in terms of potency and toxicity to develop pharmaceutical agents as single enantiomers.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch6.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.1 Separation at end of synthesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is often performed in the research laboratory to obtain small samples of both enantiomers to enable the relative biological activity to be assessed. It is normally achieved by classical resolution techniques. For example by formation of a diastereoisomeric salt with a homochiral base, recrystallis-ation of the salt to achieve high enantiomeric purity and then regeneration of the free homochiral acid.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The racemate contains only 50% of the required enantiomer and losses occur during the separation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">From a manufacturing viewpoint, this is a very wasteful technique at the end of a multi-stage synthesis. Often it is not possible to racemise and re-use the unwanted enantiomer particularly if the molecule contains more than one stereogenic centre. Thus to obtain 1 kg of pure enantiomer requires synthesis of approximately 3 kg racemate.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch6.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.2 Resolution at the start of the synthesis.</h3>
<p class="noindent">Separation into enantiomers is achieved at the start or early in the synthesis and the homochiral molecule obtained is then elaborated into the final single enantiomer product. This is more efficient than separation at the end of a synthesis.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Inversion of the sign of optical rotation occurs during the reduction stage to lactol. The absolute stereochemistry is <i>not</i> affected.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the previous it was shown that 2-methoxyphenylparaconic acid could be resolved into enantiomers by formation of a salt with (+) ephedrine. Re-crystallisation of the salt, followed by regeneration of the free acid gave enantiomerically pure (+) -<i>trans</i>-2-methoxyphenylparaconic acid, which was subsequently taken through the synthesis to give the (&#8211;) isomer of ICI 192605 as a non-crystalline oil.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch6.2.3">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.3 Incorporation of a homochiral fragment</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is an effective method if a suitable homochiral molecule is commercially available or is readily available from natural sources. Synthetic peptides are synthesised from naturally occurring (S)-amino acid fragments.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">This is exemplified in full in 9.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">ICI D7114 was developed within ICI as a potential anti-obesity agent. The synthesis used (R)-glycidyl butyrate to introduce the homochirality into the molecule.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch6.2.4">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.4 Use of a homochiral auxiliary</h3>
<p class="noindent">The principle of the method is to introduce a homochiral auxiliary fragment into the substrate prior to the chemical reaction which forms a new stereocentre. The homochiral auxiliary is then removed (and possibly reused). The residual molecule containing the new stereogenic centre is then<a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, 6 Homochiral thromboxane antagonists</a> elaborated into the desired homochiral target molecule. This method is illustrated in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch6.2.5">
<h3 class="h3">6.2.5 Use of a homochiral catalyst</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is similar to the use of a homochiral auxiliary except that the homochiral active site is regenerated in situ to enable further conversion to take place, e.g. catalytic Sharpless epoxidations, Noyori catalytic reduction of keto-esters etc.</p>

<h3 class="h3">6.3.2 Resolution of the pyridylparaconic acid</h3>
<p class="noindent">Synthesis of the (&#177;) pyridylparaconic acid <a href="#fig6.10"><b>6.10</b></a> and <a href="#fig6.10"><b>6.11</b></a> was achieved using a modified Perkin reaction from 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and succinic anhydride. Magnesium chloride and triethylamine is used to generate the enolate from succinic anhydride. Two equivalents of magnesium chloride are necessary; one to complex with the pyridine nitrogen and the second to complex with succinic anhydride. Only the required <i>trans</i> isomer crystallises from the reaction.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">See <a href="Chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The planned approach was to resolve the pyridylparaconic acid into separate enantiomers. Both the acidic carboxyl group and the basic pyridine nitrogen offer the possibility of salt formation with a homochiral acid or base. The separated required enantiomer would then be taken through the route successfully used to make the previous compounds such as ICI 192605.</p>

<p class="indent">However it proved impossible to achieve separation of the pyridylcarboxylic acid into its enantiomers, using a wide range of homochiral acids or bases.

<h3 class="h3">6.3.3 Octenedioic acid route</h3>
<p class="noindent">The research route used an Evans homochiral aldol reaction to achieve the correct relative stereochemistry about the dioxan ring and correct absolute stereochemistry. It was not possible to use the route on a large scale because of the ozonolysis required to generate the aldehyde for the Wittig reaction<a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, 6 Homochiral thromboxane antagonists</a> and also because of the chromatography to separate the 15% <i>trans</i> isomer from the required <i>cis</i> alkene.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of <i>cis</i> oetenedioic acid <a href="#fig6.12"><b>6.13</b></a> solved both these difficulties, by introducing the <i>cis</i> alkenoic acid top side chain at the start of the synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>cis</i>-Cyclo-octadiene <a href="#fig6.12"><b>6.12</b></a> contains the required <i>cis</i> stereochemistry and may be oxidised in low yield (ca 20%) to <i>cis</i> oetenedioic acid <a href="#fig6.12"><b>6.13</b></a> using chromium trioxide.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
