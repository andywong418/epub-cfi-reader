<h1 class="main">10<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reagents for large-scale operation</h1>
<p class="noindent">The previous chapters have covered examples of many different types of reaction and synthetic reagents which have successfully been operated on a large scale. Often the choice of a particular reagent is governed by many factors in addition to the obvious ones of yield and selectivity (purity of the product). Cost, availability, ease of disposal of residues, safety, reaction conditions, and solvent compatibility all need to be considered before use of the reagent on a large scale.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1">
<h2 class="h2">10.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Solvent</h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Solvent recovery is increasingly desirable on environmental as well as cost grounds.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Ideally a single solvent should be used for a chemical reaction This facilitates the charging of the solvent to the reactor and simplifies the operations if recovery and re-use are to be considered. The desirable properties of a solvent used for large scale are :</p>
<p class="indent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Solubility of reactants</p>
<p class="indent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chemical inertness to the reagents being used</p>
<p class="indent">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ease of isolation of the product</p>

<p class="indent">It is unlikely that a solvent which satisfies all these criteria will be available and the final choice is of necessity a compromise.</p>

<h3 class="h3">10.1.1 Water</h3>  
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2">Sometimes water can be advantageously used in a two-phase system with a phase transfer catalyst.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This solvent fulfils many of the above criteria and ideally should be used wherever possible. However relatively few organic substrates are sufficiently soluble in water and many synthetic reagents react with and are decomposed by water.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.2">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.2 Toluene</h3> 
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Toluene is attacked by halogenation and electrophilic reagents.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Toluene is readily available, cheap and easily recovered by simple distillation. In general it is chemically inert to many reagents and many organic substrates and reagents have adequate solubility in toluene. For many reactions it is an ideal solvent. It is a suitable replacement for benzene (a human carcinogen), which surprisingly is still used in research laboratories.</p>

<a id="page_77" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 77, 10 Reagents for large-scale operation</a>
<h3 class="h3">10.1.3 Methyl t-butyl ether</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2">Methyl t-butyl ether can be cleaved by acidic reagents. Grignard reactions are not possible due to cleavage by the magnesium halides.</p> 
</aside>  
<p class="noindent">This solvent is now very widely available due to its extensive use in lead-free petrol. It is of similar polarity to diethyl ether and many organic substances have high solubility in it, making it ideal both as a reaction medium and as an extraction solvent. It is relatively inert towards formation of peroxides.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.4">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.4 Ethyl acetate</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2"><i>n</i>-Butyl acetate is more stable and can often be used advantageously.</p>
</aside>                                                
<p class="noindent">Ethyl acetate is often used as a solvent for extracting a product from an aqueous phase, due to its relatively high polarity and the high solubility of organic products. It is slowly cleaved by both aqueous acid and alkali, so caution is necessary in large-scale use due to the longer times necessary for work up of a reaction. When used as an extraction solvent from an aqueous phase, the ethyl acetate layer typically contains ca 5% water. The consequences of this need to be considered when the solvent extract is concentrated; the water can cause hydrolysis to acetic acid and damage to acid sensitive products.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.5">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.5 Methanol</h3>
<p class="noindent">Methanol is cheap, readily available, readily recovered, and many substrates are very soluble. It is however reactive to many reagents and is somewhat toxic.</p>
</section>

<h3 class="h3">10.1.6 Ethanol</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is possible to use ethanol on a large scale providing Customs and Excise regulations are complied with.</p>
</aside> 
<p class="noindent">Ethanol is only available when denatured by another solvent, e.g. methanol, pyridine, toluene, which can lead to complications.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.7">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.7 Dimethylformamide/<i>N</i>-methylpyrrolidinone</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2"><i>N</i>-Methylpyrrolidinone is considerably more thermally stable than DMF and is advantageously used on a large scale under basic conditions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">These dipolar aprotic solvents have many uses due to the high solubility and relative inertness of the solvent to many reagents. They are not readily recovered due to the high boiling point. They are miscible with water The product is often isolated by drowning out the reaction mixture into water and filtration of the solid product. This can lead to a large volume of aqueous waste which is difficult to dispose of.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.8">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.8 Tetrahydrofuran</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Often used for Grignard reactions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This is an ideal solvent for many reactions due to the good solubility properties and excellent co-ordination to many metals. It is relatively expensive and tends to form peroxides easily. It is water miscible, but can be used to extract the product from an aqueous drown-out by saturating the aqueous phase with inorganic salts, e.g. sodium chloride.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.9">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.9 Cyclohexane, hexane, petroleum fractions</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
</aside>
<p class="noindent">These are relatively non-polar solvents which are in general chemically inert to many reagents. Many substrates have only limited solubility, which restricts their use as reaction solvents. They are however very useful solvents for isolation of products from more polar reaction solvents by dilution with, e.g. hexane and filtration of the now insoluble product.</p>
</section>

<a id="page_78" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 78, 10 Reagents for large-scale operation</a>
<h3 class="h3">10.1.10 Dichloromethane</h3>
<p class="noindent">This solvent has excellent solubility properties and is relatively chemically inert (apart from under basic conditions). The major disadvantage is that it is very toxic to sewage bacteria which means that all aqueous phases that have been in contact with dichloromethane require special treatment before disposal. Incineration of the aqueous phase is an expensive but often the only practicable option.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.11">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.11 Acetonitrile</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although relatively toxic, this is a useful polar aprotic solvent. It is used as a reaction solvent when anhydrous conditions are required and also in the purification of organic products by recrystallisation.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.1.12">
<h3 class="h3">10.1.12 Acetone</h3>
<p class="noindent">Acetone is cheap and of low toxicity. It is however too reactive to have widespread use as a reaction solvent. It is used extensively for plant vessel cleaning.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">10.2.1 Hydrogen peroxide and peroxides</h3>  
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2">Operation under a nitrogen atmosphere is a basis of safety for large scale operation. Evolution of oxygen can compromise this safety.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen peroxide is cheap, readily available, and gives rise to non-toxic by-products, oxygen and water. It is however only available as an aqueous solution which is a major limitation. Care must be taken in use to prevent catalytic decomposition by traces of metals or finely divided solids, e.g. carbon, which can lead to rapid evolution of large volumes of oxygen. Often hydrogen peroxide can be used for the <i>in situ </i>generation of peracids, e.g. peracetic acid and performic acid.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>t</i>-Butyl hydroperoxide is a very useful non-aqueous peroxide which has found widespread applicability especially in asymmetric epoxidation reactions such as the Sharpless epoxidation.</p>
<p class="indent">m-Chloroperbenzoic acid is a selective reagent for the epoxidation of double bonds. Due to its potentially explosive properties, especially in the vicinity of hot plant equipment, its use is confined to the laboratory only.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">10.2.2 Chromic acid</h3>
<p class="noindent">Chromium trioxide is widely used as a relatively non-selective powerful oxidising agent. Often it is necessary to utilise considerably more than a stoichiometric amount to achieve complete reaction. This leads to generation of large amounts of chromium-containing waste which requires specialist and expensive disposal. It can be used both in aqueous and non-aqueous media, e.g. acetic acid solvent.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.2.3">
<h3 class="h3">10.2.3 Potassium permanganate/manganese dioxide</h3>
<p class="noindent">Powerful relatively non-selective oxidants, which are used in at least stoichiometric amounts and give rise to metal residue disposal issues.</p>
<a id="page_79" style="width:70%;" class="page">Page 79, 10 Reagents for large-scale operation</a>
<p class="indent">Manganese dioxide can be used catalytically with air as re-oxidant to achieve some oxidations. Often considerable investigation is necessary to define precise reaction conditions, but the ensuing advantages such as low cost and virtually zero residue disposal costs make catalytic oxidation much more preferable to stoichiometric metal oxidations.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.2.4">
<h3 class="h3">10.2.4 Ozone</h3>  
<p class="noindent">Selective powerful oxidant especially useful for the functionalisation of double bonds. A special plant is necessary for the generation of ozone from oxygen and its use, due to the potential fire hazards. Ozone is a potentially very useful reagent for large scale use, since the by-product oxygen is environmentally very friendly. The major disadvantage is the relatively high capital cost of the special plant. There are relatively few examples of large-scale use of ozone.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.85em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2">The catalyst can be recovered and re-used.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Use of hydrogen with a catalyst, e.g. palladium, is a very attractive process for the large scale. Special plant is necessary to contain the catalyst and to prevent the possibility of hydrogen and air explosions. Catalytic hydrogenation is highly selective and leads to a very simple work-up of merely filtering off the palladium catalyst. The by-product is often water whichisenvironmentally very acceptable.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">10.3.2 Lithium aluminium hydride</h3>  
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.30em;" epub:type="sidebar"> 
<p class="noindent2">The cylinder containing the solution is placed outside the building and the solution fed to the reactor through a pipe using nitrogen pressure.</p>
<p class="noindent2">The dissolved plastic can sometimes complicate the work-up by coming out of solution on addition of water. Additionally the plastic can contaminate the product of the reaction.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Powerful reducing agent which reacts violently with water and alcohols with the potential of ignition. The reagent can be purchased as a concentrated solution in tetrahydrofuran, and this is preferable for large-scale use, since it minimises the handling hazards and minimises the quantity actually in the vicinity of the reaction vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatively the reagent can be purchased in sealed plastic bags which are readily soluble in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. The bag is charged directly to the reactor vessel. This offers considerable safety advantages.</p>
<p class="indent">The work up of lithium aluminium hydride reactions generates aluminium hydroxide which may be filtered off or dissolved in water (acid or sodium tartrate solution) for disposal.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.3.3">
<h3 class="h3">10.3.3 Sodium borohydride</h3>
<p class="noindent">This mild reducing agent is often used in aqueous solution, but can also be used in methanol (some decomposition), dimethoxyethane or diethylene-glycol dimethyl ether. The reagent decomposes to give hydrogen gas especially under acidic conditions and this needs to be safely dispersed.</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium cyanoborohydride is more stable to acid conditions. It is however considerably more expensive than sodium borohydride and care is needed in its use on a large scale due to the toxicity of cyanide.</p>

<p class="indent">Stainless steel is relatively inert to sulphuric acid and this acid is advantageously chosen for operation in metal plant vessels.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.4.2">
<h3 class="h3">10.4.2 Hydrochloric acid</h3>  
<p class="noindent">This acid is widely used for neutralisation purposes. It is obtained as an aqueous solution and this can cause stress corrosion of metal vessels, so its use is largely confined to glass-lined plant.</p>
<p class="indent">For the formation of hydrochloride salts anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas from cylinders can be used.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch10.4.3">
<h3 class="h3">10.4.3 Phosphoric acid</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a very viscous liquid which can cause handling difficulties. Its main use is as a Lewis acid or dehydration reagent. It is often used as reaction solvent in much greater than stoichiometric amount. Work-up leads to large amounts of phosphate residues which can give rise to disposal problems.</p>

<h3 class="h3">10.4.10 Sodium hydride</h3>
<p class="noindent">Chemically this is a very useful base since it generates anions <i>irreversibly</i>, due to the liberation of hydrogen gas. It reacts with water violently and is usually supplied mixed with liquid paraffin oil to protect the reagent from atmospheric moisture. This can cause complications due to the oil contaminating the product. It is inadvisable on safety grounds to remove the oil before use on a large scale. Care is necessary using sodium hydride in dimethylformamide due to the potential of very exothermic decomposition of the solvent. <i>N</i>-Methylpyrrolidinone is a safer, more thermally stable alternative solvent.</p>

The reaction is often performed in methanol in presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide as base. The reaction can also be performed in a two-phase system with a water-immiscible solvent such as toluene. Since dimethyl sulphate is consumed by alternative reaction pathways, it is necessary to use an excess of the reagent. For example dimethyl ether may be formed as by-product and this can pose a containment problem because of volatility (b.p. &#8211;23&#176;C) and inertness which means it cannot be absorbed into aqueous based gas absorption systems.</p>

<p class="noindent">Methyl tosylate is cheap, readily available and has a reasonable activity. The major disadvantage is that tosic acid has a relatively high molecular weight. This leads to the necessity to use a high weight to introduce a low molecular weight methyl group. Additionally the mole of tosic acid produced is of high weight which leads to expensive disposal.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The &#223;-lactam antibiotics, e.g. penicillin, are largely produced by enzymic processes.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Many examples of enzyme catalysed processes have been published in the chemical literature. Enzymes are attractive reagents because they are often very specific for a particular transformation and they perform under very mild conditions (e.g. in water at ambient temperature). Enzymes are particularly useful in the synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds because one isomer in a racemic substrate reacts much more quickly than the other (an example of kinetic resolution). ICI developed such a process for the manufacture of (S)-2-chloropropionic acid (used for the synthesis of pheno-oxypropionic acid herbicides) in which the unwanted (R)- isomer is selectively hydrolysed by a dehalogenase enzyme. This process is currently operated on a scale in excess of 1000 tonnes per annum. Racemic esters are similarly resolved by a selective hydrolysis using a lipase enzyme. Immobilisation of the enzyme on an inert support allows easier recovery and re-use, which may be an important factor in the viability of a large scale process.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Sometimes it is necessary to commit to building the special plant before the biological activity of the compound is proven.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The widespread use of alkyl- and arylthio groups in organic synthesis is partly attributable to the fact that they are both good nucleophiles and also good leaving groups. However simple thiols are difficult to handle in multipurpose plant because of their potent disagreeable smell. The odour threshold (level of detection) is typically one part in 10<sup>9</sup> and special plant or equipment may be necessary to achieve this level of containment. The chemical <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, 10 Reagents for large-scale operation</a> advantages of such a process need to be carefully weighed against the considerable capital cost of building a special plant.</p>
<p class="indent">In such cases the process development chemist will often find an alternative route which avoids the use of a thiol. There are cases however where the use of a thiol is very beneficial in terms of chemical selectivity, high yield and relatively low materials cost.</p>

There is only limited surface area exposed relative to the large volume, which favours maintenance of the dry anaerobic conditions.</p>
