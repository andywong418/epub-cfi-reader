<p class="noindent2">In the laboratory the same glassware is usually used for most stages of a synthesis.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Fine chemicals are organic compounds made in relatively small quantities. They can be either intermediates towards a more complicated molecule or the final &#x2018;effect chemical&#x2019;. Because of the relatively small quantities manufactured, and fluctuations in demand for the particular compound, fine chemicals are usually made in general-purpose equipment. The quantities required do not justify the capital expense of a dedicated plant.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.1">
<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reaction vessels</h2>
<p class="noindent">Small quantities of the compound required for initial evaluation studies can often be produced in laboratory glassware, and by use of suitably large glass vessels (e.g. up to 100 litre) possibly 1 to 5 kilograms may be produced in favourable cases. However there is a limit to simply using larger glass vessels for ever larger quantities. Glass is a relatively weak material and large glass vessels do not have the physical strength to support the contents and can be prone to cracking during heating and cooling operations. Some form of metal plant becomes necessary. This is most often achieved by use of reactors which are fabricated out of steel (for strength) and lined with glass to confer chemical inertness and similarity to laboratory equipment.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The nearest laboratory analogy is a glass separation funnel in which the reaction is performed and worked up in the same vessel.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A typical plant vessel is depicted in the first figure together with the ancillary equipment. Basically the unit consists of a central reactor vessel surrounded by a jacket, through which a heat transfer fluid (usually aqueous ethylene glycol) is circulated to enable the contents of the vessel to be heated or cooled. A charge-hole enables solids to be added to the vessel. Liquid reagents are usually added via a measure vessel to permit a controlled rate of addition. Solvent is added through fixed pipes, either via a pump or by residual vacuum transfer. The vessel is connected to a condenser to enable refluxing of the solvent to be achieved. A 3-way valve on the return line from the condenser permits either refluxing or distillation to a separate vessel. A fixed agitator enables the contents to be stirred. The bottom of the vessel has a valve which allows separation of a lower aqueous phase or discharge of a crystallisation slurry.</p>
<p class="indent">There are however several limitations in the use of a fixed plant consisting of multiple metal vessels.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.1.1">
<h3 class="h3">2.1.1 Separations</h3>
<p class="noindent">Metal vessels have the major disadvantage of being opaque and even a simple separation of an aqueous phase from an organic solvent is more difficult because the interphase cannot be seen in the vessel.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Water has a high electrical conductivity and most organic solvents have a very low conductivity. The probe can thus sense the change in conductivity at the interphase.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Separations are achieved by use of a clear sight-glass in the pipework leading from the bottom of the vessel. In extreme cases aqueous separations can be monitored by use of a conductivity probe to detect the solvent/aqueous boundary, which can then operate the appropriate valves to direct the aqueous phase to one vessel and the organic phase to a different vessel.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.1.2">
<h3 class="h3">2.1.2 Volume measurement</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The load cell measures changes in the pressure (force) exerted by the vessel on its mountings. Changes in temperature can cause expansion of the metal which affects the accuracy of the readings.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This again is difficult because of the opaque metal. Some plant vessels have load cells fitted into the vessel supports which give an approximate measure of the <i>weight </i>of the vessel and its contents and thence a measure of changes in weight as solvent and reagents are added to or discharged from the vessel.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, 2 Scale-up issues</a>&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">A more primitive method is to use a calibrated dipstick. This is discouraged since it involves opening the reactor vessel and the stick becomes contaminated with the contents which may be hazardous.</p>
<p class="indent">Some special vessels are equipped with an ultrasonic system to measure liquid levels. Other techniques which have been applied for level measurement include use of methods based on radar or the use of a minute radioactive source.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.1.3">
<h3 class="h3">2.1.3 Sampling</h3>
<p class="noindent">Opening of vessels to take samples is discouraged from an operational viewpoint because of the potential toxicity and flammability hazards of large-scale reactions. However, often it is essential to ensure that the reaction is proceeding normally, particularly during the first batches of a new process.</p>
<p class="indent">Some special vessels do have a fixed pipework system to enable samples to be taken or pH to be measured without opening the reactor, but these can be prone to erroneous results due to hold-up of liquids or solids in the pipes. The sample taken is thus not representative of the whole contents.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is essential that the hazards of opening the vessel are considered and that the sampler wears suitable protective clothing.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">General purpose vessels can be sampled by use of a dip-can which is a small cylinder open at one end and attached to a long rod. This is lowered into the reactor and collects a sample of the reaction.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.1.4">
<h3 class="h3">2.1.4 Evaporation to dryness</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The effect of the residual solvent in the next stage of the synthesis requires evaluation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This is a standard laboratory operation using a rotary evaporator. It is almost impossible to achieve on a plant scale. The vessel has to be fixed into the floor since it weighs several tons. Rotation of the vessel is thus impossible! The reactor vessel contains a stirrer, but this can only stir effectively when the liquid content is at least 10% of the total vessel volume. Thus removal of solvent by distillation will leave substantial quantities of solvent behind and evaporation to dryness is not possible. Additionally the best vacuum readily achievable is ca 50 mm Hg because of limitation of the capacity of pumps. Large vessels together with the associated pipework have many joints and these can give rise to minor leaks.</p>
<p class="indent">A high boiling inert solvent (e.g. toluene) can sometimes be used to chase out a lower boiling reactive solvent.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.2">
<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Temperature</h2>
<p class="noindent">General purpose vessels usually have an operating temperature range of about +20&#176;C to about 140&#176;C and it is common that a synthetic process will be designed to operate within this temperature range. Higher temperatures are rarely necessary, but can be provided by the use of an electrically heated inert heating fluid (e.g. silicone based) circulating through the vessel jacket. Temperatures lower than +20&#176;C are often required. Circulating chilled glycol through the vessel jacket is suitable for temperatures down to -15&#176;C. Below this temperature special equipment is needed. Both glass and metal can become embrittled at low temperatures, and glass-lined metal vessels are very prone to cracking due to the different expansion coefficients. The usual method for very low temperature operation is to use a totally metal vessel<a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, 2 Scale-up issues</a> fabricated from a special inert alloy and to achieve the cooling either by circulation of a carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen cooled fluid through the vessel jacket or by direct injection of liquid nitrogen into the reactor containing the reaction solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">These special procedures enable extremes of temperature to be obtained and operated on a large scale, but they restrict production to the special vessels. It is often found that by modification of procedures the higher temperatures can be operated with only minor loss of yield.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.3">
<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Isolation of solid products</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the laboratory solid crystalline products are usually isolated on a filter such as a Buchner with a porous (paper or glass) filtration medium and with removal of the mother liquors by application of vacuum. The filtered and washed product is then transferred to a drying oven. This principle can be scaled up to a moderate extent, but has severe limitations; the solid product is exposed to the atmosphere and the operator is potentially exposed to the product and solvent vapours. Some form of enclosed filtration system is preferable.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of a centrifuge offers a highly efficient filtration system which is enclosed, but the product still has to be manually transferred to an oven for drying.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">In the laboratory liquid is removed by vacuum below the filter.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The filtration, washing and drying of solid products can conveniently be conducted in a pressure filter (depicted in the second figure). This essentially consists of a perforated metal baseplate bearing a cloth which acts as filtration medium. The mixture of crystals and mother liquors is transferred to the filter and the liquid removed by use of nitrogen gas pressure above the crystalline slurry. This prevents loss of solvent by evaporation. The filter has stirrer arms which enable very efficient washing of the crystals by fresh solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally the washed solid, still inside the pressure filter, is dried by passing a stream of heated nitrogen through the filter. After drying, the solid product can be discharged directly into drums by use of the stirrer arms and opening of the exit port.</p>
<p class="indent">This equipment is a highly efficient combined filtration, washing and drying system which is totally enclosed. This minimises exposure of the operator to solvent vapours and potentially active chemical products.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">e.g. carbon block absorption systems or the use of cooled condensers.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Operations which involve the drying of solids wet with organic solvents can potentially release large quantities of solvent vapour to the atmosphere. Some form of absorption system is desirable.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.4">
<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stability</h2>
<p class="noindent">Operation on a large scale inevitably takes longer than on a small laboratory scale. Rates of heating and cooling are proportional to the surface area of the vessel, and the ratio of this relative to the vessel contents falls rapidly as the vessel volume increases. It is thus essential that the proposed reagents and products have adequate stability over the much longer processing times</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A &#x2018;hot tube&#x2019; reaction is a common example of a continuous process.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Intermediates which have limited stability can be made on a large scale by use of continuous processing conditions. This is very often used for vapour phase reactions, but this special technique is really beyond the scope of this book.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.5">
<h2 class="h2a">2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Thermochemical hazards</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before any large-scale manufacture is undertaken it is essential that the thermochemistry is fully evaluated. The cooling of large vessels is considerably less efficient than that of small vessels due to the surface area to volume ratio. A runaway reaction in the laboratory will have relatively minor consequences compared to a runaway reaction on a plant scale.</p>
<p class="indent">Reaction rates and evolution of heat can be controlled by the slow addition of a reactant to the vessel. The rate of addition can be adjusted to match the cooling capacity of the plant. This is very convenient for liquid reagents, but the controlled addition of solid reagents is more difficult. This difficulty can sometimes be overcome by dissolution of the solid reagent in a solvent and controlled addition of the solution to the reaction. Screw feed systems for slow addition of solid reagents can sometimes be used, but they are very prone to blocking and since solids can have a wide range of flow properties the conditions need to be specially set up for each individual solid.</p>
<p class="indent">A potentially dangerous mode of operation is the &#x2018;all-in&#x2019; reaction whereby all the reagents and solvent(s) are charged to the vessel which is then heated<a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, 2 Scale-up issues</a> to start the reaction. There is virtually no control over the rate of heat evolution, and the plant cooling may not be sufficient to cope with the peak heat output, resulting in the contents being ejected from the vessel via the condenser, with disastrous consequences on the large scale.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Many reactions evolve gases, sometimes unexpected e.g. use of methyl iodide for alkylation under basic conditions can lead to substantial quantities of dimethyl ether gas being produced.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The thermochemistry of the proposed reaction can be measured in an adiabatic oven system in laboratory equipment which permits the reaction to be heated and the heat output to be measured accurately. Additionally any gas produced from a reaction can be measured to ensure that the vessel will not be subjected to too high a pressure due to rapid gas evolution. The technique permits identification of exothermic behaviour not only at standard operational temperatures, but also at elevated temperatures which could be reached in an abnormal situation if the cooling failed completely.</p>
<p class="indent">Explosive compounds are ones which release a very large amount of heat and gas in a very short space of time (a few microseconds for complete reaction). These compounds cannot be handled in standard equipment. Study of the thermochemistry will give prior warning of such compounds and is thus crucial for safe operation.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.6">
<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Toxicity of reagents</h2>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">e.g. irritancy, biological potency.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Before routine large scale manufacture an evaluation of the toxicity of the reagent and products involved is necessary to enable suitable protective clothing to be recommended. Dusty solid reagents are particularly difficult to handle and contain safely, and various complicated handling systems have been devised to minimise escape of dust.</p>
<p class="indent">Liquid reagents are considerably easier to utilise since suitable pipework can easily be fabricated to dispense the liquid from the supplied container directly into the reaction vessel without exposure to the atmosphere. This protects the operator and also is particularly beneficial in the use of air sensitive reagents, e.g. butyl lithium.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.7">
<h2 class="h2">2.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Chromatography</h2>
<p class="noindent">This technique is highly efficient and is widely used in the research laboratory. It is however extremely difficult to scale up beyond a moderate scale.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two major limitations :</p>
<ol class="none1">
<li style="width:70%;">(a)<span class="space">&#160;</span>The technique is dilute and requires large volumes of solvent to purify modest amounts of material.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">(b)<span class="space">&#160;</span>A large amount of solid support is needed to prevent overloading of the column. This requires use of large diameter columns. Due to edge effects the flow of the eluant is no longer plug flow down fat columns and this can lead to a marked fall off in the efficiency of the separation.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Crystallisation can easily be scaled up and very often works better on a large scale.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Chromatography can often be avoided by formation of a suitable crystalline salt to effect the purification and there are many examples of this strategy in use described later in this book.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.8">
<a id="page_9" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 9, 2 Scale-up issues</a>
<h2 class="h2">2.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Telescoping</h2>
<p class="noindent">This technique is the procedure whereby the product of a chemical reaction is not isolated and purified but is used directly in the next stage of the synthesis often as a solution of the product. It can be very valuable not only to avoid handling non-crystalline oily products but also to avoid isolation of intermediates which are toxic, irritant, or possess a high odour.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Many examples of successful telescoped reactions are described in later chapters.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">For telescoping to be successful it is essential that the first chemical reaction is chemically clean and proceeds to completion, since there is no removal of impurities before the second reaction. Analysis to demonstrate completion is thus highly important. A second very desirable feature of telescoping is that the product from the second chemical reaction is crystalline. This enables easy isolation and purification of the intermediate if necessary.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9">
<h2 class="h2">2.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Choice of synthetic route</h2>
<p class="noindent">Often when a compound is first synthesised in a research laboratory the synthetic route chosen will be one which enables many analogous compounds to be made and evaluated. This route may not be the best method for synthesis of the chosen compound, but will often be used to supply small quantities of the product to permit further evaluation. For an alternative route to be used for long-term large-scale synthesis of a compound the following points need to be considered.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.1">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.1 Probability of success</h3>
<p class="noindent">This can be difficult to assess, but well known chemistry is most likely to be successful particularly in the short term. Reactions which are well documented with a wide range of analogous compounds giving similar results are preferred. Reactions which are high yielding lead to fewer impurities and a simpler work up.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.2">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.2 Starting materials</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many compounds listed in the standard chemical catalogues are only available in laboratory quantities. A manufacturing synthesis requires materials available in bulk, and preferably at reasonable cost. Sometimes large-scale synthesis of intermediates is necessary before the synthesis starts &#x2018;for real&#x2019;.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.3">

<p class="noindent2">See also <a href="#ch2.5">2.5</a> and <a href="#ch2.6">2.6</a></p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">This is of paramount importance for large-scale reactions. Explosive reagents cannot be handled safely in conventional equipment. Most reagents exhibit some degree of toxicity and so large-scale equipment is designed to give a good level of containment to protect the operator and the environment.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">e.g. cyanide, phosgene.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">However, very highly toxic reagents require a further level of containment and this needs to be considered for scale-up of a reaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">Chromatography is almost impossible beyond the laboratory scale. Chemical reactions which exhibit a high degree of selectivity lead to fewer impurities and reduce the need for chromatography.</p>

<h3 class="h3">2.9.6 Catalysis</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">An auxiliary reagent or fragment is one which is used to enable the chemical reaction to proceed, but does not become part of the final molecule.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The use of a catalytic reaction is very desirable. A reaction which uses a stoichiometric amount of an auxiliary reagent generates a stoichiometric amount of waste product which requires safe (and often expensive) disposal. However in the early development phase of a new product little is likely to be known about the possibility of the use of catalytic reactions in the proposed synthesis, apart from the standard literature catalytic reactions e.g. hydrogenation over palladium/carbon.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential benefits of catalysis are enormous, but the time taken to devise a catalyst for a particular transformation can be substantial.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.7">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.7 Number of steps</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Yield and number of steps are sometimes interrelated. A 3-stage synthesis with a 65% yield at each step gives a higher overall yield than a 9-stage synthesis with a 85% yield at each step.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">A synthesis with as few steps as possible is desirable. This also occupies plant equipment for a shorter time and is more productive. Additionally a synthesis with fewer steps will in general lead to less production of waste.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.8">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.8 Yield</h3>
<p class="noindent">A high yielding reaction generates less impurities and leads to an easier work-up. It also offers the possibility of telescoped reactions.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.9">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.9 Equipment</h3>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">e.g. very high pressure or very low temperature require special engineering.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Can the reactions be performed in multi-purpose standard plant or is special equipment needed for the reaction? This is often a compromise. Special equipment will often lead to a cleaner reaction, but in the early days of a compound the equipment may not be available. Until the compound has proven its value, confidence in the compound is not sufficiently high to justify the high capital cost of special equipment.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch2.9.10">
<h3 class="h3">2.9.10 Convergent route</h3>
<p class="noindent">A convergent synthesis is very desirable since it permits simultaneous production of separate fragments of the final molecule in different units before joining together at the final stage. It is overall more efficient than a linear synthesis having the same number of stages and the same yields per stage.</p>

<h3 class="h3">2.9.11 Robustness</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a concept which is difficult to define but is readily understood. Reactions which are tolerant of a wide range of conditions, e.g. concentration, time, temperature are more likely to be repeatedly successfully on a large scale than reactions involving unstable intermediates or requiring critically defined narrow operating conditions.</p>
