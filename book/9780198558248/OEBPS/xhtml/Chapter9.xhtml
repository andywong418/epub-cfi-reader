<p class="noindent">ICI D7114 was developed as a possible treatment for obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Animal studies showed that the drug acts by stimulating &#x03B2;<sub>3</sub>-receptors in brown fat tissue, thereby leading to an increase in resting metabolic rate and hence energy expenditure (a mechanism also called non-shivering thermogenesis). The (R)-enantiomer is inactive so a manufacturing route capable of making the pure (S)-isomer was required.</p>

<p class="noindent">The need to protect one hydroxyl group in <i>p</i>-hydroquinone was obvious. Luckily, <i>p</i>-benzyloxyphenol <b><a href="#fig9.4">9.4</a></b> was available in bulk from the manufacture of another product and seemed to be an ideal starting material. Its use would require selective hydrogenolysis of an <i>O</i>-benzyl group in the presence of an <i>N</i>-benzyl group but since removal of the latter was thought to require forcing conditions no difficulty was expected. This approach formed the basis of an efficient plant-scale manufacturing route. Other problems encountered and solved during the course of the development work are discussed below.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>An environmental hazard</h2>
<p class="noindent">The easiest way of alkylating phenol <b><a href="#fig9.4">9.4</a></b> with ethylene dibromide used a two-phase system (toluene/water) containing a phase-transfer catalyst. Importantly, however, complete consumption of the phenol required large excesses of ethylene dibromide (7.5 equivalents) and sodium hydroxide (5.6 equivalents). During some small-scale laboratory preparations chemists had noticed transient reflux at a temperature below the boiling point of toluene but in the haste to improve other parts of the synthesis the significance of this observation was overlooked.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em; margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A phase- transfer catalyst is often used to speed up reactions in heterogeneous systems.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A few weeks before plant-scale manufacture was due to start hazard studies showed the volatile by-product to be vinyl bromide (b.p. 16&#176;C). Since vinyl bromide is a carcinogen its formation caused serious concern, particularly because the substance is chemically inert and cannot be contained easily by a conventional absorption tower (scrubber). Analysis of the reaction mixture revealed that about 45% of the ethylene dibromide was converted into vinyl bromide.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figure style="width:70%;">
<img src="../images/he_9780198558248_graphic_0098.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">A short-term solution to the problem was devised, enabling manufacture to proceed on time. Vinyl bromide was found to be highly soluble in cold toluene so the manufacturing process was modified. At the end of the reaction the mixture was heated to expel all the vinyl bromide which was trapped in a separate vessel containing toluene maintained at 0&#176;C. Special arrangements were made for disposal of the toluene solution by incineration.</p>
<p class="indent">This approach was unacceptable for routine manufacture. Alternative reaction conditions were investigated but any which worked also generated vinyl bromide, and simply reducing the amount of vinyl bromide was not a satisfactory solution to the problem. In any case, ethylene dibromide (also a carcinogen) was not a good choice of starting material so it was imperative to begin the search for a new route (see <a href="#ch9.10">section 9.10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The ethylene dibromide process was used successfully on the pilot-plant scale. Treatment of bromide <b><a href="#fig9.4">9.5</a></b> with an excess of benzylamine (5<a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, 9 Synthesis of a potential anti-obesity agent</a> equivalents) avoided the problem of tertiary amine formation. The excess benzylamine was easily removed by washing a toluene solution of amine <b><a href="#fig9.4">9.6</a></b> with water and isolating the product as its hydrochloride salt. The yield from p-benzyloxyphenol over two steps was 64%.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Because of the need to contain pyrophoric catalysts such as palladium on carbon, hydrogenations on the plant scale are restricted to dedicated vessels.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="ch9.5">
<h2 class="h2">9.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Removal of the O-benzyl group</h2>
<p class="noindent">Initially the O-benzyl group was removed by catalytic hydrogenation (one atmosphere, 5% palladium on carbon) in 50% aqueous acetic acid. Although selective and high-yielding this process was inefficient because of the low substrate concentration (5% w/v) and the need to distil off all the solvent in order to isolate the product. A switch to <i>n</i>-butanol as solvent for plant-scale operation allowed a higher output and a simple isolation (neutralisation and partial removal of solvent followed by addition of a hydrocarbon solvent to induce crystallisation); the yield of phenol <b><a href="#fig9.1">9.2</a></b> was 75%. However the modified process was not straightforward and the hydrogenation temperature had to be carefully controlled (at 15&#176;C) to avoid loss of the <i>N</i>-benzyl group. This was a particular problem during the filtration to remove palladium on carbon since the mixture had to be warmed to ensure complete solution of the product. Removal of the <i>N</i>-benzyl group was far easier than the research process had indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequently it was shown that the addition of methanesulphonic acid (2 equivalents) prevents cleavage of the <i>N</i>-benzyl group. The yield of isolated phenol <b><a href="#fig9.1">9.2</a></b> was increased to 90%.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>An unexpected impurity</h2>
<p class="indent">A minor change to the research synthesis was to make the acetamide unit prior (rather than subsequent) to the alkylation step.</p>

<p class="indent">The research process used sodium hydride in DMF to generate the phenoxide anion. When applied to the reaction between phenol <b><a href="#fig9.1">9.2</a></b> and chloroacetamide <b><a href="#fig9.7">9.7</a></b> these conditions gave poor yields (60% maximum), with incomplete conversion even after several days. Moreover, there was a troublesome impurity in the derived D7114. The impurity, which was impossible to remove by recrystallisation, was isolated and identified as the methylenedioxy compound <b><a href="#fig9.9">9.9</a></b>.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently during the prolonged alkylation process residual dichloromethane in the crude oily chloroacetamide <b><a href="#fig9.7">9.7</a></b> had participated in a competing reaction with the phenoxide anion. The solvent for preparing chloroacetamide <b><a href="#fig9.7">9.7</a></b> was changed quickly from dichloromethane to toluene to prevent any recurrence of the problem.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em; margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Dichloromethane is not completely inert and when it is used as a solvent the potential for reaction should be considered.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A more consistent process was required for the alkylation step and this was achieved using potassium tert-butoxide in THF. Reaction was quick (4 hours at 20&#176;C) and clean. Product <b><a href="#fig9.7">9.8</a></b> was isolated in 86% yield by addition of water and distillation to remove THF, followed by extraction into and crystallisation from ethyl acetate.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Peroxide formation is a potential hazard with THF. A safe work-up procedure for the large scale is to dilute the reaction mixture with water before distilling off THF.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Strategy for obtaining the required stereochemistry</h2>
<p class="noindent">A major consideration at the start of process development activity was to decide between a resolution process and a direct synthesis of the (S)-isomer. Disadvantages of the resolution approach were:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li style="width:70%;">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The yield of (S)-enantiomer from the racemate was only 24% (i.e. 4 kg of racemate needed to make 1 kg of enantiomer) and the enantiomeric purity (96% ee) was probably inadequate to meet long term quality standards.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">2.<span class="space">&#160;</span>There was no obvious, easy way of using the unwanted (R)-isomer (e.g. by racemisation or inversion).</li>
<li style="width:70%;">3.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The resolution step was close to the end of the synthesis which meant processing large amounts of material through several stages only for 76% of it to be discarded at the resolution step. This would have dictated the need for larger vessels and equipment with obvious implications for manufacturing expense and effluent.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Options for synthesis from homochiral starting materials were investigated. Enquiries revealed that (R)-glycidyl butyrate <b><a href="#fig9.10">9.10</a></b> was available in kilogram quantities from several suppliers. The projected price (&#163;50&#8211;100/kg) for tonne quantities was considered to be favourable when initial experiments showed less than 1 kg of (R)-glycidyl butyrate was needed to make 1 kg of D7114. Therefore the resolution approach was abandoned in favour of a synthesis from an enantiomerically pure starting material.</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.8<span class="space">&#160;</span>Development of an efficient process for (S)-phenyl glycidyl ether</h2>
<p class="noindent">Reaction between phenol and (R)-glycidyl butyrate <b><a href="#fig9.10">9.10</a></b> in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 equivalent) gives diol <b><a href="#fig9.10">9.11</a></b>. The initial process for scale-up involved extraction of the product from the aqueous solution and crystallisation from an ethyl acetate/hydrocarbon mixture. Drawbacks were the low output (5% concentration) and the tendency of the low-melting product to form a gum rather than to crystallise. Operating the reaction at a much higher concentration (20% w/v) led to the discovery that diol <b><a href="#fig9.10">9.11</a></b> crystallises directly from the reaction mixture in 65% yield giving a much simpler process for plant-scale operation. The quality of purchased (R)-glycidyl butyrate was 96% ee but luckily this improved to 99.4% in the crystalline diol presumably because the solubility of the racemic diol is higher than that of a single enantiomer. The level of unwanted isomer was even further diminished on conversion to D7114 so that enantiomeric purity ceased to be a cause for concern.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">When an enantiomer has a higher melting point than the corresponding racemic compound (as in the present case) there is a good chance that fractional crystallisation will afford a solid with enhanced ee.</p>

Remarkably, this transformation is stereospecific and proceeds with retention of configuration&#8212;a feature attributed to the formation of cyclic intermediate <b><a href="#fig9.14">9.14</a></b> as a precursor to bromoacetate <b><a href="#fig9.14">9.12</a></b>.
