</aside>
<p class="noindent">Cloprostenol sodium, the active ingredient in &#x2018;Estrumate&#x2019;, is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>&#945;. The product, which entered development in the early 1970s, was shown to be effective in the synchronisation of oestrus and this led to its application in planned breeding in cattle. Cloprostenol sodium is a racemic product with the relative stereochemistry as shown:</p>

<p class="indent">Innumerable synthetic routes to the prostaglandins and their analogues have been published. One of the most versatile routes, which allows the preparation of side-chain variants, is that devised by Corey. The Corey route was modified and improved by ICI chemists so that cloprostenol sodium could be manufactured on a large scale and this chapter describes how some of the chemical problems were solved.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The isomerisation is promoted by traces of acids and bases.Thallous cyclopentadienide is less basic than the sodium salt.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An inherent problem with the Corey route is the tendency of the alkylated cyclopentadiene <a href="#fig8.1"><b>8.1</b></a> to isomerise, giving a more highly substituted olefin. Use of thallous cyclopentadienide in the alkylation step alleviates this problem but thallium reagents are too toxic for plant-scale manufacture. Oxidation of the alcohol to produce Corey aldehyde <a href="#fig8.1"><b>8.6</b></a> is achieved with Collins reagent (chromium trioxide pyridine complex in dichloromethane) but this process was considered unsuitable for scale-up (hazardous reagent, effluent problem).</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The acetoxyfulvene route</h2>
<p class="noindent">ICI research chemists devised a modified route in which the aldehyde function is introduced in the form of an enol ester. The oxidation step is thus replaced by a simple hydrolysis. Moreover use of 6-acetoxyfulvene <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.7</b></a> in the Diels-Alder reaction eliminates the problem of double-bond migration in the 5-membered ring. The aldehyde group is unmasked to allow the correct stereochemistry to be established at the bridgehead and then re-protected as an acetal until required for the olefination step.</p>

<h3 class="h3">8.3.1 Aldehyde isomerisation 8.9&#8211;8.10</h3>
<p class="noindent">The research process involved hydrolysis of the enol acetate <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.8</b></a> with 2N hydrochloric acid in dioxan (85&#176;C, 4 days). Protonation from the least hindered side gives the <i>anti</i>-aldehyde <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.9</b></a> which transforms to the thermodynamically more stable <i>syn</i>-isomer <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.10</b></a> <i>via</i> acid-catalysed enolisation. However isomerisation is slow because the necessary change in the bridgehead bond angle (sp<sup>3</sup>&#8594;sp<sup>2</sup>) is disfavoured by the constraints of the ring system. Not surprisingly, the yield of <i>syn</i>-aldehyde <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.10</b></a> was low (about 50%) because of competing side reactions (e.g. nitrile hydrolysis). Moreover, dioxan (an animal carcinogen) is not an attractive solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">A better process was sought. Other acidic systems were examined without success but the problem was solved by the discovery that isomerisation of <b>8.9&#8211;8.10</b> is facilitated by formation of a Schiff base. A simple process was developed in which a solution of <i>anti</i>-aldehyde <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.9</b></a> in toluene is treated with p-chloroaniline (25&#176;C, 8 hours). When isomerisation has stopped (&#8805;95% of <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.10</b></a>) p-chloroaniline is removed by extraction with 2N hydrochloric acid, thus providing a solution of the <i>syn</i>-aldehyde <a href="#fig8.7"><b>8.10</b></a> (in 85% yield) ready for use in the next stage. <i>p</i>-Chloroaniline was convenient to use for the Schiff base because it was already available in bulk for the manufacture of another product. Aniline and <i>p</i>-toluidine (slightly stronger bases) were tried but gave inferior results, with tar formation.</p>

<p class="indent">Acid-catalysed hydrolysis of the acetal group in <a href="#fig8.13"><b>8.16</b></a> was troublesome on scale-up, often producing large amounts of the &#945;&#946;&#8211;unsaturated aldehyde by elimination of <i>p</i>-phenylbenzoic acid.

<h3 class="h3">8.4.1 Reduction of the C-15 carbonyl group</h3>
<p class="noindent">According to the literature, borohydride reagents are those most commonly used to reduce the C-15 carbonyl group, with complex borohydrides offering some degree of stereoselectivity in favour of the required 15&#945;-hydroxy isomer at low temperature. The original Corey route used a <i>p-</i>phenylbenzoate ester group at C-11, the main advantages of this group being that it provided nicely crystalline intermediates and allowed easy separation of the C-15 isomers <a href="#fig8.22"><b>8.22a</b></a> and <a href="#fig8.22"><b>8.22b</b></a> by chromatography.</p>

<p class="noindent">ICI chemists showed that the transformation at C-15 can be achieved by a Meerwein&#8211;Ponndorf&#8211;Verley reduction. Aluminium isopropoxide is cheap and readily available. However its reactivity is decreased by association in solution and reflux temperatures are generally required. A more reactive modification is diisobornyloxyaluminium isopropoxide (DAI) which is easily <a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, 8 Development of a manufacturing route for cloprostenol sodium</a>prepared from aluminium isopropoxide and DL-isoborneol in toluene by distilling out two equivalents of isopropanol under azeotropic conditions.

Obviously it was undesirable to waste the 15&#946;-isomer so the possibility of carrying out an inversion at C-15 (e.g. by the Mitsunobu process) was examined briefly but the results were not encouraging (messy reaction, chromatographic isolation, low yield). The option of oxidation at C-15 (Jones&#x2019; reagent) followed by re-reduction was inefficient and was also discounted.</p>

<h3 class="h3">8.4.2 Stereoselective reductions</h3>
<p class="noindent">The achievement of a stereoselective reduction at C-15 in the prostaglandin synthesis was a challenging goal. Corey showed that the nature of the C-11 substituent exerts stereochemical control over the reduction at C-15. In the most favourable case a <i>p</i>-phenylphenylcarbamoyl group at C-11 gave rise to a 92:8 ratio of 15&#945;- and 15&#946;-hydroxy isomers after reduction with thexyllimonylborohydride at &#8211;120&#176;C. However, these conditions are impracticable for large scale operation because a temperature of &#8211;120&#176;C is difficult to acheive and the borohydride reducing agent is not readily available. Also, cleavage of the carbamoyl protecting group requires forcing conditions (aqueous lithium hydroxide, 120&#176;C, 3 days).</p>

The reaction is slow and this was attributed to relative insolubility of the substrate (or its aluminium complex); the scope for examining the process at low temperature was therefore restricted. It was argued that formation of a trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether at C-11 would greatly increase substrate solubility and allow the stereoselectivity of the reduction to be studied at sub-zero temperatures. Accordingly, hydroxyenone <a href="#fig8.21"><b>8.21</b></a> was silylated with a mixture of trimethylsilyl chloride and hexamethyldisilazane and the TMS ether <a href="#fig8.21"><b>8.24</b></a> was reduced with DAI at &#8211;78&#176;C; the ratio of isomers at C-15 was 93:7.</p>
