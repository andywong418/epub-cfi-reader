<h1 class="main2">Preface</h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">This book is largely derived from the study of compounds undergoing development as novel pharmaceutical agents within the Process Development laboratories of the Pharmaceuticals Division of ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) and latterly within Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. It has been the privilege of the authors to report the results of many organic chemists within the Process Development Department. This book would not have been possible without their skills, dedication, ingenuity, and enthusiasm. We would also like to acknowledge the many helpful suggestions received from colleagues in both the contents and details of the book.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Our thanks are due to Dr Steve Davies for the opportunity to produce a contribution to the Primer series and for many helpful suggestions. Our thanks are also due to Dr Ray Bowie of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals for persuading us that the book would be a worthwhile task and fill a gap in the scant literature about Process Development.</p>
