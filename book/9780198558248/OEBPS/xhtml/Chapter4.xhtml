<p class="noindent">Starting with a background of no experience in the chemical development of &#223;-lactam antibiotics, progress with the first ICI product to be selected as a candidate drug was frustratingly slow. Process development chemists who were used to working with stable aromatic heterocycles soon realised that cephalosporins have to be treated differently! Main learning points were:</p>

<p class="indent">1. Products containing the &#x03B2;-lactam ring are relatively unstable. Reactions are preferably done in organic solvents and heat is best avoided. If aqueous systems are used, processes are confined to a narrow pH range since extremes of pH cause rapid decomposition.</p>
<p class="indent">2. A specific method for measuring product purity or strength must be devised as quickly as possible. Strength is defined as the proportion of desired component in a sample and is usually expressed as %<sup>w</sup>/w. Products which appear to be a single component by HPLC analysis (UV detector) can be very impure. By-products, and particularly polymers produced by decomposition of the &#x03B2;-lactam ring, are often UV-inactive. TLC is unhelpful since it is not quantitative and decomposition often occurs on the stationary phase. Naively, samples of the first development product were submitted for elemental analysis and the results were in good agreement with theoretical values for the structure; subsequently the strengths were determined to be in the range 39-65%! Progress was made possible by the discovery that strengths can be measured accurately (&#177;1%) by high resolution NMR spectroscopy, comparing H-6 or H-7 signals against an internal standard (e.g. maleic acid).</p>

<p class="indent">3. At an early stage effort should be applied to the search for a crystalline form of the final product. &#x03B2;-Lactam products are often amorphous and cannot be purified except by chromatography. Even this technique rarely achieves the high purity (&#x2265;98%) needed for a drug. The problem of purification is usually solved by a crystallisation process but the discovery of a crystalline form requires hard work and luck. The time taken to achieve success can vary from weeks to years.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="noindent">ICI 156488 is an orally active cephalosporin which was considered to have potential use in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Kilogram quantities were required to support the development programme. The research route to ICI 156488 started from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) attaching<a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, 4 Fun with cephalosporins</a> first a mercaptotriazole group at C-3&#8242; (a sub-structure common to other commercial cephalosporins) followed by the novel step of introducing an imidazole group at the C-7 nitrogen.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.2.2 Comments on the research route</h3>
<p class="noindent">7-ACA is a commodity chemical available from several companies (price about &#163;200/kg). It is made by a sequence of fermentation and chemical steps. ICI had neither experience of nor suitable production facilities for the fermentation process so it was accepted at the outset that the scale-up route for ICI 156488 should start from purchased 7-ACA.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The impure product could be partially purified by filtration through alumina.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Patent literature describes the reaction between 7-ACA and 5-mercaptotriazole <a href="#fig4.1"><b>4.2</b></a> (and many other mercaptoheterocycles) using a simple aqueous process (phosphate buffer at pH6, 50&#8211;60&#176;C, 4 hours). The product <a href="#fig4.1"><b>4.1</b></a> (7-TACA) is precipitated in about 60% weight yield by adjusting the pH of the solution. Operationally such a process appeared to be ideal for scale-up! Unfortunately it soon became clear that the product from this process is very impure (strength about 60%) due to the presence of polymeric impurities caused by destruction of the &#x03B2;-lactam ring.</p>
<p class="indent">Research chemists had prepared small samples of ICI 156488 by treating 7-TACA <a href="#fig4.1"><b>4.1</b></a> with the triphenylmethyl-protected derivative <a href="#fig4.1"><b>4.4</b></a> of 2-fluoroimidazole but the yield was low (about 30%). In addition, 2-fluoroimidazole <a href="#fig4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> is very difficult to make.</p>

Use of the process to make multi-kilo quantities of 2-fluoroimidazole <a href="#fig4.3"><b>4.3</b></a> was out of the question because large scale photochemical reactors are rare and in any case aqueous fluoroboric acid gradually dissolves glass!</p>

<p class="indent">The cyanamide process was chosen to make 150 g of ICI 156488 for initial development studies. Because of the difficulty of adhering to a precise reaction time (heating up and cooling down takes longer on the large scale) the yield deteriorated to &#60;10% on scale-up and the purity of the crude product was only 25&#8211;30%. Purification (achieved by a sequence of chromatographic steps using reversed-phase silica, ion-exchange and polystyrene based resins) required a heroic effort, affording over 30 small batches of freeze-dried product which were blended. After allowing for water content, the purity was 93%.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Zwitterionic compounds like 7-ACA are often insoluble in organic solvents.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">A simple variation of the cyanamide approach led to an efficient production process. Treatment of cyanamide <a href="#fig4.5"><b>4.5</b></a> with trimethylchlorosilane affords the silyl-protected carbodiimide <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.9</b></a>, a stable distillable liquid. Acid-catalysed reaction between carbodiimide <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.9</b></a> and 7-ACA (solubilised by formation of the trimethylsilyl ester) affords guanidine <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.10</b></a> which can be cyclised exclusively to the required imidazole <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.11</b></a> (7-IACA) without formation of isomer <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.12</b></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially trifluoromethanesulphonic acid (non-nucleophilic counter-ion) was used to catalyse guanidine-formation but sulphuric acid (much cheaper<a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, 4 Fun with cephalosporins</a> and easier to handle) was found to be equally effective. A problem of gum deposition during the cyclisation step was avoided by using boron trifluoride acetic acid complex in place of concentrated hydrochloric acid. A simple work-up was devised in which the reaction mixture is diluted with water and the product adsorbed on a resin column. Elution with aqueous acetonitrile and concentration of the appropriate fraction gives pure crystalline 7-IACA <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.11</b></a> in 50% yield.</p>

<p class="indent">In the preferred process, 7-IACA <a href="#fig4.9"><b>4.11</b></a> is treated with the sodium salt of 5-mercaptotriazole <a href="#fig4.1"><b>4.2</b></a> in the presence of boron trifluoride sulpholane complex (this is suitable for large-scale production whereas boron trifluoride etherate<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, 4 Fun with cephalosporins</a> is unacceptable because of the extreme flammability of diethyl ether).

<p class="noindent">In this step, removal of the tert-butyl ester protecting group was troublesome.</p>
<p class="indent">Thioester <a href="#fig4.25"><b>4.25</b></a> is a useful reagent for acylation of the cephalosporin C-7 amino group. Advantages over the more usual acid chloride coupling method are: avoidance of handling and using moisture sensitive chlorinating reagents and elimination of the need for protecting the 2-aminothiazole group (e.g. as a triphenylmethyl derivative). Thioester <a href="#fig4.25"><b>4.25</b></a> is commercially available in bulk.</p>

<p class="indent">Aminopyrimidine <a href="#fig4.24"><b>4.24</b></a> coupled smoothly with thioester <a href="#fig4.25"><b>4.25</b></a> but removal of the tert-butyl ester group from the product could not be achieved. There is much precedence in cephalosporin chemistry for cleavage of the tert-butyl protecting group with strong acids (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid or conc. hydrochloric acid/formic acid mixture) but in the case of ICI 194008 these reagents caused rapid destruction of the cephalosporin (>90% loss in one hour at 25&#176;C). The acid-lability of ICI 194008 is obviously associated with the bicyclic substituent at C-3&#8242; but the mechanism of the decomposition was not elucidated.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_25" class="page">Page 25, 4 Fun with cephalosporins</a>An alternative approach was needed. Removal of the tert-butyl group prior to the coupling step was an attractive option but there was no literature precedent for this. Thioester <a href="#fig4.25"><b>4.25</b></a> did not survive treatment with strong acid but trimethylsilyl iodide proved to be effective and a simple process was developed, with the help of NMR spectroscopy to follow the deprotection (changes in the tert-butyl and trimethylsilyl signals). The new process was operated successfully on the plant scale, affording ICI 194008 in 80% yield.</p>

<p class="indent">Two problems were encountered and solved during initial scale-up of the process:</p>
<p class="indent">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>Extended reaction times with trimethylsilyl iodide led to a new impurity in the cephalosporin which was identified as the anti-oxime isomer. A literature search revealed precedent for acid-catalysed syn- to anti-oxime conversion. Hence careful optimisation of the reaction time was required.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Migration of the double bond gives a more flexible dihydrothiazine ring system, thereby decreasing ring strain. Compounds with the double bond in the 2,3-position exhibit no antibacterial activity.</p>

Double-bond isomerisation in cephalosporin esters under basic conditions is well known. Silylated aminothiazole intermediate <a href="#fig4.26"><b>4.26</b></a> is itself a potential silylating agent.

The problem of isomerisation did not recur.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.3.5 Purification</h3>
<p class="noindent">Three crystalline froms of ICI 194008 were discovered: a dihydrochloride salt, a zwitterion (solvate with <i>N,N</i>-dimethylacetamide) and a sodium salt. The last two were particularly effective, giving material of &#62;98% purity. Because of its solvent of crystallisation the zwitterion was not considered to be pharmaceutically acceptable. The high solubility of the sodium salt in water made it the ideal choice for an injectable product.</p>
