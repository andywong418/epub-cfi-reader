<p class="fmnoindent">There is no doubt that mankind has benefited tremendously from the contributions of synthetic organic chemistry to the quality of life. The discovery and synthesis phase is only the first step to producing a new pharmaceutical; equally important and demanding is the role of the process and development chemists whose efforts are crucial to bringing the new products to practical and commercial realization.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers have been designed to provide concise introductions relevant to all students of chemistry and contain only the essential material that would normally be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. In this Primer, Stan Lee and Graham Robinson provide an excellent and entertaining account, through a number of case histories, of this enormously important area.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Dr Ray Bowie of Zeneca has been involved with many of the projects described in this primer. It is appropriate also to acknowledge his role in the whole Primer concept: without his ability to convey his own enthusiasm for the Series to ICI pic and latterly to Zeneca the Series would never have been initiated or sustained. All the apprentice and master chemists who enjoy and benefit from the Primers owe him a debt of gratitude as I do.</p>
