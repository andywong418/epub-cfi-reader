Selective activation of the primary hydroxyl was achieved with methanesulphonyl chloride to yield <a href="#fig5.18"><b>5.19</b></a> (Y= CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>), and reaction with trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate gave the hemiacetal <a href="#fig5.18"><b>5.20</b></a>.

<p class="noindent">In the original research route to this series of compounds, protection of the phenolic hydroxyl group was achieved using a methyl group which was removed at the end of the synthesis by use of sodium ethanethiolate in DMF. For the new route the protecting group needs to be stable to severe conditions (strong acid for the isomerisation of paraconic acid, strong base and reducing conditions for the DIBAL and Wittig stages). Several alternative protecting groups were evaluated, but none proved suitable.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">Use of ethanethiolate deprotection led to severe difficulties due to some attack at the 4 (benzylic) position of the dioxan ring and additionally in the case of ICI 192605 due to displacement of the chlorine to form the corresponding ethyl thioether. The gross mixture of products could only be separated by chromatography.</p>
<p class="indent">Many alternative agents were investigated for this demethylation (e.g. BBr<sub>3</sub>, Lil, TMSI) with little success. Either no reaction occurred or considerable decomposition accompanied the demethylation.</p>
<p class="indent">Lithium diphenylphosphide however proved to be remarkably selective and achieved very clean demethylation.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="indent">This was fine for initial laboratory investigations, but the very ready oxidation of diphenylphosphine meant that the reaction was not very reproducible.</p>
<p class="indent1">A far superior method started from the stable, readily available triphenyl phosphine. Reaction with two equivalents of lithium metal forms an equimolar mixture of phenyl lithium and lithium diphenylphosphide. The former can be selectively destroyed by use of one mole of t-butyl chloride, leaving a solution of lithium diphenylphosphide.</p>
