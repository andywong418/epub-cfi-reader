<p class="noindent">The stomach normally has a pH of around 2, and this is achieved by the secretion of dilute hydrochloric acid to aid the digestion process. Excessive activity of the secretory glands leads to too strongly acidic conditions and a tendency towards the formation of stomach ulcers. Surgical removal of the ulcer merely treats the symptoms and not the cause. Similarly the use of anti-acids such as sodium bicarbonate or magnesium carbonate offers only temporary relief since the excessive acid secretion is not being reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">The H<sub>2</sub> blockers are a class of pharmaceutical compounds which block the H<sub>2</sub> receptors in the stomach lining and so lower the secretion of HCl. Under these milder conditions ulcers can heal naturally without the necessity for surgery. The recurrence of ulcers is also minimised under the more alkaline conditions</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Elemental sulphur is a common example of a pure substance existing in several polymorphic forms.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">A pure substance can sometimes crystallise in more than one crystalline form called polymorphs. This arises due to a different packing arrangement of the molecules in the crystal unit cell. Polymorphs have different crystal lattice energies and this leads to differently shaped crystals which have different properties such as melting point and solubility. These physical properties can be of high importance in pharmaceutical compounds since the solubility can affect the bioavailabilty of the active compound and the crystalline form can affect the mechanical stability of tablets. Control of the polymorphic form is thus of high importance.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:2em; margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">DSC is essentially a melting point technique which enables not only the temperature to be measured, but also the energy input necessary to achieve melting.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent1">ICI 162846 is a simple example of a pure compound exhibiting polymorphism. This could be studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A sample of ICI 162846 crystallised from ethyl acetate often exhibits a trace showing TWO distinct endotherms of melting at 380 K and also at 403 K together with a broad exotherm at about 390 K. This occurs due to the existence of two polymorphs in the crystalline solid sample. As the temperature rises to 380 K the energy absorption is small and is being used to heat the solid. At 380 K a large absorption of energy occurs to melt one of the polymorphic forms. This is followed by an evolution of energy as the molten material resolidifies. Further heating raises the temperature of the solid to 403 K where there is a further large absorption of energy to melt the entire solid.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Crash cooling will tend to favour crystallisation of the metastable polymorph.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In general it is preferable to use the most stable (highest melting) polymorph for pharmaceutical purposes since this minimises the possibility of subsequent polymorphic changes during milling operations and formation of tablets. The less stable polymorph is in a metastable state, being of higher lattice energy. The more stable polymorph is usually obtained by slow controlled crystallisation at a high temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of ICI 162846 the high temperature crystallisation was achieved from a mixture of toluene and w-butanol solvent. This solvent combination also achieved the required chemical purity, and consistently gave the more stable higher melting polymorph on a large scale.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conclusions</h2>
<p class="noindent">This product demonstrates many of the principles of process development. The initial research route could not be operated on a large scale because of :</p>
<ol class="none">
<li style="width:70%;">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The explosive nature of nitropyrazoles.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">2.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The high toxicity of thiophosgene would require use of special plant to contain the vapours.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">3.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The use of mercury is undesirable on environmental grounds and because of potential contamination of the final product.</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The developed route avoided these issues by :</p>
<ol class="none">
<li style="width:70%;">1.<span class="space">&#160;</span>Use of aminopyrazole.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">2.<span class="space">&#160;</span>Use of cyanogen chloride to replace thiophosgene and mercury. Although cyanogen chloride is highly toxic there was expertise available within ICI for the safe use and containment of the gas.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">3.<span class="space">&#160;</span>A facile synthesis of the relatively inaccessible trifluoroethylamine was developed and used on a large scale.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">4.<span class="space">&#160;</span>A facile synthesis of 5-bromovaleronitrile from tetrahydrofuran was developed.</li>
<li style="width:70%;">5.<span class="space">&#160;</span>The synthesis is highly efficient since it is convergent and it was possible to operate the manufacture of three separate streams of intermediates simultaneously before joining the fragments together at the end of the synthesis.</li>
