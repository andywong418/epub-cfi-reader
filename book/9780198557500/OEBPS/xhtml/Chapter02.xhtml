<p class="noindent">In 1888 Ludwig Mond, one of the founders of what was later to become ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries), observed during experiments with carbon monoxide that an unexpected volatile substance was formed when CO had been in contact with nickel. This substance was isolated as a heavy, almost colourless liquid which contained nickel but possessed properties unlike any nickel compound known so far. It boiled at only 34&#x00B0;C and decomposed on heating cleanly to metallic nickel with the release of four CO molecules per nickel atom: a complex between CO and nickel had formed of the composition Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>. Within a few years the practically-minded Mond had turned his observation into a large scale process for the manufacture of high purity nickel; his plant in South Wales is still in operation and one of the largest of its kind. Shortly afterwards a second carbonyl complex, Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>, was prepared, independently by Mond and by Berthelot in France, from CO and finely divided iron. The carbonyls of other metals are best prepared from metal salts and CO under reducing conditions.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The physical properties of these volatile metal carbonyls were so unusual that they quickly caught the imagination of chemists worldwide, and metal carbonyl complexes have remained one of the most important classes of organometallic compounds ever since.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">CO binds firmly to blood haemoglobin and renders it unavailable for oxygen transport. Metal carbonyls, in particular the volatile compounds, are therefore highly toxic; Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> is a very potent carcinogen.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The structures of metal carbonyls</h2>

<p class="noindent">The structures of metal carbonyls can be explained using the 18-electron rule. This is fulfilled if Cr, Fe and Ni bind six, five and four CO ligands, respectively, to give monomeric compounds. The carbonyls of Mn and Co form metal-metal bonded dimers to attain an 18 VE configuration. The paramagnetic 17 VE complex V(CO)<sub>6</sub> is an exception: in order to achieve an electron count of 18, it would have to dimerize to give a 7-coordinate species; such an arrangement is however sterically unfavourable. For similar reasons Ti(CO)<sub>7</sub> cannot be prepared, although the isoelectronic complexes Ti(CO)<sub>5</sub>(dmpe) (dmpe &#x003D; Me<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PMe<sub>2</sub>) and [Ti(CO)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> exist.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Metal-CO binding</h3>

<p class="noindent">Classical ligands such as NH<sub>3</sub> are Lewis bases and form donor bonds to Lewis acids such as Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> via their lone electron pairs; they do not, however, react with zerovalent metals to give for example Ni(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, CO is a very weak base indeed - its protonated form, the formyl cation CHO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, is extremely unstable - but does form adducts with zerovalent metals. Why?</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Qualitatively, a molecular orbital description of CO shows the existence of a carbon-centred lone pair (HOMO) and of degenerate &#x03C0;&#x002A; levels (LUMO&#x2019;s).</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%"><a id="page_11" class="page" >Page 11, Metal carbonyl complexes</a>
<img src="../images/page_11_1.jpg" alt="images" />
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">While the carbon-lone pair (s<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>*) interacts with a vacant metal orbital in donor fashion (the most important bonding contribution), the &#x03C0;* orbital possesses the ideal symmetry for accepting electron density from an occupied metal <i>d</i>-orbital. It is this behaviour as a powerful electron acceptor which stabilizes the M-CO bond in a way that NH<sub>3</sub> is unable to do: <i>CO is a strong '&#x03C0;-acid'.</i> Unsaturated organic ligands in general behave as &#x03C0;-acids, although few have the acceptor strength of CO. This process of electron delocalization over the ligand &#x03C0;* system is known as <b>&#x2018;back-bonding&#x2019;</b>.</p>


<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_11_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">Another possible bonding contribution, the donation of CO &#x03C0; electrons
into a vacant metal <i>d</i>-orbital, is relatively unimportant.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Valence bond resonance hybrids lead to a similar description and indicate a
metal-carbon bond order &#x003E;1 and a C-O bond order &#x003C;3:</p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Metal carbonyl complexes</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Although the occupancy of the (energetically high-lying) &#x03C0;* level of CO might be thought to destabilize the system, it has to be remembered that such 2&#x03C0;* orbitals are in fact comparable in energy to metal 3<i>d</i>, 4<i>d</i> or 5<i>d</i> levels, and therefore back-bonding leads to a substantial overall energy gain. However, if the <i>d</i>-orbitals are contracted (i.e. lowered in energy) by placing positive charges on the metal, as in Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, back-bonding becomes inefficient, and CO is lost. This is illustrated by the disproportionation of Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub> in polar solvents: CO remains bound to Co(-I) only but not to Co<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>:</p>

<h3 class="h3">Bonding modes of CO</h3>

<p class="noindent">In multinuclear complexes CO can adopt doubly and triply bridging coordination modes, recognizable in neutral carbonyl complexes by characteristic <i>v</i><sub>CO</sub> frequencies. A &#x00B5;<sub>2</sub>-CO ligand contributes one electron to the electron count of each metal centre.</p>

<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_12_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">This is a useful distinction, even though there are numerous borderline cases. It should be noted however that carbonyl anions, where back-bonding is extensive, can have stretching frequencies well below 1800 cm<sup>-1</sup> although the CO ligands are all terminal.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Asymmetrically bridging CO is also known, as is <b>isocarbonyl</b> coordination via the oxygen atom to electron-deficient early transition metals.</p>

<h3 class="h3">IR spectroscopy of metal carbonyls</h3>

<p class="noindent">Since back-bonding depends crucially on the electron density of the metal, it not only strengthens the M-CO bond but provides a very sensitive probe for the electronic characteristics of the metal centre. CO stretching vibrations are accompanied by substantial changes in dipole moment and give rise to intense bands in the infrared spectrum. As we have seen, extensive back- bonding in electron-rich complexes lowers the C-O bond order and thereby the CO stretching frequency, whereas the converse is true if the complex is positively charged or contains other strongly electron-withdrawing ligands. Compare for example:</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">In CO the electron pair on carbon is weakly C-O antibonding. If CO binds to a Lewis acid incapable of back-bonding, the influence of the electron pair is effectively removed, and the C-O bond strength (i.e. <i>v</i><sub>CO</sub>) increases.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">As a rule, transition metal carbonyl complexes have CO stretching frequencies of below 2100 cm<sup>-1</sup>. There are however rare exceptions, such as complexes of electron-withdrawing ligands. In Pd(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub> for example, a square-planar complex with halide-like perfluoroaryl ligands, <i>v</i><sub>CO</sub> is found at 2186 cm<sup>-1</sup> - higher than in free CO and an indication that back-bonding in this compound is essentially absent.</p>

<img src="../images/page_33_2.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction proceeds in the presence of heterogeneous metal catalysts such as iron or ruthenium under high pressure and temperature, and generally gives a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, as well as products incorporating oxygen such as alcohols and esters (&#x2018;oxygenates&#x2019;). The process is attractive, since CO and hydrogen are accessible from any feedstock, such as natural gas, oil, or coal, and supplies a substantial part of the petroleum needs in some countries without natural oil resources, such as South Africa (Sasol process). A related reaction, the hydrogenation of CO to methanol, involves heterogeneous CuO/ZnO catalysts and is carried out on a large scale using for example natural gas (methane) as the CO source. The production of methanol is the most important synthesis gas reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Metal clusters are frequently seen as models for metal surfaces and have played an important role in elucidating many aspects of the complex reaction sequences that are involved in the Fischer-Tropsch process. The conversion of CO into hydrocarbons requires that C-O bond cleavage occurs, followed by C-H and C-C bond formation on the surface of the catalyst, and finally hydrogenolysis and removal of the product into the gas phase:</p>

One example is Fe<sub>5</sub>C(CO)<sub>15</sub> where the carbide is located approximately in the base plane of a square pyramid of Fe atoms. Larger clusters with a carbon atom inclosed within the metal skeleton (interstitial carbon) are also known, e.g. M<sub>6</sub>C(CO)<sub>17</sub> (M &#x003D; Fe, Ru).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In binuclear mixed CO/CS complexes it is CS which prefers the bridging position since this allows a favourable reduction of the C-S bond order, for example in [CpM(CO)(&#x03BC;-CS)]<sub>2</sub> (M &#x003D; Fe, Ru).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Infrared spectroscopy has proved to be an almost ideal tool for studies of metal carbonyl complexes since the C-O stretching frequencies occur in an otherwise clear region of the spectrum. For CS and CSe, IR is less easily applied since their vibrations fall within the fingerprint region of the spectrum and are more difficult to identify.</p>

Isocyanide complexes</h2>

Some of these are very stable, even in aqueous media; radioactive technetium isocyanide complexes [Tc(CNR)6]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> are used in nuclear medicine e.g. for the radio-imaging of the heart.</p>

Dinitrogen complexes</h2>



<p class="noindent">Although not strictly an organometallic ligand, N<sub>2</sub> is isoelectronic to CO, and provides an interesting comparison. It lacks the polarity of CO and is both a very much weaker donor and a weaker &#x03C0;-acceptor. As a consequence, many N<sub>2</sub> complexes are labile, and the N-N bond distance of coordinated N<sub>2</sub> differs in most cases remarkably little from that of free N<sub>2</sub> (1.0976 A&#x00B0;).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">N<sub>2</sub> coordinates usually end-on as a terminal ligand. Side-on (&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>) coordination and bridging N<sub>2</sub> are rare:</p>

<img src="../images/page_39_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>




<p class="indent3-ka">Binary complexes between metals and N<sub>2</sub> are unstable; e.g. Ni(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> has been identified by matrix isolation techniques and decomposes at low temperatures. The first dinitrogen complex was isolated in 1965, [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, made from RUCI<sub>3</sub> and hydrazine. In most dinitrogen complexes known to date, the metal is in a low oxidation state, and back- bonding, though weak, is important for the stability of the complexes.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A number of bacteria are able to use N<sub>2</sub> and reduce it to ammonia, the best known example being <i>Rhizobium</i> which is found in the root nodules of legumes and is responsible for the biological fixation of about 100-200 million tons of nitrogen annually worldwide (approximately twice the amount of ammonia produced industrially by the Haber-Bosch process). This is remarkable in view of the very high dissociation energy of N<sub>2</sub> (945.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). The bacterial enzyme responsible, nitrogenase, contains redox-active Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cubane clusters as well as molybdenum - the only case where nature has made use of a second row metal. Consequently there has been intense interest over the years in dinitrogen complexes, particularly of Group 6 and related metals, in order to elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Dinitrogen complexes are most readily prepared by reduction under a nitrogen atmosphere:</p>

<img src="../images/page_39_4.jpg" alt="images" /></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">By contrast, some bridging N<sub>2</sub> complexes of metals which prefer to be in their highest obtainable oxidation state, such as tantalum, are best formulated as complexes of the N<sub>2</sub><sup>4-</sup> tetraanion, with a significantly elongated N-N bond and short metal-nitrogen distances indicative of double bonds:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The terminal nitrogen of the N<sub>2</sub> ligand in low-valent complexes such as W(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>L<sub>4</sub> carries a partial negative charge. This is best illustrated by the resonance hybrid formalism and explains the reactivity of these complexes towards electrophiles:</p>
