Stability and structure</h2>

<p class="noindent">The making and breaking of metal-carbon &#x03C3;-bonds plays an important role in organometallic chemistry and is central to its application to catalysis. Whenever alkanes, alkenes or alkynes are generated, hydrogenated, polymerized or functionalized, metal alkyl intermediates are involved. It is estimated that about three quarters of all products of the chemical industry pass through a catalytic process at some stage.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The first metal alkyls were prepared even before the metal carbonyls, in 1848 when Edward Frankland attempted to stabilize the &#x2018;ethyl radical&#x2019; by reacting zinc with iodoethane and isolated EtZnI and ZnEt<sub>2</sub> - a very significant experimental feat at the time in view of the pyrophoric nature and extreme hydrolysis sensitivity of zinc alkyls. Who nowadays would dream of using hydrogen as a protective atmosphere?</p>

<p class="aside" style="margin-top:4em">It is important to be clear what is meant by &#x2019;stability&#x2019;. Many compounds can be heated to high temperatures without decomposition under inert gas but react violently on exposure to air or moisture. Others, whose thermodynamic data indicate lability, nevertheless appear perfectly stable to oxygen or water. The term &#x2019;stability&#x2019; is used here to indicate the lack of decomposition of the pure compound, i.e. in the absence of a reaction partner.</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">The synthesis of zinc alkyls was soon followed by the isolation of alkyl compounds of many main group elements, such as aluminium, magnesium, mercury, silicon, tin and lead. The first transition metal alkyls were not prepared until 1907 when W. J. Pope reported PtMe<sub>3</sub>l whose tetrameric, cubic structure with octahedrally coordinated Pt<sup>IV</sup> was not recognized until some 50 years later. For many years, most attempts to prepare other transition metal alkyls similar to the compounds of main group elements failed, and as late as the 1950s it was argued (and indeed supported by theoretical considerations) that transition metal-to-carbon &#x03C3;-bonds were intrinsically unstable, particularly if &#x2018;stabilizing&#x2019; &#x03C0;-ligands were absent.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">This situation changed in the 1960s. A large number of metal-alkyl complexes, with and without &#x03C0;-ligands, are now known, and in many cases the M-C bond enthalpies have been determined. Below are the bond dissociation enthalpies <i>D</i> for a series of main group and transition metal compounds:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">On thermodynamic grounds, therefore, transition metal alkyls should be much more stable than, for example, lead alkyls which are endothermic and possess only weak Pb-C bonds. This is in sharp contrast to the observed decomposition temperatures of comparable transition metal and lead alkyls:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The reason for the difference in stability between the tetraalkyls of  titanium and lead is therefore not thermodynamic but <i>kinetic</i>. In the case of 
PbEt<sub>4</sub> all available orbitals are occupied: the four &#x03C3;-bonds to carbon supply an electron octet, the 5<i>d</i> shell is filled, the <i>6d</i> and &#x03C3;<sup>*</sup> levels are energetically inaccessible. As a result, PbEt<sub>4</sub> can only decompose by M-C bond homolysis, a comparatively high energy process:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">By contrast, transition metals such as Ti possess vacant <i>3d</i> orbitals which provide a facile decomposition pathway by allowing interaction with C-H bonds of the alkyl ligands. Since a hydrogen from a carbon in &#x03B2;-position to the metal is abstracted, this process is termed <b>&#x03B2;-hydrogen elimination</b> (or, simply, <b>&#x03B2;-elimination):</b></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The synthesis of stable transition metal alkyls can be achieved by applying two strategies:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">1. <i>Blocking any available coordination sites by donor ligands.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">This method is widely applied and successful, for example using chelating ligands, such as 2,2&#x2019;-bipyridyl (bipy) or the strongly basic diphosphine Me<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PMe<sub>2</sub> (dmpe). Whereas TiMe<sub>4</sub> decomposes above -50 &#x00B0;C, TiMe<sub>4</sub>(dmpe) is stable at room temperature. There are also numerous alkyl complexes with CO and Cp ligands which obey the 18-electron rule and are very stable, e.g. CpFe(CO)<sub>2</sub>R (R &#x003D; Me, Et, etc.).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">2. <i>Using alkyl ligands stable to &#x03B2;-hydrogen elimination.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Frequently used examples of alkyls without (&#x03B2;-hydrogens are:</p>

(&#x03B2;-hydrogens but where &#x03B2;-elimination is energetically unfavourable, such as
bridgehead alkyls:</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Metal alkyls and the 18-electron rule: The importance of steric stabilization</h2>
<p class="noindent">The structures and stability of most complexes encountered until now, such as the transition metal carbonyls and many other &#x03C0;-complexes, are conveniently explained by the 18-electron rule (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml">see. p. 2</a>) which predicts stability for a complex in which the metal is able to attain the electron configuration of a noble gas. CO is sterically relatively undemanding, and the metal is usually able to accommodate the required number of ligands to satisfy its electron requirements.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Most metal alkyl complexes containing donor ligands also follow the 18- electron rule (16 electrons for square-planar <i>d<sup>8</sup></i> systems: Rh<sup>I</sup>, Ir<sup>I</sup>, Ni<sup>II</sup>, Pd<sup>II</sup>, and Pt<sup>II</sup>). An early example is Pope&#x2019;s Me<sub>3</sub>PtI: the 18-electron rule is fulfilled if the iodide ligands act as triply-bridging five-electron donors (one &#x03C3;-bound<a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Metal alkyl complexes</a>with two electron pairs as donors - rather like the cyclopentadienyl ligand in CpPtMe<sub>3</sub>) and the molecule adopts a tetrameric cubic structure.</p>

<p class="noindent">Other typical examples are:</p>

<img src="../images/page_53_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">On the other hand, there are numerous complexes which are thermally quite stable but cannot be explained on the basis of the 18-electron rule. These compounds are often electronically highly unsaturated and owe their existence to the <i>kinetic stabilization</i> afforded by sterically demanding ligands. These ligands are often too bulky to allow the metal to bind enough donor ligands to achieve a higher electron count; on the other hand, they provide an efficient &#x2018;umbrella&#x2019; protecting the metal. Examples are found mainly among early transition and lanthanide metals in high oxidation states.</p>

Manganese(II) dialkyls are usually polymeric, with tetrahedrally coordinated Mn and structures similar to<a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Metal alkyl complexes</a>MgMe<sub>2</sub> or BeMe<sub>2</sub>, in accord with the ionic nature of Mn<sup>II</sup> (<i>d</i><sup>5</sup>). By contrast, Mn[C(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> is a two-coordinate monomer. Similarly, zinc dimethyl, a linear, monomeric, volatile compound, is highly pyrophoric and instantly hydrolysed, whereas Zn[C(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> can be boiled in aqueous HCI without decomposition&#x0021;</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A particularly striking example of the overriding importance of steric factors in determining the geometry and the oxidation state of the metal are 1- norbornyl complexes, M(l-norb)<sub>4</sub>: a series of these exists with M &#x003D; Ti, V, Cr,and even tetravalent Mn, Fe and Co.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The Co<sup>IV</sup> compound is a rare example of a <b>low-spin tetrahedral</b> complex - an indication of the strong ligand field exerted by powerful <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donors such as alkyl ligands. It can be reduced to [Co<sup>III</sup>(norb)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x203E;</sup> and oxidised to the unusual Co<sup>v</sup> complex [Co(norb)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.

<p class="indent3-ka">Although these examples demonstrate how important steric factors can be in controlling the maximum attainable coordination number, electron- deficient complexes nevertheless attempt to increase their electron count by whatever means available. Benzyl ligands, for example, possess a &#x03C0;-system (the phenyl ring) which is able to act as a weak electron donor towards the metal centre. A typical example is tetrabenzylzirconium: the <i>ipso</i>-carbon of
<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Metal alkyl complexes</a>the phenyl ring interacts with Zr; the benzyl ligand is, in effect, <i>&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>- coordinated.</i> As a result, the Zr-CH<sub>2</sub>-C angle is considerably more acute than expected for an <i>sp<sup>3</sup>-</i>carbon. By contrast, Sn(CH<sub>2</sub>Ph)<sub>4</sub> shows none of these distortions and possesses normal angles: as a main group element without accessible unoccupied d-orbitals, its benzyl ligands are &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>-bonded.</p>

A typical example is CpMo(CO)<sub>2</sub>(&#x03B7;<sup>3</sup>- CH<sub>2</sub>Ph): the metal is coordinated to three carbons in &#x03C0;-fashion, and the aromatic character of the phenyl ring is disrupted (note the bond length alternation in the six-membered ring in the Mo example&#x0021;).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Donor interactions increasing the effective electron count of the metal centre do not have to be so obvious. Heteroatoms, such as O and N, are able to interact with the metal to which they are bound via their &#x2018;non-bonding&#x2019; electron pairs. This is common in imido and oxo complexes. Indicative for such interactions are the short metal-N and metal-O bonds and the near-linear M-O-M arrangement in binuclear complexes.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Reactions with electrophiles</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Generally, metal-carbon &#x03C3;-bonds react readily with electrophiles such as HX to give alkanes and complexes L<sub>n</sub>MX. The reaction of water or aqueous mineral acids can be violent with electron-deficient alkyls of early transition metals but goes smoothly with more electron-rich complexes. Alcohols, phenols and ammonium salts may be used, for example:</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Metal electrophiles, such as HgCl<sub>2</sub>, react with transition metal alkyls usually with alkyl transfer to mercury. Two reaction pathways have been observed with stable alkyl complexes, e.g. of iron. In protic solvents and if R is primary alkyl, generation of a mercury alkyl is favoured, whereas in aprotic solvents and if R is a secondary or tertiary alkyl, alkyl halides and complexes with mercury-iron bonds are formed. Alkyl transfer also takes place with other main group halides, such as thallium trichloride.</p>

<p class="noindent">The reaction of dihydrogen with metal alkyls is of widespread importance. It occurs in several catalytic reactions (see hydrogenation, hydroformylation <a href="#page_64">p. 64</a>) and is often a clean synthetic method for the preparation of metal hydrides.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_60_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<h3 class="h3">Insertion of CO into M-C bonds</h3>
<p class="noindent">The insertion of CO into M-C bonds to give acyl complexes is one of the most widely applicable and industrially most important reactions of transition metal alkyls. For example, if CH<sub>3</sub>Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> is treated with CO under pressure, CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> results. This could be formed either by attack of free CO on the metal-alkyl bond, or by migration of the alkyl ligand to a coordinated CO. The mechanism becomes apparent if <sup>13</sup>C-labelled CO is used as the incoming ligand: the acyl group is derived from previously coordinated CO, while the labelled ligand occupies a position <i>cis</i> to the acyl group. This is consistent with an intramolecular migration of the nucleophilic CH<sub>3 </sub>ligand on to the electrophilic carbon of a coordinated CO ligand; the coordination site thus vacated by the methyl ligand is then occupied by <sup>13</sup>CO.</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:100%">
<img src="../images/page_60_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reaction is reversible: if CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> is heated under vacuum, a CO ligand - again <i>cis</i> to the acyl ligand - dissociates and allows the methyl group to migrate from the acyl group to the metal to generate CH<sub>3</sub>Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub>. This process highlights several important reaction principles:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<div class="grey">
<p class="divc"><span class="dropcap">&#9758;</span> The &#x2018;insertion&#x2019; of CO into the M-C bond consists of a<b> migration of the alkyl ligand</b> to a coordinated CO ligand.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, Metal alkyl complexes</a></p>
<div class="grey">
<p class="divc"><span class="dropcap">&#9758;</span> Migration represents an <b>intramolecular nucleophilic attack </b>by alkyl on a coordinated unsaturated electrophile.</p>
<p class="divc"><span class="dropcap">&#9758;</span> The alkyl migration step is<b> reversible</b>.</p></div>

<p class="indent3-ka">The validity of these statements is not confined to CO insertion: the principle of <i>cis</i>-migration applies equally well to the &#x2018;insertion&#x2019; of alkenes,alkynes, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc. The incoming ligand need not be identical to the one that participates in the alkyl migration step; with CH<sub>3</sub>Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> the equilibrium is equally displaced in favour of acyl formation if, for example, PPh<sub>3 </sub>is present, giving rise to CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)Mn(CO)<sub>4</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Lewis acids (BF<sub>3</sub>, AICI<sub>3</sub>) greatly accelerate the rate of alkyl migration,first by coordinating to a CO ligand and increasing its polarity, and secondly by weakly occupying the vacant coordination site, thereby stabilizing the intermediate before the incoming ligand takes its place.</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/page_61_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">If chiral alkyl ligands are used, it can be shown that the migration step proceeds with <i>retention of configuration:</i></p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%">
<img src="../images/page_61_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Many alkyl complexes do not contain coordinated CO but nevertheless react readily if exposed to CO to give acyl complexes. However, the same principle of ds-migration applies and has been demonstrated in the reaction of CO with Cp<sub>2</sub>ZrPh<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<a id="page_62" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 62, Metal alkyl complexes </a>
<p class="indent3-ka">The incoming CO ligand forms a very labile complex by interacting with the LUMO on zirconium. Alkyl migration is fast and leads to an acyl product as expected. The 16 VE &#x03B7;<sup>1</sup>&#x002D;acyl complex which may be formed initially is stabilized by the donor capacity of the acyl&#x002D;oxygen to give a complex which contains an &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x002D; bonded acyl ligand: a low&#x002D;temperature isomer ('O&#x002D;outside&#x2019;) can be identified below &#x002D;60 &#x00B0;C and rearranges on warming to give the stable product, with an &#x2018;O&#x002D;inside&#x2019; &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x002D;acyl ligand.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">&#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x002D;Acyls and &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>&#x002D;iminoacyls are frequently encountered in electron&#x002D; 
deficient complexes, particularly of early transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, although
 examples for late transition metals such as Fe and Ni are also known.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Double carbonylation</h3>
<p class="noindent">If CO so readily inserts into M&#x002D;C bonds, can this process be repeated to give &#x03B1;&#x002D;keto acyls or even poly&#x002D;ketones? This is not the case: the insertion of CO into a metal&#x002D;acyl bond is thermodynamically unfavourable and is not observed. CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)C(O)Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub> can, however, be 
prepared from Mn(CO)5&#x002D; and CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)C(O)C1; it is thermally unstable and readily eliminates CO to give CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)Mn(CO)<sub>5</sub>.</p>
<figure class="fig1"><img src="../images/page_62_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Nevertheless, &#x2018;double carbonylation&#x2019; processes are occasionally found. The carbonylation of iodobenzene in the presence of palladium catalysts for example gives &#x03B1;&#x002D;keto benzoic amides:</p>
<figure class="fig1" style="text-align:center;width:70%"><img src="../images/page_62_2.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Investigation of the mechanism shows, however, that the product is the result of the reductive coupling of two different CO&#x002D;containing units, C(O)Ph and C(O)NEt<sub>2</sub>; the latter is formed by nucleophilic attack of HNEt<sub>2</sub> on coordinated CO in a cationic palladium carbonyl intermediate. PhC(O)NEt<sub>2</sub> is also produced via a side reaction; a Pd&#x002D;CO&#x002D;CO&#x002D;Ph species is not involved in the cycle. </p>

<h3 class="h3">Insertion of isocyanides</h3>
<p class="noindent">Isocyanides are closely analogous to CO and generally undergo similar reactions (see<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_39"> p. 39</a>); it is, however, less dependent on back-bonding for stabilisation of its complexes. Commonly used reagents are Bu<sup>t</sup>NC and ArNC (Ar = e.g. m&#x002D;xylyl). They react with metal alkyls and aryls to give iminoacyls by the mechanism described for CO. Because of the pronounced donor character of the iminoacyl nitrograph &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup> complexes are frequent. In contrast to CO, however, multiple insertions are no longer energetically unfavourable, and double and triple RNC insertion takes place; indeed, (allyl)Ni(O<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>) is highly effective in catalysing the polymerization of ArNC to give linear poly(iminoacyl). Some examples of the reactions of isocyanides with metal alkyls are:</p>

<h3 class="h3">CO insertions in catalysis</h3>
<p class="divc"><i>Hydroformylation</i></p>
<p class="divc">Several industrial processes involve the insertion of CO into metal&#x002D;alkyl bonds of catalytic intermediates. One of the best known is the<b> hydroformylation</b> of olefins, originally developed by Roelen (BASF) in 1938 using cobalt catalysts, like CO<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>, and known as the <b>&#x2018;oxo process&#x2019;.</b> It operates at elevated temperatures and. high CO/H<sub>2</sub> pressures; under such reducing conditions HCo(CO)4 is formed which initiates the catalytic cycle (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_65">see p. 65</a>).</p>
<p class="divc1">The hydroformylation with cobalt carbonyls requires drastic conditions and high CO pressures to stabilize the HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>a intermediate. Efforts have been made to improve the conditions, for example by addition of PBu<sub>3</sub>. Significantly more efficient catalysts are only obtained by replacing cobalt with rhodium; the hydrides and alkyls of second&#x002D;row metals are less labile, and so much more active, that the high cost of rhodium is easily offset. The catalyst precursors are HRh(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> <i>(Wilkinson&#x2019;s catalyst)</i> in the presence of a large excess of PPh<sub>3</sub>; this catalyst has now superseded the older cobalt system. The catalytic cycle is closely analogous to that outlined below for Co and is facilitated by the ready dissociation of PPh<sub>3</sub> to give I6VE species such as HRh(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="divc1">The reaction scheme below is simplified. The insertion of a terminal olefin into the metal hydride can occur in a Markovnikov and anti Markovnikov sense:</p>

<p class="divc1" style="width:70%">A mixture of primary and secondary cobalt alkyls results, which leads to linear ad branched aldehydes. Since the aldehyde products are mainly converted to detergent alcohols which have to be linear, the branched isomer is undesirable. Rhodium catalysts, particularly in the presence of a large excess of triphenylphosphine, give predominantly linear products.</p>
<p class="divc1" style="width:70%">Dihydrogen can be replaced by protic reagents such as alcohols or amines to give a range of carbonylation products, including carboxylic acids, anhydrides, esters and amides. Many of these reactions were discovered by W. Reppe in the 1940&#x2019;s using cobalt salts.</p>

In many instances the C-H activation is driven by steric crowding; for example, the alkylation of transition metal salts with such bulky alkyls as CH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>SiMe<sub>3</sub> or thermolysis often leads to formation of metallacycles via &#x03B3;&#x002D;C&#x002D;H activation</p>
