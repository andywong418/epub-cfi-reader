<p class="fmnoindent">Organometallic chemistry has been one of the most exciting growth areas of inorganic chemistry over the last 40 years. As well as being an established academic discipline it is of key importance in the design of industrial homogeneous catalysts, and also of new organic synthetic methods.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually be covered in an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series will provide explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry. In the first of his books, Manfred Bochmann provides the reader with a clear, up-to-date description of the chemistry of single-carbon donor ligands in transition metal complexes, building upon well-accepted fundamentals.</p>
