<h1 class="fmmain"><b>Preface</b></h1>
<p class="fmnoindent">This short book is designed as an introduction to the inorganic and coordination chemistry of the second and third row <i>d</i>-block metals, and it is assumed that students using this book will already have a grounding in the chemistry of the first row <i>d</i>-block metals. It has not been easy to choose the scope of coverage for this <i>Primer</i>; within the remit of the title of the book lies a wealth of chemistry far in excess of the page limit. In deciding on the content, I have been mindful, firstly, that second and third row metals are often used to introduce students to special topics (e.g. high coordination numbers, metal&#x2013;metal bonding, polyoxometallates) and, secondly, to avoid overlap with other <i>Primers.</i> I have supplemented the book with many suggestions for further reading, including papers in the current literature both from research and more topical journals, and I hope that these articles will stimulate students to find out more about the heavier metals.</p>
<p class="fmindent">I must thank Professor John Evans and those at OUP for their patience in waiting for me to complete this project. As always, I am extremely grateful to my husband, Professor Edwin Constable, for his role as an excellent critic. And, last but not least, thanks once again go to Philby and Isis for their peaceful (and not so peaceful) feline company; writing a book would not be the same without them.</p>
