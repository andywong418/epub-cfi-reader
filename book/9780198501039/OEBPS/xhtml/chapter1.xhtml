In group 3, lanthanum (La) is generally considered with the <i>f</i>-block elements. Notice in <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> that whereas the atomic numbers of the elements in the second row of the <i>d</i>-block follow sequentially, there is a discontinuity in the atomic numbers between La and Hf in the third row. In <a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> we discuss the effects of introducing the lanthanoid elements before hafnium. The ground state electronic configurations of the metals listed in <a href="#tab_1.1">Table 1.1</a> also illustrate the introduction of the lanthanoid series.</p>

<p class="noindent">After iron, titanium and manganese, zirconium is the next most abundant <i>d</i>-block metal in the Earth&#x2019;s crust; lunar rock samples collected by the Apollo missions have been shown to contain relatively high amounts of zirconium. Zirconium occurs naturally with hafnium and their separation is difficult. The major ores are <i>zircon</i> (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>) and <i>baddeleyite</i> (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), and extraction processes involve the reduction of the oxide by calcium, reduction of K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub> produced from zircon by treatment with K<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, or reduction of ZrCl<sub>4</sub> by magnesium. Zirconium is a lustrous and ductile, silvery metal which has excellent resistance to corrosion. This property is the key to many of its uses and a major application is in the cladding of fuel rods in water-cooled nuclear reactors. Zirconium is also a component in a range of catalytic systems.</p>

In its manufacture, niobium is usually separated from tantalum by a liquid extraction process, extracting into Me<sub>3</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OMe from HF solutions. Niobium is a shiny, white, soft and ductile metal; it oxidizes in air above 470 K.

<p class="noindent">The main ore from which molybdenum is extracted is <i>molybdenite</i> MoS<sub>2</sub>; roasting MoS<sub>2</sub> in air produces MoO<sub>3</sub> which is then reduced with H<sub>2</sub>. Molybdenum is a very hard metal with a high melting point (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>); it is used extensively in alloys (e.g. steels) where it provides increased strength and hardness.</p>
<p class="indent">Molybdenum has an essential role in biological systems where it occurs in the active sites of <i>molybdoenzymes.</i> These fall into two general classes: the nitrogenases which involve the iron-molybdenum cofactor FeMoco, and the molybdopterin-containing enzymes. Molybdenum-containing nitrogenases catalyse the reduction of N<sub>2</sub> to NH<sub>3</sub> (nitrogen fixation), for example, by leguminous plants as part of the nitrogen cycle. Nitrate reductases reduce nitrate to nitrite when plants assimilate nitrogen (e.g. from fertilizers). Since 1992, X-ray crystallographic data have been available that provide detailed structural data concerning the iron-molybdenum cofactor. <a href="#fig_1.3">Figure 1.3</a> shows the Fe/Mo/S-cluster that is tethered to a protein by an <i>S</i>-coordinated cystenyl residue, and an <i>N</i>-bound histidine unit; the chelating <i>O,O</i>&#x2032; -unit in <a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> represents an isocitrate unit.

It is a hard, silver-white metal, stable with respect to oxidation in air up to <i>&#x2248;</i> 875 K, and resistant to attack by acids.

<p class="noindent">Palladium occurs with other platinum metals; it is a grey-white, malleable and ductile metal but its strength can be increased by cold-working. Palladium does not oxidize in air, but it reacts slowly with sulfuric and nitric acids. Major applications of palladium are in the electronics industry where it is used in printed circuits and multilayer ceramic capacitors. It has widespread use as a catalyst in the laboratory and in industry, with its role in catalytic converters being of prime importance for the environment. An unusual property of palladium is its ability to absorb large amounts of H<sub>2</sub> and this leads to its application in the purification of dihydrogen on an industrial scale.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-12.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent3"><i>Cold fusion</i> : the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to give helium is the source of the Sun&#x2019;s energy; however, the conditions needed to initiate fusion are harsh. In 1989, Pons and Fleisehmann reported the remarkable result that they had achieved fusion of deuterium nuclei under ambient conditions through the electrolysis of D<sub>2</sub>O using Pd electrodes. The formation of D<sub>2</sub> in this experiment is followed by absorption of the deuterium by the palladium, and it was reported that large amounts of energy were unexpectedly produced by the system and this was interpreted as co-called &#x2018;cold fusion&#x2019; of deuterium nuclei. Attempts to reproduce the results have not met with success and, to date, the phenomenon of cold fusion remains in dispute.</p>

Pure silver is a lustrous silver-white metal, and has the highest electrical conductivity of any metals. Silver tarnishes in air, forming the black sulfide, and the alloy <i>sterling silver,</i> which contains 92.5% Ag, tends to be used in jewellery and cutlery manufacture. Silver reacts with oxidizing acids (e.g. with hot concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) but resists attack by alkalis. It has extensive uses in the photographic industry, and also finds applications in the manufacture of high capacity batteries, soldering-alloys, electrical equipment and printed circuits. Each of the isotopes <sup>107</sup>Ag and <sup>l09</sup>Ag is NMR active, but their use in compound characterization usually comes in the detection of coupling to other nuclei, e.g. <sup>31</sup>P.</p>

Cadmium is a soft, ductile, blue-white metal; <a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a> illustrates its low melting point, consistent with other members of group 12, and this property leads to its use as an alloying agent in the manufacture of low melting alloys. It oxidizes in air, and reacts with dilute acids. Cadmium is a toxic element, as are solutions of its salts, and is recognized as a possible carcinogen.

<p class="noindent">Rhenium is a rare metal, occurring to an extent of only 0.0007 ppm in the Earth&#x2019;s crust. There is no ore of significant importance, and industrially, rhenium is extracted from flue dusts collected after molybdenite has been roasted (see <a href="chapter1.xhtml#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>.4). The dust is oxidized with hypochlorite to produce [ReO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, which is then reduced to the metal. Rhenium is a dense, very high melting (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>), silver-grey metal. It is alloyed with molybdenum and tungsten to provide commercially useful alloys; rhenium-tungsten alloys are used for thermocouples. Catalytic applications of rhenium are important, as are its uses in filaments for photographic flash-equipment and mass spectrometers.</p>

The metal is lustrous, blue-white, and extremely hard, dense and high-melting (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>).

<p class="noindent">Like osmium, iridium is rare and expensive, and a major source is <i>osmiridium,</i> a native alloy comprising 15-40% osmium and 50-80% iridium. The densities of these two metals are virtually identical and they are the densest elements known. Iridium is lustrous, hard and brittle, and is difficult to work in its pure state; it is extremely resistant to corrosion, and is not attacked by air, water or acids. The metal has limited uses; it is alloyed with platinum to impart increased hardness to the latter, and is used in the form of an osmium-iridium alloy in pen-nibs.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two natural isotopes of iridium, <sup>191</sup>Ir and <sup>193</sup>Ir. Although both are NMR active, the large quadrupole moments preclude significant application in NMR spectroscopy. The <sup>193</sup>Ir nucleus is however suitable for M&#x00F6;ssbauer spectroscopy.</p>

<p class="noindent">Native platinum occurs associated with other platinum-group metals, and <i>sperrylite</i> (PtAs<sub>2</sub>) is an important platinum-bearing ore. Platinum is a silver-coloured metal, malleable and ductile, and is widely used for the manufacture of wires, electrodes, jewellery and thermocouples. It is inert in air, withstanding oxidation even at high temperatures. It has an important role as a catalyst, both for chemical transformations in industry and in motor vehicle catalytic converters. Clinical uses of platinum-containing compounds ate significant; cisplatin <b>1.1</b> has been applied as an anti-tumour drug since the 1960s and carboplatin <b>1.2</b> is similarly used with the advantage that it appears to have fewer side effects than cisplatin.</p>
