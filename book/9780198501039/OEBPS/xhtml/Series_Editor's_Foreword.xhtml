<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of current understanding of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Catherine Housecroft has provided an essential guide to second and third row transition element chemistry, which incorporates a fine overview of the structures and reactivity of this important part of the Periodic Table.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Much of Catherine&#x2019;s own research has involved these elements, giving her an excellent background for writing this text. Her previous Primers have been note-worthy for the high quality of their presentation, and this book is a worthy addition to those.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Companion books covering the first row transition elements and the f-block elements will succeed this volume. Transition-element chemistry is universal in undergraduate chemistry courses, and this suite is perhaps the most approachable and up-to-date companion to these courses.</p>
