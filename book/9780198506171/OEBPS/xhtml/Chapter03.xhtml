<p class="noindent">The primary purpose of a titration is to measure an unknown amount of a  substance in a sample through chemical reaction with a known amount of a suitable reagent,in such a way that we can observe when an equivalent amount of reagent has been added to the sample. From a knowledge of that <i>equivalence point</i> we can then determine the unknown amount. Typically, a known volume of sample is taken, so that the unknown <i>amount</i> is the product of the <i>known</i> sample <i>volume V<sub>s</sub></i> and the <i>unknown</i> sample <i>concentration C<sub>s</sub>.</i> When the equivalence point is reached after reaction of a volume <i>V<sub>t</sub></i> of titrant of concentration <i>C<sub>t</sub>,</i> the two amounts are related to each other through the appropriate <i>stoichiometric factor s.</i> For the titration of a monoprotic acid with a monoprotic base the stoichiometric factor s is 1, for the titration of citric acid with NaOH, <i>s</i> will be 3 (but 1 or 2 for thetitration with NaOH of the equally triprotic H<sub>3</sub>P0<sub>4</sub>, depending on which equivalence point we use), for the titration of a monoprotic acid with a strong diprotic base such as calcium hydroxide we have s  &#x003D; &#x00BD;, for the titration of citric acid with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, <i>s</i> &#x003D; 3/2, and so on. We will come back to the value of <i>s</i> in <a href="#sec_3.4">Section 3.4</a>. In all cases, the unknown concentration can  be calculated as <i>C<sub>s</sub> &#x003D; sC<sub>t</sub>V<sub>t</sub>/V<sub>s</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">While this relation only yields the unknown concentration <i>C<sub>s</sub>,</i> a more complete analysis shows that a titration can provide additional information about the sample. In the case of acid-base titrations, such additional information consists of the acid dissociation constants of the sample. Indeed, titrations are often used to determine such constants.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.1">
<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space"> &#160;</span> Progress and titration curves</h2>
<p class="noindent">Below we will first consider the titration of a single, strong monoprotic acid with a single, strong monoprotic base. Subsequently we will generalize the approach to  a weak acid, to diprotic and polyprotic acids and bases, and finally to the titration of arbitrary mixtures of these. For the sake of simplicity we will, as before, restrict  the discussion  to aqueous solutions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The simplest titration is that of a single, strong monoprotic acid with a single, strong monoprotic base. In order to make the discussion more concrete, we will use  HC1 and NaOH as our model strong acid and strong base respectively. We will place a sample volume <i>V<sub>a</sub></i> containing the acid HC1 of (as yet unknown)  concentration <i>C<sub>a</sub></i> in a titration vessel. We will fill a buret with a solution containing the base NaOH  at a known concentration <i>C<sub>b</sub>.</i> During the titration we gradually add base from the buret to the sample, all the time measuring the total volume <i>V<sub>b</sub></i>  dispensed from the buret.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Since material is added to the sample from the outside, we have what is called an <i>open</i> system, and we must accordingly modify the mass balance conditions. In the present example this is most readily done by considering the<i>spectator ions</i>  Cl<sup>&#x203E;</sup>  and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, so called because they do not participate in the titration reactions.<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Titrations</a></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Let the original sample have a volume <i>V<sub>a</sub></i> and contain a concentration <i>C<sub>a</sub> </i>of HCI. For a strong acid, which is fully dissociated, this implies [Cl<sup>&#x203E;</sup>] &#x003D; <i>C<sub>a</sub>.</i> Upon addition of a volume <i>V<sub>b</sub></i> of base NaOH, the total volume in the titration vessel increases from <i>V<sub>a</sub></i> to <i>V<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;V<sub>b</sub>.</i> Since the total amount of CL<sup>&#x203E;</sup> in the vessel remains constant, its concentration is diluted by a factor<i>V<sub>a</sub>/(V<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;V<sub>b</sub>).</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">There is a similar dilution of the sodium ions of the titrant upon its addition to the sample: when the titrant has a sodium concentration <i>C<sub>b</sub>,</i> the corresponding concentration in the titration vessel will be diluted by a factor V<sub>b</sub>/(V<sub>a</sub>&#x002B;V<sub>b</sub>). Consequently we have the mass balance equations</p>

<p class="noindent">which is in a form we will use throughout this Chapter. Note that <i>C<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>a</sub> </i>are the concentration and volume of the<i>original</i> sample, while <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> denotes the concentration of the base<i>in the buret</i>. All three are therefore constant during the titration, and the only parameter that changes is the volume <i>V<sub>b</sub></i> of base added to the titration vessel. As before, we use A as a convenient shorthand notation for [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] &#x002D; [OH<sup>&#x203E;</sup> ] &#x003D; [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] &#x002D;K<sub>w</sub>/[H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>].</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Equation (<a href="#eq_3.4">3.4</a>) describes the volume<i>V<sub>b</sub></i> added during the titration in terms [H <sup>&#x002B;</sup>] and the constants <i>V<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>b</sub>,</i> and <i>V<sub>b</sub></i> specifying the particular experimental conditions used. The experimental procedure usually works the other way around: we add a given   volume <i>V</i><sub>b</sub>, and record the resulting pH. While, in this particular example, it is easy to invert eqn(<a href="#eq_3.4">3.4</a>) to find an explicit expression for [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] in terms of <i>C<sub>a</sub>, V</i><sub>a</sub>,<i>C</i><sub>b</sub>,   and <i>V</i><sub>b</sub>, in general this approach leads to quite complicated expressions. We will not pursue these here, because our purpose is to explain the general formalism rather than a particular solution of limited applicability.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In chemical experiments we quite often do not interpret our data in precisely the same format in which the experiment is performed, but instead analyze them in a framework that is most convenient to us. For example, we seldom attempt to interpret the measured transmittance of a spectrometric <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Titrations</a>analysis, but rather the resulting absorbance. In that case we let the instrument perform the mathematical <i>transformation</i> from transmittance to absorbance for us. Likewise few will use the interferogram of Fourier-transform infrared experiment, or the free induction decay of a Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance experiment. In these instances, virtually all users will let the instrument provide the transform which, in this case, is so important that it has lent its name to the entire method.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the case of acid-base titrations, the transform is about as simple as it can be, because it merely involves an<i>interchange of the axes.</i> While such an interchange may seem trivial, we will see below that it allows us to cast the description of titrations in a simple, unifying, general formalism.</p>

Determining the equivalence point</h2>
<p class="noindent">The primary purpose of an analytical titration is to determine the equivalence point or, more precisely, the corresponding titrant volume<i>V<sub>e</sub>.</i> For the titration of a single, concentrated strong acid and base, such as depicted in <a href="#fig_3.1a">Fig. 3.1</a>, the location of the equivalence point is obvious, and is characterized by a very  large change d(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub>, where<i>V<sub>t</sub></i> is the volume of titrant added. In fact, methods to determine the equivalence point are sometimes based on this derivative, d(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub>, see below in paragraph <a href="#sec_3.2b">3.2b</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In other cases, the equivalence point is more difficult to pin down. Fortu-nately there are a number of different methods to determine the equivalence point. We will here describe several of these, and compare them critically.</p>

Methods for detecting a specific pH</h3>
<p class="noindent">Since titrations are primarily used as quantitative tools, one will  usually have a fair estimate of the pH at the equivalence point. In that case one can simply  use a pH meter equipped with an alarm system to alert the user that a particular pH value has  been crossed. This can easily be automated, so that the titration stops at that point, and  starts a sequence in which the dispensed titrant volume is recorded, the titration vessel  cleaned, a new sample introduced, and a new titration started. There is nothing wrong with this method, as long as it operates in a region where the titration curve is so steep that  errors due to noise in the pH readings (typically mostly from insufficiently fast mixing of   dded titrant) and drift in the pH meter remain insignificant.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">An equivalent method is to use a color indicator, although in this  case the endpoint indication is much less sharp (since the indicator color changes  gradually) and the options for setting a particular equivalence point pH are limited by  the available indicator <i>pK<sub>a</sub>-</i>values. Moreover, the indicator is itself  titrated, and therefore should be present only at a concentration much smaller than that  of the sample, a factor that restricts indicators to highly colored species, i.e., to those with molar absorptivities of the order of at least 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x203E;1</sup>  cm<sup>-1</sup>. For the above reasons, the use of visual color indicators is usually inferior in precision to using a pH-meter as a level-crossing detector. On the other hand, color indicators have the advantage that they require no instrumentation.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_3.3b">
<h3 class="h3">3.3b<span class="space"> &#160;</span> Methods for detecting another equivalence point property</h3>
<p class="noindent">The pH at the equivalence point is a (weak) function of the sample  concentration, and therefore cannot be known precisely in advance of the titration. A method that does not have this problem, and is also not influenced by drift in the pH meter,  is to use the first or second derivative of the titration curve, d(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub> or  d<sup>2</sup>(pH)/d<i>V<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>.</i> In that case it is customary   to associate the equivalence point with the maximum value in d(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub>  or the  zero-crossing of d<sup>2</sup>(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>. Meites and Goldman showed that the maximum in d(pH)/dV<sub>t</sub> does<i>not</i> coincide exactly with the equivalence point,although the difference is often negligibly small. A more serious disadvantage of these  methods is that they are very sensitive to noise. Unfortunately, the dominant noise in  an acid-base titration is due to incomplete mixing, and is maximal at the equivalence point, where the buffer strength of the test solution is minimal. The process of taking the derivative further enhances the noise. The method is therefore not very robust.</p>

Methods using a subset of the titration curve</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most prominent methods in this category are those of Gran, and  use linear extrapolation of the data before or after the equivalence point to find the  equivalence volume<i>V<sub>e</sub>.</i> They are based on approximations to the titration  curves of monoprotic acids and bases either <i>before</i> of <i>after</i> the equivalence   point, as listed in <a href="#table_3.1">Table 3.1</a>.

<p class="indent3-ka">The most robust and by far the most general method available so far appears to be a non-linear least-squares fit to the entire titration curve. This method only requires that one knows what <i>type</i> of sample to expect: one clearly cannot expect to fit the titration of a triprotic acid with the equation for a diprotic one.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">However, this method has some peculiar pitfalls, related to the properties of the theoretical expressions at physically nonrealizable pH regions. When these problems are avoided (as they always can), this appears to be a very powerful gener al method of fitting titration data.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Here is the problem: the expressions for <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub></i> or <i>V<sub>a</sub>V<sub>b</sub></i> developed in <a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a> have no inherent constraints on the values of [H<sup>+</sup>]. However, any real, physical system does have such constraints: 0.1 M acetic acid has a pH of 
2.88, and its titration with 0.1 M NaOH can never bring the pH below 2.88 or above 13, the pH of the undiluted titrant. The expression for <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub></i> will yield <i>negative</i> values when used with pH-values smaller than 2.88 or larger than 13. While these would alert the user that the computed results are not physically realizable, such non-realizable values can be taken at face value by a nai&#x2019;ve least-squares routine. Moreover, since the deviant values can be quite large, they may dominate the least-squares fit, which is extra sensitive to large deviations, since it tries to minimize their even larger <i>squares.</i> These problems can be avoided by judicious data analysis, as described in detail in my book <i>Excel in Analytical Chemistry</i> (de Levie 1999c). When that is done, a general data fitting routine results which is remarkably insensitive to noise, and applicable to any acid-base titration problem. <a href="#fig_3.8">Figure 3.8</a> illustrates the noise-tolerance of this method.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">As already indicated, there are uses of titrations beyond concentration determinations. The most prominent of these is the determination of equilibrium constants. Such constants cannot be obtained from the equivalence points, but require analysis of data in the so-called buffer regions where d(pH)/<i>dV<sub>t</sub></i> is small. Gran and Schwartz plots can be used to generate values<a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Titrations</a>for <i>K<sub>a</sub>,</i> insofar as one deals with either monoprotic acids or bases, or with polyprotic acids and bases with widely spaced p<i>K<sub>a</sub>-</i>values, so that the various neutralization processes are essentially uncoupled from each other, and therefore appear as well-separated processes in the titration curve. The most general method is, again, a non-linear least-squares fit of the data to an appropriate expression for the progress of the titration, in which case the computer program will determine the best-fitting values of the equilibrium constants. As already mentioned in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.7">Section 2.7</a>, many special programs have also been written for this purpose.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.4 <b>Diagrams and titrations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is useful to try to correlate the progress or titrations curves to the logarith-mic concentration diagram of the sample. Strictly speaking this cannot be done, since the logarithmic concentration diagram reflects the properties of a single solution, whereas a titration necessarily involves two different solutions that are being mixed and then react during the titration. In practice, however, we will typically select as titrant a single strong acid or base. Moreover, dilution effects are usually small, and certainly can be made to be so by using a titrant that is much more concentrated than the sample. Under such simplifying conditions, we can look at the logarithmic concentration diagram of the sample to see whether a titration is possible. If a titration is not feasible under those favorable conditions, it certainly will not be possible when dilution is taken into account, when the titrant is a weak acid or base, etc.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Consider the logarithmic concentration diagram of 0.1 M acetic acid in 
<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.7a">Figs. 1.7</a>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.1">2.1</a>, and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">2.2</a>. A solution of 0.1 M acetic acid has a pH of 2.88, as indicated by point <i>b</i> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>. Halfway to the equivalence point, about half of the acetic acid has been deprotonated, i.e., [HAc] &#x2248; [Ac<sup>-</sup>] so that pH &#x2248; p<i>K<sub>a</sub> </i>&#x003D; 4.76. At the equivalence point all acetic acid has been reacted to sodium acetate, and (apart from dilution) the pH will therefore be 8.88, see point <i>d</i> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. At 100&#x0025; excess of titrant (and again neglecting dilution effects) we have a solution 0.1 M in NaAc and 0.1 M in NaOH, so that the pH will be 13, point <i>e</i> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. Therefore we see that the entire pH swing near the equivalence point must be contained between points <i>c</i> (at 50&#x0025; completion of the titration) and <i>e</i> (at 200&#x0025; completion) in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. We can use that distance as a rough measure of the <i>steepness</i> of the titration. In fact, it is more convenient to take a related distance that is uniquely related to the equiva-lence point, and it is customary to use as such the vertical distance between the line at log <i>c &#x003D;</i> log <i>C</i> and the particular point in the diagram that represents the equivalence point, i.e., point <i>d</i> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>. That vertical distance is precisely half that between points <i>c</i> and <i>e.</i> We will therefore define the <i>titration steepness S<sub>t</sub></i> as C/[H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, where [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>e</sub> is the value of [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] at the equivalence point.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_3.10">Figures 3.10</a> and <a href="#fig_3.11">3.11</a> illustrate how the steepness as estimated from a logarithmic concentration diagram can guide us in determining what equiva-lence point(s) to use for a polyprotic acid or base. In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig_2.21">Figures 2.21</a> and <a href="#fig_3.10">3.10</a> we see that the titration of phosphoric acid to its third equivalence point has virtually no steepness; indeed, one usually cannot even observe any change of slope in the titration curve at that point, see <a href="#fig_3.4b">Fig. 3.4b</a>. Titrating to the first equivalence point <i>(s &#x003D;</i> 1 when the titrant is a monoprotic base) is fine, and titrating to the second equivalence point <i>(s &#x003D;</i> 2) is equally satisfactory, but will consume more titrant. With citric acid the situation is just the reverse: the first two equivalence points are useless, as one can anticipate from the logarithmic concentration diagram in <a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11a</a>. The steepness at the third equivalence point is fine, and titrating to that third equivalence point is indeed very suitable, see <a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11b</a>. If the titrant in that case is NaOH, the value of the stoichometric factor <i>s</i> is 3; if the titrant were, say, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, we would have <i>s &#x003D;</i> 3/2.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">We can also use logarithmic concentration diagrams to explore how to titrate acid salts, which in principle can be titrated with either acid or base. <a href="#fig_3.12">Figure 3.12</a> shows the logarithmic concentration diagram for phthalic acid. Titrating potassium hydrogen phthalate with strong acid would get us to point a in the diagram, with little steepness; titrating with strong base yields equivalence point <i>b</i> with a titration steepness <i>S<sub>t</sub></i> of the order of 10<sup>4</sup>, sufficient for use as a primary standard for the standardization of strong bases.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.5 <b>Titration errors</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As in any quantitative method, there are several possible sources of errors that must be avoided in order to realize results of high accuracy and preci-sion. These sources of error depend on the method used.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">When we use a color indicator, the dominant errors are so-called <i>indicator errors</i>, resulting from a mismatch between the equivalence point pH and the p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> of the indicator used, and from the width of the pH range over which the color changes. The formalism of <a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a> makes it simple to estimate the resulting systematic (determinate) errors, because we use the pH values bracketing the indicator range, and compute the resulting values of <i>V<sub>t</sub>/V<sub>S</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">For example, consider the titration of 0.1 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH, using as indicator phenolphthalein, with a reported transition range from pH 8.2 to pH 9.8. Substituting <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; 10<sup>-4.76</sup>, and [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] &#x003D; 10<sup>-8.2</sup> into <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq_1.23">eqns (1.23)</a> and <a href="#eq_3.8">(3.8)</a> yields <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub> &#x003D;</i> 0.9997, while we find <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; 1.0013 for [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] &#x003D; 10<sup>-9.8</sup>, so that the resulting errors are of the order of 0.1&#x0025; and therefore quite acceptable. However, when we repeat this exercise for <i>C<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; <i>C<sub>b</sub> &#x003D;</i> 1 mM, we calculate <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; 1.0030 and <i>V<sub>b</sub>/V<sub>a</sub> &#x003D;</i> 1.1347 respectively, because the pH of the equivalence point has now moved outside the indicator range. <a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Titrations</a>A possible maximal titration error of 13.5&#x0025; is clearly unacceptable, and for the latter titration one should use a more appropriate indicator, with a range around the equivalence point pH of about 7.88, such as cresol purple.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">With potentiometric titrations, improper design of the titration cell, and specifically the relative placements of the stirrer, buret tip, and sensing pH electrode in that cell, are often a dominant source of both lag and noise in the pH readings, especially in an automated titration. As can be seen in <a href="#fig_3.7b">Fig. 3.7b</a>, the various analysis methods differ greatly in their sensitivity to noise, i.e., to random (indeterminate) errors. Moreover, offset due to drift or lack of proper calibration can also lead to significant systematic errors, and likewise affects the various methods to different extents. For example, while methods based on the first or second derivative are most sensitive to noise, they are rather insensitive to the effects of drift, and totally immune to the effects of offset. On the other hand, Gran and Schwartz plots involve computing the proton concentration from the measured pH, a calculation that can introduce rather large errors even for pH readings that are only slightly off. As with all quan-titative methods, high-quality results are obtained only with proper experi-ment design, continuous vigilance, and repeated calibration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.6 <b>The traditional approach</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The treatment of titrations given so far is quite different from that found in most textbooks. For the sake of completeness we will here summarize the more traditional approach, and then use the opportunity to highlight the dif-ferences.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">First we reconsider the titration of HC1 with NaOH as the prototypical neutralization of a strong acid by a strong base. We subdivide the problem into two parts, i.e., the curve before and after the equivalence point.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">For the section of the titration curve between the start of the titration and the equivalence point we calculate the proton concentration as follows. The total amount of acid is <i>C<sub>a</sub>V<sub>a</sub>,</i> and after addition of a volume <i>V<sub>h</sub></i> of base the remaining amount of excess acid is <i>C<sub>a</sub>V<sub>a</sub> - C<sub>b</sub>V<sub>b</sub>.</i> Since the volume of the partially titrated sample is now <i>V<sub>a</sub></i> &#x002B; <i>V<sub>b</sub>,</i> the hydrogen concentration is</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.35" style="width:70%;text-align:right">
<img src="../images/eq_46_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">For the section of the titration curve past the equivlence point, the same logic is applied to the
excess amount of base is <i>C<sub>b</sub> V<sub>b</sub> - C<sub>a</sub> V<sub>a</sub></i>, so that we obtain</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.36" style="width:70%;text-align:right">

<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.37" style="width:70%;text-align:right">
<img src="../images/eq_46_3.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent">At the equivalence point we have <i>C<sub>a</sub>V<sub>a</sub></i> &#x003D; <i>C<sub>b</sub>V<sub>b</sub>,</i> and at that point eqn <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Titrations</a><a href="#eq_3.35">(3.35)</a> yields [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] &#x003D; 0 while <a href="#eq_3.36">eqn (3.36)</a> leads to [OH<sup>-</sup> ] &#x003D; 0 and <a href="#eq_3.37">eqn (3.37)</a> to [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] <b>&#x003D; &#x221E;.</b> Such results are obviously erroneous (the correct answer being [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] &#x003D; [OH<sup>-</sup>] &#x003D; <i>&#x221A;K<sub>w</sub> &#x003D;</i> 10<sup>-7</sup> M), and in this approach the equivalence point is therefore treated separately. We note that <a href="#eq_3.35">eqn (3.35)</a> is identical to <a href="#eq_3.26">eqn (3.26)</a>, and that, likewise, <a href="#eq_3.36">eqns (3.36)</a> and <a href="#eq_3.37">(3.37)</a> are fully equivalent to <a href="#eq_3.28">eqns (3.28)</a> and <a href="#eq_3.29">(3.29)</a>.</p>

Again, the logarithmic concentration diagram shows which titration is feasible.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Next we consider the titration of a weak acid with a strong base. For the part of the titration curve before the equivalence point, one often neglects the autodissociation of the weak acid, and furthermore assumes that the amount of acid anions is fully equivalent to the amount of base added during the ti-tration. Such reasoning, which does not show precisely what assumptions are made, but is equivalent to those underlying <a href="#eq_3.32">eqn (3.32)</a>, leads to</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="eq_3.38" style="width:70%;text-align:right">
<img src="../images/eq_47_1.jpg" alt="images"/></figure>
<p class="noindent">while the part beyond the equivalence point is assumed to be given by <a href="#eq_3.36">eqn (3.36)</a> or <a href="#eq_3.37">(3.37)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In this case there is an additional problem: not only does <a href="#eq_3.38">eqn (3.38)</a> yield [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ] &#x003D; 0 at the equivalence point, but it also gives an incorrect answer for the onset of the titration, where <i>V<sub>b</sub> &#x003D;</i> 0 so that <a href="#eq_3.38">eqn (3.38)</a> goes to infinity. (The identical Gran expression <a href="#eq_3.32">(3.32)</a> has the same problem, which is why the initial part of the Granl plot for the titration of a weak acid must always be excluded from the linear analysis.) So now we need two points, at the beginning of the titration and at the equivalence point, and two approximate segments that neither join nor pass through those points.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Perhaps this is also why misconceptions, such as that the maximum in d(pH)/d<i>V<sub>t</sub></i>, coincides with the equivalence point, can survive. Since neither curve section goes through the equivalence point, and methods to determine the derivative of a single, isolated point have yet to be developed, such a (false) statement cannot be falsified&#x0021;</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Quantitative comparison of <a href="#eq_3.38">eqn (3.38)</a> with the exact result shows that <a href="#eq_3.38">eqn (3.38)</a> can be quite far off, especially for not very weak acids, as illus-trated in <a href="#fig_3.13">Fig. 3.13</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">

([<i>H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]&#x002B;K<sub>a</sub></i>)&#x007D; (thin line). The latter is only close just before the equivalence point.</figcaption></figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Clearly the above, piecemeal approach is flawed. It gets even more awk-ward and approximate when applied to polyprotic acids: for phosphoric acid, one would need four approximate segments plus four single points (the starting point of the titration, and the three equivalence points). For citric acid (a triprotic acid with p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>s that lie close together) even that method fails miserably. Moreover, it is not clear how this approach can be extended to mixtures.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In short, since the traditional approach is of limited applicability, is often quite inaccurate, and at any rate is more complicated than the exact results of <a href="#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>, there seems to be no good reason why it should still be propa-gated or used. As Ricci wrote in the introduction to his 1952 book on <i>Hydrogen Ion Concentration, New Concepts in a Systematic Treatment</i>: &#x201C;To derive<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Titrations</a>approximate practical formulas by simplification of exact mathematical equations is a legitimate and safe procedure, but to derive practical formulas on the basis of approximate thinking is unsafe, unsound, and in this case un-necessary.&#x201D; It is regrettable that this advice has been ignored for so long, especially in a discipline that values precision and accuracy.</p>
