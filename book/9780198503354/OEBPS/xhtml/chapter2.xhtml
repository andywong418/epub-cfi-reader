<p class="noindent">Spectroscopic experiments demonstrate that energy can be absorbed or emitted by molecules and atoms in discrete amounts, corresponding to precise changes in energy of the molecule or atom concerned; this is a fundamental part of <b>quantum theory.</b> We can measure precisely the amounts of energy involved because when a certain amount of energy is emitted (for example), the energy appears as electromagnetic radiation of a precise frequency (<a href="#eqn_2.1">Eqn 2.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">As will be shown in the following chapters, molecules and atoms are found to absorb only certain energies (frequencies) but not others; similarly, under certain circumstances, discrete frequencies in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are emitted.</p>

<h2 class="h2" style="width:55%;"><b>2.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Electromagnetic radiation: energy, frequency, and wavelength</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Visible light is just one of the possible forms of electromagnetic radiation, a fact which is essential to the understanding of spectroscopic and diffraction methods for studying molecular structure. Other forms of this radiation &#x2014; like X-rays, ultraviolet and infra-red radiation, microwaves, and radiowaves &#x2014; may be characterized in different ways and may have different applications, but they are essentially the same phenomenon. All forms are characterized by their <b>frequency</b> (and hence <b>wavelength)</b> and their <b>energy</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">That different types of radiation possess different energies is not difficult to appreciate (X-rays and ultraviolet radiation can cause much more damage to human tissues than does visible radiation) and it can also be demonstrated convincingly that radiation is wave-like in nature. For example, when light from a single source passes through two narrow parallel slits and then falls on a screen behind the slits, an interference pattern of dark and light lines is produced (Young&#x2019;s slits experiment). In an analogous fashion it can be shown that when a beam of X-rays is incident on a powdered solid, the atoms or ions in the latter behave as a diffraction grating and an interference pattern of maxima and minima is obtained in the reflected X-ray beam. The eye cannot see the interference pattern because X-rays are not visible, but a photographic film is darkened by the reflected beam and reveals the pattern resulting from the interference.</p>
<p class="indent">Electromagnetic radiation consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields which can be transmitted through space. In a vacuum all electromagnetic radiation travels with the same velocity, 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. The oscillations associated with different types of electromagnetic radiation proceed in a <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Introduction to spectroscopic techniques</a>wave-like fashion with different <i>wavelengths</i> (the distance between successive peaks) and <i>frequencies</i> (the number of waves passing a given point per second: the relationship between <i>c,</i> the velocity, <i>&#x03BB;</i>, the wavelength, and <i>v</i>, the frequency, is given in <a href="#eqn_2.2">Equation 2.2</a>. <i>&#x03BB;</i> has the units of length (normally m) and <i>v</i> has the units of time <sup>&#x2013;1</sup> [normally s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> or Hz (Hertz)].</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> summarizes the approximate ranges of the wavelengths for the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. X-rays, for example, are characterized by a very short wavelength (<i>&#x03BB;</i> is about 10<sup>&#x2013;9</sup> m, i.e. 1 nm) and a correspondingly high frequency and energy. Visible light has longer wavelengths, from about 400 nm (which is violet light) to about 750 nm (the red end of the visible part of the spectrum). Radio waves have much greater wavelengths &#x2014; of the order of metres.</p>
<p class="indent">In some parts of the spectrum the radiation is customarily referred to in terms of its frequency; radiowaves with <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 100 m have <i>v</i> &#x003D; 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> Hz, i.e. 3 MHz.</p>
<p class="indent">Spectroscopists sometimes also characterize radiation via the reciprocal wavelength, known as the <b>wavenumber</b> <i>&#x1FE1;</i>; like frequency, wavenumber is directly proportional to energy. Because of its almost universal usage for infra-red radiation the wavenumber will be retained here in that context. The unit customarily employed is cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, i.e. waves per centimetre; if <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 10<sup>&#x2013;6</sup> m, the wavenumber, <i>&#x1FE1;</i>, is 10<sup>4</sup>cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Atomic and molecular energy levels</b></h2>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Atoms</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Our knowledge of the well-defined energy levels for electrons in atoms originates in spectroscopic observations on the radiation emitted when atoms or ions become excited. Think of the simple flame test for alkali metals; for example, a small quantity of a sodium salt, when placed in a flame, appears yellow. This is because sodium atoms are formed and, at the high temperature of the flame, these become excited by absorption of energy; this energy is subsequently emitted as radiation in the visible region. The experiment can be carried out more precisely by analysing the emitted radiation in terms of the frequencies (and hence wavelengths) present; the radiation is incident on a prism which disperses radiation of different wavelengths in different directions (like Newton&#x2019;s experiment to produce all the colours in the visible spectrum from &#x2018;white&#x2019; light). The instrument which is used to investigate this is called a spectroscope (hence the term <i>spectroscopy</i> for studies of this kind) and the resulting radiation (not all of which will be in the visible region) can be detected with a photographic film.</p>
<p class="indent">It can then be demonstrated that from excited atoms only certain wavelengths are emitted: the resulting plot of wavelength contains several discrete values or &#x2018;lines&#x2019; &#x2014; these are typical line-spectra. In the example of the sodium flame (and, in terms of a useful application, the sodium-vapour street lamp), the orange colour derives mainly from the intense emission with <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 589 nm. Line-spectra can be used to identify different elements present (e.g. in a vaporized sample) and also, under certain circumstances, to determine the amount of a particular material present (from the intensity of the radiation associated with a particular transition).</p>
<p class="indent">The spectra can also be interpreted in terms of the energy levels associated with electrons in various shells (or orbitals) in the atom concerned. For example, the emission with <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 589 nm for the sodium atom corresponds to the energy emitted when an electron which has been promoted to a 3<i>p</i> orbital returns to the lower energy 3<i>s</i> orbital. The energy change can be larger if &#x2018;inner&#x2019; electrons are involved; for example, bombardment of copper with electrons leads to the ejection of an inner (1<i>s</i>) electron and the resulting transition of an outer electron from a higher energy level down to this vacancy, for example from 2<i>p</i> to 1<i>s,</i> leads to the emission of X-rays (<i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 0.15 nm in this case).</p>
<p class="indent">Absorption of exact amounts of energy &#x2014; a process leading to a transition <i>from</i> a lower <i>to</i> a higher energy level &#x2014; is also possible. A clear example here is provided by the <b>Fraunhofer</b> lines: in the otherwise continuous spectrum of visible radiation from the sun, several wavelengths are missing. These correspond exactly to lines in the emission spectra of various atoms, including hydrogen. The explanation is that the continuous radiation from the sun passes through its atmosphere which contains these atoms; the atoms absorb energy of discrete wavelengths which are then missing from the radiation reaching the earth. This provides a method for detecting gases in the atmosphere of the sun. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) similarly provides a useful method for determining the concentration of, for example, trace metals in aqueous solutions. <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Introduction to spectroscopic techniques</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Molecules</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">It can also be shown that <i>molecules</i> have certain exact energies, and absorption of the relevant frequencies from incident radiation raises molecules from lower to higher levels: absorptions may be detected in three different areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the <b>electrons</b> in molecules occupy molecular orbitals with precise energy levels (cf. electrons in atomic orbitals). Transitions from lower, filled orbitals to upper (higher energy) empty orbitals usually involve absorption of radiation in the <i>ultraviolet</i> (u.v.) and <i>visible</i> parts of the spectrum. This is the basis of electronic absorption spectroscopy, described in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Much smaller quantities of energy are associated with changes in the <b>rotational</b> energy of a molecule (which is allowed only certain well-defined values) and in its <b>vibrational</b> energy (which is also quantized). This second area of interest is concerned with precise energy absorption in the <i>infra-red</i> (i.r.) part of the spectrum. How the measurement and interpretation of these energy changes in molecules leads to structural information is described in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The energy changes associated with certain <b>nuclei</b> in magnetic fields are smaller still and occur in the radio-frequency region. This is the basis of <i>nuclear magnetic resonance</i> spectroscopy, n.m.r. (<a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Differences in the magnitudes of the energy changes involved dictate the necessity for different instrumental arrangements for u.v. (and visible), i.r. and n.m.r. spectroscopy. Understanding why a particular wavelength of radiation is emitted (or absorbed) then leads to detailed information about the molecules involved and provides a key to the investigation of their structure.</p>
