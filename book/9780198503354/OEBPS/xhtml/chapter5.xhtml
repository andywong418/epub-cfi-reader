<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the first nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) experiment was successfully demonstrated in 1946, the technique has become so powerful that it plays an essential role in modern research. Indeed, n.m.r. and mass spectroscopy now have no real rivals as the techniques most widely applicable for the solution of structural problems, and their use is now a routine matter. In the form of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), n.m.r. has moved from the realm of research to become an essential feature of modem medicine.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The n.m.r. experiment</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">At the heart of each n.m.r. experiment lies the nucleus of an atom. An atom can be thought of as a sea of negatively charged electrons surrounding a positively charged nucleus which is itself composed of protons (positively charged) and neutrons. It has been found that nuclei which contain an odd number of protons or an odd number of neutrons (or both) possess an extra property, in addition to their charge, which can be demonstrated by a suitable experiment. They can be shown to have a <b>magnetic moment,</b> which means that in the simplest case they behave like tiny bar magnets. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by detecting the energy of interaction when they are placed between the pole-pieces of a magnet. As happens when a simple bar magnet is placed in the magnetic field of a second magnet, the distinction between attractive and repulsive interactions can be detected.</p>
<p class="indent">The hydrogen atom, <sup>1</sup>H, has a single proton for its nucleus and hence has a magnetic moment. In the presence of an externally applied magnetic field the magnetic moment experiences an interaction which results in it becoming aligned either parallel to or opposed to the direction of the applied field. This picture of two allowed orientations is also valid for <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P, and <sup>15</sup>N, but for nuclei like <sup>2</sup>H the situation is more complex.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-8.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent3">It will be helpful to remember that a magnetic moment (or field) is associated with a body which is charged and in motion (cf. the magnetic field from electrons moving in a wire). This requires the <sup>1</sup>H nucleus to be spinning in one of two directions.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The two possible alignments of the magnetic moment of the hydrogen nucleus <sup>1</sup>H are represented diagrammatically in <a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>. These arrangements have different <i>energies</i>, and an exact amount of energy is necessary to twist the magnet from one position to the other, i.e. from the attractive to the repulsive situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Now for a magnetic moment <i>&#x03BC;</i> the component in the direction of the applied field is <i>&#x002B;&#x03BC;</i> (designated <i>&#x03B1;</i>) or &#x2013;<i>&#x03BC;</i> (designated <i>&#x03B2;</i>), depending on whether it is parallel or anti-parallel to it. The energies of these two arrangements of the magnet are &#x2013;<i>&#x03BC;B</i><sub>0</sub> (aligned) and <i>&#x002B;&#x03BC;B</i><sub>0</sub> (opposed) respectively, where <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> is the magnetic flux density of the applied field. The energy difference between the two arrangements is <i>2&#x03BC;B</i><sub>0</sub> and this amount of energy (as radiation of the corresponding frequency, see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#page_19">page 19</a>) is necessary to invert<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>the proton&#x2019;s magnetic moment from the position of lower energy to that of higher energy. The exact condition is then:</p>

<p class="indent">The simplest way in which the n.m.r. experiment may be carried out is to vary the magnetic field and keep the applied frequency <i>v</i> constant in a search for the exact condition when absorption of energy leads to &#x2018;flipping&#x2019; of the hydrogen atom&#x2019;s magnetic moment. In this experiment a radiofrequency oscillator is the source of electromagnetic radiation of fixed frequency <i>v</i> and an electromagnet is employed to generate the variable magnetic field (see <a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). The external magnetic field strength <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> is then varied until the radiofrequency radiation matches the energy difference &#x0394;<i>E</i> and it is absorbed (at resonance); at this point an imbalance is produced in a radiofrequency bridge, and the resulting signal can be amplified and fed to a recorder as a plot of absorption of energy against frequency.</p>

This method of data measurement offers many benefits and is discussed later in <a href="chapter5.xhtml#sec_5.6">Section 5.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice, signals can be readily detected for the hydrogen atoms in a small quantity (<i>ca.</i> 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) of a suitable solvent which would normally have no hydrogen atoms and therefore no absorption in this region. Signals can be detected from substrates at low concentration (<i>c. sub-</i>millimolar) which means that n.m.r. spectra can be recorded even when only a few milligrams of compound are available.</p>

<p class="indent">This relationship is generally applicable to the statistical distribution of particles between possible energy levels, and it tells us, for example, that for an energy difference (&#x0394;<i>E</i>) which is large compared with the typical thermal energy of the molecules (&#x007E; <i>kT</i>)<i>,</i> the lower energy level is much more highly populated. However, for hydrogen atoms at room temperature in a typical magnetic field, &#x0394;<i>&#x0395;</i> is considerably smaller than <i>kT</i>: the ratio <i>N</i><sub>u</sub><i>/N</i><sub>1</sub> is nearly unity and the population of hydrogen atoms is almost equally divided between the two energy levels. For a million hydrogen atoms, there will be just a few more in the lower level than in the upper level. When irradiation of the sample with radiation at the resonance frequency (<i>v</i>) takes place, transitions in both upward and downward directions occur (that is, absorption and emission take place). Overall <b>absorption</b> results because of the slight excess of nuclei in the lower level.</p>
<p class="indent">The smaller the ratio <i>N</i><sub>u</sub><i>/N</i><sub>1</sub>, the greater is the sensitivity (i.e. the greater the excess in the lower level); as will be seen from <a href="#eqn_5.2">eqn 5.2</a>, this means that a higher applied field (and higher <i>v</i>, therefore) provides an advantage in sensitivity.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><a id="heading-5_2"></a><b>5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span><sup>1</sup>H n.m.r. spectra of organic molecules</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">On the basis of the previous discussion it would be anticipated that, since n.m.r. is a nuclear phenomenon, the resonance condition for different hydrogen atoms in a variety of molecules should not be affected by the electronic environment of each. To a certain extent this appears to be true; that is, for a fixed frequency (<i>v</i>)<i>,</i> hydrogen atoms in a variety of molecules absorb energy at approximately the same value of <i>B</i><sub>0</sub><i>.</i> However, minor differences of crucial importance do exist.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, when a low-resolution n.m.r. spectrum of <i>ethanol,</i> CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, is recorded it is found that three distinct resonances occur at slightly different field strengths (the field differences between the resonances are much smaller than the magnitude of the field). The n.m.r. spectrum of ethanol is shown in <a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. The areas under the peaks are in the ratio 1:2:3, and we can conclude that the OH hydrogen atom, the two CH<sub>2</sub> hydrogen atoms, and the three CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms have separate resonances.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar observations are made for other organic molecules. For example, the spectrum of <i>2-methylpropan-2-ol</i> (t-butyl alcohol, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH), shows<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>two peaks in the ratio 9:1, and <i>diethyl ether</i>, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, exhibits a spectrum with two peaks in the ratio 3:2. In this case, the two methyl groups are in equivalent environments, but this is different from the environment of the two methene (CH<sub>2</sub>) groups.</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly, the size and direction of <i>&#x03C3;</i> (a measure of the chemical shift) determines the applied field that is needed to achieve the unique resonance condition (<i>hv &#x003D; 2&#x03BC;B<sub>effective</sub></i>) for each type of hydrogen.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>It is known that the local fields arise from electron circulations induced by the applied field, and two rather different cases can be distinguished.</p>
<p class="indent">(i) <a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a> indicates the direction of electron circulation round a nucleus that is induced by the external magnetic field for a spherical electron cloud (this corresponds effectively to an electron in the l<i>s</i>-orbital on the hydrogen atom). The electron motion creates an induced magnetic field which opposes the main field. This results in the nucleus experiencing a smaller overall field than that applied (the nucleus is said to be <i>shielded</i> from the main field) and the resonance condition can now only be achieved with a higher applied field.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure></aside>
<p class="indent">For CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH the extent of shielding differs for each type of hydrogen atom owing to different <i>electron densities</i> around the CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>, and OH hydrogen atoms. For the OH hydrogen atom the electron density around the nucleus will be relatively low owing to the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom. However, for the CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms, which are progressively further from the oxygen atom, the electron density will be progressively greater. The CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms, being most highly shielded, are in resonance at the highest field (<a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In general, we can relate the magnetic fields necessary for resonance of different hydrogen atoms to the structure of a molecule and, in particular, to the electron-withdrawing properties (negative inductive effect) of the atoms present.</p>
<p class="noindent">(ii) The second type of electron circulation which contributes to local fields in appropriate cases is that which can be induced in molecules containing double bonds (i.e. molecules containing electrons in <i>&#x03C0;</i>-orbitals). A particularly clear example is provided by the marked effect when delocalization around an aromatic ring is possible. This is called a ring current and is illustrated for benzene in <a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent3"><b>Fig 5.6</b> Induced electron circulation in benzene: the ring-current effect</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When the benzene molecule is oriented perpendicularly to the applied field, electron circulation is induced in the overlapping p(<i>&#x03C0;</i>)-orbitals and this leads to the production of local magnetic fields around the molecule. These local fields augment the applied field at the hydrogen atoms, so that they resonate at a lower external field strength. The hydrogens are said to be <i>deshielded</i>. The rapid motion of the molecules means that only for a fraction of the time is the molecule in the particular orientation depicted; nevertheless the ring-current contribution is a dominant effect and is a readily applied criterion used to distinguish aromatic protons.</p>
<p class="indent">This type of effect also contributes to the observed chemical shifts for hydrogen atoms close to carbonyl, alkynic, and certain other groups.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The measurement of chemical shifts</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Measurements of chemical shifts are not quoted in field units, because, as we have seen, the field difference (&#x0394;<i>B</i>) between two peaks depends upon the applied field (<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>) of the spectrometer employed (see <a href="#page_57">page 57</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following procedure provides a way round this problem and leads to an acceptable universal scale. First, a suitable reference compound is chosen; tetramethylsilane (TMS), Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, is widely used for <sup>1</sup>H spectra as it is inert and has a single resonance at a position which does not often overlap with<a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>other signals (there is only one type of hydrogen atom in the molecule). Then, the n.m.r. spectrum of the compound under investigation, with TMS added, is recorded. There will be a field difference &#x0394;<i>B</i> between the absorption of a hydrogen nucleus in the sample and the reference; &#x0394;<i>B/B</i><sub>0</sub> gives a measure of the chemical shift which is <i>independent of the applied field.</i> The resulting numbers are very small indeed and it is more convenient to multiply them by 10<sup>6</sup> and to refer to the resulting measure of chemical shift, <i>&#x03B4;</i>, in parts per million (p.p.m.).</p>

<p class="indent">Chemical shifts, expressed as <i>&#x03B4;</i>-values, are characteristic of the hydrogen nuclei in the compounds concerned and are independent of the spectrometer. Further, it is quite rare to find a marked dependence of the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value on solvent. Normally chemical shifts are also independent of temperature, but sometimes chemical exchange processes interfere and more complex effects are observed.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Relationship between chemical shifts and molecular structure</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The dependence of <i>&#x03B4;</i> upon molecular structure is understandable in terms of the magnitudes of the local fields produced by the electron circulation effects described earlier. For example, although a CH<sub>3</sub> group in an alkane has a characteristic <i>&#x03B4;</i> value of approximately 0.9, substitution in the molecule of a group with a negative inductive effect lowers the electron density round the hydrogen atom and hence increases the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value.</p>

Thus, along the series of halogeno-alkanes CH<sub>3</sub>X (X &#x003D; I, Br, Cl, and F) the chemical shift of the methyl group hydrogen is progressively increased (see <a href="#tab_5.1">Table 5.1</a>): the highest <i>&#x03B4;</i> value for the hydrogen atoms in fluoromethane indicates that the hydrogen atoms in this molecule are the least shielded from the external field (as expected, because fluorine is the most electron-attracting substituent).</p>
<p class="indent">The effect becomes even more pronounced when more than one electronegative element is present; for the hydrogen atom in CHCl<sub>3</sub>, for example, <i>&#x03B4;</i> &#x003D; 7.29.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the chemical shift of a hydrogen atom depends on its immediate environment within a molecule, the resonance positions of hydrogen atoms in compounds of different structural types prove diagnostically useful; some approximate values for typical groups are given in <a href="#tab_5.2">Table 5.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The increase in the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-values along the series CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;C, CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;N, and CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;O, [in alkanes, amines, and methoxy compounds (methyl ethers), respectively] again reflects the increasing negative inductive effect of the substituent group.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_60" class="page">Page 60, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>Methyl esters of alkanoic acids, RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, as might be expected, resemble methoxy compounds (methyl ethers) and have <i>&#x03B4;</i> (CH<sub>3</sub>) in the range 3.6&#x2013;3.8. In contrast, both methyl ketones and alkyl esters of ethanoic acid (acetic acid), CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R, generally show a methyl group absorption at 2.0, this being the characteristic chemical shift of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group.</p>
<p class="indent">Groups which have an inductive effect but which are further removed in the molecule have a decreased but sometimes noticeable effect: an example is the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value of 1.20 for the methyl-group hydrogen atoms in ethanol (raised from <i>ca.</i> 0.9 by the effect of oxygen, but not as high as the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value of <i>ca.</i> 3.3 for molecules in which a CH<sub>3</sub> group is directly attached to the oxygen atom).</p>
<p class="indent">Methene hydrogen atoms (CH<sub>2</sub>) have slightly higher <i>&#x03B4;</i>-values than similarly placed CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms; the characteristic <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value for a &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013; group in an alkyl chain is 1.3.</p>
<p class="indent">A hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom in the double bond of an alkene has a higher <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value (typically about 4.7) than hydrogen atoms in saturated analogues. This shift is associated with the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> rather than the <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup><i>,</i> hybridization of the alkenic carbon to which the hydrogen atom is bonded. Since few other types of hydrogen atom absorb in this area of the n.m.r. spectrum, absorptions at <i>&#x03B4;</i> <i>ca.</i> 5 have particular diagnostic value.</p>
<p class="indent">For benzene and other aromatic compounds the ring-current effect (<a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>) explains the unusually high <i>&#x03B4;</i>-values observed.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value for a hydrogen atom attached to an alkyne triple bond (<i>ca.</i> 2.0) also results from electron circulation (in the triple bond, around the molecular axis) which in this molecule provides <i>a shielding</i> effect at the hydrogen atoms. You may like to work out why the effect is opposite in direction to that observed for the hydrogen atoms in benzene.</p>
<p class="indent">When an unknown compound is studied with the aid of n.m.r. spectroscopy, the positions of the absorptions (i.e. the <i>&#x03B4;</i> values) give a fairly clear indication of the local environment of each type hydrogen atom in the molecule, and the data given in <a href="#tab_5.2">Table 5.2</a> therefore prove diagnostically useful. In addition, remember that the integration trace gives extra information on the relative numbers of hydrogen atoms in each group.</p>

<p class="indent">The n.m.r. spectrum of 1,4-dimethylbenzene (<i>p-</i>xylene) in <a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>, provides a good example of the way in which a structural analysis can be carried out. Thus, in addition to the peak at 0 <i>&#x03B4;</i> from the added standard (TMS), two<a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>absorptions are detected: the ratio of the areas under the two absorptions is 2:3, and the peak at low-field (<i>&#x03B4;</i> 7.05) is good evidence for the presence of aromatic-ring hydrogen atoms. The other peak, at higher field, has a <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value of 2.3, characteristic of methyl groups attached to an arene. In this way the structure is confirmed. Note that there are only <i>two</i> different types of hydrogen atom in the molecule and therefore two absorptions.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the information about the number and environment of a given type of hydrogen atom in a molecule is undoubtedly of considerable assistance in structure determination, there is further helpful information which is obtained from n.m.r. spectra when they are recorded under conditions of high resolution.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Spin&#x2013;spin couplings</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When care is taken to ensure that the magnetic field across the sample is homogeneous, high-resolution conditions are achieved and some of the characteristic absorptions discussed previously are split into several components. We already have an explanation for this because we started out by saying that when a simple bar magnet is placed in the magnetic field of a second magnet (applied field), attractive and repulsive forces result. This situation also exists when two magnetically active nuclei are adjacent to one another. Clearly this situation is common in many molecules. For example, <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a> is a high resolution spectrum of ethanal which shows that the peak of area 3 (from CH<sub>3</sub>, <i>&#x03B4;</i> 2.21) is split into two (compare this with the low-resolution spectrum, <a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>); the absorption is said to be a <b><i>doublet</i></b> and the two component lines have the same intensity (1:1). On the other hand, the absorption from the CHO hydrogen (<i>&#x03B4;</i> 9.795) is split into a <b>quartet,</b> with relative intensities for the four lines of 1:3:3:1. The areas under the two <i>groups</i> of lines (i.e. the groups with different chemical shifts from the two types of hydrogen atom) are still in the ratio 3:1, as indicated by the integration trace.</p>

<p class="indent">The splittings can be explained by considering first the methyl-group hydrogen atoms. These experience an extra &#x2018;local&#x2019; magnetic field due to the magnetic moment of the CHO hydrogen atom. This proton&#x2019;s magnetic moment must be aligned either <i>with</i> or <i>against</i> the applied field, so that in the CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2013;CH fragment, the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms experience an extra field which can either <i>augment</i> or <i>oppose</i> the main field. Thus the resonance condition for the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms can be achieved at two different external fields, which correspond to situations where the externally applied field is augmented by, or opposed by, the local field from the aldehydic hydrogen atom as shown. For a collection of CH<sub>3</sub>CHO molecules some of the CHO&#x2013;group hydrogen atoms will augment the main field, whereas in other ethanal molecules the magnetic moment of the CHO hydrogen atom will be opposed to the main field: absorptions will be seen for the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms in both of these possible environments and therefore there are two peaks for the resonance from the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms. The CH<sub>3</sub> resonance is said to be &#x2018;split&#x2019; by the single hydrogen atom, and the distance between the two peaks of the doublet is referred to as the coupling (or spin-spin coupling, since the magnetic moments are effectively produced by the spinning motion of the nuclei). Because both these states are almost equally populated (<a href="#sec_5.1">Section 5.1</a><b>)</b> the two peaks have the same area.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The CH<sub>3</sub> protons are in resonance; there are two possible magnetic fields generated by the CH proton which can reinforce or reduce the main field. These two situations result in the resonance of the CH<sub>3</sub> protons being split into a doublet.</p></aside>

<p class="noindent"><i>Splitting from two hydrogen atoms.</i> Consider the spectrum from diethyl ether, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig_5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>), which has two main absorptions, from the hydrogen atoms of the CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub> groups. The two sets of CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms (<i>&#x03B4;</i> 1.15) will each experience local fields from adjacent &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2013; hydrogens, and we must therefore work out the possible &#x2018;arrangements&#x2019; of the latter. Two CH<sub>2</sub> hydrogen nuclei may be both aligned with their magnetic moments in one direction (which we can represent <img src="../images/f0062-02.jpg" alt="images"/>), both in the other direction (<img src="../images/f0062-03.jpg" alt="images"/>), or in opposite directions (<img src="../images/f0062-04.jpg" alt="images"/> or <img src="../images/f0062-05.jpg" alt="images"/>).

<h3 class="h3"><b>Summary</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Before proceeding further, it is perhaps worthwhile being reminded of the various stages in the analysis of a complex n.m.r. spectrum by reference to that of CH<sub>3</sub>CHO.</p>
<p class="indent">First, under low resolution conditions there are two absorptions, of relative area 3:1, from the CH<sub>3</sub> and the CHO hydrogens, respectively. These different groups have different chemical shifts (<i>&#x03B4;</i>-values) which are typical of the chemical environment of the two types of hydrogen atom (<a href="#tab_5.2">Table 5.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Second, under high-resolution conditions, splitting can be seen. Interaction of the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms with the CHO hydrogen atom means that the former resonance is a 1:1 doublet; interaction of the CHO hydrogen atom with the CH<sub>3</sub> hydrogen atoms means that the aldehydic hydrogen&#x2019;s resonance is a 1:3:3:1 quartet.</p>
<p class="indent">The size of the coupling, i.e. the separation between the peaks of each multiplet, is a measure of the energy of the interaction, and is the same for both resonances (see <a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>). The coupling is customarily quoted in frequency units (<i>&#x0394;&#x03BD;/</i>Hz); it is, for a given compound, independent of the magnitudes of the characteristic radiofrequency and applied magnetic field of the n.m.r. spectrometer employed.</p>
<p class="indent">A word of explanation is necessary here since the measurement involves (usually) conversion from the <i>&#x03B4;</i>-scale: the problem is to express a separation (measured as &#x0394;<i>&#x03B4;</i>) as &#x0394;<i>v</i> (Hz).

<p class="indent">Analysis of the splittings in the n.m.r. spectra of organic compounds is usually fairly straightforward because appreciable coupling normally occurs only between hydrogen atoms on <i>neighbouring</i> atoms (information about the alignment of one magnetic moment is transmitted to other nuclei through the bonds and the effect dies off rapidly with the number of intervening bonds). This makes the technique extremely effective for distinguishing isomeric alkyl structures (straight-chain and branched): see <a href="#sec_5.3">Section 5.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">It must also be remembered that hydrogen atoms in exactly equivalent environments in a molecule do not split each other. Thus, for CH<sub>3</sub>CHO, for example, the methyl hydrogen atoms, while split by the CHO hydrogen, do not split each other. This is because they are all identical and in resonance together (at the same chemical shift).</p>

<p class="indent">Not only does the observation of the splitting patterns in n.m.r. spectra indicate which groups are attached to others in an organic molecule, but also, in certain cases, it is found that the magnitude of the splitting is informative. For example, in alkenes in which the hydrogen atoms are not all equivalent (if they were, they would all have the same <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value and hence have no observable splitting) then the following splittings are typical. The recognition of these differences sometimes enables a choice to be made between various possible isomeric structures. For example, in 3-phenylpropenoic acid (cinnamic acid) the two alkenic protons resonate at <i>&#x03B4;</i> 7.83 and 6.46, with a coupling (J<sub>HH</sub>) of 17 Hz: this must therefore be the <i>trans</i> (E) isomer.</p>

This often happens when protons such as OH, are exchangeable with those in the solvent. The observation of such behaviour is indicative of chemical exchange and represents a more advanced area of NMR study.<a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a></p>

<p class="noindent">(i) <a href="#fig_5.15">Figure 5.15</a> is the spectrum of 1,1-dichloroethane, CH<sub>3</sub>CHCl<sub>2</sub>. There are clearly two types of hydrogen atom in the molecule, the number(s) in each group being in the ratio of the integrated intensities (3:1). This strongly suggests the presence of CH<sub>3</sub> and CH groups, which is confirmed by the splittings of 1:3:3:1 (of the CH absorption due to interaction with three equivalent hydrogen atoms) and 1:1 (the doublet from splitting of the methyl group absorption by the single hydrogen atom). The high <i>&#x03B4;</i>-value (5.95) for the single hydrogen atom reflects the negative inductive effect of the chlorine atoms.</p>
<p class="noindent">(ii) <a href="#fig_5.16">Figure 5.16</a> is the spectrum of an aromatic compound, as judged from the absorption at <i>&#x03B4;</i> 7.2. The aliphatic part of the molecule has two types of hydrogen atom, apparently in the ratio 1:6 (as deduced from the integrated trace). The high-field peak is typical of a C&#x2013;CH<sub>3</sub> group, so that the part-structure CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> may be suggested. This is confirmed by the splittings; the methyl hydrogen absorption is split into a doublet by interaction with one hydrogen (CH) and the absorption of the single hydrogen is split by interaction with six equivalent hydrogen atoms to give a septet (1:6:15:20:15:6:1). Since the ratio of the number of aromatic hydrogen atoms to aliphatic hydrogen atoms is approximately 5:7, the structure must be (1-methylethyl) benzene (isopropyl-benzene, cumene).<a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a></p>

Thus the high-field resonance at <i>&#x03B4;</i> 0.95 (of relative intensity probably 3) is typical of a methyl group in an alkane, and there are two other absorptions with relative intensity 2: of these, the low-field (CH<sub>2</sub>) peak is evidently split by a CH<sub>2</sub> group (to give a 1:2:1 triplet), and the splitting of the middle multiplet (evidently another CH<sub>2</sub>) by CH<sub>3</sub> <i>and</i> CH<sub>2</sub> gives a 1:5:10:10:5:1 pattern.

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.6</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Pulsed n.m.r. spectrometers</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that n.m.r. spectroscopy can suffer from the limitation that detected signal strengths are very weak because the corresponding population differences are very small. While proton nuclei are the most readily detected, <sup>13</sup>C signals are 6400 times smaller due to their lower relative abundance and smaller magnetic moment. Consequently <sup>13</sup>C signals are much harder to detect.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, these problems have been very effectively solved by the new generation of pulsed spectrometers now available for the detection of all n.m.r. active nuclei. These machines have revolutionized the scope of n.m.r., especially by allowing ready access to nuclei such as <sup>13</sup>C.</p>
<p class="indent">These instruments work by supplying a range of different <b>frequencies</b> instantaneously to the sample which is located in a magnetic field of constant value. This is achieved by irradiating the sample with a short <b>pulse</b> of electromagnetic radiation such that the applied frequencies are in the region expected to contain the resonances in the selected sample. For example, if the spectrometer employed to record the <sup>13</sup>C spectra has a magnetic field of 1.41 Tesla, the frequency of the pulse is 15 MHz (i.e. the appropriate resonance frequency for <sup>13</sup>C in this field) and the spread of frequencies about this value (&#x0394;<i>&#x03BD;</i>) is typically 4 kHz.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of the radiation is to excite the <sup>13</sup>C nuclei whose resonance frequency lies within the range &#x0394;<i>&#x03BD;.</i> After the pulse, these <sup>13</sup>C nuclei return to their equilibrium state within a few seconds but during that time a signal can be detected which contains information about all the frequencies that have been excited (i.e. the resonance frequencies). The measured analog signal is converted into a digital value and stored in computer memory. Repeating the pulse-additive-data-storage process rapidly allows the detected signals to be added together to increase the signal strength relative to the background noise level before conversion into the n.m.r. spectrum. Because this process enhances the signal-to-noise ratio it improves the quality of the final spectrum and thereby allows the measurement of very weak signals.</p>
<p class="indent">A technique referred to as the Fourier Transform method is employed to convert the signal stored on the computer into the final spectrum. Put simply, this process separates the complex mixture of frequencies detected after the pulse into its component frequencies. The resulting spectrum of different frequencies at a fixed field is plotted in the same way as described earlier, i.e. chemical shifts on the <i>&#x03B4;</i> scale, relative to TMS.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>N.m.r. from other nuclei</b></p>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that besides <sup>1</sup>H, other nuclei have nuclear magnetic moments: these include <sup>2</sup>H (deuterium), <sup>11</sup>B, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>C1,<sup>37</sup>C1,<sup>79</sup>Br,<a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>and <sup>81</sup>Br. These nuclei also interact with a magnetic field and therefore exhibit their own resonance condition. Furthermore, these nuclei will interact with other magnetically active nuclei and may give rise to splittings in a similar way to the <sup>1</sup>H&#x2013;<sup>1</sup>H couplings described earlier. However, the ease of measuring these splittings depends on the nucleus, and it is rarely possible to observe splittings from <sup>14</sup>N or the chlorine and bromine isotopes.</p>
<p class="indent">Importantly, the value of the magnetic moment <i>&#x03BC;</i> is a characteristic of the nucleus that is being examined. Because the values of <i>&#x03BC;</i> differ substantially from one nucleus to the next, the resonance frequencies for each nucleus are normally well separated. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.20">Fig. 5.20</a> and confirms that, for example, the resonance frequency of <sup>19</sup>F atoms in fluorine-containing molecules can be detected at a frequency which is 94% of the <sup>1</sup>H frequency. By tuning the circuit of an n.m.r. probe for resonance it is possible to affect, and detect, only selected values of <i>v</i>, in other words, probe the magnetically active nuclei in the sample selectively. This process is similar to tuning into a radio station on your stereo and means that several n.m.r. experiments must be completed before all the magnetically active nuclei in a sample have been monitored.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.7</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Carbon-13 n.m.r. spectroscopy</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is particularly desirable to be able to record n.m.r. signals from the very small proportion of carbon nuclei (<sup>13</sup>C) which possess magnetic moments (you will recall that <sup>12</sup>C does not have a magnetic moment). This enables information to be gained directly about a molecule&#x2019;s carbon skeleton, with the presence of functional groups such as CO or CN being easy to recognize.</p>
<p class="indent">Carbon-13 spectra do not normally exhibit <sup>13</sup>C&#x2013;<sup>13</sup>C splittings because there is a very low natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C, and the percentage of molecules which possess two adjacent <sup>13</sup>C atoms is very small. However, there will be interactions between the <sup>13</sup>C nuclei and the magnetic moments of nearby protons in the molecule, which will cause splittings (exactly as for <sup>1</sup>H&#x2013;<sup>1</sup>H splittings). The resulting patterns are often quite complicated, however, because a particular <sup>13</sup>C nucleus may show observable splittings not only from protons attached directly to it but also from protons further away.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, it is possible to simplify the spectra and remove <i>all</i> these splittings by simultaneous <i>decoupling</i> of all the protons in the sample. To achieve this the sample is irradiated with an extra range of frequencies such that all the proton&#x2019;s resonances are excited while the <sup>13</sup>C signals are recorded (see <a href="#sec_5.6">Section 5.6</a>). The absorption of this extra radiation means that each proton no longer provides a static local magnetic field for neighbouring carbon nuclei but rapidly changes from one spin state to the other with the result that the effect which normally causes the splittings is averaged and lost. <a href="#fig_5.21">Fig. 5.21</a> shows a typical fully decoupled <sup>13</sup>C n.m.r. spectrum which has been recorded in this way: this is for butanone, CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, whose <sup>1</sup>H n.m.r. spectrum is shown on <a href="#page_64">page 64</a>. The spectrum was obtained by adding signals from 32 pulse-collect measurements in two minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of the carbon atoms in butanone gives an absorption which is a single sharp peak, with a different chemical shift; it is the range of shifts obtained, plus the simplification gained by decoupling, that is particularly<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>useful in the study of large molecules such as proteins, alkaloids, and steroids. For example, the steroid cholesterol-acetate, whose structure is shown in <a href="#fig_5.22">Fig. 5.22</a>, has a broad, complex, and relatively uninformative proton n.m.r. spectrum (the different alkyl fragments have very similar chemical shifts and splittings from adjacent protons, causing considerable overlap). In contrast, the fully decoupled <sup>13</sup>C spectrum shown in <a href="#fig_5.23">Fig. 5.23</a> shows significant differences in the carbon chemical shifts, and resonances from most of the 29 carbon atoms can be recognized.</p>

<p class="indent">In the first of these there are only two separate types of <sup>13</sup>C atom (with one peak approximately twice as high as the other).

<p class="noindent"><b>Carbon-proton multiplicity determination</b></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.8</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The development of n.m.r. spectroscopy is continuing in many exciting ways. The vast amount of detailed information to be obtained from <sup>13</sup>C spectra<a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a>(from shifts, coupled, and decoupled spectra) has led to the manufacture of pulsed spectrometers of enormous sophistication that can be used to examine the wide range of nuclei with magnetic moments (<sup>2</sup>H, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>33</sup>S, etc.). These changes have also facilitated the linking of resonances in two dimensions and now, for example, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C spectra can be connected in a single plot. These new techniques lead to incredible versatility in the type of analytical and research problems tackled by n.m.r.</p>
<p class="indent">The development with perhaps the greatest implications of all is &#x2018;magnetic resonance imaging&#x2019; or &#x2018;whole-body&#x2019; n.m.r. In this approach, a much larger sample (e.g. a human body or limb) is placed in the magnetic field and a signal obtained from, for example, <sup>1</sup>H nuclei in water molecules in human cells. Signals from healthy and diseased tissues can often be distinguished and, as with X-rays, an image can be obtained. These studies, compared with related applications of X-rays, have the important advantage that the radiation employed is harmless. The scan illustrated in <a href="#fig_5.29">Fig. 5.29</a> is the MRI image (from <sup>1</sup>H nuclei) of the neck region of a human spinal column.</p>
