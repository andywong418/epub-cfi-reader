<p class="noindent">In addition to the absorption of well-defined amounts of energy to increase its vibrational and rotational energy, a molecule may also absorb energy to increase the energy of its <b>electrons.</b> The energy changes involved are considerably greater than those involved for vibration and rotation and correspond to radiation in the <i>ultraviolet</i> (u.v.) (<i>&#x03BB;</i> <i>ca.</i> 200&#x2013;400 nm) and <i>visible</i> (<i>&#x03BB;</i> 400&#x2013;750 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">For radiation of <i>&#x03BB;</i> 400 nm, <i>v &#x003D;</i> 7.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>14</sup> Hz, the energy of one quantum (h<i>v</i>) is 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;19</sup> J. This is the energy which is absorbed by <i>one molecule</i> if it absorbs one quantum (or photon) of violet light, and it is obviously a very small quantity. However, for one <i>mole</i> of material (in which the number of molecules is the Avogadro constant, <i>L</i>) the total energy absorbed (<i>L</i> quanta) corresponds to (5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2013;19</sup>) &#x00D7; (6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>23</sup>) i.e. <i>ca.</i> 300 kJ: this is the same order of magnitude as some <i>bond enthalpies</i> (energies) in typical molecules. The interaction of visible or u.v. radiation with molecules can therefore sometimes bring about chemical reactions involving bond breakage: such processes are called <b>photochemical</b> reactions.</p>

<p class="indent">In a sample of a stable substance at room temperature, all the molecules will be in the <i>E</i><sub>0</sub> level (the ground electronic state) but may have different <b>v</b> and <i>J</i> quantum numbers. When the appropriate energy is incident it is possible to excite the molecule to the higher energy <i>electronic</i> state <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> (which again has similarly quantized rotational and vibrational energy levels). The excited state arises because of the promotion of electrons to higher energy <i>molecular orbitals</i>, exactly as can happen for electrons in atomic orbitals (cf. the sodium flame test, <a href="chapter2.xhtml#page_21">page 21</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This type of absorption explains why some organic and inorganic compounds are coloured &#x2014; the absorption of energy for the transition <i>E</i><sub>0</sub> &#x2192; <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> is in the visible region. Other compounds absorb energy in the ultraviolet region and although they do not appear coloured (unless there is also visible absorption) the absorption in this part of the spectrum can be detected. The phenomena of fluorescence and phosphorescence, beyond the scope of this book, are associated with the re-emission of energy (particularly in the visible region) when the molecules in an excited electronic state return to the ground state.<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The experiment</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The approach is similar to that employed for infra-red spectroscopy, and many commercial instruments are available. The <i>source</i> provides radiation in a continuous range of wavelengths in the u.v. and visible region, as from a heated tungsten filament (e.g. an electric light bulb). Two separate sources are usually required for covering the whole u.v. and visible region. A <i>prism</i> or <i>grating</i> separates the radiation into component wavelengths and the absorption of the sample at any particular wavelength is measured by the reduction of the signal from a <i>photoelectric device</i> when the sample is placed in the incident beam.</p>
<p class="indent">Most investigations involve the use of liquid samples, which usually contain the compounds to be studied as solutions in suitable solvents. Modem spectrometers employ a <i>double-beam</i> system whereby two identical beams of radiation are generated, one of which passes through the solution under investigation, the other of which passes through an equivalent amount of pure solvent, so that the difference in absorption which is measured is just that due to the molecules of the <i>solute</i> in the solution: the <i>solvent</i> should be transparent in the region of interest. Tetrachloromethane, hexane, cyclohexane, and ethanol are often employed as solvents, and the solutions are usually contained in quartz glass cells such that the beam of radiation passes through 1 cm of solution (this is known as the path length).</p>
<p class="indent">Most spectrometers automatically record <i>absorption</i> as a function of <i>wavelength.</i> In others you record the absorption at different wavelengths. A colorimeter is a simple type of spectrometer working with a given colour; i.e. at a fixed range of wavelength in the visible region, selected with a suitable filter from a wide range of radiation.<a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Examples of spectra</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Figs. 4.2&#x2013;4.4 are the electronic absorption spectra of three organic molecules &#x2014; propanone, benzene, and the indicator methyl red. These are plots of wavelength (<i>&#x03BB;</i>/nm) against absorbance (<i>A</i>) (sometimes also referred to as optical density). The absorbance is the logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of the incident radiation (<i>I</i><sub>0</sub>) to that of the transmitted radiation (<i>I</i>).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">A peak in the spectrum at a given <i>&#x03BB;</i> corresponds to absorption of energy at this wavelength by the solute molecules; for some molecules, more than one area of absorption is observed, as in Figs 4.2 and 4.3: strong absorptions tailing off into the normally inaccessible region below 200 nm are detected in addition to the higher-wavelength peaks. Propanone and benzene are colourless, since they do not absorb in the visible region, but methyl red absorbs in acid solution in the blue-green region (<i>&#x03BB;</i> 400&#x2013;600 nm) and so appears red; in alkaline solution, the absorption is at lower wavelengths and the solution is yellow. The peaks observed are broad in most cases because molecular interactions in the liquid cause the obliteration of the expected vibrational and rotational fine structure, although vibrational fine-structure is clearly apparent in the absorption with <i>&#x03BB; ca.</i> 250 nm from benzene.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Beer&#x2013;Lambert Law</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The extent of absorption at a given wavelength by an absorbing compound in a non-absorbing solvent is found to depend upon the <i>concentration</i> of the compound and upon the <i>path length</i> of the cell. The <b>Beer-Lambert Law,</b> which is generally well obeyed for fairly dilute solutions, expresses the dependence of the absorbance on these two variables (<a href="#eqn_4.2">eqn. 4.2</a>). If <i>b</i> is in m and <i>c</i> is in mol m<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>, then <i>&#x03B5;,</i> in m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, is described as the <b>molar decadic absorptivity</b> or <b>molar extinction coefficient.</b> Thus if <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are known, and if the experiment gives a value for <i>A</i> (the spectrometer records this), <i>&#x03B5;</i> can be calculated. This is usually quoted for the wavelength of maximum absorption (i.e. at <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>4.3 The relationship of <i>&#x03BB;</i></b><sub><b>max</b></sub> <b>and <i>&#x03B5;</i></b><sub><b>max</b></sub> <b>to structure</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The electronic absorption spectra of a variety of organic compounds show that only certain types of molecule exhibit absorption in the u.v.-visible range (<i>&#x03BB;</i> 200&#x2013;750 nm). These must contain double or triple bonds (or, in some cases, lone-pairs of electrons), which are essentially responsible for the absorption; these fragments are called <b>chromophores.</b> When two or more chromophores are adjacent to each other (the groups are then said to be <b>conjugated</b>) the absorptions become more pronounced (higher <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub>) and occur at lower energy (greater <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">This behaviour can be understood in terms of the types of molecular orbitals involved in the electronic excitations. There are three types of molecular orbital, and the electrons in these orbitals have somewhat different environments. First, there are the electrons in the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-orbitals which constitute the bonding framework of a molecule (e.g. the electrons in the 4 C&#x2013;H bonds in methane, CH<sub>4</sub>). These orbitals are formed from overlap of <i>s</i>, <i>sp, sp</i><sup>2</sup>, and <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>, orbitals. Second, there are electrons in <i>&#x03C0;</i>-orbitals, formed from laterally overlapping atomic <i>p</i>-orbitals in compounds such as benzene and ethene (ethylene). Third, there are <i>lone-pair</i> electrons in orbitals on atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, etc.; these are called non-bonding or <i>n</i>-electrons. The carbonyl group (in a ketone, say) contains all three types of molecular orbital.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-10.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig2">
 <img src="../images/f0047-01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When two electrons in atomic orbitals are brought together to form a bond (i.e. when a filled molecular orbital is produced) a higher energy <i>anti-bonding</i> orbital is also formed which is empty in the ground state of the molecule (cf. empty high-energy atomic orbitals). When excitation takes place, an electron from one of the filled orbitals (<i>&#x03C3;</i>, <i>&#x03C0;</i> or <i>n</i>) becomes excited to a vacant anti-bonding orbital (<i>&#x03C3;&#x002A;</i>, <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i>) so that a new <i>excited</i> state is reached. Since various excitations are possible, there are various possible absorptions, corresponding to the transitions <i>n</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C3;</i>&#x002A;, <i>&#x03C3;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;</i>&#x002A;, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>approximate</i> relative energies of typical <i>&#x03C3;</i>, <i>&#x03C0;, n</i> and anti-bonding orbitals are indicated in <a href="#fig_4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>; as expected, the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-electrons are the most-tightly bound (most energy is needed to excite them). The order of decreasing energy for the absorptions is as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">Of all these possible transitions, only those of the last three types normally account for absorption in the u.v.-visible region, the others requiring too great an energy. This then explains why only molecules with <i>n</i> or <i>&#x03C0;</i> electrons give rise to characteristic u.v. and visible spectra whereas alkanes, for example, show no absorption in this region.</p>

<p class="indent">Ethanol absorbs radiation of wavelength <i>ca</i>. 200 nm and below. This absorption derives from the <i>n</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C3;</i>&#x002A; absorption by the lone-pair electrons on the oxygen atom. Ethanol is transparent above this wavelength and finds use as a solvent for u.v.-visible studies on molecules with higher-wavelength absorptions. For a variety of organic molecules which contain chromophores (double bonds etc.) and which also give absorption in the u.v.-visible region, <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a> indicates the measured values of <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub>, together with the types of transition.<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a></p>

<p class="indent">For propanone (see <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) the peak at <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 188 nm (for which <i>&#x03B5;</i> &#x003D; 90 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) is responsible for absorption at the low-wavelength end of the observed spectrum, and the peak at <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 279 nm (<i>&#x03B5;</i> &#x003D; 1.5 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) is also clearly visible. These are due to transitions involving the electrons in the carbonyl-group double bond (<i>&#x03C0;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i>) and the oxygen&#x2019;s lone-pair electrons (<i>n</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i>), respectively. The characteristic values are slightly sensitive to the solvent used.</p>
<p class="indent">These absorptions do not depend to any marked extent on the nature of the alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl function; thus for a variety of ketones and alkanals, the u.v. spectra recorded for hexane solutions show the following values of <i>&#x03BB;</i> and <i>&#x03B5;</i> for the <i>n</i>&#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i> absorption: butanone (279 nm, 1.6 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), cyclohexanone (285 nm, 1.4 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), ethanal (acetaldehyde, 293 nm, 1.2 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), propanal (290 nm, 1.8 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). For carbonyl-containing compounds of different chemical type (e.g. alkanoate esters), the absorptions are, however, characteristically different (see <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a carbon&#x2013;carbon double bond is present, a characteristic <i>&#x03C0;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i> absorption is observed (<a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a> gives data for pent-1-ene): what is particularly noticeable here is the larger value of <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub> (which means that a more dilute solution of the compound is needed, compared with the ketones, to obtain the same amount of absorption). This type of increase often occurs when a transition takes place between states of similar type (e.g. <i>&#x03C0;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;</i><b>&#x002A;</b> compared with <i>n</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;</i>&#x002A;).</p>
<p class="indent">When two chromophores in a molecule are adjacent (conjugated) it is generally found that the energy needed for absorption <i>decreases</i> (i.e. <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub><a id="page_49" class="page">Page 49, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a>increases) and the extent of absorption (<i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub>) <i>increases</i> compared with the values for separate groupings. This is illustrated for the diene and the unsaturated ketone listed in <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>. The effect is particularly marked for benzene (and other aromatic compounds) which have extended <i>&#x03C0;</i>-systems. These molecules can also be distinguished since there are several <i>&#x03C0;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i> absorptions (owing to the existence of several <i>&#x03C0;</i> and <i>&#x03C0;&#x002A;</i> orbitals).</p>
<p class="indent">When a benzene ring and another chromophore are conjugated then the characteristic absorptions are shifted to even longer wavelengths: an example is provided by <a href="#fig_4.6">Fig. 4.6</a>, which shows the electronic absorption spectrum of acetophenone, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> (there is also a weak absorption at higher wavelength; the details are given in <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>). Substitution of alkyl groups on aromatic and alkenic chromophores leads to small increases in <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub>.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">The increased wavelength of absorption for <i>conjugated</i> molecules (i.e. when chromophores are adjacent to each other) can lead, if enough chromophores are present, to an absorption in the visible region. This occurs, for example, for aromatic compounds containing fused rings, for some 1,2-diketones (which are yellow), for large molecules (with delocalized <i>&#x03C0;</i>&#x2013;electrons) used as pH indicators (the conjugation and hence the colour depends upon the ionization of groups in the molecule) and for molecules containing chains of double bonds.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, <i>&#x03B2;</i>-carotene (which occurs in carrots) is orange and has <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub> &#x003D; 450 nm, <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub> <i>&#x003D;</i> 15,000 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. When <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub> is very high, only very dilute solutions are needed for detection of the absorbing molecules, and the technique becomes a very sensitive method indeed for the detection of absorbing species (for example, absorption could be detected for a solution made up from less than 0.01 mg of <i>&#x03B2;</i>-carotene).<a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a></p>

<p class="noindent">One important use of electronic absorption spectroscopy is the recognition of chromophores or groups of chromophores in organic molecules, by the measurement of <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>&#x03B5;</i><sub>max</sub> for the various absorption peaks. This information usually allows the type of molecule to be determined and, particularly when used in conjunction with other spectra, may provide valuable assistance with the determination of the exact molecular structure.</p>
<p class="indent">This branch of spectroscopy has been particularly useful in the structural investigation of steroids, which are biologically important molecules. An example is the hormone testosterone. The absorption at 241 nm (<i>&#x03B5;</i> &#x003D; 1600 m<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) is characteristic of adjacent C&#x003D;C and C&#x003D;O double bonds in this type of cyclic structure; it has proved possible in examples like this to use the uv data to give an indication of the detailed structure around the chromophores.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Quantitative analysis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We can often use the Beer&#x2013;Lambert Law to relate the absorbance from a particular substance to its concentration (if <i>&#x03B5;</i> is known), with many applications in quantitative analysis. The advantages of this method are that very low concentrations can be reliably obtained and that the <i>rate</i> of change of the absorption at a given wavelength can easily be monitored (e.g. if the compound is involved in a chemical reaction). Some typical applications are as follows.</p>
<p class="noindent1">(i) <i>Kinetic Investigations.</i> Most spectrometers produce a plot of absorbance against <i>&#x03BB;</i> but also allow the absorbance at one particular wavelength to be plotted as a function of time. This facility leads to a plot of concentration against time for either the loss of a reactant or the build-up of a product, as long as the absorption is characteristic of only the single component under investigation. Thus, the spectrometer not only provides vital information about the nature of the product (or products) of a reaction, it may also allow the rate of the reaction to be followed. Both pieces of information can aid the elucidation of the reaction mechanism concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent1">(ii) <i>Keto-enol tautomerism.</i> Both the u.v. spectrum (<a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>) and the n.m.r. spectrum of pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone, CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>) indicate that this molecule does not exist simply as the molecular formula suggests &#x2014; i.e with two keto groups. The n.m.r. spectrum provides detailed evidence for two different forms of the molecule present in equilibrium: these are the <b>keto</b> and <b>enol tautomers</b> of the molecule (the phenomenon is called <b>tautomerism</b>).<a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a></p>

First, the extent of absorption suggests that a simple carbonyl-type structure is not responsible for the peak [for example, a much greater concentration of propanone is necessary to obtain a strong (<i>n</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;</i><b><i>&#x002A;</i></b>) absorption: see <a href="#fig_4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>]. A <i>&#x03C0;</i> &#x2192; <i>&#x03C0;</i><b><i>&#x002A;</i></b> transition associated with a <i>conjugated</i> structure is more likely. Second, the variation in the extent of absorption with solvent is surprising (it certainly does not occur for a simple ketone).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The explanation is that the absorption at <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 270 nm is due to the <i>enol</i> form (cf. absorption for compounds of the type C&#x003D;C&#x2013;C&#x003D;O, <a href="#tab_4.1">Table 4.1</a>) and it can be demonstrated (e.g. by n.m.r. spectroscopy) that for a solution in ethanol there is approximately 73% of the enol and 27% of the keto form together in equilibrium (the percentage of the former accounts for the absorption with <i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub> &#x003D; 270 nm, absorbance &#x003D; 0.96 from the 10<sup>&#x2013;4</sup> mol dm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup> solution of the diketone in ethanol). The absorptions for aqueous and hexane solutions imply that in water there must be a much smaller proportion of enol than when ethanol is the solvent and that in hexane solution there is correspondingly more enol. In hexane the internally hydrogen&#x2013;bonded enol form is preferred (the dotted line in the structure indicates a hydrogen bond) whereas in aqueous and alcoholic solutions the formation of <i>intermolecular</i> hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group and the water molecules (or alcohol molecules) stabilizes the keto form.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Indicators</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig_4.8">Fig. 4.8</a> shows the variation in the absorption spectrum of a dilute aqueous solution of the indicator methyl red as the pH is altered. The indicator is red in acid (<i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub> &#x003D; 520 nm, see <a href="#fig_4.4">Figs 4.4</a> and <a href="#fig_4.8">4.8</a>) and yellow in alkali (<i>&#x03BB;</i><sub>max</sub> &#x003D;425 nm), these being the colours of the acid and base forms.</p>
<p class="indent">At pH 1, the indicator is essentially all in the acid (HA) form; at pH 13, it is essentially all in the base (A<sup>&#x2013;</sup>) form. For intermediate pH values, both HA<a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a>and A<sup>&#x2013;</sup> are present (to an extent which is governed by the pH and by the dissociation constant of the indicator, <i>K</i><sub>a</sub>)<i>.</i> The heights of the &#x2018;acid&#x2019; peak (<i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 520 nm) and the &#x2018;base&#x2019; peak (<i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 425 nm) can be used, together with the 100% &#x2018;acid&#x2019; and &#x2018;base&#x2019; absorptions, to determine the concentrations of HA and A<sup>&#x2013;</sup> at any given pH. This then leads to a measurement of <i>K</i><sub>a</sub><i>.</i> Alternatively, if <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> is known, then measurement of [HA] and [A<sup>&#x2013;</sup>] gives a value for the pH. As will be appreciated, these measurements serve to quantify the procedure whereby, in a titration, the eye responds to the change in colour of a solution when a predominance of HA, say, is changed to a predominance of A<sup>&#x2013;</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Metal ions and complexes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The application of u.v.-visible absorption spectroscopy also allows the determination of absorption maxima and molar decadic absorptivities for inorganic ions with electronic absorptions in this part of the spectrum [e.g. for the absorptions which account for the purple colour of the manganate (VII) ion (permanganate, MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup>) and for the yellow colour of the dichromate (VI) ion (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>)<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>]. This type of detailed information can then be useful in several contexts. For example, the ions MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2013;</sup> and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#x2013;</sup> could be identified as present in a solution from the appearance of their characteristic absorption spectra. Further, the inorganic anions mentioned above could be formed by the oxidation of solutions containing trace quantities of, say, Mn(II) and Cr(III), and the extent of absorption (the absorbance) at the appropriate wavelengths could be use to calculate the concentrations of the ions present (this can often be done for mixtures of ions from a single spectrum). In addition, there is considerable interest in the detailed analysis of absorptions from metal ions and complexes in terms of the electronic structure (and hence<a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Electronic (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectroscopy</a>the possible electronic transitions) of the molecules or ions concerned. Particularly useful information can be obtained about transitions and energy levels involving <i>d</i>-electrons in transition metal ions.</p>
