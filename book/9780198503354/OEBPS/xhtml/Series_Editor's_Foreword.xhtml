<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series contains books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modem undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Simon Duckett and Bruce Gilbert present an exceptionally clearly written and elegant introductory account of the <i>Foundations of Spectroscopy.</i> The book explains in simple terms the basic ideas and applications of a subject which is essential knowledge for all practising chemists. This Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
