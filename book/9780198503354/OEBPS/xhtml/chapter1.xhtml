<p class="noindent">The technique of mass spectrometry, which owes its origin to pioneering experiments carried out at the beginning of the twentieth century, is now established as a means for obtaining the formulae and structures of molecules. It enables many sophisticated structural problems to be solved rapidly, even when only minute quantities of material are available.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>1.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The mass spectrometry experiment</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The principle of the method is to obtain a positively charged ion characteristic of the substance under investigation, and then to determine the <i>mass</i> of this ion using an approach closely related to that employed by J. J. Thomson for measuring the charge-to-mass ratio (<i>z/m</i>) for electrons. The procedure involves the use of electric and magnetic fields to deflect the charged particles.</p>
<p class="indent">Thomson used a magnetic field to deflect a beam of positive ions, obtained by the ionization (loss of an electron) of neon atoms. Close examination of the trace produced by the positive ions as they impinged on a detector demonstrated that there were two different types of ion, characterized as those from the two neon <b>isotopes</b> (<sup>20</sup>Ne and <sup>22</sup>Ne), which differ in mass because of the different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. The design of a simple mass spectrometer is shown in <a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>. A very small amount of the vapour of the substance to be studied (obtained, for example by heating the sample) is introduced into the ionization chamber at very low pressure (about 10<sup>&#x2013;4</sup> N m<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>). The vapour is bombarded with high-energy electrons, and the collision between an electron and the molecule M (or atom) causes an electron to be ejected, leaving a positively charged ion (M<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). The ions are attracted by an applied electrostatic potential and are hence accelerated towards the negative plate. The ions pass through a slit in the plate and into a magnetic field: the positive ions then become deflected by an amount which depends upon their <i>mass</i> (<i>m</i>) and the <i>charge</i> (<i>z</i>). The lighter the ion and the greater its charge, the greater will be the deflection.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Mass spectrometry</a>The derivation of the exact relationship is as follows: for an acceleration potential <i>V</i> the <i>potential energy</i> of an ion, of charge <i>z,</i> generated in the ion-chamber is <i>zV.</i> The ion is accelerated through the slit, and in this process its potential energy <i>zV</i> is completely converted into <i>kinetic energy <img src="../images/f0002-04.jpg" alt="images"/><i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>,</i> where <i>m</i> and <i>v</i> are the mass and velocity, respectively, of the ion (<a href="#eqn_1.1">eqn 1.1</a>). When the positive ion passes into the magnetic field (of magnetic flux density <i>B</i>) it experiences a force at right angles both to the direction of motion and to the field direction. The magnitude of this force is <i>Bzv.</i> The positive ion is now constrained to move in the arc of a circle of radius <i>R</i>, as given in <a href="#eqn_1.2">equation 1.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Early mass spectrometers like this achieved a low resolution (e.g. separation of two fairly similar masses, such as <sup>20</sup>Ne and <sup>22</sup>Ne). Many modern mass spectrometers are designed with an extra focusing system which enables increased resolution to be obtained. As before, a narrow beam of positive ions with a small but finite range of kinetic energies is produced: this spread of energies must be reduced for more precise work so that <a href="#eqn_1.3">equation 1.3</a> is strictly applicable. This is achieved by passing the ions through an electric field ( an electrostatic analyser) which deflects the ions according to their kinetic energies (<a href="#fig_1.2">Fig. 1.2</a>). Then only one small component of the resulting beam, with a well-defined kinetic energy, is passed into the magnetic field for focusing of ions of given <i>m/z</i> values. As before, a scan of mass is obtained by varying <i>B</i> (although in certain circumstances it is possible to obtain a more rapid scan by varying <i>V,</i> keeping <i>B</i> constant). An electron-multiplier usually serves as a collector and detector of positive ions, and the arrival of the ions gives rise to a signal. The signal is subsequently displayed as a peak on a oscilloscope or recorder or is processed (and stored) by an on-line computer. This procedure produces a <b>mass spectrum</b> &#x2014; effectively a plot of the masses of the positive particles present against the relative number of ions of each mass. The scan is calibrated with a peak from a substance of known relative molar mass. The resulting spectrum can usually be obtained from less than a nanogram of material in a few seconds.<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Mass spectrometry</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Modern mass spectrometers with a double-focusing facility can be used in various kinds of study. For example, they may be employed to give fairly rapid scans of the relative masses of the ions from a variety of substances. Alternatively, under conditions of high resolution, they can be used to separate closely spaced peaks and to determine the appropriate relative atomic and molar masses with precision. The following example illustrates the advantages of the latter approach if the maximum amount of information is to be derived. A peak which corresponds to mass 28 might be due to nitrogen (<sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (<sup>12</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O), or ethene (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>H<sub>4</sub>). However, these three molecules have slightly different relative molecular masses, as shown (these are based on the internationally accepted scale, with 12 exactly for the <sup>12</sup>C isotope).</p>

<p class="indent">A high resolution mass spectrometer can readily be used to identify a peak exactly enough for it to be characterized as the positive ion from one of these. Further, if all three substances were to be present together, then under high-resolution conditions three separate peaks could be resolved. If one relative molar mass is accurately known, this can be used to calibrate the field scan so that the other molecular masses can also be accurately determined. Relative heights of separate peaks can also be used to obtain quantitative information. For example, from the mass spectrum of neon can be measured not only the relative atomic masses of the constituent isotopes (<sup>20</sup>Ne, <sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>22</sup>Ne), to an accuracy of 1 part in 10<sup>6</sup>, but also the relative abundance of the separate isotopes in the mixture.</p>

<p class="noindent">When an organic compound is introduced into the mass spectrometer, the molecules become ionized, by the loss of an electron, and the positive ions produced pass through the focusing system, leading usually to a peak at the appropriate relative molar mass. However, the mass spectrum of an organic compound also contains extra information about fragmentation which can be extremely useful.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a> shows the mass spectrum of ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH): this is a printout of signal height (proportional to the number of ions of given <i>m/z</i>) against increasing <i>m/z</i> (since nearly all the ions have the same unit charge this axis effectively corresponds to increasing mass).</p>
<p class="indent">Peaks occur at (or close to) most integral values (the extra precision possible with high resolution is not usually employed at this stage). Many of the peaks are derived from ethanol by processes which will be described shortly.</p>
<p class="indent">There may also be peaks due to traces of air in the instrument: this gives rise to signals from N<sub>2</sub> (<i>m/z</i> 28) and O<sub>2</sub> (<i>m/z</i> 32), approximately in the expected ratio 4:1. These peaks may be used to calibrate the scan. The peak heights are expressed as percentages of the height of the highest peak (called the <b>base peak</b>), which in this example is the peak with <i>m/z</i> 31.</p>

<p class="indent">The spectrum shows the expected peak at <i>m/z</i> 46, corresponding to the <b>molecular ion</b> (M<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) of the parent molecule (the relative molecular mass is the sum of the relative atomic masses of 2C &#x002B; 6H &#x002B; O).</p>
<p class="indent">There is also a very small peak at <i>m/z</i> 47, called the (M &#x002B; 1) peak, which corresponds to the relatively few ethanol molecules present which, because they contain a <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>17</sup>O, or <sup>2</sup>H atom, have a molar mass of 47. <sup>13</sup>C has a natural abundance compared with <sup>12</sup>C of 1.1%; for <sup>17</sup>O, relative to <sup>16</sup>O, the figure is 0.04% and for <sup>2</sup>H, relative to <sup>1</sup>H, the abundance is 0.01%.

<h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:0em;"><b>The molecular ion</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many molecules give a peak of appreciable size for the molecular ion. It is usually a reliable guide that a molecule with <i>&#x03C0;</i>-electrons (e.g. benzene) will give a detectable molecular ion (M) since one of these electrons can normally be lost (to give M<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) without the breakdown of the bonding framework in the molecule. However, because in some cases no peak from a molecular ion can be observed, care must be taken before it can be assumed that the peak at highest <i>m/z</i> is from the molecular ion.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be possible at this stage to determine very accurately the <i>relative molecular mass</i> of any given peak (if the high-resolution facility is available) and this will then be carried out for the molecular ion itself. Because different atoms do not have exactly integral atomic masses and, in addition, because various combinations of similar mass are not identical (contrast for example C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>) the exact relative molecular mass (to 3 or 4 places of decimals) characterizes the molecular formula exactly. For instance, a molecular peak with <i>m/z</i> at almost exactly 60 could be from various possible molecules with different formulae, including C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [e.g. ethanoic acid (acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H)] and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O (e.g. propanol). Under conditions of high resolution, these possibilities can be clearly distinguished. Indeed, given a precisely determined relative molecular mass we can obtain the molecular formula: for example, a molecular ion with <i>m/z</i> 94.0419 can be reliably attributed to a compound with the molecular formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O.</p>

<p class="indent">Information can often be extracted from the &#x039C;, (M &#x002B; 1), and (M &#x002B; 2) peaks even if a high resolution facility is not available. For example, for ethanoic acid (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the height of the (M &#x002B; 1) peak at <i>m/z</i> 61, which is mainly due to <sup>12</sup>C<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, should be just over 2% of the height of the peak from the molecular ion (<i>m/z</i> 60). This is because there is approximately a 2.2% chance that a molecule will contain one <sup>13</sup>C atom (there will be a much smaller percentage of molecules containing <sup>2</sup>H or <sup>17</sup>O). The corresponding figure for C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O is just over 3%, and for a compound with, say, eleven carbon atoms the relative intensities of &#x039C;: (M &#x002B; 1) peaks should be about 88:12 (i.e. [100 &#x2013; (11 &#x00D7; 1.1)]:[11 &#x00D7; 1.1]). Clearly, then, measurement of the <i>relative heights</i> of the M and (M &#x002B; 1) peaks, and sometimes of the (M &#x002B; 2) peak can be diagnostically useful, and extensive tables of accurate &#x039C; : (M &#x002B; 1) : (M &#x002B; 2) ratios for various molecular formulae are available. In any case, from a brief inspection sensible deductions can usually be made. Thus the (M &#x002B; 1) peak will be approximately <i>N</i> % of the main peak if the formula has <i>N</i> carbon atoms, a larger-than-usual (M &#x002B; 2) peak may indicate that a sulfur atom is present in the molecule (<sup>34</sup>S has a natural abundance of 4.22%), and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_6" class="page">Page 6, Mass spectrometry</a><span class="space_p">&#160;</span>In certain molecules the effect can be particularly striking. <a href="#fig_1.4">Fig. 1.4</a> shows the mass spectrum of chloromethane in which the peaks at <i>m/z</i> 50 and 52 are from the molecular ions of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>35</sup>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub><sup>37</sup>Cl, respectively, their relative intensities being in the ratio expected from the relative isotopie abundances of <sup>35</sup>Cl and <sup>37</sup>Cl (approximately 3:1). For bromomethane (<a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>) the two almost equally intense peaks are from CH<sub>3</sub><sup>79</sup>Br and CH<sub>3</sub><sup>81</sup>Br, the two bromine isotopes having approximately the same abundance.</p>
<p class="indent">Another useful rule is that a molecular ion with an <i>odd</i> value of <i>m/z</i> generally characterizes a molecule with an odd number of nitrogen atoms.</p>
<p class="indent">It should also be remembered that a peak of reasonable intensity at the highest <i>m/z</i> value observed is not necessarily from the molecular ion, but may be instead from part of the fragmentation pattern of a compound whose molecular ion has a peak too small to be clearly established. Wherever possible, therefore, data should be interpreted together with information from other spectroscopic techniques and from conventional molecular mass and both empirical and molecular formulae determination.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Fragmentation patterns</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A variety of fragmentation pathways is normally possible for M<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and for each route one of the fragments retains the positive charge. For example, another possibility here is fragmentation to P &#x002B; Q<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and further fragmentation of either P<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or Q<sup>&#x002B;</sup> may also occur.</p>

<p class="noindent2">M &#x2192; M<sup>+</sup> &#x2192; P<sup>+</sup> + Q</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The recognition of preferred modes of fragmentation (e.g. whether for this molecule a larger peak for P<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or Q<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is obtained) is assisted by practice with spectra from known molecules, but deductions are based mainly on chemical intuition, and a few simple guidelines. Most of the principles involved in recognizing and predicting fragmentation patterns are closely related to those employed for discussing the chemistry of reactions in solution. For instance, we will need to consider which of a variety of possible fragments is best able to bear a positive charge, which bond is the weakest and therefore most likely to break, and which stable entities might readily be formed in simple decomposition pathways.</p>
<p class="indent">First, remember to do some elementary book-keeping with electrons and charges; almost all molecules have an even number of (paired) electrons, so that the positive molecular ion must have not only a <i>charge</i> but also an odd number of electrons. The fate of both the charge and the unpaired electron should be considered when fragmentation patterns are being interpreted.</p>
<p class="indent">The main types of fragmentation possible for a molecule may be characterized as follows.</p>
<p class="noindent1">(i) <i>Simple cleavage.</i> This involves the breakage of a single bond in the molecular ion, and a good example is provided by the mass spectrum of ethanol (<a href="#fig_1.3">Fig. 1.3</a>). The molecular ion is at <i>m/z</i> 46 and the base peak is at <i>m/z</i> 31; the latter corresponds to a molecular ion which has lost a group of mass 15 before being accelerated and focused. It is described as an (M-15) peak, and is due to the ion [CH<sub>2</sub>OH]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> formed as shown.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-left:0em;margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig2">
 <img src="../images/f0007-02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Note that the &#x2018;dot&#x2019; indicates an unpaired electron. The products of this fragmentation then are the charged <i>ion</i> [CH<sub>2</sub>OH]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (since the charge resides effectively on carbon this type of species is sometimes called a carbonium ion or carbocation and written <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and the neutral methyl radical CH<sub>3</sub>. Only the former, being charged, is recorded in the mass spectrum. Some of the other peaks arise as shown. The peaks with <i>m/z</i> 27&#x2013;29 are typical of a molecule containing an ethyl group, just as the appearance of an (M-15) peak is usually indicative of a methyl group in the parent compound.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason that the peak with <i>m/z</i> 31, [CH<sub>2</sub>OH]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> , is larger than those of the other positive ions is that this is a relatively <i>stable</i> positive ion compared to some of the other possible ions (e.g. [CH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, [CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). This stability arises because oxygen has a lone-pair of electrons which can help to stabilize the positive charge on the adjacent carbon atom: this is possible because there is a spreading (delocalization) of both the charge and the electrons between carbon and oxygen, a phenomenon which is indicated diagrammatically as shown. The use of the double-headed arrow implies that the actual electronic structure is somewhere in between the two extremes indicated.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar explanation accounts for the formation of the fairly intense peak with <i>m/z</i> 45, attributed to the ion <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH formed by loss of a hydrogen atom: this ion is more stable than CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. This mode of fragmentation is <a id="page_8" class="page">Page 8, Mass spectrometry</a>often observed when an ion can be produced with the positive charge on a carbon atom adjacent to an atom with a lone pair of electrons (e.g. O, S, N), and is often significant for alkanols, ethers, thiols, and amines. Their typical fragmentation patterns often provide a means by which these molecules can be recognized.</p>
<p class="indent">Other cases where stabilized positive ions are produced include compounds containing the phenylmethyl (benzyl) group and also carbonyl-containing compounds. For example, <a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6</a> is the mass spectrum from methylbenzene (toluene) which illustrates the behaviour of compounds in the former group. In addition to the molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 92 and the (M &#x002B; 1) peak at <i>m/z</i> 93 (which has an intensity which is about 8% of the molecular peak, since there are seven carbon atoms in methylbenzene; see <a href="#page_5">page 5</a>), there is an intense peak (the base peak) at <i>m/z</i> 91. This is from some of the methyl-benzene molecules in the ionization chamber which lose first an electron and then a hydrogen atom, to give the phenylmethyl cation as shown.</p>

<p class="indent">The reason for the comparative stability of this cation is the ease with which the <i>aromatic ring</i> can delocalize the positive charge, a phenomenon which can be represented diagrammatically as shown.</p>
<p class="indent">This type of fragmentation, to give a peak with <i>m/z</i> &#x003D; 91, is characteristic of compounds of the type C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>X. The mass spectrum from methylbenzene also shows other small peaks which indicate that alternative modes of fragmentation after high-energy bombardment are possible. These include the formation of two-, three-, and four-carbon fragments (that with <i>m/z</i> 51 is [C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) from the aromatic ring; the occurrence of these, though helpful, is not as diagnostically useful as the evidence from the main pathway.</p>

<p class="indent">Carbonyl-containing compounds RC(O)R&#x2032; tend to decompose to give fragment ions in which the positive charge is again shared between carbon and oxygen (RCO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). Other peaks arise because fragmentation occurs at the other C-alkyl bond to give R&#x2032;CO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and because these ions readily lose carbon monoxide. For example, the mass spectrum from butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, <a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>) shows the molecular ion (<i>m/z</i> 72) and the peaks at <i>m/z</i> 57 <a id="page_9" class="page">Page 9, Mass spectrometry</a> (M-15) and 43 (M-29), diagnostic of loss of <sup>&#x00B7;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> and <sup>&#x00B7;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> from the parent positive ion.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Some examples of fragmentation patterns</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The simple rules laid down so far should provide assistance with the solving of a variety of mass spectra. The following examples to a considerable extent typify the class of organic compound to which they belong.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Chloroethane,</b> (<a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>). The mass spectrum shows the two expected molecular ions from C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>35</sup>Cl and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>37</sup>Cl, at <i>m/z</i> 64 and 66, respectively. The other main peaks are formed as shown. The loss of <sup>&#x00B7;</sup>H and <sup>&#x00B7;</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> in the first two paths leaves the positive charge next to the chlorine [cf. <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH, <a href="#page_7">page 7</a>]. Another mode of fragmentation in this example involves elimination of the neutral molecule hydrogen chloride, to give a peak at <i>m/z</i> 28 from the positive ion from ethene (ethylene).<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Mass spectrometry</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Diethyl ether (ethoxyethane),</b> CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig_1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>). The spectrum shows a molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 74, and an (M-15) peak at <i>m/z</i> 59 which indicates loss of a methyl group: this leaves the fragment <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, in which the oxygen atom is again able to exert a stabilizing influence. The peaks at <i>m/z</i> 45 (M-29) and 29 are consistent with the occurrence of an ethyl group in the molecule; loss of this group gives either <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> and <sup>&#x00B7;</sup>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> or [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O]<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The peak at <i>m/z</i> 31 is probably from <sup>&#x002B;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, arising as shown. The (M-29) peak (<i>m/z</i> 45) probably arises via a similar process. The driving force for these fragmentations is the production of a stable molecule (ethene) with the retention of the positive charge next to oxygen in the remaining cation.</p>

<p class="indent">The detection of a peak at <i>m/z</i> 77 (and, in general, peaks in the 75&#x2013;77 region) provides very strong evidence for a benzenoid compound.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Mass spectrometry and chromatography</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The previous sections demonstrate how the mass spectrometer provides an extremely sensitive technique for determining the molecular formulae and structures of a wide variety of organic compounds. Together with an additional facility it can provide a rapid analysis of complicated mixtures of different compounds.</p>
<p class="indent">A small quantity of the mixture to be examined is injected into a gas chromatograph. The chromatograph separates the various volatile components (which are partitioned between the carrier gas stream and a liquid phase supported on an inert solid in the column) and these emerge from the chromatographic column in the carrier gas stream after different times have elapsed (depending on their retention times on the column). Each pure component is fed into the mass spectrometer and its spectrum is recorded with a rapid scan. In this way the <i>chromatograph</i> achieves the separation of components (the areas under the chromatographic traces indicate the relative amounts of the separate components in the mixture) and the <i>mass spectrometer</i> provides additional information which leads to the relative molecular masses and structures of the separate components. The combination of the two techniques provides a remarkably sensitive and effective method for determining the products, and their relative yields, from a chemical reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Other techniques for volatilization and ionization</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Particularly helpful advances include the use of a <b><i>fast-atom bombardment</i></b> <b>(FAB)</b> technique to volatilize and ionize involatile organic samples and the use of <b><i>spark excitation</i></b> to achieve the necessary volatility for salts.</p>
<p class="indent">In <b>MALDI</b> spectrometers, the molecule under investigation is embedded in a polymer matrix and subsequently vaporized and ionized by a blast from a laser (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization). In an <b>Electrospray</b> mass spectrometer a solution is evaporated, leaving a gaseous molecule in the inlet chamber: for molecules which are already charged (e.g. protonated biological samples) no high-energy treatment is required.</p>
<p class="indent">Some techniques which generate ions under more gentle conditions allow much larger biomolecules to be studied very effectively. Where volatilization can be achieved and fragmentation patterns can be observed, very helpful information can also be obtained. For example, if a peptide with a possible amino-acid sequence represented as ABCDEF etc. is studied, fragments identified by their RMM as A, AB, ABC, ABCD etc. allow the whole sequence to be defined.<a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Mass spectrometry</a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Quantitative applications</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have largely been concerned with the structural aspects of mass spectrometry, with emphasis on the use of wide scan ranges and determination of accurate masses and formulae. However, it should also be noted that smaller &#x2018;dedicated&#x2019; mass spectrometers can give continual monitoring of the level of a chosen substrate or substrates: medical examples include the quantitative analysis of the gases in human lungs during respiration.</p>
<p class="indent">A mass spectrometer also allows isotopes to be employed in mechanistic studies: for example, <sup>18</sup>O labelling can be used to determine whether hydrolysis of an ester, such as the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O with, e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, proceeds with cleavage of the CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)&#x2013;O or CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O&#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> bond.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Other information</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Attention can also be focused upon the processes which take place when electrons collide with molecules in the ionization chamber. For example, by studying the appearance of various peaks in a mass spectrum as the energy of the bombarding electrons is increased it is possible to determine the <i>ionization energy</i> of the molecule (i.e. the threshold energy at which the collision knocks out an electron) and also the <i>dissociation enthalpy</i> (energy) of a bond which is broken in a fragmentation process.</p>
