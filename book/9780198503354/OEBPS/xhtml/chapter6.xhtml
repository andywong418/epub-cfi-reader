<p class="noindent">The diffraction techniques are quite different from the spectroscopic methods so far discussed. Whereas the latter are based on the absorption of certain wavelengths (and energies) from radiation with a range of wavelengths, diffraction techniques employ radiation with a single wavelength, i.e. <i>monochromatic</i> radiation.</p>
<p class="indent">X-ray diffraction occurs when a monochromatic beam of X-radiation interacts with matter and is <i>scattered</i> in different directions, with no absorption of energy. Similarly, a beam of neutrons or electrons with well-defined wavelength can be scattered to give typical diffraction patterns.</p>
<p class="indent">The basis of the application of diffraction techniques in chemical problems is to use ions or molecules as diffraction gratings and then to determine, from the observed diffraction phenomena, the spacings between ions in a crystal or between the atoms which constitute molecules.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>6.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction to the X-ray diffraction method</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The first significant experiments were carried out at the beginning of the twentieth century when it was realized both that X-rays have wave properties and that crystals consist of regular arrays of atoms or ions. It was demonstrated by von Laue that a crystal lattice behaves as a grating so that it is possible to generate a diffraction pattern from a crystal; for his first experiments he used an ionic crystal, a beam of X-rays (with a range of wavelengths) and a photographic plate (to detect the scattered X-rays). A regular pattern of spots appeared on the plate, giving a clear indication of the success of the experiment. As we shall see, diffraction phenomena can be observed if the wavelength of the radiation is of the same order of magnitude as the &#x2018;repeat distance&#x2019; of the atoms or ions in a crystal; X-rays (but not visible light) fulfill this condition.</p>
<p class="indent">The method has been developed to provide a means for determining the exact positions of ions in an ionic crystal lattice and of atoms within a molecule &#x2014; that is, for determining accurate values for bond angles and bond lengths, even in extremely complicated molecules like proteins and enzymes.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The apparatus</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">X-rays are produced when a beam of accelerated electrons strikes a metal target. An inner electron from an atom in the metal is ejected, an outer electron drops down to fill the vacancy created, and the emitted radiation, of precise energy, frequency, and hence wavelength, is in the X-ray region. Since various electronic transitions are possible, the resultant beam at this stage contains X-rays of several different energies (wavelengths). <a href="#fig_6.1">Figure 6.1</a> for example, shows the intensity of X-radiation, as a function <i>&#x03BB;</i>, emitted from a copper target. The <i>K<sub>&#x03B1;</sub></i> line, which corresponds to the energy emitted when<a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, X-ray diffraction</a>an electron undergoes a transition from the <i>L</i> shell to the <i>K</i> shell (<i>2p</i> <b>&#x2192;</b> 1<i>s</i> in terms of orbitals), has <i>&#x03BB;</i> &#x003D; 0.154 nm. A sheet of nickel proves to be a good filter for all the wavelengths except the <i>K<sub>&#x03B1;</sub></i> line (all the X-rays of wavelength less than the &#x2018;absorption edge&#x2019; of 0.149 nm are absorbed: they are of high enough energy to remove completely a <i>K</i>-shell electron from a nickel atom) so the combination of the two metals used like this provides a <i>monochromatic beam</i> of radiation.</p>

<p class="indent">The monochromatic beam of X-rays is incident on a solid sample (single crystal or powder) of the material under investigation. A powder contains many very small crystals, in a variety of different orientations, whereas for a single crystal only one orientation of the solid can be considered at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">Detection of the resultant X-ray beam is usually achieved by surrounding the sample with a photographic film: where X-rays strike the film it becomes darkened, and the film is subsequently developed to yield the diffraction pattern. <a href="#fig_6.2">Figures 6.2a</a> and b show the experimental arrangement for taking a powder &#x2018;photograph&#x2019;.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Bragg equation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A more detailed understanding of X-ray diffraction and of the exact requirements for the appearance of intensity maxima were presented by W. L. Bragg in 1912. He realized that when X-rays impinge on a crystal some are reflected from the atoms in the top layer, whereas others penetrate this layer and are reflected off the next layer, and so on. Analysis shows that the resultant reflected rays are only in phase for certain angles of incidence of the X-rays upon the crystal. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>, which shows the path difference between the two rays (one reflected off the top layer, the other reflected off the second layer) when they arrive at the at the detector. For these two rays to combine (i.e. to reinforce each other) they must be completely in phase: that is, their path difference (2<i>d</i>sin<i>&#x03B8;</i>) must be a whole number of wavelengths (<i>n&#x03BB;</i>) where <i>d</i> is the separation between the planes and <i>&#x03BB;</i> is the wavelength of the X-rays. This is the <b>Bragg</b> <a href="#eqn_6.1"><b>Equation</b> (6.1)</a> and it correctly predicts that a reflected beam will be observed (i.e. that there is <i>constructive</i> interference) only for certain angles of incidence of the X-ray beam on the crystal; at other angles of incidence the rays from the different layers will be partly or completely out of phase (<i>destructive</i> interference).</p>

<p class="noindent">A crystal consists of a repeating <b>unit cell</b> of atoms or ions, in three dimensions. The unit cell is characterized by the length of each side (<i>a</i>, <i>b, c</i>) and the angles between the three sides (<i>&#x03B1;</i>, <i>&#x03B2;,</i> <i>&#x03B3;</i>). <a href="#fig_6.10">Figure 6.10</a> shows two of the possible different types of unit cell or <b>crystal system.</b> The symmetry of each of these allows three-dimensional structures (crystals) to be built up from the tiny building blocks (unit cells). The planes referred to earlier are sheets in the crystal containing a high density of lattice points (atoms or ions), observed as the external faces of a crystal.</p>

<p class="indent">Within the unit cell there are various allowed arrangements of atoms or ions which still preserve the overall symmetry. <a href="#fig_6.11">Figure 6.11</a> shows the three possibilities for a <b>cubic</b> unit cell (i.e. with equal sides, all angles 90&#x00B0;); these are the <b>primitive</b> (or <b>simple)</b> cubic, <b>body-centered</b> cubic, and <b>face-centered</b> cubic systems.</p>
<p class="indent">You will probably find it helpful inspect &#x2018;ball-and-stick&#x2019; models of unit cells and fragments of lattices in order to appreciate the various possible planes of atoms or ions in the different types of crystal. You may also find it helpful that a face-centred cubic lattice can equally well be described as a cubic-close-packed arrangement; this common structure arises if equivalent spheres are packed in one layer, the next layer is added, and then the third layer is added at positions not corresponding to those of the first layer, but in the alternative positions; the next layer corresponds to the first, and the pattern is repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus for a cubic lattice, the increasing values of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> should be related to each other as are the increasing simple integers [the smallest value of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> being the reflection from the (1,0,0) planes, the next from the (1,1,0) planes, etc.] but with no line corresponding to the integer 7 because no combination of the squares of integers gives this number. Similarly it can be shown that there should be no lines for integers 15, 23, 28. The pattern obtained from a simple cubic lattice confirms this analysis, and any solid which gives such a pattern (i.e. with 7<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup> etc., lines missing) is known to have a cubic lattice. Further, if <i>&#x03BB;</i> is known, values of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> for the <i>n</i> &#x003D; 1 reflections lead to a measurement of <i>a</i>, the length of the side of the unit cell. The process just described is called <b>indexing</b> a powder photograph (that is, deriving the shape and size of the unit cell).</p>
<p class="indent">In the single crystal method, measurements with each axis vertical in turn lead to determination of the unit cell length along each of the axes (from the separation of the layer lines, see <a href="#page_81">page 81</a>). Again, comparison with patterns from compounds whose structures are known can be helpful.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The Bravais lattice</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The type of Bravais lattice (e.g. body- or face-centred) can also be readily obtained from the diffraction pattern. First, consider a body-centred cubic structure and try to visualize what happens to the expected reflections from the (1,0,0) [and the (0,0,1) (0,1,0) planes]. For the (1,0,0) planes viewed end- on, it can be seen that the reflection which satisfies the Bragg equation (i.e. with distance <i>d</i><sub>100</sub>) now has an extra beam superimposed (<a href="#fig_6.16">Fig. 6.16</a>). This is the beam reflected from the atoms at the centres of the unit cells; as shown this extra beam is completely <i>out of phase</i> with the beams reflected from the (1,0,0) planes (the path difference for the extra beam compared to the others is <i>&#x03BB;</i>/2 and therefore there will be destructive interference; the reflection is now absent). This is referred to as a <b>systematic absence.</b></p>

<p class="indent">The (2,0,0) (0,2,0), and (0,0,2) reflections (with separation <i>d</i><sub>200</sub>) will be present, the reflections being in phase (remember that <i>d</i> is now half that for the 1,0,0 planes); a diffracted beam at the corresponding <i>&#x03B8;</i> is observed. As<a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, X-ray diffraction</a><a href="#fig_6.17">Fig. 6.17</a> demonstrates, the (1,1,0) reflection should be <i>present</i> [there being no atoms in between the (1,1,0) planes] but the (1,1,1) plane reflections are absent (the planes have atoms in between).</p>

<p class="indent">For a face-centred cubic structure, the (1,0,0) reflections are absent, as too are the (1,1,0) reflections, but not, in this case, the (1,1,1) type (you are recommended to check that this is the case by reference to models). The following diagram summarizes the observed reflections:</p>

<p class="indent">A simple (primitive) cubic cell gives no systematic absences, whereas the body-centred cubic cell shows only those reflections for which <i>(h</i> &#x002B; <i>k</i> &#x002B; <i>l</i>) is even; the face-centred cubic structure gives reflections only from planes where <i>h, k,</i> and <i>l</i>, are either all odd or all even. This information enables you to use a series of values of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> (from a powder photograph) to decide to which type of lattice the numbers belong. For example, if the values of <i>&#x03B8;</i> are such that the ratios of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> for the first three reflections fit most closely the integers 3:4:8, then the lattice is of <i>face-centred cubic</i> type [3 has <i>h,k,l,</i> of (1,1,1), 4 has <i>h,k,l</i> of (2,0,0,), and 8 has <i>h,k,l</i> (2,2,0)]. The ratios are quite different for primitive or body-centred cubic structures.</p>
<p class="indent">This procedure can be exemplified by reference to <a href="#fig_6.3">Figs 6.3</a> and <a href="#fig_6.4">6.4</a>; you should be able to conclude by inspection at this stage that molybdenum has a body-centred cubic structure, whereas copper is face-centred cubic.</p>
<p class="indent">The photographs are reproduced to scale (180 mm &#x003D; 180&#x00B0;), so that you should also be able to verify that the appropriate <i>&#x03B8;</i>s (measured from the film &#x2014; the angle between a line and the centre of the film is 2<i>&#x03B8;</i>) give integral ratios of sin<sup>2</sup><i>&#x03B8;</i> as predicted. You can also calculate the unit cell dimension <i>a.</i></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Ionic crystals</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The powder photograph of crystalline sodium chloride (<a href="#page_78">page 78</a>) provides a good example of the effect upon the diffraction pattern when more than one type of ion is present in the lattice. It can be seen from the diffraction pattern that the (1,1,1) reflections are weaker than those for the (2,0,0) planes. This observation can be understood in terms of the intensity of the scattered beam of X-rays and its dependence on the nature of the atom doing the scattering. The X-rays are scattered by the electrons around the nucleus, which will lead to a different intensity (amount) of scattering from Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. Now for the (2,0,0) type reflections, all the planes causing reflection contain Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions so that all these ions will contribute to reinforcement [three (2,0,0) horizontal layers are clearly shown in <a href="#fig_6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>]. However, for the (1,1,1) plane of sodium ions, there is a layer of chloride ions in between (see <a href="#fig_6.18">Figure 6.18</a>); the X-rays scattered from each layer are exactly out of phase, but do not cancel exactly because their <i>intensity</i> is not the same. Thus a weak reflection is observed.</p>

<p class="indent">For KCl the two ions have the same number of electrons and cannot be distinguished with X-rays. Although the KCl structure is the same as that for<a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, X-ray diffraction</a>NaCl, the (1,1,1) reflection is now actually missing. The X-ray pattern resembles that for a cubic lattice with one half of the spacing of the actual unit cell.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the important information in an X-ray diffraction pattern is contained in the <i>positions</i> (values of <i>&#x03B8;</i>) and <i>intensities</i> of the diffracted beams. The former usually allow recognition of the unit cell and lattice type and the dimensions of the unit cell. The intensities of the reflections depend on the <i>nature</i> of the ions present and these are the key to the application of X-ray diffraction for structure determination for molecules.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Ionic radii</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The measurement of the unit cell length can also lead to values of the ionic radii of the constituent ions. For example, for NaCl the length of the cell side is equal to the sum of the diameters of the sodium and chloride ions (<a href="#fig_6.12">Figure 6.12</a>). In LiCl, which has the same type of structure, the Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions are so much smaller than the Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ions that the latter actually &#x2018;touch&#x2019; along the diagonal of a face (see <a href="#fig_6.12">Fig. 6.12</a>). From the X-ray powder photograph from this compound, the length of the cell side can be obtained (0.513 nm) and used to calculate the length of the diagonal of the face and hence the ionic radius of Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. Then, from the length of the cell side for NaCl (0.56 nm), you should be able to calculate the ionic radius of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.4</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The structure of molecules</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In a crystal where the lattice points are occupied by covalent molecules (e.g. in a crystalline organic compound) the diffraction from each separate atom must be considered. The molecules themselves will be symmetrically placed with respect to each other, but atoms in the molecules will now not only be found at the comers and body- or face-centres of the cells. However, there will still be characteristic &#x2018;repeat distances&#x2019; in the structure (i.e. periodic variation in electron density) which cause diffraction as discussed before for simple ions, and the essential theory is the same. The X-ray examination is carried out for a single crystal, if one is available, and a very complicated pattern of reflections, with different intensities, is obtained. The problem then is to work back from this information to a plot of the electron density (which causes diffraction) in the unit cell. An electron density contour map, in which the &#x2018;peaks&#x2019; correspond to atoms in the unit cell, can be drawn. For example, <a href="#fig_6.19">Fig. 6.19</a> shows an electron density map for benzene, and the positions of the carbon atoms (a symmetrical hexagon, with equal C&#x2013;C bond lengths) can be seen: peaks from hydrogen atoms are not clearly observed because there is relatively little X-ray scattering from these atoms (which depends on the number of electrons round a given atom).</p>

<p class="indent">Computers make this type of analysis relatively straightforward, and it is now routine to obtain the complete molecular structure of many organic and organometallic molecules, giving a detailed picture of the molecules and accurate measurements of bond lengths and angles. X-ray diffraction also provides an excellent method for investigating the structures of biologically important molecules which contain repeating chemical groups (e.g. proteins and nucleic acids). One important example is the analysis of the X-ray pattern from the nucleic acid DNA, which is interpretable in terms of this molecule<a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, X-ray diffraction</a>having an interwoven double-helix of repeating units of base pairs. X-ray reflections indicate characteristic &#x2018;repeat distances&#x2019; (cf. planes in a crystal) of 0.34, 3.4, and 2.0 nm: these are, respectively, the distance between successive units in the chain, the repeat distance (pitch of the helix), and width of the spiral. This new information enabled the essential features of the DNA structure to be elucidated so elegantly by Watson and Crick in their pioneering and Nobel Prize-winning research.</p>
