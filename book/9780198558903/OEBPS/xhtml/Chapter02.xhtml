<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The last chapter presented the essential theory of NMR in solution together with a formalism to predict the appearance of the NMR spectrum for a given compound/spin system. Emphasis was placed on the fact that the appearance of the spectrum depended on the arrangement of nuclear spins and not on the particular elements present, thus the interpretation of NMR spectra follows the same rules whether we are studying an &#x201C;organic&#x201D; or &#x201C;inorganic&#x201D; compound; it is only the chemistry that changes not the NMR!</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter we approach the subject from the other end; given the relevant NMR spectra can we deduce the structure of the compound? This of course is the problem that the practising chemist will usually encounter; the hope is that the understanding of the basic principles gained in the previous chapter will inform our chemist&#x0027;s interpretation of the spectra we meet in this.</p>
<p class="indent">In the interpretation of an NMR spectrum we are, of course, not interested solely in the topology of the molecule but also in obtaining as much information as possible about, <i>e.g.</i> oxidation state, co-ordination number, bond angles etc. For this reason this chapter also surveys the chemical factors that influence the chemical shift and the magnitude of coupling constants.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Differentiation of chemical shifts and scalar couplings</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The two most important effects in the NMR spectrum, from the point of view of structure determination, are the chemical shift and scalar couplings. The chemical shift results in a separate multiplet of resonances for each chemically different group of NMR active nuclei in the molecule, <i>i.e.</i> each group of chemically different nuclei will have its own resonance position determined by the chemical nature of its surroundings. Furthermore the intensity of the resonance tells us the number of nuclei responsible for each chemical shift. The structure within each multiplet results from scalar coupling and is determined by the number and arrangement of neighbouring (inequivalent) spins. Fortunately it is a simple matter to distinguish the two effects; the multiplet structure arising from scalar coupling is symmetrical about the <a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a> midpoint of the multiplet whilst the chemical shift places resonances according to the chemical nature of the groups giving rise to each resonance. Thus, there will be no pattern, <i>i.e. no symmetry</i>, in the distribution of the chemical shifts other than that determined by the chemistry. Using the symmetry present in a scalar coupled multiplet we can easily distinguish scalar couplings from chemical shifts and hence arrive at the number of chemically distinct groups of NMR active nuclei in the molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum shown in <a href="#fig2.1">figure 2.1</a>, that of a compound that contains fluorine, phosphorus, and alkyl groups, P<sub>x</sub>F<sub>y</sub>R<sub>z</sub>. The spectrum contains ten lines, however we notice that six of the lines give a symmetrical pattern, recognizable as a doublet of triplets, about a chemical shift of 88 ppm. The remaining four lines also give a symmetrical pattern, a doublet of doublets, around 5 ppm. Since we can identify two sets of symmetrical resonances we know that the compound must contain two chemically different types of fluorine atoms. We can use the intensities of the multiplets to tell us the relative number of fluorines in each group. The total intensity of the four line pattern is twice that of the six line therefore there must be twice as many fluorine atoms in the former group as in the latter.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.1</b> Coupling patterns are symmetrical about the mid-point and so are easily distinguished from chemical shifts. In the <sup>19</sup> F NMR spectrum above the doublet of doublets is thus easily distinguished from the doublet of triplets.</figcaption>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Determination of couplings and coupling patterns</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Scalar coupling is reciprocal, that is the magnitude of the coupling between two nuclei A and B must be the same in the spectrum of A as it is in B. This allows us to determine easily which resonances come from mutually coupled groups of nuclei, we simply measure the coupling constants and look for two that are the same in different multiplets. We must, of course, remember that in the NMR spectra of inorganic <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a> compounds the coupling partner may be a nucleus of a different element &#x2013; a heteronuclear coupling &#x2013; and so appear in a different NMR spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking at the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of <a href="#fig2.1">figure 2.1</a> we notice that the separation of adjacent lines in each branch of the doublet of triplets is 26 Hz and is the same as the separation of the lines in each branch of the doublet of doublets. Immediately we can see that the 26 Hz coupling relates the two multiplets and so must be the coupling between the fluorines. We also notice that the intensities of the outside two lines of the triplet are in the ratio 1:2 confirming that the coupling is due to two equivalent neighbouring spins &#x2013; the other fluorines. In fact, the separation of the outside two lines of a multiplet must correspond to a coupling constant and the relative intensity of the outside line to the next line must equal the number of coupling partners responsible for this coupling. These are useful rules when the coupling pattern is not immediately obvious, however it does not hold in coupling in second order systems (<i>vide</i> chapter 1.8).</p>
<p class="indent">The large doublet coupling in the resonance centred at 88 ppm is 968 Hz whilst in the resonance at 5 ppm it is 780 Hz. Clearly these couplings do not link the two multiplets.</p>
<p class="indent">So far we can deduce that the compound contains two types of fluorine in the ratio 2:1, that the fluorines are close enough to each other to be mutually coupled, and that both types of fluorine see coupling to another spin &#x00BD; nucleus. Since the coupling partner is clearly not in the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum we can guess that it must be phosphorus.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption1-left-60"><b>Fig. 2.2</b> The <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectrum above shows a doublet of triplets. Note that the spectrum is symmetrical about the midpoint confirming that all lines belong to a single multiplet.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">The <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectrum, <a href="#fig2.2">figure 2.2</a>, shows several lines around 8 ppm. The multiplet structure is less clear than that in the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum, <a href="#fig2.1">figure 2.1</a>, however the whole pattern is symmetrical indicating that it arises from scalar couplings on a single phosphorus chemical shift; <i>i.e.</i> there is only one type of phosphorus in the molecule. We know that the separation of the outside two lines must equal a <a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a>coupling constant, here 780 Hz, and that the ratio of the two outside lines, here 1:2, tells us the number of coupling partners responsible for this, <i>i.e.</i> the 780 Hz, coupling. We can deduce that the 780 Hz coupling is to a group of two identical nuclei. Inspection of the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum reveals a 780 Hz coupling is also associated with the <sup>19</sup>F resonance centred at 5 ppm so these fluorines must be the coupling partners.</p>

</aside>


<p class="indent">By looking for this coupling recurring in the <sup>31</sup>P multiplet we can identify two 1:2:1 triplets, lines 1,2 and 4 and 3,5 and 6. Having identified the triplets, the multiplet structure is seen to be a doublet (968 Hz) of triplets (780 Hz), the 968 Hz coupling being due to the other fluorine, &#x03B4;<sub>F</sub> = 88 ppm, in the molecule.</p>
<p class="indent">We now know the relative numbers of phosphorus and fluorine atoms in the molecule. Each fluorine resonance is split into a doublet by the phosphorus so each set of fluorines sees one phosphorus; there is only one phosphorus chemical shift so this must be the same phosphorus, hence the molecule must contain only one phosphorus atom. This in turn fixes the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule as three, two of one type and one of another. (It is also possible that the molecule might be a polymer of some sort containing isolated, but identical {P(F<sub>a</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(F<sub>b</sub>)} units.)</p>
<p class="indent">The common oxidation states of phosphorus are III and V; since we know the phosphorus has alkyl substituents as well as the three fluorines we must have a P(V) compound and we might guess that there are two alkyl groups, <i>i.e.</i> the molecule is PF<sub>3</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, <a href="#fig2.3">figure 2.3</a>. The nature of the alkyl groups could be determined by a combination of <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR however it is impractical to use couplings to <sup>13</sup>C in the <sup>31</sup>P or <sup>I9</sup>F NMR spectra to determine the number of alkyl groups since <sup>13</sup>C is only 1% abundant - the multiplets due to coupling to <sup>13</sup>C will appear as satellites on the main peak and will contain only 1% of the intensity in the spectrum (see chapter 1.9). The type and number of alkyl groups would usually be determined another way, for example by microanalysis, whilst mass spectroscopy could be used to determine the molecular mass (and hence whether the molecule is a monomer or polymer).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="bgc_11">The probability that any given phosphorus is adjacent to one <sup>119</sup>Sn is the natural abundance of <sup>119</sup>Sn times the number of tin atoms adjacent to the phosphorus = 8.6% * 2 = 17.2%. The chances that given phosphorus is adjacent to two <sup>119</sup>Sn nuclei is 8.6% * 8.6% = 0.7%.This is so small it can be ignored. Thus we would expect to see a doublet for the tin satellites on each phosphorus resonance. The intensity of each line in the doublet is 17.2% divided by 2 = 8.6%.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Satellites</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We saw in chapter 1.9 that satellites occur as a result of scalar coupling when the coupling partner is less than 100% abundant. Satellites, since they contain all the coupling information, can also be used to obtain structural information from the NMR spectrum. For example the <sup>119</sup>Sn{<sup>7</sup>Li} and <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>7</sup>Li} NMR spectra of [Sn<sub>4</sub>(Pcy<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Li<sub>4</sub>] (cy = cyclohexyl) are shown in <a href="#fig2.4">figure 2.4</a>. The satellites due to coupling to tin are clearly visible in the phosphorus spectrum.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>General trends in the chemical shift</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several factors, for example co-ordination number, oxidation state, and geometry influence the shielding of the nucleus and hence the chemical shift in inorganic complexes. Although it is possible, by carefully chosen examples where a single factor dominates the shielding, to establish trends for the effects of these factors on the chemical shift, it is difficult to establish general rules for the chemical shifts of nuclei in inorganic compounds since many interdependent factors, often having competing affects on the shift, are involved. Shifts can be very large &#x2013; up to 10 000 (or more) ppm in metal complexes. This is perhaps unsurprising given the often strong interactions of the metal electrons with the ligands.</p>
<p class="indent">It is worth reiterating at this point that an increase in shielding, &#x03C3;, results in a decrease in the chemical shift, &#x03B4;, <i>i.e.</i> in a shift upfield, <i>i.e. to less positive/more negative &#x03B4; values.</i></p>
<section id="sec2.3.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors influencing the chemical shift &#x2013; geometry</b></h3>
<figure class="figure-center-60" id="fig2.5">
<img src="../images/fig2.5.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.5</b> Geometric isomerism can make otherwise identical species different. Here the triphenylphosphine ligands in the <i>fac</i> complex are equivalent but in the <i>mer</i> isomer there are two types of PPh<sub>3</sub> ligand differentiated by their geometrical position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen that geometric factors can make otherwise equivalent nuclei distinct, <i>e.g.</i> the axial and equatorial fluorines in the PF<sub>3</sub>R<sub>2</sub> example above. Other such geometric factors might be <i>cis vs trans</i> or <i>mer vs fac</i> isomerism in a complex or the overall symmetry present or <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a>absent in the compound, <a href="#fig2.5">figure 2.5</a>. It is therefore important that we can recognize when geometry makes, say, the ligands in a complex different. A useful starting point is to look at the group <i>trans</i> to the ligand of interest, thus the triphenylphosphine ligand <i>trans</i> to chloride in Wilkinson&#x0027;s catalyst, <a href="#fig2.6">figure 2.6</a>, is clearly different to the two mutually <i>trans</i> triphenylphosphines. Thus, there will be two phosphorus chemical shifts in the <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectrum of Wilkinson&#x0027;s catalyst of intensity ratio 2:1 and the resonances will show coupling to rhodium and between the dissimilar phosphines.</p>
<figure class="figure-center-100" id="fig2.6">
<img src="../images/fig2.6.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.6</b> The differing ligands in the <i>trans</i> positions divide the sites occupied by the triphenylphosphine ligands in Wilkinson&#x0027;s catalyst into two distinct groups. In the <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectrum the inequivalent groups of phosphorus nuclei couple to each other as well as to the rhodium.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="indent">In some compounds it may simply be the spatial arrangement that makes otherwise identical ligands different. For example, in Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, <a href="#fig2.7">figure 2.7</a>, we can easily see that the two bridging carbonyls will be distinct from the ten terminal CO ligands and by considering the differences between the iron atoms (Fe<sub>a</sub> is unique whilst the two CO bridged atoms Fe<sub>b</sub> are equivalent) we can see that the terminal carbonyls on Fe<sub>a</sub> must be different from those on Fe<sub>b</sub> since the iron atoms are different. Two of the carbonyls on Fe<sub>a</sub>, (C<sup>2</sup>O), lie in the Fe<sub>3</sub> plane and are thus distinct from the two ligands, (C<sup>1</sup>O), that lie in symmetry equivalent positions above and below the Fe<sub>3</sub> plane. In a similar way we can divide the terminal CO ligands on Fe<sub>b</sub> into two groups, C<sup>3</sup>O lying in the plane whilst C<sup>4</sup>O lie above and below the Fe<sub>3</sub> plane. Thus there are four distinct terminal CO environments and one type of bridging CO in Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors influencing the chemical shift &#x2013; electronegativity, charge, and oxidation state</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">All of these factors affect the electron density around the nucleus and so affect the chemical shift. The shielding generally becomes smaller, <i>i.e.</i> the chemical shift increases, as the electron density at the nucleus decreases. Thus electronegative substituents, positive charge or an increase in oxidation state all (usually) result in downfield shifts.</p>
<a id="page_37" class="page" style="width:60%">Page 37, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a>
<p class="indent">The effect of substituent electronegativity can be seen in the shifts caused by halogen ligands in main group halide complexes &#x2013; the shielding increases as the electronegativity of the halide decreases, thus shifts follow the electronegativity Cl &#x003E; Br &#x003E; I, <a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>. The opposite trend, however, may be observed for transition metals due to ligand field effects (vide infra).</p>

<p class="indent">The effects of electronegativity, charge, and oxidation state can also be seen, for example, in the <sup>31</sup>P chemical shift of some typical phosphorus compounds. In PPh<sub>3</sub> (P<sup>III</sup>) the shift is about -6 ppm whilst in P(OPh)<sub>3</sub> (more electronegative substituents) it is 128ppm. In the oxide, OPPh<sub>3</sub>, (P<sup>V</sup>) it is around 28 ppm, (increase in oxidation state) and in PPh<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (P<sup>V</sup>) the shift is 20.8 ppm (positive charge), <a href="#fig2.8">figure 2.8</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Co-ordination shifts for a ligand are usually small &#x2013; a few tens of ppm &#x2013; and can be of either sign. For example, whereas hydride ligands and the ligating carbon of alkyl ligands are usually shielded on co-ordination to a transition metal, for strong &#x03C0;&#x2013;acceptor ligands such as carbonyls and phosphines the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>17</sup>O, and <sup>31</sup>P are usually deshielded on co-ordination due to a paramagnetic contribution from the &#x03C0;-back bonding.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors influencing the chemical shift &#x2013; co-ordination &#x2013; effect on transition metal</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the effects above, transition-metal chemical shifts are also influenced by both the magnitude of the ligand field splitting and by nephelauxetic effects, effects we are familiar with from the UV-vis spectra of transition metal ions. These effects are often (usually) in competition hence it is difficult to give hard and fast rules for ligand effects on the chemical shift. In transition metal complexes, shifts often follow the &#x201C;spectrochemical series&#x201D;; thus strong field ligands such as CO, PR<sub>3</sub>, H<sup>-</sup> usually give large upfield shifts whilst the halogens give smaller shifts. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig2.12">figure 2.12</a> and <a href="#tab2.3">Table 2.3</a> for some cobalt complexes.</p>
<p class="tablecaption-left-60" id="tab2.3"><b>Table 2.3</b> In transition metal complexes shifts often follow the &#x201C;spectrochemical series&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="table-left-60"><img src="../images/tab2.3.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Interestingly the competition between ligand field effects and electronegativity can be seen in the ordering of the halogen induced shifts in <a href="#tab2.4">Table 2.4</a>. For late transition metals <i>e.g.</i> Co and Pt, the halogen induced shifts follow the halogen electronegativity, shifts increasing in the order Cl<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; Br<sup>-</sup> &#x003E; I<sup>-</sup> as we saw for main group halides whilst for early transition metals <i>e.g.</i> Sc, Ti, and Nb the shifts follow the spectrochemical series, Cl<sup>-</sup> &#x003C; Br<sup>-</sup> &#x003C;I<sup>-</sup>, a phenomenon termed &#x201C;inverse halogen dependence&#x201D;.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>General trends in the coupling constant</h2>
<p class="noindent">Just as we have seen for the chemical shift, many, often competing, factors affect the size of coupling constants. Nevertheless some general trends can be found, and the magnitude of the coupling constant can give useful chemical and structural information when variations in coupling constant between related complexes are considered.</p>
<p class="indent">An important point that must be borne in mind when discussing variations in coupling constants is that couplings can have positive or negative signs, however most chemists report only the magnitude of the coupling. An increase in the value of a negative coupling constant will result in a decrease in the magnitude of the coupling.</p>
<p class="indent">Typical values for scalar coupling constants are given in Brevard&#x0027;s book &#x2013; a valuable ready reference guide to the magnitude of scalar couplings and chemical shifts.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors influencing the coupling constant &#x2013; gyromagnetic ratio</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">For a given pair of elements, the scalar coupling is proportional to the product of the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei provided all other factors remain the same. Thus, where two NMR active isotopes of a given element exist, <i>e.g.</i> <sup>10</sup>B and <sup>11</sup>B, the ratio of the coupling constants to a third nucleus will be as the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#tab1.2">table 1.2</a>. For example, in BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>J(<sup>10</sup>BH) is 28 Hz whilst <sup>l</sup>J(<sup>11</sup>BH) is 80 Hz, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.22">figure 1.22</a>. (The gyromagnetic ratios of <sup>10</sup>B and <sup>11</sup>B are 2.87 and 8.58 *10<sup>7</sup> rad T<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> respectively.) However when we move from one element to another, other factors also change <i>e.g.</i> the nature of the bonding, thus <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PH</sub> is <i>Ca</i>. 200 - 500 Hz whereas <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PPt</sub> is several thousand hertz despite the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton being roughly five times that of <sup>195</sup>Pt.</p>

<p class="noindent">The magnitude of couplings between the ligand and acceptor is strongly influenced by the other ligands in the complex. This effect is particularly evident in square planar complexes of the noble metals, &#x03C0;-acid ligands in the <i>trans</i> position reduce the magnitude of the coupling between the metal and the ligand.

<p class="indent">However, the explanation for this effect cannot simply be the &#x03C0; interaction with the metal since hydride ligands also have a high <i>trans</i>-influence.

<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors influencing the coupling constant &#x2013; interbond angles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The <i>s</i>-character in the bonds between the coupling nuclei is expected to vary with bond angle; simplistically a bond angle of 90&#x00B0; is obtained using pure <i>p</i> orbitals; as the bond angle increases, increasing <i>s</i> character must be added to the bonding hybrid orbital 109&#x00B0; (<i>sp<sup>3</sup></i>), 120&#x00B0; (<i>sp<sup>2</sup></i>), 180&#x00B0; (<i>sp</i>). We would expect, therefore, that the magnitude of a coupling constant should correlate with the interbond angle(s) between the coupling nuclei, <i>i.e.</i> for two bond couplings, <i>trans</i> couplings will normally be larger than <i>cis</i> couplings. Thus for example the coupling between the bridging phosphido ligand and the <i>trans</i> phosphine in the palladium hydride complex shown in <a href="#fig2.19">figure 2.19</a> is <i>ca.</i> 213 Hz whereas the coupling to the <i>cis</i> phosphine is <i>ca.</i> 0 Hz.

At times relaxation effects can be a nuisance, for example, the widely differing relaxation rates of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary carbons prohibit the use of line intensities in <sup>13</sup>C{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR as a guide to the number of each type of carbon atom in a molecule. On the other hand the nuclear Overhauser effect, nOe, which uses through space relaxation of one nucleus by its neighbours &#x2013; the stronger the nOe the closer the two nuclei must be is widely used in organic chemistry and in protein chemistry to determine molecular conformation. On rare occasions, however, a strong nOe can be misleading as in the dimanganese compound shown in <a href="#fig2.23">figure 2.23</a> in which the strong nOe from the directly bonded proton in the diphenylphosphine ligand doubles the intensity of the <sup>31</sup>P{<sup>1</sup>H} resonance of this ligand with respect to that of the phosphido bridge.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Molecular hydrogen complexes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Kubas&#x0027; report in the early 1980&#x0027;s of a neutron diffraction crystallographic structure determination of the complex W(H<sub>2</sub>)(CO)<sub>3</sub>(P<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in which molecular hydrogen acts as a ligand caused great excitement since up till then it had been believed that such complexes could not exist. In fact (and with the benefit of hindsight) it is now known that many polyhydride complexes synthesized in the years before Kubas&#x0027; report are in fact molecular hydrogen complexes.</p>
<p class="indent">Characterizing molecular hydrogen ligands in transition metal complexes poses certain difficulties: due to its low atomic number hydrogen is difficult to locate in X-ray diffraction crystallographic studies in the presence of a strongly diffracting transition metal; neutron diffraction studies require large crystals and access to a high energy neutron source; the H-H bond stretch comes in the range 3100 to 2400 cm<sup>-1</sup> &#x2013; a region in which C-H bonds also absorb. The explosion of studies into molecular hydrogen ligands relied heavily on a wide variety of NMR techniques to characterize the compounds and provides an interesting review of the techniques available.</p>

<p class="indent">Both molecular hydrogen and classical hydride ligands resonate upfield of TMS.

For example the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of a mixture of the tautomers W(CO)<sub>3</sub>[P(i-C<sub>3</sub>D<sub>7</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>), <b>A</b>, and W(CO)<sub>3</sub>[P(i-C<sub>3</sub>D<sub>7</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>(H)<sub>2</sub>, <b>B</b>, is shown in <a href="#fig2.24">figure 2.24</a>.

<p class="indent">If we replace the H<sub>2</sub> by HD in the molecular hydrogen complex then we could use the scalar coupling between the deuterium and hydrogen to distinguish the two tautomers since we would expect the one bond HD coupling in <b>A</b> to be larger than the two bond coupling in <b>B</b>. Typically, <sup>1</sup>J<sub>HD</sub> is between 25 and 34 Hz in molecular hydrogen complexes whereas <sup>2</sup>J<sub>HD</sub> in classical hydrides is less than 5 Hz. <a href="#fig2.25">Figure 2.25</a> shows the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of W(CO)<sub>3</sub>[P(i-C<sub>3</sub>D<sub>7</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>(HD) in which the 1:1:1 triplet expected for coupling to <sup>2</sup>D is clearly seen. The coupling constant is 33.5 Hz confirming the presence of a molecular hydrogen ligand.</p>
<p class="indent">Another method of distinguishing the two types of ligand was hinted at in <a href="#fig2.24">figure 2.24</a>. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR resonance of the molecular hydrogen ligand is very broad. In <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">chapter 1</a>, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec1.10">section 1.10</a>, we noted that dipole-dipole relaxation falls away as r<sup>-6</sup>, and increases as the product of the squares of the gyromagnetic ratios of the relaxing pair of nuclei. In molecular hydrogen ligands the two protons are bound to each other <i>i.e.</i> the H - H distance is pretty much as short as possible. Furthermore, protons have one of the largest of all nuclear spin magnetic moments. The combination of these two factors results in very efficient relaxation of the two protons in a molecular hydrogen ligand. Efficient spin-spin relaxation accounts for the observed large line width. Unfortunately other factors, such as chemical exchange and fluxional processes, see chapter 3, can also cause broadening of NMR lines so a broad line is not enough to distinguish unequivocally molecular hydrogen from classical hydride complexes. Fortunately no such ambiguity arises if we use spin-lattice relaxation to distinguish the two tautomers. T<sub>1</sub> for the protons of a molecular hydrogen ligand will clearly be much faster than that for a classical hydride, <a href="#fig2.26">figure 2.26</a>. Care is still needed in the interpretation of these results since inspection of <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.26">figure 1.26</a> and <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq1.8">equation 1.8</a> clearly shows that T<sub>1</sub> is both temperature, through the effect of temperature on the molecular correlation time, and field, through the terms in co, dependent. To eliminate these effects it is essential that T<sub>1</sub> is measured at the same spectrometer magnetic field and that the value at the T<sub>1</sub>, minimum is determined. When this is done spin-lattice relaxation times of less than 10 ms (at 5.875 T, <i>i.e.</i> <sup>1</sup>H = 250 MHz) indicate a molecular hydrogen ligand whilst T<sub>1</sub>&#x0027;s greater than 100 ms indicate classical hydrides.</p>

<p class="noindent">A similar problem to distinguishing molecular and classical hydride ligands in complexes exists if we adsorb hydrogen on a metal surface &#x2013; does the hydrogen adsorb dissociatively, <i>i.e.</i> as atoms, or non-dissociatively as molecules? This apparently trivial question was a cause of furious debate throughout the 1970&#x0027;s and 80&#x0027;s for the industrially important case of hydrogen adsorption on copper based methanol synthesis catalysts.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen on copper is highly activated; although early studies had indicated that dissociative chemisorption occurred readily on evaporated copper films, later ultrahigh vacuum measurements and theoretical calculations showed that the sticking probability for dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen on clean, polycrystalline copper surfaces is very low &#x2013; a result that was frequently mis-interpreted as meaning that dissociative chemisorption on copper did not and/or could not occur.</p>
<p class="indent">A resonance, assigned to hydrogen adsorbed on metallic copper, is observed in the region 80 to 95 ppm when a variety of oxide supported copper catalysts are exposed to H<sub>2</sub> or HD, <a href="#fig2.28">figure 2.28</a>. This shift, called a Knight shift, results from contact of the hydrogen nuclear spin with the metal conduction electrons and is consistent with a bonding interaction between metallic copper and hydrogen.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have seen above, a simple test to distinguish molecular from atomic hydrogen is the presence or absence of an intramolecular dipole - dipole contribution to the nuclear spin relaxation, such an interaction being expected to dominate the relaxation in molecular hydrogen due to <a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a>the shortness of the H-H bond. Direct measurement of the spin-lattice relaxation time could not be used to distinguish atomic from molecular hydrogen in this case since, obviously, it was not known what the expected relaxation times for the two species absorbed on copper should be. Instead the spin-lattice relaxation times for hydrogen <i>ex H<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>ex HD</i> on supported copper were determined. The relative importance of H-H and H-D dipole-dipole relaxation can be estimated from <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#eq1.8">equation 1.8</a>, <a href="#fig2.26">figure 2.26</a>.

The first 90&#x00B0; pulse translates the <b><i>S</i></b> magnetization into the xy-plane.

<p class="indent">We saw in chapter 1.4, that the intensity of the NMR signal depends on this population difference hence the INEPT experiment increases the intensity of NMR signal of the insensitive nucleus.

Thus the intensity of signals from <sup>59</sup>Fe or <sup>103</sup>Rh can be increased 30-fold on transfer of polarization from <sup>1</sup>H using INEPT. Furthermore, using the refocussed INEPT experiment, the resulting NMR spectrum looks exactly like a conventional NMR spectrum; all couplings are seen allowing the number of ligands (containing an NMR active donor atom) attached to the metal nucleus to be determined. Care must however be taken in using intensity information from the INEPT family of experiments since this no longer depends simply on the number of nuclei present but on the efficiency and degree of enhancement.</p>

<p class="noindent">Chemical systems are often complex, for example there may be extensive coupling between the nuclei, the resonances of interest may be hidden by more intense nuclei or chemical exchange may be occurring. It would clearly be helpful if we could probe the nuclear spin system in a way that highlighted the information we are interested in. This is what 2-D NMR spectroscopy seeks to do. The basis of 2-D spectroscopy is beyond the scope of this book and readers are referred to the texts in the bibliography. In essence 2-D experiments work by recording a series of one dimensional FID&#x0027;s. In each one dimensional experiment the nuclear spin system is <i>prepared</i> by a series of excitation pulses and delays to ensure that the FID will be modulated by the NMR property of interest <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a>(<i>e.g.</i> exchange, or coupling), <a href="#fig2.33">figure 2.33</a>. One of the delays in the excitation sequence (for example, the time allowed for exchange to occur in an EXSY experiment) is sequentially increased (incremented) between one 1-D experiment and the next. In this way we create two time dimensions, one is &#x201C;real&#x201D; the acquisition time of the 1-D FID, (called F2), the other, (called F1), is &#x201C;synthesized&#x201D; by the incrementing delay in the preparation sequence, <a href="#fig2.34">figure 2.34</a>. We can now do Fourier transformations in both time dimensions to produce a two dimensional map in which crosspeaks occur that relate the chemical shifts in the 1-D spectrum to the property selected by the pulse sequence in the second.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider for example, the carbaborane clusters 1, 2-C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub> and 1, 7-C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub> that we met in chapter 1.10. In the 1, 2 isomer B(3) and B(6) are adjacent to both carbons and are equivalent, borons 4, 5, 7, and 11 are adjacent to one of the carbons and are equivalent, borons 9 and 12 are diametrically opposite a carbon and are equivalent and B(8) is equivalent to B(10). In the 1, 7 isomer however, B(2) and B(3) are adjacent to both carbons and are equivalent, borons 4, 6, 8, and 11 are adjacent to one carbon and one of B(2) or B(3) and are equivalent, B(5) and B(12) are opposite to one the carbon atoms and are equivalent and B(9) and B(10) are equivalenced by symmetry. In each case the 1D spectra show the predicted four resonances in the ratio 2:2:4:2, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.27">figure 1.27</a>, but it is not possible to assign the resonances to particular atoms. The atom connectivities do however allow the isomers to be differentiated and the spectra to be assigned. Thus, for example, in the 1, 7 isomer, boron atoms<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 2 Structure Determination</a> (2, 3) are linked to B(4, 6, 8, l1) but no others whereas in the 1, 2 isomer all borons see at least two other boron environments. We can see these connectivities in the 1, 7 isomer displayed in the COSY spectrum in <a href="#fig2.35">figure 2.35</a>. A knowledge of the atom connectivities derived from the COSY spectrum can be a great aid in deducing the structure of the new boranes.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>HMQC</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">HMQC uses the coupling between a sensitive, <b><i>S</i></b> and an insensitive, <b><i>I</i></b>, nucleus to observe indirectly the NMR spectrum of the insensitive nucleus through the effect its couplings have on the spectrum of the sensitive nucleus. The two dimensional spectrum produced gives the chemical shifts of the sensitive (<i>i.e.</i> the directly observed) nucleus in the F2 dimension (horizontal axis) whilst the vertical axis (F1 dimension) relates to the insensitive (<i>i.e.</i> indirectly observed) nucleus. One disadvantage of HMQC is that only <b><i>I</i></b> spins that couple to an <b><i>S</i></b> spin are detected, however, HMQC is still preferable to the alternative of observing no signals at all for the insensitive nucleus by &#x201C;conventional&#x201D; methods. Couplings to third nuclei are observed in the HMQC spectrum thus, for example, coupling to <sup>3l</sup>P is observed in both F1 and F2 in the {<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>103</sup>Rh} HMQC experiments described below.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.36</b> The <sup>103</sup>Rh NMR spectrum of a mixture of PPN[Rh(CO)<sub>4</sub>] and dppe, obtained by {<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>103</sup>Rh} HMQC spectroscopy, allows the species present in solution to be identified unambiguously.</figcaption>

<p class="indent">For example, the reaction of a solution of PPN[Rh(<sup>l3</sup>CO)<sub>4</sub>] with dppe, (Ph<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>), has been studied using {<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>103</sup>Rh} HMQC. The 1D <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two phosphorus containing molecules one of which contained only one type of phosphorus, the other two types, which, from the chemical shifts, must be free and co-ordinated phosphine. The 2D correlation map with projections along F1 and F2, <a href="#fig2.36">figure 2.36</a>, however, reveals the presence of three rhodium carbonyl species. From the coupling patterns in the rhodium (F1) dimension these clearly are due to rhodium centres carrying none, one, and two equivalent phosphoruses, indicating the solution contains [Rh(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [Rh(CO)<sub>3</sub>(&#x019E;<sup>l</sup>-dppe)]<sup>-</sup>, and [Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>(&#x019E;<sup>2</sup>-dppe)]<sup>-</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the crosspeaks in HMQC spectra relate coupled <b><i>S</i></b> and <b><i>I</i></b> spins, the spectra also allow the couplings between the <b><i>I</i></b> and <b><i>S</i></b> spins to be easily assigned. For example, HMQC, <a href="#fig2.37">figure 2.37</a>, has been used both to detect the <sup>103</sup>Rh resonances of Rh<sub>6</sub>(CO)<sub>15</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>), <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.8">figure 1.8</a>, and to assign the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum of the cluster.</p>
<p class="indent">EXSY is discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">chapter 3</a> and gives a two dimensional map in which crosspeaks occur that relate sites between which exchange is occurring.</p>

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.37</b> The <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>103</sup>Rh HMQC NMR spectrum of Rh<sub>6</sub>(CO)<sub>15</sub>(PAr<sub>3</sub>) provides easy access to the <sup>103</sup> Rh NMR data for the complex and ready assignment of the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum. Shown here is the bridging carbonyl region. Assignment of Rh<sub>A</sub> to Rh<sub>D</sub> and of the bridging carbonyls is straightforward.
