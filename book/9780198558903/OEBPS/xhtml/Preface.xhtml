<p class="noindentf">Most students first meet NMR spectroscopy in &#x2018;Organic&#x2019; Chemistry. The approach usually adopted is to concentrate on interpretation of *H NMR spectra and ignore much, if not all, of the physical basis of the technique. Whilst this approach often enables the student to interpret simple *H spectra many students have difficulty in interpreting the NMR spectra of other nuclei - some students even seem unaware that NMR extends beyond protons! The aim of this book is to provide a non-mathematical grounding in the &#x2018;physics&#x2019; of NMR spectroscopy and then use this to explore the use of NMR spectroscopy in &#x2018;Inorganic&#x2019; Chemistry. The author hopes that <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">chapters 1</a> &#x2018;Fundamentals&#x2019; and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">2</a> &#x2018;Structure Determination&#x2019; will be useful and accessible to 2nd year chemistry students and above whilst <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> &#x2018;Dynamic Processes&#x2019; is intended for 3rd year students. <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> provides a brief introduction to&#x2019;The Solid State&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indentf">The author has tried to include examples from many different areas of Inorganic Chemistry where suitable examples are available, however, the examples used in this book inevitably reflect the amount of work done with each nucleus. Not all the work described is the author&#x2019;s own; where possible acknowledgement is given in the text for specific examples from others&#x2019; work, where data has been gleaned from a variety of sources, e.g. to provide comparative data, this has not been possible and acknowledgement to those workers is made here.</p>
