<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to provide clear and concise introductions to a wide range of topics that may be encountered by chemistry students as they progress from the freshman stage through to graduation. The Physical Chemistry series will contain books easily recognized as relating to established fundamental core material that all chemists will need to know, as well as books reflecting new directions and research trends in the subject, thereby anticipating (and perhaps encouraging) the evolution of modern undergraduate courses.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In this Physical Chemistry Primer, Guy Grant and Graham Richards have produced a clearly written and fascinating introductory account of <i>Computational Chemistry</i>. This is an ever increasingly powerful subject which seeks to predict quantitatively molecular (and biomolecular) structure, properties, and reactivity by computational methods alone; it has enormous importance and potential in many areas of chemistry ranging from the fundamental to the applied. The Primer will be of interest to all students of chemistry and their mentors.</p>
