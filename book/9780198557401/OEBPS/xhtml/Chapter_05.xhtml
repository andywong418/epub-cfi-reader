<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">As computer power has increased steadily over recent years so too has the size of the systems which the computational chemist has the potential to investigate. This has opened up many different applications in the field of biological molecules: proteins, DNA, lipids and carbohydrates. The importance of structure for the understanding of biological systems is exemplified by Watson and Crick&#x2019;s discovery of the structure of DNA (<a href="#fig5_1">Fig. 5.1</a>). Immediately it could be suggested how DNA might replicate &#x2013; perhaps one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the century &#x2013; and in turn this spawned the new discipline of molecular biology. The first protein crystal structures, while almost baffling in their complexity, would provide new insights into the structural basis of their activity; so too, the first enzyme structure (lysozyme) allowed the molecular basis of enzymic catalysis to be viewed. Although technology has made experimental structure determination less difficult than in the past, the process of carrying out an x-ray diffraction study on a protein is still measured in years rather than months. Therefore, it is here that computational methods have a part to play by learning from the precedents of existing biological structures and to utilize this information to make valid predictions of unknown structures.</p>

<p class="indent">In this chapter we will concentrate on methods for modelling protein structures as much more work has been done in this area. Most of the interesting studies on DNA, carbohydrates and lipids have relied heavily on molecular dynamics methods. The interested reader is recommended to follow this up using the Further Reading list.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2">
<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:2em;">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Protein structure prediction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before continuing, a brief introduction to protein structure is required. Proteins are polymeric macromolecules synthesized from the twenty naturally occurring amino acids which are coded for by DNA. Although other amino acids sometimes appear in proteins, these have arisen from modification after the protein has been synthesized. Fortunately it is possible to create broad groupings for the amino acids according to the properties of their sidechains: hydrophobic, polar but uncharged, polar acidic, polar basic, and finally, glycine, which has no sidechain. The particular sequence of amino acids in a given protein is its primary structure. Note, however, that structure in this case implies nothing about conformation. The next level of protein structure is secondary structure, as defined by the local conformation of the protein backbone. Secondary structure can be further divided into <a id="page_63" class="page">Page 63, Modelling biomolecules</a>regular secondary structure &#x2013; such as helices, &#x03B2;-sheets and turns &#x2013; and irregular structure: loops containing no discernible underlying order. The packing together of these secondary structure units into compact globular domains defines the tertiary fold, while multiple domain proteins require the packing of individual domains to form the quaternary structure. It is important to note that the latter two levels of structure often utilise interactions between amino acid residues which are distant in the sequence.</p>
<p class="indent">The recent, vast increase in both protein sequence and three-dimensional structural data has made it increasingly clear that there may only be a relatively small number (1000&#x2013;2000) of structures formed by proteins. This should reduce the scale of the modelling problem. There are two main strands to this argument. The first comes from the observation that a certain proportion of newly sequenced genes are related to sequences which were already known in the protein sequence database. This relationship is more strictly defined as homology: that is to say, there is evidence to suggest that the proteins have evolved from an ancestral common gene. Coupled with the sequence data is the observation that approximately one third of newly determined three-dimensional structures have a similar fold to previously known structures. Assuming that neither the sequence nor structure databases are biased (not strictly true) it is possible to arrive at the predicted number of &#x223C;1200 different protein folds.</p>
<p class="indent">The second approach is genetic. Some proteins, which are considered as modern on the evolutionary timescale, are constructed from individual folding units, or modules, which are replicated in a diverse range of sequences; sometimes as multiple copies. These proteins provide some evidence for a process of splicing together gene fragments (exons) to produce new proteins: exon shuffling. That proteins might only fold in a limited number of ways is seductive to the nascent protein modeller.</p>
<p class="indent">The final important idea regarding the relationship between sequences and structure is that all the necessary information for the definition of a protein&#x2019;s three-dimensional structure is encoded in its sequence. Crucial to the development of this idea were the seminal experiments of Anfinsen who showed that the protein ribonuclease could regain its native structure when it was removed from unfolding conditions and placed in a solvent which promotes folding. This sets out quite clearly one of the most fundamental unanswered questions in biology: if the three-dimensional structure of a protein is determined entirely by its sequence, what are the rules which map one onto the other?</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Protein folding</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conceptually, the most obvious approach to the protein structure problem would appear to be the simulation of the actual process of protein folding. Not only would this have the potential to predict structures from sequences, but by monitoring the development of order throughout the simulation the underlying driving forces, and the structures of intermediates along the folding pathway, could be elucidated. The timescale for the folding event is of the order of milliseconds, therefore it falls outside the capabilities of conventional molecular dynamics simulations using potential functions of <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Modelling biomolecules</a>the type discussed in <a href="Chapter_03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>. Therefore, less detailed models must be investigated.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-16.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">A detailed discussion of techniques used in protein folding simulations is given in Skolnick, J. and Kosinski, A. (1989). <i>Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem</i>., <b>40</b>, 207&#x2013;235.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Simplicity can be engineered by two approaches: the representation of the amino acids, and the degrees of freedom allowed to the folding chain. Like many approaches in the protein modelling field the reduced representation of the amino acids can be calibrated using the Brookhaven database of known structures. At the core of a typical protein the principal ordering force is that of close-packing of residue sidechains; at this point we will assume that the protein chain has undergone collapse from its denatured state to maximize burial of hydrophobic residues. Therefore, packing considerations can be reduced to one of sidechain size: the residue can be considered as a volume unit. By examining the occurrence of a given amino acid in known structures one can obtain average values for this volume so the protein is now a flexible backbone with sidechains approximated by spheres of appropriate size. Further simplification is possible by considering the backbone as bonds between C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> (see <a href="#fig5_2">Fig. 5.2</a>) rather than as two rotatable bonds (&#x03D5;,&#x03C8;) and the fixed peptide link (&#x03C9;). As volume is the only criterion in this representation a potential function of the Lennard-Jones type would be suitable. Models of this type can then be used with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The second approach commonly used is to model the structure as a lattice. The individual amino acids in the chain occupy points on this lattice and change position by movements from one grid point to another. While studies have been carried out with both diamond and cubic lattices, the latter has proved to be the more successful in that it allows a better representation of the secondary structure. Again, a reduced representation of the individual residues is necessary; note that the backbone torsion angles have very little meaning since they do not drive the changes in conformation. The accuracy of this type of model is determined both by the resolution of the grid and the type of potential function used to calculate the interaction energies. Some of the most successful studies have been carried out on a face-centred cubic lattice with point separations of 1&#x00C5;. If the protein is mapped onto this lattice by placing each C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> atom on a lattice site and considering the inter-C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> vectors to be (2,1,0) the overall topology of the protein is not unduly distorted. But with more crude lattices the structure loses this accuracy of representation and becomes more like a model of a folding chain with some protein-like properties. If an additional atom centre is defined for each residue to represent the sidechain, the lattice model can be modified to include rotational flexibility about the C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub>-C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> bonds. A lattice type model is very suited to Monte Carlo simulations. Starting from random chain conformations on the lattice the protein can be folded by moves which change the position of a residue from one lattice point to another; if the sidechain is also represented, random torsional moves about the C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub>-C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> bonds will also be required to reorientate its position. Then the energy of the new conformation can be evaluated and the move accepted or rejected using the criteria discussed in <a href="Chapter_04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. A commonly used method to evaluate the interaction energies is based on the frequency of particular inter-residue contacts in known structures. Clearly this should favour the formation of a <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Modelling biomolecules</a>compact hydrophobic core but will be less well defined for residues found on the surface which have few contacts with other groups. Also, since residues on the surface of a protein can be present more for purposes of recognition than for structure determination, their influence is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="indent">It is still not clear whether protein folding simulations provide useful information about the nature of the folding process or if they can be utilized to predict the three-dimensional structure of a given sequence. Results obtained experimentally on protein folding are also still open to interpretation. Each of the approximations in the method gives rise to problems: the lattice model is at too low resolution for actual structure prediction while the simplified potential functions used rely heavily on known structures opening up the possibility of inbuilt bias. This is not to say that they will have no use in the future once more is known about the rules behind the protein structure code.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">Secondary structure prediction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Prediction of the overall fold of a protein requires the consideration of not just local interactions between residues sequentially close on the chain but also non-local interactions through space. In theory then it should be less difficult to predict secondary structure of proteins than to predict the tertiary fold. Typically, secondary structure can be thought to fall into three or four groups: helices, &#x03B2;-strands, and loops. But the latter may sometimes be treated as turns, which are considered to be regular structure. Returning to Anfinsen&#x2019;s experiments on refolding; a naive interpretation of folding would be that the information to define regular secondary structure resides in the local sequence and that the fold, or tertiary structure, arises from the docking together of different folding elements in such a way that they form a hydrophobic core and place hydrophilic residues on the surface. There are obvious thermodynamic arguments against this hypothesis but if we modify it slightly we reach the conclusion that certain residues will bias the formation of a particular class of secondary structure. It was on this basis that the early methods of secondary structure were derived.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">See, for example, Fasman, G. (ed.) (1989). <i>Prediction of protein structure and principles of protein conformation</i>. Plenum, New York.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the 1970s only a very few (&#x003C; 40) protein crystal structures had been solved but it was already clear that certain residues were associated with different elements of secondary structure e.g., glycines are very common in turn regions, and branched sidechains are disfavoured in helices. The first commonly used method was that of Chou and Fasman which was a literal interpretation of these observations. From an analysis of the known structures they produced propensity tables which showed the probability of a given residue being in a particular secondary structure type. By examining the appearance of strings of residues with a particular preference it became possible to predict the occurrence of secondary structure elements, however, some features of the method require more subjective decisions and this makes it difficult to implement computationally. An extension of the statistical method, by Gamier, Osguthorpe and Robson (GOR), considered relationships between residues in the different classes of secondary structure. Interactions with up to eight residues on either side of a given position are summed to give the probability of finding a given residue type in a particular <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Modelling biomolecules</a>conformation. If we consider a helix (<a href="#fig5_3">Fig. 5.3</a>) then it is obvious that the sidechain has a greater interaction with those residues three and four positions distant than with those immediately beside it. Thus there would seem to be some justification for including the preferences of other residues. Although more automatic in its use, the GOR method still produced predictions of about 60&#x0025; accuracy, not much better than Chou-Fasman. So, while statistical considerations of residue preferences can give an indication of some of the secondary structure they also highlight the problem that tertiary interactions can influence structure formation to quite an extent.</p>
<p class="indent">Before going on to discuss more recent methods of structure prediction we must digress and outline methods to obtain optimal alignments between protein sequences. This is required for nearly all of the methods still to be discussed.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Sequence alignment</h3>
<p class="indent">When a new gene product has been sequenced, one of the first things to be done is to check it against the database of known sequences to see if there is any similarity. In this way information can be obtained regarding the classification of the protein and possibly an indication of the structure, or at least important residues. A vast number of sequence alignment tools have been developed to carry out this kind of screening efficiently but we shall consider only the principles behind the general method of dynamic programming.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Sequence alignment methods are extensively reviewed in Barton, G. J. (1990). <i>Methods in Enzymol</i>., <b>183</b>, 403&#x2013;428.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Obviously sequence alignments can be carried out &#x2018;by hand&#x2019; and it may sometimes be necessary to make manual changes to the automatic alignment, but for mass screening the automatic method is advisable. If we take two sequences, A and B, and assume there is some similarity between them, the problem becomes one of obtaining the best match between the identical residues while pairing non-identical residues in such a way that some common property is conserved as far as is possible. The starting point in all dynamic programming is to construct a two-dimensional matrix where the elements represent the similarity between any residue in sequence A with each of the residues in sequence B. <a href="#fig5_4">Figure 5.4</a>a shows the simplest case where a value of one is assigned if the residues are identical and zero if not. Next we must find the highest scoring path through the comparison matrix to obtain the optimum alignment. This is known as generating the maximum match matrix. Now consider what a matrix element (M<sub>ij</sub>) in the maximum match matrix represents: it is the highest scoring path which can be obtained starting at that point. Clearly, since we are restricted to retaining the sequence order, the matches which follow positions i and j can arise only from higher values of the subscripts. In practice we start from the bottom right hand corner and systematically go through the comparison matrix converting it into the maximum match matrix by finding the highest value in the row and column i + 1, j + 1 of the maximum match matrix and adding this to the value in the comparison matrix. The partially completed matrix in <a href="#fig5_4">Fig. 5.4</a>b shows which values are considered at a given point. Having completed the assembly of the maximum match matrix one starts at the top left hand corner and finds the optimum alignment by choosing the highest <a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Modelling biomolecules</a>value in each row and column pair such that i and j are both higher than those of the previous pair (<a href="#fig5_4">Fig. 5.4</a>c). For the two similar sequences in the example the highest value commonly fell on the diagonal, but occasionally a letter is skipped, leaving it unpaired. Hence, gaps can be created in the alignment. In evolutionary terms this is justifiable as additional bases can be inserted into DNA as two sequences diverge from a common point. Therefore, it is not necessary to obtain an exact match. However, the creation of gaps must be controlled, otherwise, if dissimilar stretches of residues crop up in matched sequences the algorithm will react by increasing the length of the gaps. To overcome this problem gap-penalties are introduced. These are subtracted from the maximum match score to disfavour moving off the diagonal when different residue types are matched.</p>

(b) Conversion of the comparison matrix into the maximum match matrix. The value in the highlighted position is added to the highest value in the boxed region. (c) The completed maximum match matrix. The final alignment is read from the top left hand corner; in this case it is along the diagonal.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The second issue in sequence alignment is the values used in the comparison matrix. In the example, we used the identity matrix. Many different relationships have been constructed to group residues by similarity or by their acceptability as mutations in homologous proteins. Take, for example, the hydrophobic residue leucine; if this were matched against isoleucine or valine the property of the sidechain at that site in a protein would be conserved therefore it would not be an unwise alignment. Thus, some account must be taken of conservative substitutions which would be counted as zero by the identity matrix.</p>
<p class="indent">Having screened a database using pairwise alignments, as described above, and obtained a family of sequences which show evidence of being related, the next task is to try and optimally align all the sequences. We will see later on that this provides much more information than a single alignment. Clearly the dynamic programming method could be extended into many dimensions for simultaneous alignment but this would soon run into problems with memory requirements. An alternative approach is first to generate pairwise alignments between all the members of the family. The most similar pair is then taken as the core of the alignment to which successive sequences are matched, with average values being placed in the comparison matrix where there is not identity across the growing set of alignments. This method can be run iteratively to find a self-consistent solution. The main consequence of a multiple alignment is that positions in the sequence which show absolute conservation, or where only conservative changes are made, can be spotted.</p>
<p class="indent">Comparison of known, related three-dimensional structures have shown that the rate of successful mutation is much greater on the surface of a protein than it is in the protein&#x2019;s core. Thus by monitoring the degree of conservation across a family of proteins we can start to make predictions about tertiary structure without prior knowledge of the three-dimensional structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Methods utilizing this approach have recently been used to great effect for secondary structure prediction prior to the publication of the experimental results. The methods can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="nlist">1.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Collect an appropriate set of sequences and obtain an optimal multiple sequence alignment.</p>
<a id="page_68" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 68, Modelling biomolecules</a>
<p class="nlist">2.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Distinguish between buried and surface regions using residue variability and patterns of hydrophobic residues.</p>
<p class="nlist">3.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Look for key residues, such as glycine and proline, which tend to break regular secondary structure regions; the sequences are now divided up into likely regular and irregular secondary structure regions.</p>
<p class="nlist">4.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Assign secondary structure to the regular regions. The Benner method uses the repeat of property patterns to make this assignment e.g., a &#x03B2;-strand has alternate residue sidechains above and below the plane of the &#x03B2;-sheet; a surface &#x03B2;-strand would therefore have alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic sidechains. Similar arguments can be made for helices.</p>
<p class="nlist">5.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Attempt to construct a tertiary structure template using known biochemical information such as the active site residues, epitope mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis data.</p>
<p class="indent">This last stage is the most difficult to achieve, but even its exclusion leaves a potentially more powerful method than those discussed previously. Note, however, that the structure produced is not that of an individual sequence but a consensus structure which provides a representative template for the complete family of proteins.</p>

<h3 class="h3">The inverse folding problem</h3>
<p class="noindent">At the start of the chapter it was implied that, although the three-dimensional structures of a great proportion of sequences are not known, in many cases the sequence might be expected to assume a fold similar to that of a known structure. From sequence alignment one can pick up closely related sequences, with maybe > 40&#x2013;50&#x0025; sequence identity. But how do we find more divergent relatives? This can be rephrased such that if we have a known protein fold, how do we find out which other sequences are consistent with this structural pattern? Thus described we have the &#x2018;inverse folding problem&#x2019;.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The starting point for this type of study is an examination of the database to extract data which groups residues as similar according to their properties. If one starts with families of homologous proteins whose structures are known, structure alignment can be used to superimpose the folded chains giving equivalent positions in the sequence. These equivalencies might not be accurately determined by sequence alignment due to the nature of the method, but when using three-dimensional structures they are unambiguous. Comparisons between the residues found at a particular position across all the equivalent sites in the family give an indication of which substitutions are acceptable and which would be disfavoured. To relate this information more closely to structure it is necessary to create a set of property classes utilizing information about whether residues are buried or on the surface; secondary structure classes; positive &#x03D5; angles in the backbone (indicative of turn regions), and hydrogen bonding properties. Classifying all of the substitution data as above produces tables which are essentially probabilities for replacing one residue by another at a site in a protein with given properties. By bringing all these data together into a master table one can use the method for conventional sequence alignment whereby one structure is <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Modelling biomolecules</a>known, with the properties at all the positions calculated, and the second structure is matched using the substitution tables to complete the comparison matrix. Thus the alignment shows the probability of the unknown structure adopting the fold of the known structure; an alignment with high scoring matches and the minimum of gaps would appear to suggest similarity, but the converse situation would imply that the two were not related. Another interesting property of this method is that apparently anomalous results can point to interesting features such as buried polar residues (usually disfavoured) which could be involved in, say, the active site of an enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent">The second method, known as 3D-1D Profiles, uses a far smaller number of structural classes: eighteen. These are derived from three levels of sidechain burial; three classes of secondary structure, and two classes defining the amount of buried surface in contact with polar residues. Thus a starting protein structure is converted from a sequence of amino acids to a sequence of residue environments. Propensities for a given residue existing in each environment are calculated from an analysis of the composition of known protein structures. These propensities can now be used in sequence alignment methods to determine whether sequences of unknown structure would be consistent with a particular fold. The advantage of 3D-1D Profiles and the previously discussed substitution tables is that once the propensity values are known the method can be used for screening sequence databases to find likely candidates to assume a particular three-dimensional structure. In both cases the secondary structure of the starting structure is known so high gap-penalties can be used to disfavour the breaking of these regions in the alignment. Also, one is no longer restricted to arguments based on homology since one is interested only in consistency of sequence with fold, not that the two sequences are necessarily descended from a common ancestor. This opens up the possibility of finding homologous matches with low similarity scores and even structures which have arisen from convergent evolution but which may have no sequence similarity whatsoever. Obviously the propensities are only as good as their statistical significance but as more structures become available it should be possible to recalculate these values to reflect the extended database.</p>
<p class="indent">One interesting extension of the 3D-1D Profile method is its use to check experimental and model structures. If one takes a set of protein coordinates and calculates the environment at each residue site, the score for the native sequence in that environment can be plotted against residue number. Significant dips in this profile can point out residues in unsuitable environments and in some cases this has been shown to result from mistraced chains in the crystal structure analysis. <a href="#fig5_5">Figure 5.5</a> shows the profiles for myoglobin and a myoglobin structure containing a deliberately misfolded region. Clearly this is a potentially very powerful tool for the verification of model built structures.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The final method to be discussed in this section approaches the problem from a different angle in that instead of posing the question &#x2018;which other sequences are likely to fold in the same way as protein X?&#x2019;, it asks &#x2018;which three-dimensional fold is the most likely to be assumed by sequence Y?&#x2019; It is also known as &#x2018;threading&#x2019;. The authors have created a database of unique <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Modelling biomolecules</a>protein folds against which sequences can be evaluated. The sequences are matched using a dynamic programming method which places energy values in the comparison matrix. The energy values are calculated using a potential of mean force which is, in essence, a distance-dependent probability of finding a given pair of residues. An additional solvation term has been added for surface residues. The advantage of the dynamic programming method is that it allows the systematic investigation of the effect of placing gaps in the sequence by way of a penalty term in the energy function. Thus the comparison matrix can be converted to the maximum match matrix giving the energetically most favourable match of the sequence to the structure. And by carrying out the process across the full range of known folds the most acceptable structure can be found. Again, this method can pick out nonhomologous structures, or domains which might be similar in fold. Also, subject to the limitations of the potential function, it has a greater chance of picking up more marked changes in sequence, such as those resulting from switches in polarity, since the sequence of the three-dimensional fold plays no part in the threading procedure. This is not the case for the other two methods.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, we are now in a position to generate good models for sequences which can show evidence of assuming a fold close to those which are known and can pick out important residues for defining membership of a particular family. In addition, we can identify distantly related or convergently evolved structures. The next step is to use this information to generate model structures.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Modelling by homology</h2>
<p class="noindent">The discussion in the preceding sections has shown how sequence alignment and other methods can identify structures which are potentially similar. This can now be exploited to produce three-dimensional structures of proteins prior to their experimental elucidation. However, one should always be cautious that the relationship between the unknown structure and the sequences of the known structures is significant. At the outset it should be made clear that there may be errors introduced into the model structure which arise from the approximations of the method. This is often used to criticize the utility of the method, but as structure-based methods of drug design become a more prominent tool in the pharmaceutical industry, and the desire to provide a molecular basis of biochemical processes becomes more pressing, it is better to have a carefully built model structure than no structure at all.</p>

<p class="indent">First, some terms will be defined. The generic name for the method is homology modelling, where homology is strictly defined as meaning descended from a common ancestor; there are no degrees of homology, as is sometimes quoted in the literature: a protein either is or is not homologous to another protein. At the time that the method was being developed only structures which had a high level of sequence similarity could be easily identified as candidates for the method so it was limited to homologous structures. Now, as methods such as 3D-1D Profiles and threading allow the <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Modelling biomolecules</a>identification of possibly convergently evolved structures, the strict ancestral link has been broken; we are no longer doing homology modelling, but the name has stuck. Other important terms are Structurally Conserved Regions (SCRs) and Variable Regions (VRs). The former are those parts of the known protein or proteins which show conservation between one structure and another; typically these will be the basis of the core or framework of the protein and will include most of the regular secondary structure regions. The variable regions are stretches of the protein where there is more sequence variability and, often, conformational differences. Fortunately, these regions of the protein will be found on the surface of the protein and the gaps indicate either a reduction or extension of turns or loops. <a href="#fig5_6">Figure 5.6</a> shows a flow diagram outlining the different steps in the modelling procedure. These will now be considered in turn.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">The alignment</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is usual for a newly sequenced protein to be screened against the database of known sequences to determine whether it shows any similarity to a particular class or family. If one restricts this database to those sequences whose three-dimensional structure is known, a successful alignment will produce one or more suitable candidates from which to build a framework. Alternatively, inverse structure prediction methods will give an alignment of sequence to structure without the requirement of sequence similarity. Studies have shown this stage to be the most important of the whole modelling process so care must be taken to check that the alignment has done nothing to break the integrity of the starting structure i.e., introducing gaps in regular secondary structure; burial of charged residues etc. A sample fragment of an alignment is shown in <a href="#fig5_7">Fig. 5.7</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">If a family of structures has been selected as potential templates it is necessary to carry out a multiple sequence alignment to obtain the maximum amount of information. This will give a clearer indication of the more conserved and variable regions in a typical member of the family and also highlights residues which are invariant across the complete set of matches. These should include active site residues, disulphide links if present, and conserved co-factor binding sites. Conserved residues are also important anchor points for the SCRs.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">Construction of the framework</h3>
<p class="noindent">When only one structure is being used as the template for modelling, this stage in the process reduces to a manual inspection of the structure to determine the limits of the conserved regions. For example, if we require to make an insertion into a loop between two regions of &#x03B2;-strand (<a href="#fig5_8">Fig. 5.8</a>), it would be sensible to replace the whole loop by a longer one rather than attempt to incorporate additional residues into the existing one. In this case the SCRs are the two &#x03B2;-strands. Clearly, when using only one structure, each insertion or deletion must be viewed on its own and there is scope for subjective judgement. If multiple structures are being used this is not the case.</p>
<a id="page_72" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 72, Modelling biomolecules</a>
<p class="indent">From the multiple sequence alignment we hope to have obtained a set of key invariant residues. These can now be used to superimpose the structures of the templates in such a way that there is optimum matching of regular secondary structure. The SCR is then defined by starting from the invariant residue and moving along the aligned structures, position by position, on either side, calculating the root mean-squared deviation of the residue positions across the multiple structures. If the structures are close, the SCR is extended by one residue in that direction. This procedure is continued until the chains start to diverge i.e., the variable regions are reached. In this way a set of SCRs can be constructed to represent the framework of the protein. One can either take the average coordinates across the family of structures or choose the structure with the highest degree of sequence similarity for the model SCR. <a href="#fig5_9">Figure 5.9</a> shows the SCRs from a set of aligned structures.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3.3">
<h3 class="h3">Selecting variable regions</h3>
<p class="noindent">If the preceding steps have been carried out carefully the remaining regions to be modelled, the variable regions, should be loops or turns on the protein&#x2019;s surface. A number of different approaches can be taken here and it is suggested that a combination of these methods, rather than dogmatic adherence to one, be used. Usually, modelling the variable regions will require some kind of insertions or deletions in the chain but this must be done in such a way as to minimize distortion of the existing framework.</p>
<p class="indent">The first case to be treated is turns linking antiparallel stretches of secondary structure, most commonly &#x03B2;-strands. Usually the minimum number of residues are involved and the conformational restrictions are quite considerable. To make a change to this type of structure it is advised that the tables of different &#x03B2;-turn geometries compiled by Janet Thornton and coworkers be consulted. These have been derived from an analysis of all such turns in the protein database and point out conformational preferences for a given length of chain. Also, their classification incorporates information about the hydrogen bonding pattern on either side of the turn so appropriate structures can be picked which do not change the register of the chain following the loop.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</aside>
<p class="indent">In many cases the loop structure to be modelled is less strictly defined than above. These can be approached in two ways: database searching or conformational searching. The first of these methods uses the protein database as a source of &#x2018;spare parts&#x2019; for protein modelling. If we require to make an insertion into the loop shown in <a href="#fig5_8">Fig. 5.8</a> our starting information is the length of the loop, its sequence, and the geometry of the framework regions on either side. We can then search through the database looking for a chain of the required length but subject to the constraint that the neighbouring framework must be close to that of our template structure. Most commonly, the matrix of inter-C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> distances is used to compare the framework geometries but additional information such as the backbone dihedral angles at the junction points may also be usefully compared; if these differ markedly to the original structure, the direction that the new chain takes would be quite different. A second indicator could be the mass-centre <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Modelling biomolecules</a>of the loop. By using these criteria we are minimizing the changes made in the modelling procedure.</p>

<p class="fcaption1"><b>Fig. 5.8</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Grafting a new turn structure between two &#x03B2;-strands.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The second method is conformational searching. As discussed in <a href="Chapter_03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, this method, while being rigorous, suffers from the sheer number of conformations to be generated as the size of the loop increases. Unless one has access to hugely parallel computers and carefully constructed, efficient algorithms this method cannot realistically be useful for generating a loop of more than seven residues. Since amino acids can only exist in certain broadly defined conformations the search procedure can be reduced to combinations of these but computer power can still be the limiting factor. Once generated, a set of suitable conformations can be assessed by the same criteria as those located in the database search.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, it is worth mentioning immunoglobulin loops. These are of particular importance since they provide immunoglobulins with their diversity of recognition powers. However, from an analysis of the known three-dimensional structures it was shown that five of the six loops existed in only a small number of conformations, since called the canonical structures. More recent experimental evidence has validated this concept with almost all of the new structures conforming to these rules. One non-canonical loop structure has been found but given the size of the original sample of structures it is surprising that so few exceptions have turned up. Studies have pointed out which residues in a particular loop in an antibody are responsible for determining the conformation, so now most of the loops in an antibody can be modelled using the most suitable canonical structure. The final loop, for which no consensus has been found, must be modelled using other searching methods.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3.4">
<h3 class="h3">Sidechain placement</h3>
<p class="noindent">Studies on the conformations of sidechains in homologous proteins have shown conservation as far as is possible. Therefore, the first group of residues, those which are identical, is easily treated: no change is made. If a residue substitution is being made then, as far as possible, any common sidechain dihedral angles between the old and new sidechains should be conserved. Again, there is experimental evidence that this should be the case. If one considers the protein as a whole, then the sidechains which are constrained more are those on the inside. Packing considerations will play as much of a role as the conformational energies of the individual residues. Therefore, if a mutation is to be acceptable it must make the minimum possible perturbation to the packing arrangement. Thus the conformation must be conserved.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<p class="fcaption1"><b>Fig. 5.9</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Superposition of three immunoglobulin structures showing the conserved &#x03B2;-sheet framework (SCR).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If the new sidechain is very much bigger one must either look to the database for precedents or search for the most favourable conformation. One interesting approach is to devise rules for the likely conformation on substituting one residue for any other. If this is further refined by including secondary structure classes, a set of 1200 substitution rules is obtained. This method can be calibrated using families of homologous proteins.</p>
<p class="indent">Conformational search procedures can be used if the number of rotamers is limited only to those likely to exist i.e., the minima of the torsional <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Modelling biomolecules</a>potential, and sampling can be restricted to, say, dihedral angles beyond those found in the original residue. In the case where a very divergent structure is being built, or a convergently evolved structure, the number of residue substitutions may be great and retention of original conformation might introduce unwanted strain. An interesting method which has proved very successful is to apply simulated annealing to the sidechain dihedrals within the framework of a constrained backbone. This can produce an optimum packing arrangement of the sidechains in close agreement with experiment.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, many of the methods described for homology modelling are available in software packages, but one should be cautious when applying a complete procedure blindly. Structures should be checked closely to avoid errors.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.3.5">
<h3 class="h3">Refinement</h3>
<p class="noindent">The structure obtained from the above modelling steps is likely to be in a very strained state. There will probably be many less than optimal non-bonded contacts, together with deviations in bond lengths and angles at the joins between SCRs and variable regions. Therefore, the structure must be refined in some way. At this stage it is important that the changes in the structure are annealed with as little modification to the starting framework as possible. To do this we must use a gradual approach and try to, first, refine poorly defined regions with respect to a constrained framework, then release the constraints and allow further relaxation of the structure. It is important that the final refinement is done using as few constraints as possible to minimize any bias in the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Refinement can be carried out using just energy minimization but, if packing of the protein&#x2019;s core is to be achieved, it will probably be necessary to use molecular dynamics to avoid the structure being trapped in a local potential well.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The degree of correctness can be assessed in different ways. First, one should check that the structure fulfils the criteria normally expected of an experimental structure: it should show good stereochemistry and not have residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran map (<a href="#fig5_10">Fig. 5.10</a>). Second, any residues in unusual environments should be investigated. These will sometimes be apparent by eye but the 3D-1D Profile method of Eisenberg should give a more systematic picture. Third, check that features such as the solvent accessible surface area are typical for a protein of the length of your sequence. This is a much more sensitive property to the correctness of folding than the molecular mechanics energy. Finally, use any available experimental data to check that these observations are compatible with the model. Only at that stage can one be sure that the model is, in essence, correct.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Modelling enzyme reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although much of the modelling work on biological molecules has focused on structural aspects there is now increasing interest in methods which can <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Modelling biomolecules</a>successfully simulate enzyme reactions. The kind of information which is produced experimentally &#x2013; binding constants, rates of reaction &#x2013; provide little feeling for the molecular basis of catalysis and cannot prove that a particular mechanism is followed. This would appear to be an ideal place for computational methods to fill in the gaps left by the experimentalists and at the same time provide new insights into the way that enzymes work. One of the most important aspects, yet most difficult to quantify, is the nature of the transition state for a given enzymic reaction. It is now generally accepted that the driving force of enzymic reactions results from the stabilization of the transition state compared to what would be expected in solution. The elusive nature of the transition state makes it difficult to describe structurally with the result that vague hypotheses based upon organic chemical intuition, rather than hard structural explanations, exist for most reactions. Without this proper understanding of the nature of a particular transition state we still lack detailed information about why an enzyme works and cannot suggest how its efficiency could be improved.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of methods have been used to probe enzymic reaction mechanisms, and this is still a field under of development. Here we shall discuss some of the approximations which have been made to overcome the problems associated with systems of this size.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.4.1">
<h3 class="h3">Small model systems</h3>
<p class="noindent">In an enzymic reaction bonds are made and broken, therefore explicit account must be taken of the electrons in the system. For this reason molecular mechanics methods are of little use. A common approach has been to model the enzyme as only those residues actually participating in the reaction. A further approximation is to treat amino acid residues as just their functional groups: the carboxylate of an aspartate or glutamate sidechain is modelled as formate; histidine by imidazole, and a peptide linkage by formamide (<a href="#fig5_11">Fig. 5.11</a>). In this greatly reduced form the reacting system can be investigated using <i>ab initio</i> or semi-empirical molecular orbital methods (see <a href="Chapter_02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>). Thus the system is treated essentially <i>in vacuo</i> without reference to its surroundings. In a typical case the model system will have the reacting groups arranged as they are found in the enzyme&#x2019;s structure. Since the &#x2018;bare&#x2019; reacting groups feel no stabilization from the surroundings, as would be the case in the real system, it could be necessary to restrain their movement. Often the concentration of polar groupings will result in very high attractive or repulsive forces. The system can then either be driven along a reaction coordinate by changing the geometry of the model, providing an indication of the energetic pathway for the reaction, or transition state locating algorithms can be used to find the structure of the transient species and calculate their energies. If one is interested in the specific effect of surrounding residues, the appropriate functionality can be added but again its effect may be greatly exaggerated.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In addition to the acknowledged shortcomings related to the size of system, model calculations using <i>ab initio</i> wavefunctions will suffer from all of the usual problems associated with basis set size. More recently a number of successful applications of semi-empirical methods have highlighted this <a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Modelling biomolecules</a>option as having considerable potential; also the size of the system can be greatly increased.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the simplest ways to include the effect of the environment into a model enzyme calculation is to surround the explicitly quantum mechanical segment by charges on the atom centres of the remaining atoms. This has the effect of modelling the influence of the electrostatic potential of the enzyme. Many electrostatic effects result not from explicit atom-atom contacts but from the focusing of long range charge distributions. Consequently, their inclusion into the calculation is an important step towards more realistic simulations. The increase in computer time is not that great since the charged atoms are considered as nuclei and are only included in the one-electron integrals, not the more costly two-electron integral evaluations. Unfortunately this is only a partial solution in that it accounts for the electrostatic effect of the surroundings on the reacting atom but not for polarization effects in the other direction. Thus the charge field is a rather static representation. Also no account is taken of van der Waals interactions which can play a large part in favourable binding energies.</p>
<p class="indent">Attempts have been made to include reaction field effects (see <a href="Chapter_04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>) but only homogeneous fields can be modelled easily. To model an inhomogeneous reaction field, as would be found in a protein, is still not straightforward, and this still leaves the question of the influence of ions and the solvent. Similarly to the charge field method, van der Waals interactions are neglected.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Combined molecular mechanics/quantum mechanics methods</h3>
<p class="noindent">The methods which would appear to hold the greatest potential are those which treat the central reacting system by explicit quantum mechanical methods while allowing the remainder of the system to be represented by a classical model. The energy of the system therefore becomes</p>

<p class="noindent">where the first two terms <i>E</i><sub>QM</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>MM</sub> are reasonably straightforward to calculate. For this type of calculation the reacting system is represented by a similar model system to those discussed in the previous section. The linking bonds between the QM and MM are replaced by hydrogens pointing along the direction of the bonds. The non-bonded interactions between atoms in the molecular mechanics segment of the system are calculated as usual. The last term in <a href="#eq5.1">Eqn. 5.1</a> represents the interactions between the QM and MM atoms: van der Waals interactions between QM and MM atoms are calculated using the appropriate potential for the force field (Lennard-Jones, Buckingham etc.), while electrostatic interactions are incorporated by considering the MM atoms as notional core <i>s</i> orbitals. These can be used to calculate a charged core-core interaction. This latter formulation is necessary due the nature of the MNDO formalism used to treat the QM atoms; if an <i>ab initio</i> method had been used the charges could be included as discussed in the previous section.</p>
<a id="page_77" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 77, Modelling biomolecules</a>
<p class="indent">Clearly this method has some of the disadvantages associated with molecular mechanics calculations in that the basic MM representation cannot account for polarization effects. However, it has been used very successfully to model the reaction carried out by triose phosphate isomerase. On comparing energetic pathways calculated using protonated and neutral histidine residues it was clear that only the latter pathway was consistent with experiment.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">The final method to be discussed is the Empirical Valence Bond Method (EVB) due to Warshel. This is distinct from the other methods in that it does not use molecular orbital theory. First, one must divide the system into the reacting part and the surroundings. For the reacting section one must derive all the possible valence-bond resonance forms; these will be both covalent and ionic. This has the advantage of representing the reaction by chemically intuitive forms. The energy of the reactive system is then found by using the secular determinant formed using all of the resonance structures. The pure forms are placed on the diagonal and the off-diagonal terms represent mixing terms. For the covalent forms the appropriate energy term is usually an empirical force field function, while the ionic resonance forms include an electrostatic term. Diagonalization of this determinant produces an analytical form representing the system so that the energy can now be calculated for any given geometry. To ensure a close fit to experiment the calculation is then calibrated using experimental data on representative systems in solution. When the reaction is carried out in the enzyme, the active site is considered as being &#x2018;solvated&#x2019; by the surrounding protein and non-bonded interactions replace the solvation energy contribution. This is usually done using more complex representations than in a typical molecular mechanics method so allowing polarization of the surroundings. The EVB method has been used to investigate a number of systems and from the results it is clear that electrostatic effects play an enormous part in enzymic catalysis. Also, from the relative contributions of the different resonance forms one can discern the nature of the transition state complex.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">In many circumstances it is now possible to make a reasonable prediction of the structure of a protein from its sequence. Methods which predict secondary structure will typically be around 60&#x0025; reliable but, together with information from multiple sequence alignments, it is possible to make quite realistic divisions into regular and irregular secondary structure. Multiple sequence data also allows the identification of the most likely mutations at particular positions across a family of homologous proteins. Extension of this information to include different structural classes provides excellent tools to approach the inverse folding problem. The first step is to consider the three-dimensional structure as a sequence of environments, then consistent sequences for those environments can be found.</p>
<p class="indent">Once a sequence of unknown structure has been matched with a known structure, homology modelling methods can be used to effect the transformation of one structure into the other. Since insertions and deletions <a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Modelling biomolecules</a>are found in the loops and turns on the surface, the secondary structure of the original protein remains intact. Again, multiple structures will provide a better consensus.</p>
<p class="indent">Theoretical investigations of enzyme mechanisms are now also a possibility. These can range from rather limited studies on gas-phase models up to methods incorporating quantum mechanical fragments into the molecular mechanics force field. Such methods are proving to be very useful in understanding the molecular basis of enzyme activity.</p>
