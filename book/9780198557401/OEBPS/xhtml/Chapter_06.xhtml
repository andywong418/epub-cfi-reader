<h2 class="h2">6.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">One area where computational chemistry has proved to be most useful is in the design of molecules as putative therapeutic agents. The structure of the drug, its receptor, and the interactions between them are analysed closely to find the best way to optimize activity or to give an indication of which molecules would be the most interesting to synthesize. Historically this was not always the case and drugs were discovered by the often discussed phenomenon of serendipity, rather than deliberately designed. The major breakthrough in the development of a rational process of drug design came from the Nobel Prize winning work of Sir James Black, who took as his starting point the working hypothesis that the structure of an inhibitor for the transmitter molecules noradrenalin or histamine should be based upon the structure of the natural transmitter itself. By extending the structure in different ways, and by adding appropriate functionality to the ring and sidechain, he was able to use biological activity to map out the active site in terms of acceptable size and polarity. This systematic approach was the norm until the late 1970s.</p>

<p class="indent">Empirical studies such as the type outlined above were greatly helped by the development of methods for Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR). These techniques can be considered as a natural extension of the methods used in organic chemistry for predicting linear free energy relationships, and the Hammett substituent reactivity constants which had been in use for many years. The idea was to take biological activities and relate these to the properties of the molecules. These properties could be related to size (steric), lipophilicity, or electronic features not dissimilar to the Hammett constants. For a group of compounds a regression equation such as <a href="#eq6.1">Eqn. 6.1</a> could be fitted to the biological activity, giving an indication of the relative importance of each property to the activity</p>

<p class="noindent">In an equation of the type shown above the biological activity factor &#x2013;represented as log (1/<i>C</i>) &#x2013; is considered not just from the viewpoint of receptor binding but also in terms of the transport capabilities of the molecule. The latter is characterized by partition coefficient (<i>P</i>) contributions. The &#x03C3; term is electronic and <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> is a steric term. Thus, while one is attributing activity to the different properties of the molecule there is still some confusion concerning the hydrophobic nature of the molecule as this could contribute both to transport and binding. Therefore, the regression equation could suggest that the drug be optimized in a misleading way such <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Ligand design</a>that a poor binding molecule could give reasonable activity because of optimization of transport properties allowing it to be present at the receptor in high enough concentrations to be active. This is clearly the opposite of the desired result but the blame cannot be attributed fully to QSAR analysis: the nature of the pharmacological data often would not allow further discrimination between the different effects. Fortunately, molecular biology has opened up the possibility of using cloned receptors so biological activity can be separated into its two components: transport and receptor affinity. This less ambiguous data could lead to the more fruitful application of QSAR methods in the future.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.1.1">
<h3 class="h3">3D-QSAR</h3>
<p class="noindent">Since the availability of molecular graphics systems has become more widespread, interest has shifted towards methods which are more intimately concerned with the detailed molecular structure of drug molecules; parameters such as partition coefficients are bulk properties. Improvements in computing power have also allowed more thorough conformational analysis on flexible molecules to be carried out. Thus, structures can now be readily predicted and visualized.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">See Cramer, R. D., III, Paterson, D. E., and Bunce, J. D. (1988). <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, <b>110</b>, 5959&#x2013;5967.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The principal problem when considering drug molecules is the conformation actually assumed at the receptor. There is no reason to believe that this will correspond to structures obtained by crystal structure analysis or the solution conformation from NMR. This forces one to think in terms of consensus structural elements across a range of different molecules. Let us first assume that we know how to carry out molecular superpositions successfully; in later sections this will be discussed in more detail. This allows the evaluation of the influence of different structural features on the behaviour of a drug molecule at the binding site: so called 3D-QSAR. First, a grid is placed around the collection of superimposed molecules. For each molecule in the ensemble interaction energies are calculated using a probe placed at each grid point in turn. This interaction energy is composed of a van der Waals term, usually with respect to an <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> carbon atom, and an electrostatic term. If these two energies are treated separately the structure-activity relationship can be viewed in terms of the more traditional steric and electrostatic contributions. For simplicity we shall assume a ten point cubic grid. So, for each molecule we have 2 &#x03C7; 10<sup>3</sup> energy values (steric and electrostatic) and one value for the binding constant. Now, one must assess the importance of each grid point in determining the binding constant; we are attempting to produce a regression equation in terms of the 2000 variables. Obviously this is a vastly underdetermined problem, as in most cases, one will have only tens of compounds against which thousands of coefficients must be fitted. Fortunately modern least-squares methods can handle such cases.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Analysis of such a huge regression equation can best be done graphically; the grid points surrounding the collection of active molecules can be coloured according to the size of the coefficients and very small values can be ignored. In this way clusters of points can be used to identify regions of common steric or electrostatic energy and thus provide an indication of the <a id="page_81" class="page">Page 81, Ligand design</a>most important regions of the molecules in determining activity. Future molecules may then be designed in such a way that their properties are optimized to these assigned regions of space.</p>
<p class="indent">By concentrating on the fields generated by a molecule, rather than the identity of chemical groups, 3D-QSAR can be thought of as seeing the molecule from the viewpoint of the receptor. As is typical in these cases, the parameters used for comparison will always be open to criticism; particularly the charges. Also, the molecular superposition and the size of the grid spacing will be very sensitive parameters. However, in the light of these shortcomings, the extension of QSAR methods beyond the use of substitution constants must be considered as a major advance.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">Active analogs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although advances in technology are now allowing the characterization of many protein structures, the problem still remains that many of the targets for drug intervention are membrane-bound receptors about which relatively little is yet known. Medium resolution electron microscopy studies have allowed the gross structural features of these receptors to be visualized, but this is still some way from providing a complete set of coordinates. Therefore, the nature of the receptor site must be inferred from the structures of known binding agents. This has become known as the &#x2018;active analog approach&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly the best starting point when attempting to derive a receptor model from known active agents would be a high affinity molecule with little conformational flexibility. This would serve to define the spatial orientation of important units of the molecule. By important groups we mean functionality which would be likely to make a significant interaction with the receptor on binding i.e., amino groups (but their protonation state must be known); hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors; bulky hydrophobic groups (indicative of a hydrophobic pocket at the binding site), etc. If the set of active molecules contains a rigid structure one immediately has a template onto which the other molecules may be fitted. When all the molecules contain some conformational flexibility there are two options: either one can assume that the lowest energy conformer in each case will be the binding conformation, and then attempt to superimpose these structures, or alternatively, represent each molecule by an ensemble of conformations below a certain energy threshold and choose the structure which gives the best fit across the set. The latter is obviously much more time consuming in that many more flexible superpositions must be considered, but makes fewer assumptions about the influence of the receptor on ligand conformation. If only low energy conformations are used, one runs the risk of being completely wrong, or at least of overlooking possible better matches. If the molecules can be fitted using conformations which are energetically not too disfavoured, it is reasonable to assume that the energy difference can be compensated for through interactions with the receptor.</p>
<a id="page_82" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 82, Ligand design</a>
<p class="indent">How best can molecules be fitted? If the group of molecules is not too diverse in structure it may be possible that the appropriate matching units are easily spotted and the superposition carried out manually at the graphics screen. Following this rough matching, paired atoms/groups can be better superimposed using a simple least-squares minimization. If it is not immediately obvious how to match structures i.e., there are considerable differences in the exact functionality, it must be assumed that molecular properties such as the electrostatic potential at the van der Waals surface are similar. The electrostatic potential at a point is simply the electrostatic energy of the interaction between all the charges in the molecule and a hydrogen ion at that position. Thus it is a much better indicator of a molecule&#x2019;s polarity than the actual charges on the atoms. Although it may now be obvious as to which parts of each molecule should be superimposed, there could still be problems associated with the irregular shape of each molecule&#x2019;s surface. For this reason some methods have been developed where the electrostatic potential, or some other characteristic property, is projected onto a regular geometric shape such as an icosahedron or a sphere. Thus the problem of superposition becomes one of matching electrostatic potentials on a few relatively evenly spaced points, giving much greater scope for automating the complete procedure. More complex methods such as Molecular Similarity will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.2">
<h3 class="h3">Pharmacophores</h3>
<p class="noindent">Having obtained a set of optimally aligned drug molecules, two different pieces of information can be gleaned: the pharmacophore, and an indication of the size of the receptor binding site. The first of these, the pharmacophore, is defined in each case by extracting common structural elements from the superimposed structures. These will most likely be involved in binding. Each of these sites on the drug molecule is considered to be essential for activity and often may have already been identified as the matching points in the superposition. <a href="#fig6_3">Figure 6.3</a> shows typical pharmacophore elements for CNS (central nervous system) active drugs and identifies the optimal distance between the amine group and the centre of the aromatic ring. Also, the angle between the lone pair and the vector normal to the ring-plane can only be within certain limits. If, for example, the drug is directed against a metal-containing active site, then acidic groups capable of binding to the metal should be an important component of the pharmacophore. But each system is different and must be considered separately.</p>
</section>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Further discussion of pharmacophores and the active-analog approach can be found in Marshall, G. R. (1987). <i>Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol</i>., <b>27</b>, 193&#x2013;213.</p>
</aside>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.2.3">
<h3 class="h3">Receptor volumes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The second piece of information, the receptor volume, is obtained by application of the active-analog approach. First one requires the superposition of a diverse set of active molecules. If this can be done, and a pharmacophore is apparent, the assumption can be made that each of the drug molecules will bind to the same site on the receptor and so the accessible volume at the binding site must be capable of accommodating the total van der Waals volume enclosing the complete set of molecules. One then does something similar with a set of related molecules which are known <a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Ligand design</a>to be inactive. Assuming that the same units have been used to superimpose the two sets of molecules it should then be possible to superimpose the two total volumes by matching the pharmacophore elements. Subtraction of one volume from the other will indicate those regions occupied solely by the active molecules. This provides information on the steric constraints which might operate at the active site and so give an indication of how to extend a given molecular structure to optimize its binding. Conversely, volumes occupied solely by the inactive molecules might imply clashes with the receptor and hence modifications in this direction would be disfavoured. Methods such as the active-analog approach are greatly enhanced by the use of computer graphics to visualize the occupied and disallowed volumes and provide an immediate &#x2018;assay&#x2019; for any new structure prior to synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent">The most obvious flaw in this method is the assumption that all molecules bind at the same site. Also, one cannot be sure of the reasons for a molecule&#x2019;s inactivity; it may be something other than steric. Finally, a great deal of information is ignored in that one considers only the components of the pharmacophore, and the total volume; very little can be deduced about more subtle interactions between other parts of the molecule and the receptor. However, in spite of these shortcomings, the method has proved to be a very useful starting point for many industrial drug discovery programmes.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.3">
<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Receptor mapping</h2>
<p class="noindent">The most fortunate circumstances from which to initiate drug design studies are those where a detailed structure of the receptor is known and available. This can be either an experimental structure, from crystallography or NMR, or a modelled structure derived using the methods outlined in the previous chapter. Usually the experimental structures are to be preferred but care must be taken to ensure that the correct conformational form or oligomeric state is considered. If working with a modelled structure then one must always bear in mind that certain inaccuracies may be inherent in the modelling procedure. One can now proceed with mapping out the properties of the putative recognition sites.</p>
<p class="indent">Although it is clearly better to have a knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the drug target, this information can be double-edged if one is unsure as to exactly where the ligand will bind, or which residues are important triggers for activity. For enzymes this problem is lessened as the active site quite often resides at the bottom of a clearly defined cleft in the structure, with some access to the surrounding solvent environment. But this is not always the case. If the binding site is unknown then the receptor mapping techniques outlined below must be utilized across the whole structure, with reference to mutation studies and any other available information.</p>

</aside>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.3.1">
<h3 class="h3">Grid maps</h3>
<p class="noindent">If we take as our starting point the hypothetical situation where we know the structure of the receptor and the position of natural substrates or signalling <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Ligand design</a>molecules within that active site, two questions must be asked before designing a new ligand. If the ligand is to block the receptor (an antagonist or inhibitor), first, we must limit ourselves to thinking about which parts of the molecule could be replaced by alternative substituents without affecting the binding properties i.e., we are looking for potential bio-isosteres. Secondly, we must direct our attention to the remainder of the binding region to get an idea of where additional groups could be incorporated into the new ligands such that optimum binding is achieved. Fortunately both of these questions can be answered using the same approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest and most systematic method, which now forms the basis of many variants, is to investigate the energetics of interaction between a representative probe group and the protein. First, the target protein is surrounded by a grid which defines potential interaction sites. Next, a probe group &#x2013; for example: water to represent &#x2013;OH; ammonia for an amine &#x2013; is placed at each site in turn and the interaction energy calculated. Since both the protein and probe groups are kept rigid the energy contains only intermolecular terms: electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrogen bond, but more complex formulations could be used. Many of the grid points can be eliminated as being &#x2018;inside&#x2019; the protein, and hence will have large unfavourable energies, but the remaining points can be contoured according to their energy values allowing clear graphical interpretation of the results. These contoured regions can be selected to display only the most favourable sites (i.e., those that have a reasonable negative energy). <a href="#fig6_4">Figure 6.4</a> shows such a map for an OH~ probe calculated in the active site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">

</figure>
<p class="fcaption1"><b>Fig. 6.4</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Grid map of an active site.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The flexibility of such an approach is most clearly seen when probe maps from a number of different characteristic groups are combined and compared. In this way a very complete picture can be built up of &#x2018;what can go where&#x2019; in the active site of the target molecule. From the relative position of acceptable hydrophobic binding areas and potential hydrogen bonding sites, say, something equivalent to a detailed pharmacophore can be generated. Additionally, one is not restricted to groups which are present in known binding agents; the suitability of any functional group can be tested simply by repeating the calculation with a set of appropriate non-bonded probe parameters. As implemented in most modelling software the method is more complex that outlined above. Directionality of functional groups can be accounted for by considering different orientations of the probe at each grid point, and additional energy functions can be used to accommodate environmental effects and ensure optimum hydrogen bond geometries. The validity of the method was clearly shown by its ability to reproduce the positions of ordered water molecules in x-ray structures, showing that these molecules must be considered as bound to the protein.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.3.2">
<h3 class="h3">Multiple copy minimizations</h3>
<p class="noindent">A second method, which produces a similar end result, is based not on systematic searches on a grid but on energy minimization. Again typical functional groups are represented by small probe molecules, but these could easily be extended to include &#x2018;linker&#x2019; atoms or groups. First, the active site of <a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Ligand design</a>the target protein, or its complete surface, is surrounded by many hundreds of copies of the probe molecule. It is essential that these are randomly placed to eliminate bias due to the starting conditions. The next stage is to minimize all of these molecules simultaneously with respect to the protein&#x2019;s structure. In the minimization procedure the probe molecules cannot see each other, in the sense that no forces are calculated between them; only protein-probe interactions are considered. In this way very many trial orientations or starting positions can be tried at very little extra computational expense. If the minimization procedure is successful the resulting probe positions should show some clustering around favourable binding sites and each cluster can be reduced to a single representative molecule. These can then be used as starting configurations for more rigorous scans of the local environment. As in the previous case the most energetically favourable positions can be contoured for graphical display and the maps from different probe molecules combined. One very important extension which has been made to this method is to allow the inclusion of protein flexibility and so cooperative movements between a ligand and its receptors are simulated.</p>

<p class="indent">Receptor maps produced by the above methods are useful in that multiple maps can provide suitable alternatives to, say, the natural substrate&#x2019;s functionality. But they give almost no clues as to what kind of framework should be placed between these groups. At this stage some kind of &#x2018;docking&#x2019; procedure must be applied to place putative ligands in the active site while satisfying the constraints of the allowed regions.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.3.3">
<h3 class="h3">Docking methods</h3>
<p class="noindent">A considerable number of docking procedures exist in the literature. These range from the use of interactive graphics to manipulate the position of the ligand, to the completely automatic procedures which are becoming increasingly powerful for screening databases of molecules. One novel extension of the former was for the user to make adjustments to the molecule&#x2019;s position <i>via</i> a mechanical arm which provided resistance proportional to the forces felt by the ligand; an occasionally painful experience. However, tests showed that social science undergraduates were as successful as trained molecular modellers in finding the correct ligand position!</p>

</figure>
<p class="fcaption1"><b>Fig. 6.5</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Flow chart for typical docking algorithms.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In principle, many docking algorithms follow a quite similar pattern. A typical flow chart is shown in <a href="#fig6_5">Fig. 6.5</a>. Usually the first stage is to represent the molecules by their solvent accessible surfaces. This smoothes out the exterior of the protein while at the same time defining the size of the molecules. Starting from a number of different relative orientations the two molecules can then be brought together. The driving force for this movement can simply be crude translation and rotation of one structure until there is contact, or alternatively one molecule can be moved subject to force field of the other. More sophisticated methods carry out their moves using a Monte Carlo algorithm to direct both rotations and translations. Rapid convergence to a minimum can be achieved by gradually cooling the simulation temperature as the molecule appears to be descending into a potential well. In effect the lower temperature slows down the extent of movement of the <a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Ligand design</a>ligand by allowing an ever decreasing number of successful moves. In all of these cases the intermolecular energy can be evaluated using a traditional van der Waals plus electrostatics function, but this will have a very steep repulsive penalty if there is any interpenetration of the ligand with its receptor. Increasingly, so called &#x2018;soft potentials&#x2019; are being used which have much less drastic short-range repulsions and allow a certain amount of overlap. In this way they are thought to account for induced fit by the receptor after minimization of the complex. Once a sufficient number of different solutions have been obtained from a range of starting orientations, the complexes can be refined and clustered to remove degenerate structures. At this point it is advisable to include as many experimental data as are known to allow elimination of any structures which are clearly inconsistent. Having found a suitable binding site on the protein, other molecules can be docked simply by superposition. Alternatively, the user might calculate a receptor map to determine which other groups could be used at that site.</p>
<p class="indent">Another successful docking method works, in the first instance, with the volume of the receptor site. Molecules can be matched according to how their shape fits this volume and then scored using an appropriate energy function. As with most of the other methods the program treats the two molecules as rigid entities, and this is widely viewed as the greatest shortcoming of such methods. However, to include flexibility would increase the size of the problem considerably. Typically, it is implicitly understood that all of these methods provide starting geometries for energy refinement.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Generating new structures</h2>
<p class="noindent">Thus far we have concentrated on using ligands of known structure to provide information about the structure and properties of the binding site. The next step is to use this information to suggest new ligands with greater binding affinity.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_6.4.1">
<h3 class="h3">Three-dimensional databases</h3>
<p class="noindent">Traditionally medicinal chemists would take as their starting point a lead molecule which was either one they had synthesized themselves or perhaps a competitor&#x2019;s structure. This &#x2018;lead&#x2019; molecule would then be modified: different substituents could be added; ring systems would be modified, until an active and patentable molecule was found. However, the crucial feature of this process is that the new molecule is likely to look quite similar to the original; there has been no real leap to a different class of compound. Recently, computational methods have come to the chemist&#x2019;s assistance. This has come in the form of techniques to search vast databases of molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">All established pharmaceutical companies will have a huge library of structures which they have made, but often these putative drug molecules will only have been tested for a very limited range of activities. Perhaps other activities reside with these structures. The first stage is to convert the two-dimensional structural formulae into a database of three-dimensional structures. Automated procedures now exist which use knowledge-based <a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, Ligand design</a>approaches &#x2013; they interpret rules for geometry and stereochemistry derived from known structures &#x2013; to carry out this transformation rapidly. In most circumstances this will produce a database of tens of thousands of structures. This database can be further supplemented by the inclusion of other useful structural data such as ring centroids, likely protonation state at physiological pH, lone pair vectors and so on. The database can now be used in conjunction with information acquired from receptor mapping &#x2013; that is to say, the pharmacophore &#x2013; to locate new structures. Since the database contains information about the three-dimensional structure of the molecules, the type of questions asked are related to the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. A typical type of query is shown in <a href="#fig6_6">Fig. 6.6</a>, with the elements of the pharmacophore being the aromatic ring and the amine nitrogen; these require the spatial arrangement shown for optimum activity. This query is then tested against the complete database. Many of the solutions produced will be molecules known to be active at the particular receptor but it should be hoped that other, interesting structures which include this arrangement of the pharmacophore elements turn up. Searching databases simply on the basis of a pharmacophore still leaves the problem that the adjoining segments of the molecule are not defined so care must be taken to test the new structures against all known data on the receptor model, including allowed and disallowed volumes.</p>

<p class="indent">In an earlier section it was mentioned that projecting molecular properties onto a regular shaped geometric shape provides a useful, simplified representation of the molecule for molecular superpositions. Similarly, this method can also be applied to database screening. By extending the comparisons to a molecular property, longer range effects (modulation of the value of p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> by distant electrostatic groups for example) can be accommodated into the comparison procedure. This has the additional advantage that the comparison is no longer being carried out on an atom-to-atom basis, providing much greater scope for topologically different molecules to be picked out. If a second screen, based upon molecular shape, is then carried out by the same procedure it is clear that one stands a reasonable chance of finding a molecule which would be a novel starting point for drug design. The second major advantage in the use of a regular shape is that fitting can be done very quickly using precalculated rotation matrices. Given that this approach seems at first glance to be fairly crude &#x2013;reducing a molecule to at most twenty points on an extended surface &#x2013; it has proved to be remarkably successful in locating useful molecules. It should also be noted that although the above discussion has been restricted to the situation where a single company&#x2019;s database of thousands of molecules is being searched, the complete compound index of <i>Chemical Abstracts</i> is being converted into three-dimensional form allowing millions of molecular shapes to be evaluated.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><i>De novo</i> <b>design methods</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another approach is to attempt to create, <i>de novo</i>, new molecular shapes which will fit a particular receptor site model. An ideal starting point for this approach would be a series of probe maps, as derived in a previous section. <a id="page_88" class="page">Page 88, Ligand design</a>This would define a set of suitable anchor points for particular functional groups. The next stage would be to assemble these into a single molecule using suitable linker regions, say, ring systems, such that the binding groups would be held quite rigidly in place. If the complete set of suitable linker groups is considered to be an ensemble of atomic sites, even more diverse ways of joining the functional groups may be devised by linking appropriate atom centres. The principal advantage of this approach is that one is no longer relying on existing molecules for information, as would be the case in a database search, therefore it is possible that completely novel entities will be found as lead compounds. Furthermore, if one is working with a three-dimensional structure of the receptor it will be immediately apparent if the linker pieces fit snugly into the binding site. Although much more difficult, it is also possible to use this type of method in conjunction with the active analog approach. Clearly, one will be limited by starting from a reduced set of functional-group binding sites, but, if the starting model is suitably well defined, the accessible and inaccessible volumes should be unambiguous.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Genetic algorithms</h3>
<p class="noindent">A further method for generating new structures has recently received considerable attention. This uses so-called &#x2018;genetic algorithms&#x2019;. These programs allow the starting molecule to be modified over successive generations of structures in an analogous way to the random changes in DNA during replication. Changes take place in two different ways: crossover and mutation. In crossover, features of two molecules are combined to produce two new molecules (offspring), each of which contains half of each parent molecule. The second genetic process is mutation: that is to say, single features of molecules are allowed to change between successive generations, subject to an allowed mutation rate. Typically this would take the form of changing one functional group for another. The control process which determines which molecules proceed to the next generation is selection; again analogous to the Darwinian ideal. Molecules can be tested for &#x2018;fitness&#x2019; &#x2013; their goodness of fit to a proposed receptor model &#x2013; with only the most likely structures being propagated forward. Alternatively, selection can be based almost entirely on chance, which would allow less useful structures to continue but if further generations produced no better structure this avenue would be discontinued. The main attraction of this approach is that it is completely random, and while this may produce ridiculous structures much of the time it can also turn up interesting combinations. Apart from setting mutation rates, the only other control which the user has is over the set of functional groups and structural units which are incorporated into the &#x2018;gene pool&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">New structures can be found by a number of methods and many potentially novel compounds can be &#x2018;invented&#x2019; by the various computer algorithms. But the likelihood of these structures being useful is highly dependent on the receptor model used initially.</p>
<p class="indent">The last question to be addressed is how similar are two structures, and can this be quantified?</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Molecular similarity</h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the most difficult comparisons that a medicinal chemist is faced with is to consider how similar two molecules actually are. This is clearly a rather loose idea (just as the word similar implies) however considerable inroads have been made towards providing useful indices of similarity. To complicate things further one must also consider similarity of more than one property for the method to be a useful tool for ligand design; molecules must show both electrostatic and shape similarity.</p>
<p class="indent">In the preceding sections we have taken it for granted that sets of molecules can be superimposed without difficulty, or that the comparison of new molecules is routine. Clearly this is only so if the molecules are based upon related chemical frameworks, but if one is pursuing novelty then this will not be the case. The idea of shape similarity is obvious and stems from some of the earliest analogies about the nature of interactions between big molecules and small molecules: the lock and key. Electrostatic similarity is less easy to picture in that it is a property that results not just from an individual grouping but also from the influence of the rest of the molecule on that site. Remembering that the electrostatic potential at a point results from the sum over all charges, it should be obvious that different charge distributions could result in not dissimilar potentials.</p>

<p class="noindent">which compares both magnitude and shape.</p>
<p class="indent">The major problem with these methods is the complexity of the integrals involved and their computing requirements. This has necessitated the search for other parameters to compare. One such alternative is the electrostatic potential which is a much better indicator of a molecule&#x2019;s electrostatic properties than the atom-centred charges, while at the same time it can be rapidly calculated from the molecular wavefunction or from a point charge distribution. A practical problem is that the electrostatic potential goes to infinity as it approaches the atom centres but this can be overcome by considering only the potential beyond the van der Waals surface of the molecule. Thus the electrostatic potential can be calculated on a grid <a id="page_90" class="page">Page 90, Ligand design</a>surrounding the molecule and the similarity of potential can be calculated using <a href="#eq6.3">Egn. 6.3</a>. If one uses point charges to calculate the potential then conformational flexibility can be introduced to find the fit between two molecules which maximizes their similarity; a tool of considerable importance for many of the methods used in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarity of molecular shape is also quantifiable in a very simple way. First, a pair of superimposed molecules is surrounded by a rectilinear grid. Each grid point is then tested as to whether it lies inside the van der Waals surface of one, two, or neither of the molecules. Similarity is then evaluated using <a href="#eq6.4">Eqn. 6.4</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Summary</h2>
<p class="noindent">A vast array of methods is now available to facilitate the design of novel ligands for biomolecules, particularly putative drug molecules. Often the target for the drug is not structurally defined and one must infer structural information from the molecules which do and do not show activity inbiochemical assays. By superimposing molecules one can define the most likely binding units (the pharmacophore) and the properties and volumes of other sites of the receptor. If the receptor structure is known it can be mapped to show possible binding sites for particular functional groups. This can be treated as the equivalent of a pharmacophore for the purposes of database searches or as constraints for <i>de novo</i> ligand design. In the latter a computer program attempts to fit molecular fragments between functional group binding sites to create new molecules, or alternatively, genetic algorithms can be used. The final test for any new molecule is whether it resembles the existing active molecules. Molecular similarity techniques allow both shape and electrostatic similarity to be quantified. These techniques can also be useful at the earliest stages in the design process where optimal superposition of molecules is required.</p>
