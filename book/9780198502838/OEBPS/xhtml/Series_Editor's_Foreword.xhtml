<p class="fm-no1">The state of natural waters is a subject of vital concern to all of us. Establishing the effects of humanity&#x2019;s activities on them can only follow an understanding of their intrinsic properties. Many of these can be explained using the bases of inorganic aqueous solution chemistry and it is the theme of this book to provide these principles and to illustrate their application.</p>
<p class="fm-in">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would normally be covered in an 8&#x2013;10-lecture course. As well as giving up-to-date information, this series provides explanations and rationales that form the framework of an understanding of inorganic chemistry. Alan Howard here gives us the basis of the course he has successfully introduced in Southampton over the last three years. He shows how the fundamentals of equilibrium inorganic chemistry can be used to account for the properties of natural waters in their varied environments.</p>
