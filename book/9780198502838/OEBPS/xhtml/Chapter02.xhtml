<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.1">
<h2 class="main">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> Types of natural waters</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are many ways by which natural waters can be classified and it must be recognized that the movement of water through the environment does not limit it to any single category. It is often convenient however to consider the Earth&#x2019;s surface as a suitable cut-off point.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Groundwater</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is the water below the Earth&#x2019;s surface. The interface between the upper region, where air is present in the soil and underlying rocks, and the level below which any pores, cracks etc. are filled with water is called the <b>water table.</b> The quantity of water that can be held as groundwater and its mobility are dependent upon the nature of the geology. The quantity of water that can be held within the rock structure is governed by its porosity.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><b>porosity</b> = the proportion of a rock which is void space and which can hold water.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">A rock which is porous does not necessarily permit the ready movement of water through it and the term <b>permeability</b> is used to describe the ability of water to move through the rock. The size, nature, and interconnections between the pores, voids, and cracks through a rock governs its permeability.</p>
<p class="indent">Groundwater spends a significant time in contact with the underlying rock and this results in the dissolution of minerals and nutrients. The chemical composition of the groundwater will therefore reflect the underlying geology of the region. As it moves through the rock beds much of the dissolved and paniculate material which has been picked up at the surface is removed by filtration and adsorption but at the same time some of the rock material will dissolve. Where the water table intercepts the surface, groundwater seeps out forming springs, streams, swamps, and lakes.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Limestones often have low porosities but high permeabilities. This results from the rock having large channels and fissures. A shale on the other hand may hold a lot of water due to its high porosity, but permeability through its small pores may be slow.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="main2">Surface waters</h3>
<p class="noindent">The concentration of salt in the water allows us to divide surface waters into two broad categories. Freshwater is distinguished from saline water by its low salt content and is most commonly found in rivers and lakes.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Local situations, such as volcanic activity, can result in extreme natural water conditions not covered in this general description.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The most significant example of a saline water is oceanic seawater. Whilst the chemical composition of seawater varies slightly from area to area due to the addition of freshwater and evaporation, it typically contains <i>c</i>. 35 g of dissolved salt per litre. This is made up of a number of different ions, the most dominant of which are sodium and chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">Freshwater and seawater come together in estuaries resulting in regions of intermediate salt content. In a well-mixed estuary a salinity gradient occurs between the river and the estuary mouth (<a href="#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>).<a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 2 The aquatic environment</a></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Freshwater and seawater have different densities and in many poorly mixed estuaries the less dense river water can lie on top of the incoming seawater for a large proportion of the estuary; such an estuary is said to be stratified.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig2.1">
<img src="../images/fig2.1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.1</b> The salinity (S) along atypical estuary.</figcaption></figure>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Salinity is the weight in grams of inorganic ions dissolved in 1 kg of the water. In practice this cannot be measured and it is normally assessed by measuring the conductivity of the water relative to the conductivity of a standard seawater. This measure of salinity is therefore unitless. Older texts however will be found which give measured salinity values with units of parts per thousand (1&#x2030;) or g dm<sup>&#x2013;3</sup>.Typical open ocean salinities lie in the range 32 to 37.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Estuaries are complex areas in which both dissolved and particulate materials are subjected to often quite rapid changes in chemical and physical environment. Most significant of the changes that occur are those involving pH and salinity. If either of these change significantly, it can induce the precipitation of dissolved species or the redissolution of material from the sediments. Those elements which are neither added to, nor removed from the dissolved phase during the mixing of freshwater and seawater in the estuary are described as behaving <b>conservatively</b> (<a href="#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>).</p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig2.2">
<img src="../images/fig2.2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption style="width:90%;"><b>Fig. 2.2</b> Conservative and non-conservative behaviour of dissolved material in an estuary.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">This is normally reflected in the concentration of a dissolved component being linearly related to salinity. <b>Non-conservative</b> behaviour results from material being deposited or added to solution during its movement through the estuary.</p>
<p class="indent">A significant example of such behaviour is the precipitation of riverine colloidal iron as it encounters the increasing salinity in an estuary. This results in iron being deposited into the sediments.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-3.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The precipitating material may take with it other elements by co-precipitation or adsorption.</p>

<h2 class="main">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span> The hydrologic cycle</h2>
<p class="noindent">Whilst much of the World&#x2019;s water is to be found in the oceans, it is also present in lakes, rivers, snowpacks, glaciers, polar ice caps, in the ground, organisms, and the atmosphere. It is constantly moving, both as liquid and vapour, transporting with it the gases and nutrient materials required for life. Its movement is a cycle, recirculating water between temporary storage compartments (<a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>).<a id="page_12" class="page">Page 12, Chapter 2 The aquatic environment</a></p>
<figure class="imgc" id="fig2.3">
<img src="../images/fig2.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.3</b> The cycling of water.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">This cycling is not limited to purely physical processes. Vegetation cover, for example, can reduce the rate of direct evaporation of water from the soil, but at the same time will result in the loss of water to the atmosphere by <b>transpiration.</b></p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2.35em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Transpiration = loss of water from plants.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec2.3">
<h2 class="main">2.3<span class="space">&#160;</span> Water, nature&#x2019;s solvent</h2>
<p class="noindent">Water is the most ubiquitous liquid on the Earth&#x2019;s crust and it has many properties which govern its environmental impact. Firstly, it has a very high dielectric constant making it an excellent solvent for ionic substances. It therefore causes the dissolution of minerals, increasing their mobility and aiding the delivery of nutrients to plants. For aquatic plants to survive, light must be available to them for photosynthesis. Water is transparent to visible and long wavelength ultraviolet light permitting the penetration of the light required for photosynthesis to some depth.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-5.8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Light only penetrates to about 200 m in the oceans, limiting photosynthesis to a relatively small upper layer of water.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The ability of water to store heat, and the energy required for it to evaporate, play important roles in maintaining the structure and temperature of water bodies. It is relatively difficult to alter the temperature of a mass of water due to the high heat capacity of water (4.19 kJ kg<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> K<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). Water also has an extremely high heat of vaporization (2260 kJ kg<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) which limits its vaporization, protecting the organisms which live in it.</p>
<p class="indent">The density-temperature relationship of water is rather unusual (<a href="#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>) and has a number of environmental consequences. The density of water is at a maximum at 4&#x00B0;C above its freezing point.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 2.5</b> The stratification of a lake.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent">This causes ice to float and prevents large bodies of water from completely freezing. In non-flowing bodies of water, such as lakes, stratification can occur due to the solar heating of the water surface. The warmer water (the <b>epilimnion</b>), having a lower density, floats on a cooler (more dense) bottom layer (the <b>hypolimnion</b>) (<a href="#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Between these two layers there is a region in which the temperature changes rapidly called the <b>thermocline.</b> One consequence of this thermal stratification and poor mixing between the layers is that whilst the epilimnion is in contact with the atmosphere, and is therefore well provided with oxygen, the hypolimnion is cut off from an oxygen source and can become depleted of oxygen. This depletion can become particularly pronounced as the little oxygen which is present is used up in oxidizing dead organic matter falling to the bottom of the lake. The upper levels are therefore favourable to <b>aerobic</b> organisms, often resulting in a heavy growth of algae.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4.6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Aerobic = requiring free oxygen for respiration.</p>
<p class="sidebar">Anaerobic = not requiring oxygen.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If the lower water becomes oxygen depleted this will favour the growth of <b>anaerobic</b> organisms such as <b>methanogenic</b> and <b>sulfate-reducing</b> bacteria.</p>
<p class="indent">During the period of stratification nutrients build up in the bottom waters as they are released from decaying matter. In the autumn the water stratification becomes unstable as the epilimnion cools causing the surface water to increase in density and to mix with the lower water. As this happens the thermal stratification disappears (the <b>overturn</b>). Chemicals in the water layers mix and the water body becomes more uniform, providing a release of nutrients from the lower water into the nutrient-deficient upper water which induces an increase in biological activity. The fertilization of the upper water column results in a burst of growth of micro-algae called a phytoplankton bloom. These blooms commonly occur in both the spring and autumn as a result of the overturns.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Methanogenic = methane producing. Sulfate-reducing bacteria obtain their energy by reducing sulfate (S(VI)) down to sulfide (S(&#x2013;II)).</p>

<h2 class="main">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> Dissolved inorganic compounds in natural waters</h2>
<p class="noindent">The quantity of dissolved material in natural waters varies greatly. At the two common extremes, rainwater may contain as little as a few milligrams of dissolved material per litre whereas seawater contains approximately 35 g of salt per litre. The presence of even a few milligrams of dissolved matter in a litre of rainwater may at first seem surprising. This is derived from a number of sources: sulfate from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and dimethylsulfide, and nitrogenous material from terrestrial vegetation and <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 2 The aquatic environment</a>combustion emissions. Especially in coastal regions, a large proportion of the material is derived from sea salt in aerosol particles released into the atmosphere from breaking waves.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-17em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Dimethylsulfide (Me<sub>2</sub>S) comes from the breakdown of the dimethylsulfoniopropionate generated by some phytoplankton in the World&#x2019;s oceans. Being a volatile species it is released into the atmosphere.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">After falling onto the land, rainwater moves both through and over the soil and underlying rocks dissolving material as it travels. Organic matter is picked up during this process but can be removed from the water if it subsequently travels through the groundwater system. Such a route may also increase the inorganic content of the water.</p>
<p class="indent">The concentrations of metals which are present in natural waters are highly variable, reflecting the geology of the catchment area and its history. A large proportion of the material which is dissolved in water is in fact made up of metal salts (<a href="#tab2.1">Table 2.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">All natural waters contain organic matter. Some of this is living, ranging in size from bacteria to whales; some is decaying, and some has been introduced from external sources such as drainage, factory pollution, and atmospheric fallout. The natural dissolved organic matter in water is made up of the transformation products of <b>biogenic</b> material and biological excretion products. Organic compounds are secreted and excreted by all living organisms and these in turn are broken down into smaller species by bacteria and chemical processes. Proteins, amino acids, fats, lignins, etc., the structural elements of plants and animals, are being broken down continuously both whilst the organism is living and as it decays. The products of the degradation and the compounds which are formed by the reassociation of these fragments, lead to a complex mix of dissolved organic compounds in the water.</p>

<p class="noindent">Much of the dissolved organic matter is of high molecular weight and falls under the title of humic matter.</p>
<p class="indent">Humic matter is a complex mixture of polymeric material, having molecular weights above 300 Dalton. Its solubility and metal complexing abilities are largely determined by it containing a large number of phenolic and carboxylic acid groups. Historically, this material has been divided into three main groups according to the conditions under which the components can be extracted. These are:</p>
<p class="blist" style="margin-top:1em;">&#x2022;<span class="space">&#160;</span><b>humic acids</b>&#x2014;compounds which are alkali soluble but which are precipitated by acid</p>

<p class="blist">&#x2022;<span class="space">&#160;</span><b>humin</b>&#x2014;material which cannot be extracted by acid or base.</p>
<p class="indentt">Humic material has no single structure and it is only therefore possible to make generalizations regarding its structure from NMR, infrared, group specific colorimetry, and titrimetric analysis. Due to its ready availability and the ease by which significant quantities of humic matter can be extracted, more is known about the humic matter that can be extracted from peat and river waters than any other source. Marine humic matter is currently believed to be much less aromatic in structure than its freshwater equivalent. <a href="#fig2.7">Figure 2.7</a> illustrates some of the structural features which have been proposed as typifying humic matter.</p>
