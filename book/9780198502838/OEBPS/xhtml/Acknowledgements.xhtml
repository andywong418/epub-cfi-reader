<p class="fm-no">The author would like to thank all those who so freely gave of their time to read the initial &#x2018;drafty&#x2019; manuscript. In particular I would like to thank John Evans, Sandra Dann, Gillian Reid, and Peter Statham for their detailed comments which have led to significant improvements being made to the manuscript. My thanks are also due to Roger Parsons for his help in developing an approach to the problem, unsolvable at this level, of whether to assign units to equilibrium constants.</p>
