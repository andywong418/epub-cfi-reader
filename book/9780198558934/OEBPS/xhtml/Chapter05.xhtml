<p class="sidebar">This chapter deals mainly with nucleophilic substitution, though the second step of the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism can be regarded as an addition reaction, and will feature also in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. Electrophilic substitution is also discussed in this chapter; while radical substitution is covered in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>. The discussion is centred on reactions at carbon, but the mechanisms and the stereoelectronic basis of the chemistry involved are of much wider application.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Substitution, or displacement, reactions are the commonest of all organic reactions, and substitutions at sp<sup>3</sup>-carbon were the first to be studied in depth. We know that two, conceptually quite different, mechanisms may be involved. The reaction can be concerted, with the new bond forming as the old bond breaks:</p>

<p class="eq" style="margin-bottom:0.9em;margin-top:0.9em;"><b>R &#x2014; X + Y&#160;&#160;&#x2192;&#160;&#160;R &#x2014; Y + X</b></p>

<p class="noindent">or stepwise, with separate bond-breaking and bond making steps:</p>
<p class="eq" style="margin-bottom:0.9em;margin-top:0.9em;"><b>R &#x2014; X&#160;&#160;&#x2192;{[R] + X&#160;&#160;&#x2192;&#160;&#160;[R] + Y}&#160;&#160;&#x2192; R &#x2014; Y</b></p>
<p class="noindent">[R] here represents a group short of one bond. It can be a cation, as in the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism for nucleophilic substitution; an anion, in which case the reaction is electrophilic substitution; or a radical.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Concerted nucleophilic substitution: the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The familiar S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is conventionally represented by a pair of curved arrows (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>), which provide a convenient and accurate indication of what is going on.</p>

<p class="indent">The orbital interactions involved in a simple displacement process were introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> for the transfer of a proton from an acid HX to ammonia (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). <a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>The lone pair of NH<sub>3</sub> is an sp<sup>3</sup>-hybrid orbital with an axis of symmetry, and thus defined directionality, while the H&#x2014;X bond of the acid defines the axis of symmetry of the &#x03C3;*<sub>H&#x2013;X</sub> orbital. The most efficient overlap between the two occurs along a common axis, as shown (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at a saturated carbon centre involves very similar orbital interactions. The HOMO is usually a non-bonding electron-pair on the nucleophile, as it is for ammonia. The LUMO in the case of an alkyl halide, or similar system with a C&#x2014;X bond to a good leaving group (X strongly electronegative) is now the antibonding orbital, &#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub>. The most efficient HOMO/LUMO interaction is then along the common axis of the two orbitals (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>, top).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that, purely on symmetry grounds, attack of the nucleophile might take place on X. This does not happen in this system because a carbanion is not a viable leaving group. (In frontier-orbital terms, the larger coefficient of &#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> is at the carbon end, so overlap is more efficient there.) But nucleophilic attack at a halogen centre is a perfectly normal reaction when it is attached to a viable leaving group, like a second halogen. Nucleophilic attack on the X&#x2014;X bond involves the same interactions as the reaction with C&#x2014;X shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. The only difference is that the LUMO is now &#x03C3;*<sub>X&#x2013;X</sub>, and lower in energy, making the reaction with a given nucleophile much faster. Ammonia, for example, reacts sluggishly with most alkyl halides, but instantaneously with halogens.</p>

<p class="indent">The extra dimension to displacement at sp<sup>3</sup>-carbon is its stereochemistry. The smooth transition from the orbital system of the starting materials to that of the products, maintaining maximum overlap throughout, leads naturally to inversion of configuration. At the halfway stage there can be equal amounts of weak bonding to nucleophile and leaving group (<b>5.1</b>). If the nucleophile and leaving group happen to be the same (as in the displacement of iodide by iodide, which is a particularly easy reaction) the transition state becomes perfectly symmetrical. At this point the three &#x2018;spectator&#x2019; substituents on the central carbon atom lie in a plane, and there is partial bonding to the incoming nucleophile and the leaving group. <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>
</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Remember that a transition state represents the &#x2018;structure&#x2019; corresponding to the point of highest energy on the reaction coordinate. But it is at the same time an energy minimum with respect to all other motion, because the reaction coordinate defines the minimum energy pathway from starting material to product.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The actual configuration of <b>5.1</b> is trigonal bipyramidal. Note that it is a transition state (an energy maximum on the reaction coordinate), and thus not a stable structure, because carbon cannot support more than four two-electron bonds. The linear arrangement of nucleophile, central carbon atom and leaving group is an essential feature: if it is not possible the reaction is not observed. Such cases are covered by Baldwin&#x2019;s rules (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a> above), and discussed in the next section. Conversely, any structural feature which can stabilise the trigonal bipyramidal arrangement (<b>5.1</b>) will lower the energy of the transition state and thus favour the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. This factor is the basis of a number of stereoelectronic effects on reactivity that are discussed below, in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.3">Section 5.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">One reaction of this type that we will not discuss further is substitution at formally saturated centres other than carbon. If the element concerned comes from the third, or a higher row of the Periodic Table, it may be able to form an extra electron-pair bond using a vacant atomic orbital. This leads to a third, addition-&#x00E9;limination mechanism for substitution at such centres. This is similar to the familiar addition-elimination mechanism for substitution at sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised carbon, which is discussed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">A simple example is the equilibrium</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/36_1.jpg" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="sidebar" style="text-align:justify;">which allows the exchange of chloride anions at the phosphorus centre. Each exchange is formally a nucleophilic substitution.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stereoelectronic barriers to intramolecular alkyl-group transfer</h2>
<p class="noindent">The trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the transition state for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction requires a linear arrangement of nucleophile, central carbon atom and leaving group, as shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>. This arrangement is not possible as part of a 6-membered ring. As a result, what may look like perfectly reasonable intramolecular alkyl-group transfers (e.g. <b>5.2 &#x2192; 5.3</b>) are in fact more complicated reactions.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">No curved arrows are drawn for the reaction of <b>5.2</b> because the direct methyl transfer from oxygen to nucleophilic carbon does not occur.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/36_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Labelling experiments show that methylation of the carbanion is in fact an intermolecular reaction: as we should now expect, because the intramolecular reaction would be 6-endo-trig, a class disfavoured according to Baldwin&#x2019;s rules (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">Section 4.2</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_28">page 28</a>). Thus in an experiment where the reaction was stopped before it was complete, by neutralising the carbanion, a mixture of three products <b>5.3</b> &#x2013; <b>5.5</b> was obtained), showing clearly that <b>5.3</b> is not the initial product of reaction. <a id="page_37" class="page">Page 37, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>

<p class="indent">As usual, the stereoelectronic barrier is not absolute: it is not necessary for the N&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;C&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;X angle at C to be exactly 180&#x00B0;, and borderline cases are to be expected. Most of these are of little synthetic interest, and endo-tet reactions involving medium-sized rings face the additional disadvantage of conformational strain. Thus methyl transfer to nitrogen from the sulphonate ester group of <b>5.6</b>, to give the zwitterion <b>5.7</b>, is still an intermolecular process.</p>
<section id="sec5.2.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reactions involving the epoxide ring</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Three-membered rings stretch all the rules. They are easily formed, despite the angle-strain associated with internal angles close to 60&#x00B0;, so 3-exo-tet is evidently a favourable process: even though at first sight the geometry of the S<sub>N</sub>2-type transition state (e.g. for epoxide formation, <b>5.8</b>) looks worse than the one rejected by <b>5.6.</b></p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/37_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">A helpful way of thinking about the stereoelectronic arrangements in this reaction is to visualise the HOMO/LUMO interaction between &#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;Cl</sub> and the centre of electron density of the oxygen lone pair (<b>5.10</b>), rather than taking literally the angles defined by the reacting nuclei. This is legitimate in this special situation because &#x03C3;-bonds in three-membered rings are considered to be bent, with centres of electron-density outside the lines connecting the nuclei (see below, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_74">page 74</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are strict limits on the degree of tolerance allowed, as shown by the conformational control of epoxide opening and formation in six-membered rings (compare the reactions of <b>5.11</b> and <b>5.12).</b> The in-plane arrangements (<i>cf</i>. <b>5.10</b>) may seem to bend the rules, but the requirement that all the orbitals (and therefore all the atoms) involved must lie in the same plane is strict. The correct trans-coplanar geometry is easily available only when oxygen nucleophile and leaving group are both axial (<b>5.11</b>). The more difficult this geometry is to attain, the more likely that some other (or no) reaction will be observed. Thus <b>5.12</b> does eventually give epoxide, but the reaction is thousands of times slower, and presumably goes through a high energy twist-conformation to get the oxygen and bromine centres more or less coplanar. <a id="page_38" class="page">Page 38, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>
</p>
<figure class="fig">

</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The trans-ring junction in <b>5.11</b> and <b>5.12</b> (the bracket represents a second, trans-fused 6-membered ring) prevents ring inversion. But the free end of the ring retains a good deal of conformational flexibility.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The most important consequence is for the reverse reaction, when an epoxide is opened by a nucleophile. A nucleophile attacking epoxide <b>5.13</b> has a choice of two similar secondary centres, but attack at one of them must go through the high energy conformation, and thus transition state, involved in the slow cyclisation of <b>5.12</b>. The observed ring-opening reaction thus gives specifically the diaxial product corresponding to <b>5.11</b>. Here the combination of stereoelectronic and conformational preferences determines which of two different products is formed.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="figure-aside-center">
<img src="../images/38_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">When an epoxide is opened by an intramolecular nucleophile Baldwin&#x2019;s classifications are less clear-cut. To take just one example: the unique geometry of the three-membered ring allows the 5-exo-tet reaction (<b>5.14</b>), but is reasonable also (<b>5.15</b>) for the formation of a six-membered ring. It can be argued that the epoxide oxygen is just as much an exo as an endoleaving group with respect to the six-membered ring (compare reactions <b>5.15</b> and <b>5.16</b>). This is one of those points where fine distinctions can become a matter of semantics. The recommended avoiding action is to go back to the basic stereoelectronics and examine each situation on its merits. The important consequence is that competition between 5-exo and 6-endoring opening, for example, is much more equal for epoxides than for other leaving groups. Both are possible, and the balance can be changed by suitable patterns of substituents on the epoxide carbon atoms.</p>

<h2 class="h2">5.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stabilisation of the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state by delocalisation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The transition state represented by <b>5.1</b> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>) is a high energy species, and very sensitive to local structural features which may stabilise or destabilise it. The two partial bonds, derived by mixing a filled and a vacant orbital, can be regarded as having to some extent the character of both. This means that stabilising delocalisation should be available from both electron donor and vacant orbitals, and this becomes significant if good donors or acceptors are involved. <a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 5.4</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The strongest interactions are with &#x03C0;-donors and acceptors. The three most important examples are summarised in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>, and discussed in turn below. The symmetry allows efficient overlap with any p or &#x03C0;-type orbital: the effect observed depends on its energy level as either donor or acceptor.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no doubt, for example, that an adjacent carbonyl group (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>, <b>5.1</b> + &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>) will act exclusively as a &#x03C0;-acceptor. Conversely an adjacent oxygen or nitrogen acts as expected as an electron-pair donor (e.g. <b>5.1</b> + n<sub>O</sub>). But the HOMO and LUMO associated with an adjacent &#x03C0;-system (allyl or benzyl, shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a> specifically as <b>5.1</b> + &#x03C0;<sub>C=C</sub>) can vary a great deal, depending on substituents. The S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state can thus derive stabilisation by overlap with either.</p>
<section id="sec5.3.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions at allyl and benzyl centres</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The stabilisation of the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state available from bonding overlap with &#x03C0;-donor orbitals (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>, <b>5.1</b> + &#x03C0;<sub>C=C</sub>) provides a simple explanation of the well-known high reactivity of allyl (<b>5.17</b>) and benzyl derivatives (<b>5.18</b>) in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, compared with the corresponding saturated aliphatic compounds. Thus dimethylaniline is alkylated by allyl bromide over 100 times faster than by ethyl bromide; and benzylic halides react faster still when compared with the corresponding ethyl derivatives.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/39_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Allyl and benzyl derivatives with good leaving groups also undergo rapid S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions. The source of the stabilisation is the same &#x03C0;-donor system as shown in <b>5.1</b> + &#x03C0;<sub>C=C</sub>, but now the acceptor is the developing p-orbital of the carbocation, potentially a more powerful electron&#x2013;sink (lower energy LUMO).</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">There is evidence in some cases that an adjacent &#x03C0;<sub>C=C</sub>-system can also act as a &#x03C0;-acceptor. A double bond conjugated to a C=O group, for example, acts exclusively as a &#x03C0;-acceptor. More subtle are a number of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions of substituted benzyl derivatives (<b>5.18</b>) which are accelerated by both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents Y. The likely explanation is that, for Y = H, &#x03C0;&#x2013;donor and &#x03C0;-acceptor stabilisation are roughly in balance. The effect of the substituent is then to increase either one more than it decreases the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The importance of &#x03C0;-stabilisation is brought home very clearly by what happens when this delocalisation is not available. The sulphonium compound <b>5.19</b> is debenzylated smoothly by thiocyanate, as expected: both the benzylic centre and the sulphur atom of the thiocyanate anion are well-known to show high reactivity in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. Attack on the ethyl group is not observed, and must be much slower than attack at benzylic carbon. <a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>
</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/40_01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Just how much slower is suggested by the result with the cyclic sulphonium compound <b>5.20</b>, which has the same arrangement, of an ethyl group and two benzylic carbons on the sulphonium sulphur. The reaction is now 8000 times slower, under the same conditions. Moreover, the main product is now the heterocycle <b>5.21</b> (80%), produced by attack on the ethyl group: only 20% of the reaction of thiocyanate with <b>5.20</b> takes place at benzylic carbon. The competition for the nucleophile between the ethyl and benzylic centres is now more closely balanced, because in <b>5.20</b> the benzylic C&#x2014;S bonds are held by the five-membered ring more or less in the plane of the or-system of the aromatic ring. As a result the &#x03C0;-delocalisation that makes a normal benzylic centre so reactive (<b>5.1</b> + &#x03C0;<sub>C=C</sub> in terms of <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>) is not available, and the benzylic CH<sub>2</sub> groups are no more reactive than any other primary centre.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec5.3.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions next to carbonyl groups</b></h3>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The discussion in this section is limited to reactions next to C=O, but the conclusions apply equally to other electron-deficient systems with &#x03C0;-symmetry, such as C=N, C=N<sup>+</sup> and C=N.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">When the adjacent &#x03C0;-system is a carbonyl group the only significant delocalisation of the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state is with the antibonding &#x03C0;* orbital. Thus S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity is not observed, but concerted reactions with nucleophiles may be strongly accelerated. Depending on the nucleophile and the conditions reactions may be even faster than the corresponding reactions at benzylic centres. The displacement of chloride by iodide from phenacyl chloride, PhCOCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, for example, is 10<sup>5</sup> times faster than from a simple primary alkyl chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">The interpretation in terms of delocalisation into &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub> ((<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>) is supported in this case also by experiments with systems where overlap is prohibited by the geometry. The simplest to interpret is a comparison between the opening of the ring of <b>5.22</b> by iodide and the corresponding intermolecular displacement, of effectively the same very good leaving group from the phenacyl system (<b>5.23</b>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/40_02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent"> <a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>The reaction of the open-chain compound <b>5.23</b> is several thousand times faster at low temperatures than that of the ring-opening of <b>5.22</b>. The difference is entirely accounted for by a less favourable enthalpy of activation, as expected for an electronic effect. The explanation is that the C&#x2014;O bond to the leaving group (starred in <b>5.22</b>) is held in the plane of the carbonyl group by the five&#x2013;membered ring: which is made up &#x2013; apart from the CH<sub>2</sub> group under attack &#x2013; of four sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised atoms, and thus unable to pucker even to the small extent possible for a normal ring of this size. The transition state for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of <b>5.23</b> can take advantage of the normal stabilisation available from delocalisation into &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec5.3.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reactions next to hetero-atoms</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have already seen (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec3.4">Section 3.4</a>) that the second heteroatom in a system X&#x2014;C&#x2014;Y has a profound effect on the bond to the first. When the system is symmetrical (X = Y) the two C&#x2014;X bonds are shortened and strengthened. This is explained, at least in part, by the n&#x2013;&#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> interactions of the anomeric effect working in both directions. But when the system is unsymmetrical, as in an &#x03C3;-chloroether, the n<sub>O</sub>&#x2013;&#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;Cl</sub> interaction is much stronger than n<sub>Cl</sub>&#x2013;&#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;O</sub>, and can lead to cleavage of the C&#x2014;Cl bond (<b>5.24</b>: see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.1">Section 4.1</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/41_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This is an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, and is thus particularly rapid for an &#x03B1;-haloether. But so too is the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (see the Table in Problem 5.3, below). This is the expected result of overlap between a lone pair on oxygen and the partial bonding system of the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state (<b>5.1 + n<sub>O</sub></b>) suggested above in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>. (The corresponding <i>&#x03B1;</i>-halo-amine structure is not normally stable enough to exist because the lone pair of amine nitrogen is a better donor still.)</p>
<p class="indent">The effect can be reduced either (a) electronically, or (b) by preventing overlap by fixing the geometry. Thus (a) &#x03B1;-chloroalkyl esters, RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, are hydrolysed by normal ester hydrolysis mechanisms (attack at C=O); and the &#x03B1;-bromoether <b>5.25</b> is very unreactive in S<sub>N</sub>2 (or S<sub>N</sub>1) reactions: and (b) the bicyclic &#x03B1;-chloroether <b>5.26</b> is actually less reactive than the corresponding chloride <b>5.27</b>.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Of course these bicyclic systems cannot react by the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism because backside attack is prevented by the ring structure. But the message from <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a> is clear: the features which stabilise a developing carbocation, and thus support high reactivity in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, will stabilise the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state also. So that any system which reacts readily in the S<sub>N</sub>1 mode is potentially reactive by the S<sub>N</sub>2 route also. In <b>5.26</b> and <b>5.27</b>, and &#x2013; albeit less dramatically &#x2013; at other tertiary centres, this potential reactivity is masked by steric effects. <a id="page_42" class="page">Page 42, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>

<p class="noindent">The factors which stabilise the transition state for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction are even more effective in stabilising a carbocation.

So two of the three most important interactions in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.4">Fig. 5.4</a> &#x2013; with adjacent &#x03C0;-systems and lone pair orbitals &#x2013; also enhance reactivity in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. In contrast, adjacent C=O can interact efficiently only through its &#x03C0;* orbital: since no bonding overlap is possible between two vacant orbitals, an adjacent C=O group generally inhibits S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-9em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The HOMO of the carbonyl group (&#x03C0;<sub>C=O</sub>) is too low in energy to interact productively even with the vacant p-orbital of a carbocation. Though even this interaction has to be considered under extreme conditions. There is recent evidence that suggests that the HOMO of the C=N group can act as a &#x03C0;-donor in such a situation.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Two general points need to be borne in mind when reactivity in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is discussed. First, the transition state is not the carbocation, as drawn for example in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>, but a species with a partial bond to the departing leaving group. Since carbocations are in most cases high energy intermediates the transition states leading to them are expected to be close to them in energy, and therefore in structure. (A statement of the Hammond Postulate.) It is therefore a convenient simplification &#x2013; <i>but a simplification nonetheless</i> &#x2013; to discuss reactivity in terms of carbocation stability.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The Hammond Postulate can be simply summarised: adjacent states on a reaction coordinate that are close in energy are close in structure also. The effect is illustrated by the energy profiles of <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_31">page 31</a>. The higher the energy of the intermediate (INT) the closer it will be to the various adjacent TS.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The second point is more subtle. The transition state for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (<b>5.1</b>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_35">p. 35</a>) is more or less infinitely variable. Such a high energy species will accept stabilisation from any available source. For reactions in solution the available sources are the orbitals of the starting material and the product &#x2013; i.e. the carbon skeleton, the nucleophile and the leaving group &#x2013; and the solvent. Since a purely dissociative S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction generates a pair of ions it is likely to be run in a polar, ionising solvent; which is itself a potential nucleophile. (In a solvolysis reaction it is both solvent and nucleophile, by definition.) The result is that all S<sub>N</sub>2 and many S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions go through related transition states: which can be represented in general terms as in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.6">Fig. 5.6</a> (i.e. no different in principle from <b>5.1</b> above).</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig5.6">
<img src="../images/fig_5.6.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 5.6</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Even for well-established S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions a range of structures is possible. At one extreme are ordinary, &#x2018;tight&#x2019; transition state structures, where there is strong bonding to both X and Y. At the opposite extreme are &#x2018;loose,&#x2019; sometimes called &#x2018;exploded&#x2019; (not a good name for a theory) transition states, <a id="page_43" class="page">Page 43, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>with little bonding to either X or Y, and an accumulation of positive charge at the carbon centre.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point the picture merges with the range of transition states believed to be involved in many S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions; where solvent takes the place of the incoming nucleophile, and thus assists the reaction, without appearing in the rate law. This is thought to happen in many reactions once thought to go via the unassisted S<sub>N</sub>1 pathway. Two useful generalisations, based on the stability of the potential carbocation, also go some way to explaining this convergence of transition state structure: the higher the energy of the carbocation as a full intermediate in an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, the more likely it will be that some nucleophilic assistance is involved: alternatively &#x2013; now considering the reaction in terms of an S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism &#x2013; the more stable is the same (potential) intermediate carbocation the looser the transition state is likely to be. The result in both cases is the so-called loose transition state.</p>
<p class="indent">Complicated though this situation may appear, the consequences for stereoelectronic effects are simple. The transition state for an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (or for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction with a loose transition state) develops significant positive charge at the central carbon atom. This has to be delocalised, or the reaction will not happen. Any available &#x03C0;-donor will stabilise a carbocation and thus assist the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, as long as efficient orbital overlap is possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The new factor in reactions at the S<sub>N</sub>1 end of the spectrum is the importance of stabilisation by &#x03C3;-donors. Because carbocations are high-energy species, and thus have particularly low-lying LUMOs, they can engage in significant bonding interactions with donor orbitals which are too weak to stabilise the typical S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state significantly.</p>

<p class="indent">A C&#x2014;X bond is not usually a useful donor if X is more electronegative than H.

However, where X is <i>less</i> electronegative than H the &#x03C3;-donor effect (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>) will be stronger than for C&#x2014;H, and may come to control the chemistry.</p>

<p class="indent">The case where X is Si is of particular interest. The stabilisation of a carbocation by a silyl group in the &#x03B2;-position (e.g. <b>5.31</b>) is the basis of a great deal of recent organosilicon chemistry. To take one example important <a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>in synthesis, the attack of an electrophile on an allylsilane (<b>5.30</b>) takes place predictably at the end of the double bond remote from silicon (at least so long as the geometry of the system allows the overlap shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>).</p>

<p class="sidebar">Where the &#x03C3;-donor orbital stabilising an existing or developing carbocation is a C&#x2014;C bond the integrity of the carbon skeleton is at risk. Such an interaction may lead to a rearranged structure, or even C&#x2014;C cleavage. This sort of reaction is discussed specifically in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. We concentrate here on cases where stabilisation of the existing structure is the most important effect.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">To be a good &#x03C3;-donor a C&#x2014;C bonding orbital needs to be of particularly high energy. (The implicit benchmark is always &#x03C3;<sub>C&#x2013;H</sub>.) The strained C&#x2014;C bonds of cyclopropane rings are particularly suitable, and well-known to be available for delocalisation even with ordinary electron-deficient &#x03C0;-systems. Thus cyclopropyl ketones (e.g. <b>5.32</b>) show low carbonyl stretching frequencies in the infra-red. Similar effects on the UV spectra of related conjugated systems are comparable with, or even greater than the effects of extra double bonds; and indicate clearly that the cyclopropane ring is involved in delocalisation.</p>
<p class="indent">These effects depend characteristically on geometry, as expected for stereoelectronic effects. They are strongest in the so-called <i>bisected</i> conformation (<b>5.33</b>), and minimal in the <i>perpendicular</i> form <b>5.34</b>. (The terminology refers to the relationship between the plane of the cyclopropane ring and the plane defined by the substituents on the adjacent sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised centre.) In the bisected conformation there is optimal overlap between the antibonding orbital (here &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>) of the &#x03C0;-system and two of the three &#x03C3;-bonds of the ring.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Another result of the high energy of the C&#x2014;C bonding orbitals of cyclopropanes is that they can undergo addition reactions. This aspect is discussed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/44_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The same effect stabilises the cyclopropylmethyl carbenium ion (<b>5.35</b>) and derivatives; these are actually more stable than the corresponding benzylic cations. Crystal structures confirm that the preferred geometry is that shown. The delocalisation must be symmetrical, and is represented most <a id="page_45" class="page">Page 45, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>conveniently by the overlap shown in <b>5.35</b>, in which two of the bent bonding orbitals of the ring are involved in a bonding interaction with the vacant p-orbital of the carbocation.</p>
<p class="indent">Reactions involving these cations as intermediates show clear evidence for &#x03C3;-delocalisation. The products from the hydrolysis of cyclopropylmethyl chloride (<b>5.36</b>), for example, are a mixture of the three isomeric alcohols <b>5.38</b> &#x2013; <b>5.40</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">&#x03C3;-Delocalisation in situations like this took many years to become accepted, and cations like <b>5.36</b> were christened &#x2018;non-classical.&#x2019; The area is a rich source of fascinating stereoelectronic effects, but far too extensive to go into in any detail here. However, the familiar generalisation which is the key to understanding almost all stereoelectronic effects of this sort is a reliable guide:</p>
<p class="boxm"><b>WHERE THE GEOMETRY ALLOWS, OR IMPOSES, GOOD OVERLAP BETWEEN A &#x03C3;<sub>C&#x2013;C</sub> BONDING ORBITAL AND THE VACANT p-ORBITAL OF A HIGH ENERGY CARBOCATION, &#x03C3;-DELOCALISATION IS TO BE EXPECTED.</b></p>
<p class="indent">One final example involves the &#x03C3;-bonds of cyclopropane in a quite different way. Through-space interactions generally have different geometrical preferences from the through-bond interactions responsible for the &#x03C3;-delocalisation we have discussed so far. The most efficient interaction between a &#x03C3;-bond and an orbital with p-symmetry which are not directly connected by a &#x03C3;-bond is along the axis of the p-orbital, and from the centre of electron-density of the &#x03C3;-bonding orbital (<b>5.41</b>). This interaction is involved in through-space neighbouring group participation by the cyclopropane ring. For example, it is the basis of the extraordinarily fast solvolyses of systems like <b>5.42</b>. The ester (Ar = 4-nitrobenzoate ester) is solvolysed almost 10<sup>14</sup> times faster than the corresponding ester (<b>5.43</b>) (which has an ordinary &#x03C3;-bond in the position where a nucleophile could assist the departure of the leaving carboxylate group), and gives the rearranged alcohol <b>5.45</b> as one of the products. The electron-rich &#x03C3;-bond of the cyclopropane is perfectly placed to stabilise the cation formed.

<h2 class="h2">5.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electrophilic substitution at saturated centres</h2>
<p class="noindent">In electrophilic substitution a new bond is made to an electrophile, so the relevant frontier orbitals are the LUMO of the electrophile and the HOMO of the reactant of interest. In the concerted mechanism at a saturated centre the HOMO is by definition a &#x03C3;-bonding orbital, so compounds with electron-rich &#x03C3;-bonds, as discussed in the previous section, will show particular reactivity. But in principle any &#x03C3;-bond can react if the LUMO is attractive enough, and under super-acid conditions even C&#x2014;H bonds are attacked by protons. In the extreme case the protons of CH<sub>4</sub> have been observed to exchange with deuterons, and the stable t-butyl cation is formed from isobutane.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/46_2.jpg" alt="images" style="margin-left:-4em;"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In this reaction (one of several observed under the conditions) the electrophile ends up bound to H. Hydrogen is formally less electronegative than carbon, and the t-butyl is a more stable cation than an unsolvated proton, so we can deduce that electrophilic attack on C&#x2014;H bonds is not likely to be very useful in synthesis. What is needed for clean electrophilic substitution at carbon is a C&#x2014;X bond where X<sup>+</sup> will give a stable cation.</p>
<p class="eq" style="margin-bottom:0.9em;margin-top:0.9em;"><b>R&#x2014;X + Y<sup>+</sup>&#160;&#160;&#x2192;&#160;&#160;R&#x2014;Y + X<sup>+</sup></b></p>

<p class="noindent">The obvious choice is a metal (i.e. X = M), and by far the most important type of electrophilic substitution in synthesis involves organometallic compounds. These are generally not ideal subjects for mechanistic work, but at least the stereochemistry of the reaction is well-defined. Retention of configuration is the general rule, as seen, for example, in the carboxylation of the Grignard reagent <b>5.46</b> to give the carboxylic acid <b>5.47.</b></p>

<p class="indent">However, this preference is not nearly as strong as the preference for inversion in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, and inversion at the carbon centre can be observed under the right conditions. A carefully designed example is the reaction of the sterically hindered tin compound <b>5.48</b> with bromine. <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Chapter 5 Substitutions at saturated centres</a>All these results are simply interpreted in terms of the frontier orbitals involved (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>). The HOMO is the highest energy &#x03C3;-bonding orbital. This will be the one to the least electronegative centre, which we will call M. The LUMO will normally be a &#x03C3;*-orbital or a vacant p-orbital, and thus have an axis of symmetry. The most efficient overlap is between the LUMO, along its axis, with the centre of highest electron-density of the HOMO. This is in the central region of the &#x03C3;-bond, nominally perpendicular to the bond, but at an angle determined by the steric requirements of the system. If the carbon centre is more sterically demanding the interaction is represented most simply as shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.10">Fig. 5.10</a>. Retention of stereochemistry results naturally from front-side attack.</p>

<p class="noindent">An alternative mode of attack &#x2013; along the common axis of the HOMO and the LUMO &#x2013; also has the correct symmetry. Here the LUMO (a vacant p-orbital in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>) engages the &#x2018;tail&#x2019; of the &#x03C3;-bonding orbital, which has significant electron-density in a bond polarised towards carbon. The geometry of this interaction parallels that for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, and inversion of configuration would be the logical result (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#fig5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>).</p>

However, the result is generally addition rather than substitution, so is dealt with in the next chapter. The difference arises because a carbocation is not normally as stable as the M<sup>+</sup> used in typical S<sub>E</sub>2 reactions, and is not released into solution.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The C&#x2014;Si bond (see above, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_44">page 44</a>) has a higher HOMO than C&#x2014;H, and organosilicon compounds can also undergo electrophilic substitution reactions: as shown by the gradual evolution of methane from solutions of Me<sub>4</sub>Si in concentrated sulphuric acid.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The logical exceptions are systems like cyclopropanols (<b>5.49</b>), where the developing carbocation is effectively stabilised, in this case by &#x03C0;-donation from the adjacent oxygen.
