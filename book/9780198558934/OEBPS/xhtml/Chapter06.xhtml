<h1 class="chaptitle">6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Additions and eliminations</h1>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we discuss a large number of important reactions, which have in common the interconversion of sp<sup>2</sup> and sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised centres. In some cases the overall reaction is substitution rather than addition or elimination: substitution at sp<sup>2</sup>-carbon generally involves an addition-&#x00E9;limination mechanism, and substitutions at sp<sup>3</sup>-centres carrying more than one heteroatom may go by an &#x00E9;limination-addition route.</p>
<p class="indent">The more closely we look at the orbital interactions involved the clearer become the underlying similarities between different mechanisms. Particular addition reactions are of course the microscopic reverse of eliminations, and El and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions have a first step in common. But stereoelectronic effects on some E2 reactions show marked similarities to stereoelectronic effects on S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions, and we have seen in the previous chapter how S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions can merge imperceptibly with S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions at one end of the mechanistic spectrum.</p>
<p class="indent">Addition reactions going by ionic mechanisms involve the addition of both a nucleophile and an electrophile, almost always in separate steps. The usual classification into nucleophilic and electrophilic addition is based on the main HOMO/LUMO interaction in the rate determining step. For additions to ordinary alkenes this involves the interaction of the &#x03C0;-bonding orbital with the LUMO of the electrophile. We look first at reactions of unsaturated systems where the &#x03C0;*-orbital plays the major role.</p>

<p class="indent">The orbital interactions involved are discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. The HOMO is the lone pair of the nucleophile, the LUMO is &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>, and the requirement for optimal orbital overlap defines the geometry of approach (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). When the carbonyl compound has planar symmetry, attack from above and below the plane are equivalent, but in less symmetrical systems &#x2018;&#x03C0;-face selectivity&#x2019; is of considerable synthetic importance.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Addition to C=O</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A much-studied example is addition to the C=O group of substituted cyclohexanones. If the conformation is fixed, as in <b>6.1</b>, different amounts of axial and equatorial alcohols will be produced. Thus reduction of <b>6.1</b> by <a id="page_51" class="page">Page 51, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a> borohydride gives a 3:2 preference for axial attack, to give the equatorial alcohol <b>6.2e.</b></p>

<p class="sidebar">&#x03C0;-face selectivity for addition to C=O usually depends primarily on steric effects. The Felkin&#x2013;Anh model predicts a preference for addition to the face anti to the largest substituent on the &#x03B1;-carbon, as shown below (L, M and S refer to the relative sizes &#x2013; large, medium and small &#x2013; of the substituents). </p>

<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent">The possible involvement of stereoelectronic effects in determining face selectivity has been much discussed in recent years. Different substituents on the carbon atom &#x03B1; to the C=O group can in principle make the two faces electronically different. (To be precise, if the &#x003B1;-carbon is a chiral centre the two faces are diastereotopic.) For example, the developing <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond will interact with the C&#x2014;X bond antiperiplanar to it (<b>6.3</b>) on the &#x03B1;-carbon (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>). (Compare the stabilising interactions identified for the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state next to C=O, discussed in the previous chapter, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_40">page 40</a>). If the C&#x2014;X bond is a good <i>&#x03C3;</i>-acceptor (X strongly electronegative) the interaction of the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonding orbital of the part-formed bond with <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;X</sub> will be favourable, and addition will be favoured in this conformation.</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">This sort of analysis can be applied to any system where a nucleophile, an electrophile, or even a radical adds to a &#x03C0;-bond with an adjacent chiral centre. Different ways of thinking about the reaction are possible, but should give the same answer. For example, one could consider the interaction with <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2014;X</sub> in the ground state, which makes the two faces of &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub> non-equivalent</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This argument immediately raises the question: why should this partial bond not take advantage also of <i>&#x03C3;</i>-delocalisation in the reverse direction, interacting as an acceptor, with <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2014;X</sub> as donor? Small stereoelectronic effects in this direction are in fact observed in the reactions of the adamantanone system <b>6.4</b>. Substituents Y, which look too far away from the reaction centre to affect it directly, nevertheless affect the stereoselectivity of addition to the carbonyl group. It is found that for electron-withdrawing substituents the main product is <b>6.5E</b>, where the hydride nucleophile has come in <i>syn</i> to Y. The effect is reversed for electron-donating substituents, confirming that the effect is electronic.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Bonds in antiperiplanar relationships referred to in the text are marked in bold in <b>6.4</b> and <b>6.5.</b></p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>One explanation is that the stereoelectronic effects of (two pairs of) C&#x2014;C bonds &#x03B1; to the C=O group are differentiated by the remote substituent <b>Y</b>. If <b>Y</b> is electron-withdrawing it makes the adjacent C&#x2014;C bonds &#x2013; including in particular the bonds antiperiplanar to C&#x2014;Y) &#x2013; poorer <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donors. This would reduce any stabilising <i>&#x03C3;</i>-delocalisation, making addition preferred antiperiplanar to the other C&#x2014;C bond, leading to <b>6.5E</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Though these effects are significant, they are not large in these ketones, and suggest that the preference for axial addition in cases like <b>6.1</b>, without strongly electronegative substituents, is unlikely to be due to the much smaller difference in <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donor capability between <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2013;C</sub> and <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2013;H</sub>. Ordinary steric and conformational effects are generally sufficient explanation. But in systems with stronger electron-demand stereoelectronic effects will be expected to be more significant.</p>
<p class="indent">Nucleophilic addition reactions are not limited to C=O groups, and similar stereoelectronic considerations apply to additions to O-protonated (and alkylated) carbonyl groups, C=NR and C=N<sup>+</sup>R<sub>2</sub>, and to conjugate additions to &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated derivatives of all of these. Michael addition reactions (Fig. 6.3) , for example, involve the interaction of the lone pair of the nucleophile with the LUMO of an &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is a &#x03C0;*-orbital much like that of C=O, with its largest coefficient at the terminal carbon (Fig. 6.3).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The stereochemistry of nucleophilic addition to &#x03C0;-bonds</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group generally produces an oxyanion, which is protonated on work-up: or, occasionally, reacts further with an electrophile. In either case the stereochemistry of addition across the C=O bond is not generally defined. But in systems with substituents at both ends of the &#x03C0;-bond the stereochemistry of the reaction can be defined, providing direct evidence about the stereoelectronic effects involved.</p>
<p class="indent">A broad generalisation is that there is a preference for the new bonding or non-bonding orbitals formed in the addition reaction to be antiperiplanar, or trans, to each other. This generalisation does not necessarily apply to particular situations or even conditions, but is evidence for a significant degree of stereoelectronic control, and mirrors the preference for antiperiplanar geometry in the reverse, elimination reactions.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest cases involve additions to triple bonds, where the stereochemistry of the double bonds produced is stable and well-defined. Simplest of all are the reactions of the (slightly exotic, very reactive) nitrilium compounds (e.g. <b>6.6</b>), where the incoming nucleophile and the lone pair produced end up trans to each other (<b>6.7</b>). <a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a></p>

<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/53_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Addition to C&#x2261;C behaves similarly, as shown by the product <b>(6.10)</b> from the addition of methoxide to phenylacetylene (<b>6.8</b>), which also has the original substituents on the triple bond trans to each other in the product; showing that the carbanion (<b>6.9</b>) formed in the initial, rate-determining step, again has the lone pair trans to the incoming nucleophile.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/53_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7.2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that the preferred carbanion <b>6.9</b> is stabilised by the favourable antiperiplanar interaction of the localised non-bonding electron-pair with <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;OMe</sub>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Addition to a carbon-carbon double bond results in a conformationally flexible system. Furthermore, the first-formed intermediate is less stable, because a carbanion at sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised carbon is less stable than at sp<sup>2</sup>-C, and not likely to form unless delocalised. This makes it more difficult to identify the stereochemistry of the final product with the kinetic product of the first step. Where this is possible trans-addition again seems to be the rule, at least for the addition of hetero-nucleophiles. One of several examples is the base-catalysed addition of lithium thiolates to &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated amides and esters (e.g. <b>6.11</b>) in the presence of an excess of the acidic thiol. The product of trans addition is obtained from either isomer (for example, the E-isomer, <b>6.11</b>, gives the erythro-product, <b>6.12</b>), so the reaction is stereospecific: but this does not necessarily tell us about the stereochemistry of the addition step itself.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig6.4">
<img src="../images/fig_6.4.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 6.4</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">This result depends on the presence of an excess of the thiol, which accelerates the protonation step and reduces the lifetime of the enolate. Under more basic conditions the reaction is stereoselective only - trans addition is observed, but both E and Z isomers of the ester give the same mixture of products.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>In fact, under these conditions the stabilised (ester-enolate) carbanion (<b>6.13</b>) is a full, though short-lived intermediate, so the stereochemistry of the product is determined not by the preferences of the addition reaction but by the second, protonation step (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.4">Fig. 6.4</a>). The situation is very like that described above (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>), where a C&#x2014;X bond in the corresponding position can affect the &#x03C0;-face selectivity for addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group. But here the HOMO/LUMO relationship is reversed, and an electrophile is adding to an electron-rich &#x03C0;-system. So it appears to be favourable to have a <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;SR</sub> acceptor orbital antiperiplanar to the electron-rich part-formed bond in this case also (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">It is often a useful simplification to consider a complicated transition state from the point of view of the reverse reaction, in this case the deprotonation of the product <b>6.12</b>, followed by the elimination of RS<sup>&#x2013;</sup> from a carbanion. Both steps seem intuitively more reasonable this way round; which is discussed in more detail below (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_67">page 67</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Addition to C=NR<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and C=OR<sup>+</sup></b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a nucleophile adds to an iminium (C=NR<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) or C=OR<sup>+</sup> system the positive charge is neutralised and a lone pair formed. Extrapolating from the results so far in this section suggests that the lone pair might be expected to develop trans, or antiperiplanar, to the incoming nucleophile, and there is a good deal of evidence that there is a stereoelectronic preference to this effect. For example, the borohydride reduction of the bicyclic iminium salt <b>6.14</b> gives the trans-fused system <b>6.15.</b></p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">N.B. Lone pairs make smaller steric demands than other substituents, and their position generally has to be inferred indirectly, from where the other substituents are. Amine stereochemistry in particular can easily be reversed by the nitrogen inversion mechanism. So discussions of the behaviour of lone pairs in reactions needs extra care.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/54_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The stereochemistry of this sort of reaction only becomes apparent when the system is conformationally fixed. Delivery of hydride to the equally accessible bottom face of <b>6.14</b> would have given a less favourable conformation, and this preference must already be felt in the transition state of the reaction. A convenient way of thinking about the stereochemistry of reactions of this sort is illustrated in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>. <a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a></p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">N.B. The argument illustrated by <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a> assumes that the conformation of the iminium system is fixed as shown (<b>6.16</b>). If it is not, conformational inversion of the ring will make the top and bottom faces equivalent, and the two products will simply be enantiomers.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Addition of the nucleophile (identified as <b>X</b>) to the top face of <b>6.16</b> leads to a twist-boat product conformation (<b>6.17</b>). This may adapt, for example by inversion of configuration at nitrogen: but initially at least is less favourable than the product of addition of <b>Y</b> to the bottom face. This is formed in the stable chair conformation (albeit with the incoming nucleophile in the axial position). The lone pair is axial, and likely to remain so since the substituent R on the iminium system will prefer to stay equatorial.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar considerations apply to addition to C=OR<sup>+</sup>. This is a high-energy species, and obtained most easily under preparative conditions when stabilised by a second oxygen. Thus alkoxides add to bicyclic cations like <b>6.19</b> to give specifically the products (<b>6.20</b>) of axial attack. Similarly the reactions of Grignard reagents with cyclic orthoesters <b>6.21</b>, which are thought to involve similar dioxacarbenium ions (<b>6.22</b>), give the product (<b>6.23</b>) with the incoming alkyl group axial.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Electrophilic addition to C=C</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The LUMO of a typical simple electrophile has p-symmetry: in the case of a cation or other Lewis acid this is a low-level vacant atomic orbital, while for reagents like proton acids and halogens it is the vacant <i>&#x03C3;</i>*-orbital of the bond to the electrophilic (proton or halogen) centre. The HOMO is the &#x03C0;-orbital of the double bond, so the basic requirements for efficient HOMO/LUMO overlap favour perpendicular approach of the electrophile (i.e. perpendicular to the plane defined by the bonds of the alkene). The most general picture for a symmetrical alkene is shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>:</p>

In fact for any element X which has lone pair electrons a bridged intermediate is possible. This accounts very simply for the observed trans stereochemistry of addition in such cases: the intermediate <b>6.24</b> is opened by the nucleophilic part of the adding reagent, from the back as expected for an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>).

<p class="indent">When a stable bridged structure is not possible, for example for <b>X = H</b>, the symmetrical species <b>6.24</b> is no longer an intermediate - i.e. an energy minimum - but a high energy species, probably close in structure to the transition state for addition (or for a 1,2&#x2013;shift of <b>X</b> - see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>). The contribution from the rest of the original alkene structure then becomes crucial, and at the other extreme from <b>6.24</b> a carbenium ion may be a full intermediate. In this situation the &#x03C0;-system, and the transition state for electrophilic attack, can become very unsymmetrical (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.9">Fig. 6.9</a>).

<h3 class="h3"><b>&#x03C0;-Face selectivity</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The stereochemistry of electrophilic addition to ordinary alkenes is of special interest for chiral synthesis. The regiochemistry is generally straightforward, controlled predictably by the substituents on the double bond. But &#x03C0;-face selectivity is a more complex problem, especially in acyclic systems. It is subject to the usual array of geometric, steric and stereoelectronic effects, and is a good illustration of the power - and the limitations - of current theory.</p>
<p class="indent">We have met the basic problem twice already. It is important in the context of nucleophilic addition to C=O compounds, and arises also in the second step of Michael addition reactions, When the enolate anion first <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>produced reacts with an electrophile. The two faces of the &#x03C0;-system become different (diastereotopic) when there is a chiral centre in the molecule, and subject to stereoelectronic effects when this is in the allylic position, attached directly to the double bond.</p>
<p class="indent">When a substituent <b>Y</b> in the allylic position is strongly electron-donating or withdrawing a significant &#x03C0;-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2013;Y</sub> or &#x03C0;*-<i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2013;Y</sub> interaction is possible if the geometry is right: that is, if the C&#x2014;Y bond can line up more or less parallel with the adjacent &#x03C0;-orbital (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Whether this conformation is accessible will depend on the other substituents on the double bond. Conformations in this situation are controlled primarily by steric interactions, though any stabilising stereoelectronic interaction will make a contribution to the equilibrium situation.</p>
<p class="indent">The most stable conformations about the allylic bond (<b>6.25</b> and <b>6.26</b> in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>) are staggered with respect to the substituent on C(2), and have the smallest substituent on C(3) eclipsing the C=C double bond. The most significant remaining steric interaction is allylic 1,3-strain, between the bonds marked in bold in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>. The 1,3 interaction between H and a primary alkyl group is not large, and up to 25% of <b>6.25*</b> can be present at equilibrium for the monoalkyl alkene. A 1,3 interaction between two alkyl groups is much larger, and <b>6.26</b> is the only significant conformation present for a Z-alkene. (The 1,2-eclipsing interaction with the substituent on C(2) is a major disadvantage for conformation <b>6.26**</b> even when two hydrogen atoms are involved.)</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-10.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Conformational energies for rotation about a single bond depend on the torsion angles between the bonds at the two ends, reaching a maximum for each eclipsed conformation.

<p class="noindent">The conclusion in both these cases is that conformations with a C&#x2014;X bond perpendicular to the plane of the &#x03C0;-system, which require only a 30&#x00B0; rotation from the minimum energy conformations (<b>6.25</b> and <b>6.26</b>) shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.11">Fig. 6.11</a>, are quite readily accessible in acyclic systems, in the absence of sterically very demanding substituents.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrophilic attack is favoured by electron-donating substituents, and good <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donors in the allylic position favour attack on the opposite face of the double bond. The clearest cases involve allylsilanes (<b>Y</b> in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.10">Fig. 6.10</a> = SiR<sub>3</sub>), where the steric effects of the large trialkylsilyl group hinder the approach of <a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>the electrophile and reinforce the stereoelectronic preference. Thus in the alkylation of <b>6.27</b> the t-butyl group adds on the opposite side of the double bond from the trimethyl silyl group for both E and Z-isomers, resulting in complete &#x2018;transfer of chirality.&#x2019;</p>

For 100% transfer of chirality a pure enantiomer of starting material must be converted to a pure enantiomer of the product.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Results are less clear-cut with electron-withdrawing allylic substituents, which should be deactivating, and for which steric and stereoelectronic effects are in opposition.

<p class="noindent">When there is a powerful &#x03C0;-donor on a double bond, such as NR<sub>2</sub>, OR or OH, and especially O<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, the energy of the HOMO is raised significantly, electrophilic attack is particularly easy, and the regiochemistry is unambiguous (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.14">Fig. 6.14</a>). &#x03C0;-Donation from the oxygen or nitrogen (also, to a lesser extent, from sulphur) stabilises positive charge on the carbon atom next to it.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig6.14">

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 6.14</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the geometry restricts or prevents &#x03C0;-donation, reactivity is reduced as expected. Thus the bicyclic compound <b>6.30</b>, though nominally an enol ether, is protonated 1400 times more slowly than the parent olefin <b>6.31.</b> And although enamines are normally very sensitive to acid, the bicyclic compound <b>6.32</b> adds HBr only at very high temperatures, to give a product <b>(6.33)</b> in which the proton has added next to nitrogen. In both cases the lone pairs on the potential &#x03C0;-donors are held by the rigid framework in the plane of the &#x03C0;-system, and are unable to stabilise the positive charge developing on the adjacent carbon atom. Protonation, and electrophilic attack in general, is thus subject to stereoelectronic control.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/59_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">In more flexible cases this may be expressed as &#x03C0;-face selectivity, if there remains some conformational restriction. Thus there is a very weak preference for axial protonation of conformationally biased cyclohexanone enolates (7:3 in the case of <b>6.34</b>), and an even weaker one for axial alkylation. Axial attack generates the more stable chair form of the cyclohexanone directly, while protonation from the top face produces initially the twist-boat (see above, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_55">page 55</a>). Selectivity may increase with increasing rigidity, but any stereoelectronic preference is easily overridden by steric and other effects.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Intramolecular addition reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Intramolecular reactions are subject to the same stereoelectronic effects at the reacting centres as intermolecular reactions. Other things being equal, intramolecular reactions are faster, but this rate advantage disappears for several important classes of reactions. The usual reason is that the preferred geometries of the key orbital interactions are incompatible with the ring being formed. This question of compatibility is the basis of Baldwin&#x2019;s rules (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_28">page 28</a>), and has already been discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_36">page 36</a>) in the context of the disfavoured 6-endo-tet reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The most interesting disfavoured addition reactions are 5-endo-trig cyclisations, involving either nucleophilic or electrophilic attack on &#x03C0;-systems to form 5-membered rings. Similar principles are involved in the two cases, and these are discussed first for nucleophilic reactions.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Remember that 5-endotrig defines the ring size, the sense of the bond being broken, and the geometry of the centre under attack, as explained in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Intramolecular nucleophilic additions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The example shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.15">Fig. 6.15</a> was quoted in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>: <b>6.37</b> cyclises to form the lactam, even though primary amines normally add to the C=C bonds of acrylate esters.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig6.15">
<img src="../images/fig_6.15.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 6.15</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The selectivity arises directly from the stereoelectronic preferences of the two competing reactions. We know that a nucleophile prefers to attack a &#x03C0;- system from above the plane defined by the bonds to the sp<sup>2</sup>-centres (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Figs. 6.1</a> and <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.3">6.3</a>, above). The five atoms forming a 5-membered ring &#x2013; <a id="page_61" class="page">Page 61, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>including a 5-membered cyclic transition state on the way to one &#x2013; lie in or close to a common plane. So for a nucleophile to add to the carbon atom of a C=O group five atoms away both must lie in this plane. This means that &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub> must also lie in the plane if overlap is to be efficient (i.e., if the geometry defined in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.1">Fig. 6.1</a> is to be accommodated in the 5-membered ring). This is possible for the addition of the amino-group to the ester C=O (<b>6.38</b>). The reaction is formally 5-exo-trig, since the C=O &#x03C0;-bond being broken is exo to the ring being formed.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/61_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">However, this is not possible for the 1,4-conjugate addition of the amino-group to the &#x03B1;&#x03B2;-unsaturated ester (the reaction would be 5-endo-trig, because the C=C bond broken would be endocyclic to the ring being formed, as shown in <b>6.39</b>). The amino-group can approach quite close to the electrophilic CH<sub>2</sub>, but only in the plane of the &#x03C0;-system (<b>6.39</b>). If the amino-group rotates out of plane, to get in position to add to C=C from above, the geometry takes it out of range (<b>6.40</b>): and rotation about the C=C double bond is of course prohibited. The result is that this mode of cyclisation is not observed, and the formation of the lactam results, as the fastest reaction that is possible in the circumstances. Many similar cases are known.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/61_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Chemists typically see a rule as a challenge, and look for exceptions to prove it. The 5-endo-trig process does happen, sometimes quite rapidly, and the exceptions make an important contribution to the way we think about stereoelectronic effects. A particularly instructive case is the cyclisation of <b>6.41.</b> This compound does not cyclise in base, as is to be expected for a disfavoured 5-endo-trig process, but it does cyclise perfectly well in acid.</p>
<figure class="fig">

<p class="indent"><a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a><span class="space">&#160;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>The original explanation was that the reactive form in acid is the conjugate acid (<b>6.44</b>), which has the <b>C=OH<sup>+</sup></b> sufficiently stabilised by &#x03C0;-delocalisation into the aromatic ring for the cyclisation to qualify as at least honorary 5-exo-trig. In fact - at least for the 4-methoxy-derivative, which cyclises very rapidly - an alternative mechanism, involving C-protonation, makes this a genuine 5-exo-trig reaction (<b>6.45</b>). The effect of C-protonation is to allow free rotation about the original C=C double bond (marked <i>a</i> in <b>6.45</b>), thus removing the geometrical restriction to overlap.</p>

<p class="indent">The ease of the corresponding reactions of alkynes may seem surprising, since the geometry looks distinctly worse for ring closure, and no better for orbital overlap. But <b>6.46</b> is readily cyclised even in base.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/62_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The important difference here is that an alkyne does have an acceptor, &#x03C0;*-orbital available in the plane of the 5-membered ring. Even though this is not the one conjugated with the C=O group, it is strongly polarised by it; and alkynes are in any case a good deal more electrophilic than the corresponding alkenes. So cyclisation proceeds, in spite of the potential barriers, because there is a strong enough thermodynamic driving force.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Where there is a choice, 5-membered cyclic acetals may actually be formed faster than 6-membered rings from some sugars: even when the 6-membered ring is thermodynamically more stable.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If the driving force is strong enough, 5-endo-trig cyclisations <i>are</i> observed. The most familiar involve the formation of cyclic acetals from aldehydes or ketones and 1,2-diols. Here the acid-catalysed cyclisation of the hemiacetal (e.g. <b>6.47</b>) must involve a 5-endo-trig process (<b>6.48</b>) in many cases.

<p class="indent">Similar reactions are observed for C=N<sup>+</sup> compounds, which are intermediate in reactivity between C=O and C=O<sup>+</sup>. In fact in one case (<b>6.50</b>) a 5-endo-trig cyclisation is faster than a competing 6-exo-trig reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/63_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This is part of a general pattern, in which the stereoelectronic demands of nitrogen seem to be less rigid than those of oxygen in a similar situation. Thus we saw above (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_41">page 41</a>) that the C&#x2014;Cl bond of the chloroether <b>5.26</b> is cleaved three times more slowly than that of the corresponding tertiary halide <b>5.27;</b> because n<sub>o</sub>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;Cl</sub> overlap is prevented by the geometry of the bicyclic system, and oxygen acts almost exclusively by inductive electron-withdrawal. By contrast the corresponding NMe compound <b>6.51</b> is hydrolysed many millions of times faster. Evidently nitrogen, as the better electron-donor, is stereoelectronically more flexible also, and stabilises the developing cation <b>6.52</b> significantly despite the unpromising geometry.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/63_4.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">As usual, it is instructive to look at interesting reactions in the reverse direction. For the reverse of the 5-endo-trig process we can see (<b>6.53</b>) how the lone pair of a good electron-donor like nitrogen can achieve quite reasonable overlap with <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;O</sub>: and when the leaving group is protonated this becomes a viable reaction for oxygen as a donor (<b>(6.54</b>). But for a typical delocalised carbanion (the enolate <b>6.55</b>) the C&#x2014;O single bond lies in the nodal plane of the &#x03C0;-system, and &#x03C0;-<i>&#x03C3;</i>* overlap is negligible. So even when the carbanion can be shown to be formed, for example by exchange of deuterium from the solvent into the CH<sub>2</sub> group &#x03B1; to the ketone, this does not lead to ring-opening. <a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Elimination reactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Three classes of &#x03B2;-elimination reaction can be distinguished experimentally &#x2013; concerted E2 and stepwise E1 and E1cb (via the conjugate base). These mechanisms correspond, respectively, to the reverse of concerted addition, and to the reverse of the stepwise additions involving electrophilic and nucleophilic attack on double bonds. In practice elimination and addition reactions are carried out under very different conditions. But the <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>stereoelectronic effects involved are closely related, and E2 mechanisms can be regarded as merging at the two extremes into E1 and E1cb.</p>
<p class="indent">The first step of an E1 reaction is the same as for an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction: the loss of a good leaving group to generate a carbocation. This process has already been discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_42">page 42</a>), and will not be explicitly considered here. Similarly, the first step of an Elcb reaction is the formation of a carbanion, usually delocalised by an adjacent C=O or similar group. We discuss here E2, and the second step of the E1cb reaction, which are stereoelectronically closely related.</p>
<section id="sec6.4.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>The E2 reaction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the classical E2 reaction a base removes a proton from one centre, and a leaving group departs from an adjacent atom, in processes which are demonstrably coupled. The preferred geometry is well-established. The two bonds which are broken have to be more or less coplanar, and prefer to be antiperiplanar: though synperiplanar eliminations are readily observed if the geometry is sufficiently biased. The sequence shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.16">Fig. 6.16</a> is a good illustration (though it should be borne in mind that the Hofmann elimination does favour syn elimination).</p>
<p class="indent">Elimination of trimethylamine from the cyclohexyl derivative is almost exclusively antiperiplanar, presumably mostly by way of the inverted chair form, as shown. Two adjacent axial groups are precisely antiperiplanar, and provide the ideal geometry for the anti-E2 process. The rigid cyclobutyl derivative, on the other hand, cannot provide an antiperiplanar hydrogen, but has two in synperiplanar positions. The cyclopentane derivative can pucker to some extent, but most of the 1,2-relationships are synperiplanar for most of the time. The resulting competition between the stereoelectronically less favourable syn process and the stereoelectronically preferred but geometrically restricted anti-elimination gives almost equal amounts of each (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.16">Fig. 6.16</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig6.16">

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 6.16</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The bond to the leaving group breaks in an elimination reaction because the antibonding orbital becomes populated, by electrons from the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donor orbital involved. We have already seen, several times, that overlap between vicinal <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds is most efficient when they are coplanar and parallel, which <a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>means antiperiplanar. The picture is intuitively simple - compare the antiperiplanar interaction (<b>6.61</b>) with the same interaction in the synperiplanar arrangement (<b>6.62</b>) - and supported by evidence of many sorts, from the sizes of NMR coupling constants (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, page 25) to the stereoelectronic preferences of reactions.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/66_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The study of structure and reactivity in elimination reactions is complicated not only by the possibility of syn or anti elimination, but also by competition from the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. For example, restricting the geometry to assess the effect on the E2 reaction is more likely to divert the reaction to other pathways (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.17">Fig. 6.17</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig6.17">
<img src="../images/fig_6.17.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 6.17</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">As usual, the situation is simplified where the conformation is fixed, as it is for eliminations across double bonds to give alkynes. Elimination of bromide from <b>6.65Z</b>, for example, is over 2000 times faster than the reaction of the E-isomer, which probably adds methoxide first to give, eventually, the dimethyl acetal. Here syn elimination is possible, but must be over 2000 times slower than anti: since the rates of addition of methoxide should not be very different for the two isomers.</p>
<figure>
<img class="center" src="../images/66_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<a id="page_67" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 67, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>
<p class="indent">It may be that syn elimination is relatively more difficult across a double bond. Overlap in the syn geometry (<b>6.62</b>, above) becomes more difficult as the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-donor and acceptor orbitals diverge further from the preferred parallel orientation. (The angle between the axes of the orbitals concerned, which is zero for the antiperiplanar arrangement and 39&#x00B0; for the syn across two sp<sup>3</sup>- hybridised carbons, goes up to 60&#x00B0; for two sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised centres.) A case which may be relevant here is the formation of the high-energy species benzyne (<b>6.66</b>) from chlorobenzene, in which the carbanion (<b>6.67</b>) is thought to be an intermediate (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a>). An sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised carbanion with a vicinal leaving group as good as chloride is not expected to have long enough lifetime to be a full intermediate.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The E1cb reaction</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of benzyne in the reaction shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.18">Fig. 6.18</a> is noteworthy not just for the unusual nature of product, but as a (slightly unusual) example of the Elcb mechanism. The carbanion <b>6.67</b> is the conjugate base of the starting material. For such a species to be a viable intermediate it must have some minimum stability, which usually involves delocalisation of the negative charge, or a poor leaving group, or both. (A stereoelectronic barrier to the loss of the leaving group will also help.)</p>
<p class="indent">This means that the two steps, removal of the proton and the elimination of the leaving group, may have quite separate stereoelectronic requirements. The stereoelectronic requirements for the removal of a proton from a carbon acid are simply good overlap of <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2013;H</sub> with a low energy vacant orbital like &#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>. Those for the elimination step are not very different from those for the E2 reaction: i.e. for optimal overlap the orbitals should lie in the same plane (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a>). The geometry of overlap is thus halfway between that for syn and anti E2 eliminations, and if the carbanion is a full intermediate the distinction between syn and anti eliminations may be lost. One reason why it may be retained is negative hyperconjugation (discussed in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_26">page 26</a>): by which orbital overlap of the sort shown in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.19">Fig. 6.19</a> is net stabilising &#x2013; at least up to the point where bond breaking starts.</p>

<p class="indent">This extra stabilisation of the carbanion reinforces the main stereoelectronic effects favouring its formation, and results in an additional preference for removal of the proton antiperiplanar to the leaving group.

So the process is comparable to the addition of a nucleophile to C=O, and we are rather confident that it will take place from above the plane of the ring, almost certainly from an angle similar to the B&#x00FC;rgi-Dunitz angle, and fairly close to the symmetry plane through C(l) and C(4) (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.20">Fig. 6.20</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Of special interest for reactivity is the structure of the tetrahedral addition intermediate <b>6.72</b>. The delocalised &#x03C0;-system is the equivalent of a pentadienyl anion, so the symmetry of the HOMO is known: it has nodes at carbons 2 and 4 (of the pentadiene), and the electron-density is concentrated at carbons 1, 3 and 5 &#x2013; the positions ortho and para to the site of substitution, as shown in <b>6.72</b>. This helps us to understand why nucleophilic aromatic substitution depends on the presence of &#x03C0;-acceptors, like nitro-groups, in one or more of these positions.</p>
<p class="indent">The nucleophile and the leaving group X are often both hetero-atoms, so the tetrahedral intermediate may be stabilised further by the effects, including the generalised anomeric effect, which operate on systems with two heteroatoms on the same carbon atom (see above, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_18">page 18</a>). Finally, X is acting as a leaving group, so <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> is by definition a low-energy antibonding orbital. If Nu has available lone pair electrons these will also assist in the bond- breaking process, as discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec5.3">Section 5.3</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_41">page 41</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is instructive to try this sort of analysis on other addition-elimination reactions. Reactions at C=O centres are more straightforward, as the negative charge displaced is simply parked temporarily on oxygen (<b>6.73</b>): the doubleheaded arrow in <b>6.74</b> is a convenient shorthand for what is going on.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/69_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The fact that substitutions at sp<sup>2</sup>-centres go by addition-elimination mechanisms tells us that the LUMO is the &#x03C0;*-orbital and not the <i>&#x03C3;</i>* orbital of the C&#x2014;X bond being broken, though in principle a concerted S<sub>N</sub>2-type of displacement reaction is not impossible. In fact under conditions which might favour this process &#x2013; very electronegative X, and thus very low-lying <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> &#x2013; the mechanism can also change to elimination-addition. Thus the formation of the acylium ion intermediate (<b>6.75</b>) (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.21">Fig. 6.21</a>) involves the interaction of the (presumably) antiperiplanar sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen with <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> :</p>

<p class="noindent">The stereochemistry of this process is straightforward. For related elimination-addition reactions involving sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised oxygen there are interesting complications.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Elimination-addition reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Elimination-addition reactions involving sp<sup>2</sup>-carbon have well-defined stereochemistries and it is generally a simple matter to identify the <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>stereoelectronic effects involved. Thus the Z-vinyl chloride <b>6.76</b> is converted to the Z-enol ether <b>6.77</b> by way of the acetylenic sulphone. Evidently both the elimination and the addition steps involve preferred antiperiplanar orbital interactions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/70_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The stereochemistry is less clearly defined at sp<sup>3</sup> centres, especially where lone pairs are the donor orbitals in the elimination step, and are regenerated in the addition step of the reaction. This is the case for most reactions at acetal centres, and for reactions of related compounds like orthoesters.</p>
<p class="indent">Acetal hydrolysis is the most familiar of these reactions. The C&#x2014;O cleavage step generates a carbocation stabilised by &#x03C0;-type delocalisation of lone-pair electrons from the remaining oxygen, exactly as in the first step of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction (<b>6.78</b>, X = ROH<sup>+</sup>: compare <b>5.24</b>, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_41">page 41</a>).</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">We have seen how the reactant prefers the conformation with the lone pair antiperiplanar to the C&#x2014;X bond, which allows the strongest n<sub>O</sub>&#x2014;<i>&#x03C3;</i>* interaction. The product requires the corresponding conformation <b>6.79</b> to allow &#x03C0;-delocalisation. This suggests that an antiperiplanar lone pair is needed for easy C&#x2014;X cleavage, and that one is also generated when a nucleophile adds to a C=OR<sup>+</sup> double bond in the reverse reaction. We have already seen some evidence for these propositions (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_55">page 55</a>). Since they apply to both steps of the elimination-addition mechanism it is important to be able to assess the extent of this stereoelectronic control of these reactions.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The principle of stereoelectronic control in this sort of system was put forward in its simplest form by Deslongchamps, and is discussed in detail in his landmark book (see the Preface to this Primer).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Important early evidence came from oxidation reactions of orthoformate esters and acetals, in which electrophilic attack by ozone is thought to remove hydride to generate initially a hydrotrioxide (e.g. <b>6.80</b>). Compounds like &#x03B2;-glycosides (<b>6.81</b>) and the rigid bicyclic acetal <b>6.82</b> react, whereas conformationally rigid a-glucosides (based on <b>6.83</b>) and acetal <b>6.84</b> do not.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/70_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reactive systems have two lone pairs in positions where they can be antiperiplanar to the C&#x2014;H bond being attacked, and the similar behaviour of orthoesters in substitution reactions (see above, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_55">page 55</a>) gives strong support to the suggestion that they play a ke;y role in the transition state: <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>specifically, that two antiperlplanar lone pairs are required for easy cleavage of a bond to the central carbon.</p>
<p class="indent">Acetal hydrolysis (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.22">Fig. 6.22</a>) involves breaking the bond to one of the oxygens, so only one is available as a donor.</p>
<figure id="fig6.22">

<figcaption style="margin-top:0.8em;margin-left:15em;"><b>Fig. 6.22</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The reaction (<b>6.86</b>) should be even more dependent on the efficiency of electron-donation from this single donor, as indeed it is. But activation energies are now higher, and this requirement only affects the observed reactivity to any significant extent when conformations are rather firmly fixed. The theory predicts, for example, that a glycoside or tetrahydropyranyl acetal should be hydrolysed more rapidly when the leaving group is in the axial position (<b>6.83</b>, above, rather than <b>6.81</b>), because there is a lone pair on the ring oxygen antiperiplanar to the bond being broken.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Remember that in the chair conformation of a saturated 6-membered ring, a ring bond, is always antiperiplanar to any equatorial bond.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This is not observed: axial glycosides and tetrahydropyranyl acetals like <b>6.88</b> are hydrolysed at about the same rate as their equatorial isomers, and often slightly more slowly. A simple example is the spontaneous cleavage of the oxadecalin acetals <b>6.88a</b> and <b>6.88e</b>. Here the equatorial isomer 6.88e is hydrolysed three times faster; no doubt because the conformation is flexible away from the trans bridge. Reaction can occur through a twist-boat conformation <b>6.88b</b>, which is readily accessible from <b>6.88e</b>, and particularly stable, because it can now take advantage of stabilisation from the anomeric effect. The situation is the one described in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> (case 3, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_31">page 31</a>). Since the reactive conformation <b>6.88b</b> can be attained at little or no cost in conformational energy, and the barrier to the conformational change is small compared with the activation energy for the reaction, the stereoelectronically incorrect isomer can still react easily. (In fact it reacts faster, because the axial isomer is stabilised by the anomeric effect, and the relative rates are determined by the relative ground state energies.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/71_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The stabilised carbocation intermediate (<b>6.89</b>) is rapidly hydrolysed to products. The same intermediate is formed from both isomers, differing (while the ion pair stays together) only in the face on which the anion is released.</p>
<p class="indent">When the conformation is fixed the magnitude of the contribution from n<sub>O</sub>&#x2013;<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;O</sub> overlap does become apparent. The bicyclic acetal <b>6.90</b>, which is <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>rather rigidly fixed in the equatorial conformation, is extremely unreactive. In contrast, the corresponding axial analogue (<b>6.91</b>) is too reactive to prepare, but extrapolations give an estimated difference in reactivity of 10<sup>13</sup>. As we have seen before in this sort of bicyclic system, overlap between the lone pairs on the ring oxygen and the C&#x2014;OAr bond in <b>6.90</b> &#x2013; or the vacant p-orbital of any carbocation <b>6.92</b> &#x2013; is prohibited.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/72_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This is an extreme case, where the high energy of the transition state for the cleavage reaction of <b>6.90</b> is determined mainly by the high energy of the intermediate <b>6.92</b>, and the axial analogue reacts by way of a different intermediate. Where axial and equatorial isomers react by way of the same intermediate reactivity differences are smaller, but can still be substantial; as in the case of <b>6.93a</b>, which is hydrolysed in acid 300 times faster than its equatorial isomer <b>6.93e</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/72_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The conclusion is familiar: a reaction which is thermodynamically favourable will go by the lowest energy pathway available. Stereoelectronic (and other kinetic) barriers affect reactivity only if no lower-energy pathway to products is available.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6<span class="space">&#160;</span>Additions to C&#x2014;C single bonds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Additions to carbon-carbon a-bonds, in the sense:</p>

<p class="noindent">are rare. The energy balance is not favourable for a reaction in which two <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds are converted simply into two new <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds, unless the C&#x2014;C bond is particularly weak. And unless the C&#x2014;C bond concerned is in a ring the reaction is in any case not formally an addition. So it is not surprising that such reactions are limited almost exclusively to cyclopropanes.</p>
<p class="indent">Both nucleophilic and electrophilic additions are known, and both resemble the reactions of alkenes in many respects. Nucleophilic addition requires delocalisation of the developing negative charge, just as in the Michael <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>reaction, and the same &#x03C0;-accfeptor groups work in both cases. Thus good nucleophiles open esters (<b>6.94</b>) of cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid to give addition products (<b>6.95</b>):</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/73_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This looks very much like an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at the carbon atom attacked by the nucleophile, and the reaction does indeed go with inversion at this centre (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#fig6.23">Fig. 6.23</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Efficient delocalisation of the pair of electrons displaced (the C&#x2014;C <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond which breaks) is essential. As we saw in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_44">page 44</a>) this happens most efficiently in the bisected conformation (<b>6.96</b>). This stereoelectronic preference explains why the spirocyclic diester <b>6.97</b>, which has both C=O groups held by the ring in the desired conformation, is particularly reactive, and thus the ester of choice for synthetic applications of this (1,5-addition) reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Typical electrophilic reagents like bromine and the halogen acids add to cyclopropanes, though not so easily as to the corresponding alkenes. As for nucleophilic addition, the two reactions have a great deal in common, but the stereochemistry is quite different. The alternative products from alkenes are the trans or cis adducts, but for cyclopropanes the choice is between inversion or retention of configuration at the two reacting centres. (The regiochemistry is also more complicated because all three bonds of the cyclopropane may be attacked.)</p>
<p class="indent">Halogenation generally involves attack by the electrophile on the bent, electron-rich <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bonds of the three-membered ring. The reaction is very much like attack on a &#x03C0;-bonding orbital as discussed earlier in this chapter (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_55">page 55</a>), and involves the interaction of the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond with the <i>&#x03C3;</i>*-antibonding <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter 6 Additions and eliminations</a>orbital of the electrophile, as shown for a symmetrical system in <b>6.98</b>. (An intramolecular version of this type of interaction involving a vacant p-orbital as the acceptor was discussed in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_45">page 45</a>)). The C&#x2014;C bond can then break spontaneously (to form the more stable carbocation); or with assistance from the nucleophilic part of the reagent, leading to retention of configuration at the first centre and inversion at the second: corresponding &#x2013; for related reasons &#x2013; to trans-addition to an alkene.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/74_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Other electrophiles, however, may attack at the comer, rather than the edge of the cyclopropane, and here the story becomes more complicated. The result can range from complete retention to complete inversion of configuration. A fascinating case in point is the opening of the cyclopropanol <b>6.99</b> derived from tricyclene. Cyclopropanols, like enols, are particularly reactive towards electrophiles, and are opened under mild conditions even in water, to give ketones or aldehydes. The reaction is catalysed by acid or by base, and running the reaction of <b>6.99</b> in deuterated acidic solvent showed that protonation leads to the product (<b>6.100</b>) with retention of configuration. This is consistent with electrophilic attack on the cr-bond, as shown (and as already discussed on <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_47">pages 47</a>-<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_48">48</a>): presumably the interaction with the electrophile is a very unsymmetrical version of <b>6.98</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/74_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">However, when the reaction (now of the more reactive anion) is run in strong base, inversion results (<b>6.102</b>). A simple explanation is that the normally weak n<sub>O</sub>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2013;C</sub> interaction, between the antibonding orbital of the C&#x2014;C bond of the cyclopropane and the lone pairs of the alkoxide anion, weakens the bond in such a way that the tail of the bonding orbital becomes more prominent. This redistribution of electron-density results in the preferred HOMO/LUMO interaction shown (<b>6.101</b>), when the LUMO is <i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>O&#x2013;D</sub> of a weak acid (t-BuOH).</p>
