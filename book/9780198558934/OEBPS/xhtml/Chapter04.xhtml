<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">This Chapter describes in general terms the various ways in which stereoelectronic effects can control reactivity, introducing ideas which are used in the following chapters.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">When two independent molecules collide in solution or in the gas phase there is in principle no geometrical restriction on interactions between their orbitals, apart from any imposed by their intrinsic symmetries. In real systems there may be restrictions imposed by steric effects, but these are not relevant to the present discussion, and will not be considered further in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Through-space interactions between two orbitals on the same molecule, on the other hand, are subject to the geometric constraints imposed by its structure. In the trivial case, we do not expect two groups to react with each other if they are on opposite faces of a rigid ring-system because the molecular geometry keeps them apart. But even when the groups concerned can get close, apparently within easy bond-forming distance, stereoelectronic effects may effectively prohibit reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Through-bond interactions also lead to many important reactions. As we saw in the previous chapter, these interactions are very clearly under stereoelectronic control.</p>
<section id="sec4.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Effects through bonds</h2>
<p class="noindent">We saw in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>) that the n&#x2013;&#x03C3;* interactions that control conformation are also involved in bond-breaking (if the system is reactive enough). The same set of curved arrows describes both processes (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>), and the geometrical requirements for optimum overlap are the same. Thus an &#x03B1;-chloroether (<b>4.1</b>, X = Cl) prefers the gauche conformation shown, and reacts readily by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism because in the same conformation the lone pair on oxygen is available to stabilise the developing carbocation <b>(4.2)</b> by &#x03C0;-type overlap.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig4.1">

<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 4.1</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The corresponding orbital-interaction picture for &#x03C3;&#x2013;&#x03C3;* interactions (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_20">p. 20</a>) makes clear how the same factors control these interactions also.</p>
<p class="indent">This geometrical requirement for optimum bonding-overlap of interacting orbitals is of fundamental importance for understanding organic reactivity. As a result, electronic effects are transmitted through saturated systems most efficiently when the bonds involved are antiperiplanar. This is apparent in physical as well as chemical properties.</p>
<a id="page_25" class="page" style="width:60%">Page 25, Chapter 4 Effects on reactivity</a>
<p class="indent">One of the simplest is the dependence on torsion angle of the observed three-bond coupling in <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra between vicinal hydrogen nuclei. This coupling is well-known to be a maximum when the protons concerned are antiperiplanar (<b>4.3</b>, torsion angle &#x03B8; = 180&#x00B0;), and to follow an approximate cos<sup>2</sup>&#x03B8; relationship (the Karplus equation), with a minimum value at &#x03B8; = 90&#x00B0;. Similarly the coupling between alkene protons is largest for the <i>trans</i> arrangement (<b>4.4</b>); while long-range (four-bond) couplings are readily observable only when the geometry about both central bonds is antiperiplanar. Thus W-coupling is observed in systems where this geometry is found in a long-lived conformation (<b>4.5</b>), as is <i>meta</i>-coupling (<b>4.6</b>) where the system is permanently fixed in the correct geometry.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Vicinal coupling disappears, as expected, when the two C&#x2013;H bonds involved are orthogonal (torsion angle = 90&#x00B0;), but reaches a second (lower) maximum when they are eclipsed (coplanar again, but now with a torsion angle of 0&#x00B0;). This is a simple indication that &#x03C3;&#x2013;&#x03C3;* overlap is significant in this geometry also. The orbital-interaction picture (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.2">Fig. 4.2</a>) shows qualitatively how the symmetry is correct for overlap in this situation (and closely similar for n&#x2013;&#x03C3;* and &#x03C3;&#x2013;&#x03C3;* interactions), but less than optimal because the two orbitals involved are not parallel.</p>
<section id="sec4.1.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Hyperconjugation</h3>
<p class="noindent">A very similar interaction between a donor orbital (lone pair or a-bond) and a vacant p or &#x03C0;*-orbital accounts simply for the effect known as hyperconjugation. This accounts for the stabilisation of carbenium ions by adjacent alkyl groups which makes the t-butyl cation an energy sink while the methyl cation remains inaccessible. Once again this is a straightforward extension of a familiar idea: in this case the stabilisation of the carbenium ion <b>4.2</b> (above) by the lone pair on the adjacent oxygen. This happens because the HOMO-LUMO interaction is strongly bonding (<b>4.7</b>): as it is also when the highly electron-deficient carbocation interacts with a &#x03C3;-donor orbital (<b>4.8</b>). Clearly any suitable a-bonding orbital is a potential donor. The symmetry of the interaction shows how the same stabilising effect can operate when the acceptor is the &#x03C0;*-orbital of an electron-deficient &#x03C0;-system (C=O, etc).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="figure-aside-center">
<img src="../images/25_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">All these interactions have a direct bearing on reactivity. The ground state effect shown in <b>4.8</b> is conventionally represented as &#x2018;no-bond resonance&#x2019;, with a contribution from structure(s) such as <b>4.9.</b> The reality of this contribution is readily apparent in the crystal structure of the t-butyl cation (<b>4.10</b>), in which the lengths of the three (identical) C&#x2013;C bonds are about half-way between standard single and double bond-lengths. We will see in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> how the interaction-arrows shown in <b>4.7</b> and <b>4.8</b>, and those in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.2">Figs. 3.2</a> and <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.2">4.2</a>, translate smoothly into reaction-arrows under the right <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 4 Effects on reactivity</a>conditions. The curved arrow in <b>4.10</b> could equally well represent the familiar reaction in which a carbocation loses a proton.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Remember that reactivity is determined by effects which stabilise the structures of ground states and intermediates as well as by effects on transition states.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Negative hyperconjugation</h3>

<figure class="figure-aside-center">
<img src="../images/26_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">Negative hyperconjugation is a term that was coined to describe the stabilisation of anionic species by &#x03C3;-delocalisation, involving &#x03C3;*-orbitals as acceptors. An extreme case is the trifluoromethoxide anion (<b>4.11</b>), usually observed only as a highly reactive species, but stable enough in the solid state [as the (Me<sub>2</sub>N)<sub>3</sub>S<sup>+</sup> salt] for the crystal structure to be determined. The C&#x2013;O bond in <b>4.11</b>, though nominally a single bond, has almost the same length as an ordinary C=O double bond; while the C&#x2013;F bonds are significantly longer than normal. The simplest explanation is that there is strong a-delocalisation of the non-bonding electrons on O<sup>&#x2013;</sup> into the anti bonding orbitals of the C&#x2013;F bonds: the pattern of bond lengths is accounted for by the major contribution from the &#x2018;no-bond resonance&#x2019; structure <b>4.12</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear from this picture that n<sub>O</sub>&#x2013;&#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;F</sub> interaction is no different in principle from other types of &#x03C3;-delocalisation we have come across (compare, for example, <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>, above). Negative hyperconjugation is no more than a generalised anomeric effect. Thus anomeric effect, negative hyperconjugation and hyperconjugation are three terms describing in different situations what are basically the same effects.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec4.1.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Electronic strain</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a truism, but one worth repeating at regular intervals, that reactivity is determined by the stabilities of ground states and intermediates as well as by effects on transition states. When the usual bonding interactions between orbitals are weakened or interrupted, for whatever reason, stabilisation energy is lost and increased reactivity is the likely result. This effect has been called electronic strain, to distinguish it from steric and angle strain, which we will not discuss here (though a case could be made that both are electronic in origin).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Steric strain is a buiid-up of serious non-bonded interactions, of the sort that made o-di-t-butylbenzenes difficult to make and tetra-t-butylmethane impossible. Angle strain is more obviously electronic strain: ethylene oxide, for example, is vastly more reactive towards nucleophiles than ordinary dialkyl ethers because each of the three atoms in the ring has to make bonds &#x2013; that is, have orbitals interact at unnatural angles.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Electronic strain usually results from geometrical restrictions on orbital overlap. The basic ideas involved were introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec2.3">section 2.3</a> above, where we saw how twisted alkenes show increased reactivity towards electrophilic attack. Many other systems which derive stability from &#x03C0;-bonding interactions show related effects when a rigid structure prohibits the planar geometry needed. Thus <b>4.13</b>, though written as an amide, does not behave like one. It is rapidly hydrolysed, under conditions where a normal amide would not react, and has a basic nitrogen (pK<sub>a</sub> 5.3). Amides are normally protonated only in strong acid, and then specifically on oxygen.</p>
<a id="page_27" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 27, Chapter 4 Effects on reactivity</a>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/27_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, the cage structure inhibits the usual amide (n<sub>N</sub>&#x2013;&#x03C0;*<sub>C=O</sub>) delocalisation, which would involve structure <b>4.13&#x2032;</b>, with a double bond at a bridgehead. This leaves the lone pair on nitrogen available to accept a proton like any ordinary tertiary amine (albeit a weakly basic one because of the strongly electron-withdrawing group next door).</p>
<p class="indent">Stabilisation energies associated with the anomeric effect and with &#x03C3;-delocalisation in saturated systems are relatively much smaller, and the effects of ground-state electronic strain correspondingly less dramatic. However, bond-breaking can lead directly to high energy species like carb&#x00E9;nium ions, which derive very large stabilisation energies from adjacent &#x03C3; or &#x03C0;-donor orbitals. The reactions of such systems can therefore still be highly sensitive to electronic strain if rigid geometries prohibit strong overlap with donor orbitals.</p>

<section id="sec4.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Effects through space</h2>
<p class="noindent">Through-space interactions between two orbitals on the same molecule are also subject to the geometric constraints imposed by its structure. When these are two-electron bonding interactions strong enough to lead to reactions such constraints can have major effects on reactivity.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Intermolecular reactions, between separate molecules, in which two new bonds are formed (the Diels&#x2013;Alder reaction is a familiar example) are also formally (intermolecular) cyclisation reactions. We will discuss intramolecular cyclisations almost exclusively, and call them simply &#x2018;cyclisation reactions.&#x2019;</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The effects are most obvious for cyclisation reactions, many of which are discussed in detail in later chapters of this book. The experimental situation is conveniently summarised in a set of rules, due to Baldwin, which are set out in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>, below.</p>
<p class="indent">Intramolecular reactions always have to compete with the corresponding intermolecular processes. Cyclisations are prevalent because intramolecular reactions are generally faster than the same reactions between separate molecules. This is because the functional groups involved are held in close proximity. (If this sounds like no explanation at all, follow up the relevant suggestion for further reading at the end of the chapter.) Thus 4-hydroxybutyric acid (<b>4.14</b>) lactonises in the presence of acid; rather than esterifying another molecule, and giving, eventually, a polyester (<b>4.15</b>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Cyclisation reactions are particularly favourable for the formation of stable 5-and 6-membered rings, and surprisingly easy also for the formation of (strained!) 3-membered rings. But the formation of any small ring, for <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 4 Effects on reactivity</a>example the 5-membered ring in the cyclisation of <b>4.14</b>, involves a highly structured arrangement in the rate determining step <b>(4.16)</b>, which has to satisfy both the conformational demands of the system and the need for efficient orbital overlap.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The ease of ring formation depends to some extent on the ring-forming reaction involved. A rough guide to relative rates is 5&#x003E;6&#x003E;3&#x003E;7&#x003E;4. Mediumsized (8&#x2013;10-membered) rings are formed much more slowly.</p>
</aside>
<section id="sec4.2.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Baldwin&#x2019;s rules</h3>
<p class="noindent">The full set of &#x2018;rules&#x2019; is shown in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#tab4.1">Table 4.1</a>. It is important to stress that these are not Rules, which have to be obeyed. (In fact one common reaction is a formal exception, as discussed in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_61">page 61</a>). Each <img src="../images/t29.jpg" alt="images"/> or <img src="../images/w29.jpg" alt="images"/> simply summarises a great deal of laboratory experience. <img src="../images/t29.jpg" alt="images"/> means that the process concerned is generally favourable, i.e. observed: <img src="../images/w29.jpg" alt="images"/> indicates that it is unfavourable, and not usually observed. Since rings of all the sizes listed can be formed if the centre concerned has the correct geometry, the cases marked <img src="../images/w29.jpg" alt="images"/> are not thermodynamically unfavourable. The increased barriers to reaction are therefore kinetic, and stereoelectronic in origin.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Note: <img src="../images/t29.jpg" alt="images"/> and &#x00D7; in the Table mean that the reaction type is favourable or unfavourable, respectively: not allowed or forbidden. Reaction categories marked <img src="../images/m29.jpg" alt="images"/> are not covered by the original rules: simple mechanisms like 4.18 may be expected to be unfavourable, but each case is of interest, for different reasons.</p>

<p class="indent">The terminology introduced with the rules is indicated in the Table. It is widely adopted in the literature and in textbooks, and is used in the later chapters of this book. Two simple examples illustrate how it works.</p>
<p class="indent">At least one of the atoms involved in forming the new bond is carbon: the first column of the Table defines its hybridisation and thus geometry, as tetrahedral, trigonal or linear (&#x2018;digonal&#x2019;); abbreviated as <b>tet, trig</b> and <b>dig</b>, respectively. Column 2 specifies the geometry of the bond being broken at the carbon atom centre concerned (the same one referred to in column 1). This bond can be <b>exo</b> (outside) with respect to the ring being formed, as in <b>4.17;</b> or <b>endo</b> (inside), as in <b>4.18</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Each reaction type is then specified, concisely, by a more-or-less self-explanatory 3-element code, as shown.

<h2 class="h2">4.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Conformation and reactivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">The remaining chapters of this book are about stereoelectronic effects on reactivity. The interpretation of differences in reactivity requires a proper understanding of the reacting system and of the mechanism of the reaction. In practice a very small number of different situations is involved. These are described in this section, which provides the basis for much of the discussion in later chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">It is easy enough to identify an effect on reactivity if it is large: if one isomer of a compound reacts a million times faster than another there is not much doubt that some effect is at work, and the chances are that it will be a simple matter to identify it. An example is the acid-catalysed hydration of the cyclooctenes discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_10">page 10</a>), where the electronically strained <i>trans</i>-isomer reacts much faster than the <i>cis</i>. Here the analysis is limited, implicitly, to comparing the two ground states. One is strained and thus of higher energy, so more reactive. Two-state problems are the easy ones.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact large effects of this sort are observed almost exclusively in rigid systems. Effects on reactivity in conformationally mobile systems are more subtle. To identify them, and especially to predict them, requires a proper analysis of the reaction concerned &#x2013; which means considering activation energies. Activation energies are of course energy <i>differences</i>, between ground states and transition states. So comparing activation energies is a four-state problem: both ground state and transition state have to be considered, for both reactions.</p>
<section id="sec4.3.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3">Case 1. Isomers in equilibrium giving the same product</h3>
<p class="noindent">When comparing conformational isomers, or indeed any pair of isomers, which are rapidly interconverting, it is not possible to measure reactivity differences between them directly. Even if it is possible to start the reaction by adding pure conformer or isomer, if the interconversion is rapid relative to the reaction then the only observable reaction is that of the same equilibrium mixture C1 <img src="../images/a29.jpg" alt="images"/> C2 (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that the lower energy, and thus more highly populated, form could react through its ground state conformation (C<sub>1</sub>), via the high energy transition state TS<sub>1</sub>, has little or no significance for reactivity. It has easy access to a lower energy pathway via TS<sub>2</sub>, by way of conformer or isomer C<sub>2</sub>. The lower energy pathway is preferred, so TS<sub>2</sub> determines the observed activation energy for the reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Case 2. Isomers in equilibrium giving different products</h3>
<p class="noindent">Similar factors control the product ratio if the reactions of the two interconverting conformers or isomers give different products. In the common situation where C<sub>1</sub> leads specifically to P<sub>1</sub> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>) and C<sub>2</sub> gives specifically P<sub>2</sub>, a mixture of P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> is produced. It may at first seem surprising that the product ratio, P<sub>1</sub>:P<sub>2</sub> bears no relation to the relative abundance of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>; but is determined almost exclusively by the energy difference between the two transition states TS<sub>1</sub>* and TS<sub>2</sub>* (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>).</p>

If the pathway which allows the ready interconversion C<sub>1</sub>/C<sub>2</sub> is removed the different reactivities of the two forms can be measured without difficulty. In the case of conformational isomers this means using a modified system which is conformationally fixed: or at least strongly biased. Thus much of the classical work on conformation and reactivity was done using <i>trans</i>-decalins (e.g. <b>4.19</b>, where the substituent X is fixed in the axial position by the trans ring junction): or cyclohexane rings with t-butyl substituents. For example, it is possible to compare the rates of hydrolysis of axial and equatorial ethyl ester groups on a cyclohexane using the conformationally biased system <b>4.20</b> as the model equatorial ester.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Case 3. Isomers not in equilibrium giving the same product</h3>
<p class="noindent">This third case is also a common one. We are often interested in differences in reactivity between enantiomers (in a chiral environment) or diastereoisomers where the reaction involves the formation of a common intermediate or product. E2, S<sub>N</sub>1 and enolisation reactions are familiar examples where the same sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised system can be formed from such isomers.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the most interesting examples are two-step reactions, and the energy profile involved (e.g. <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>) features a high-energy intermediate (INT). To keep the discussion simple we assume that the first step of the reaction concerned is rate determining. We can therefore ignore the second step, in which the intermediate is converted to the product or products: if this step is fast enough it does not affect the rate of the overall reaction.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a> may look complicated, but we have seen all its component parts before. The comparison of interest is between the reactivities of A and B. One isomer (B) has the &#x2018;correct&#x2019; stereochemistry for reaction and goes directly to the intermediate. Isomer A is stereoelectronically incorrect: in its ground state form (A<sub>1</sub>) it can react only through the high energy transition state TS<sub>1</sub>. The stereoelectronic effect of interest is thus in principle the difference between this activation energy and that for the uncomplicated reaction of B. To separate the two in practice is usually not so simple.</p>

<p class="indent">No molecule is completely rigid. (Diamond comes close but is not a convenient test system in this context. Even adamantane (<b>4.23</b>), with the structural unit of diamond, can twist to some extent.) So &#x2013; if there is sufficient thermodynamic driving force for the reaction &#x2013; A has every chance of finding a way round the high energy barrier represented by TS<sub>1</sub>. A (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#fig4.5">Fig. 4.5</a>) is then behaving exactly in the way described above as Case 1, and the same conclusions apply. The observed rate (<a href="#eq4.1">eqn 4.1</a>) is the sum of the rates for the two (or more) forms, here A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>: and TS<sub>2</sub> determines the observed activation energy for the reaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3">A case history</h3>
<p class="noindent">All three cases described above are nicely illustrated by a single set of experiments, which form part of the classical evidence for the preference for antiperiplanar stereochemistry in the E2 reaction. The comparison of interest (cf. Case 3) is between the axial and equatorial isomers (<b>4.24a</b> and <b>e</b>), which have t-butyl groups in the 4-position to fix the conformation, and to drive the trimethylammonium groups into the conformations shown.</p>
<p class="indent">No alkene is produced when the equatorial trimethylammonium compound (<b>4.24e</b>) is heated in the presence of t-butoxide in t-butanol. The E2 reaction requires the H&#x2014;C&#x2014;C&#x2014;N<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>3</sub> system to be at least close to antiperiplanar, but <b>4.24e</b> has two similar sterically demanding substituents with strong preferences for the equatorial position. The ground state conformation, with ring C&#x2014;C bonds antiperiplanar to C&#x2014;N<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>3</sub>, is thus strongly favoured. Evidently reaction through any higher energy conformation is too slow to compete with the (slow) demethylation reaction, in which the base removes a methyl group in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/32_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Hofmann elimination of trimethylamine is, as expected, the main product from the axial isomer (<b>4.24a</b>), which has two axial hydrogens antiperiplanar to the C&#x2014;N<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>3</sub> bond. Demethylation is only a minor side-reaction in this case, indicating that elimination from <b>4.24a</b> must be at least 100 times faster than from <b>4.24e</b>. (The t-butyl and trimethylammonium <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 4 Effects on reactivity</a>groups are in fact of similar sizes, so there should be comparable amounts of the conformation shown (<b>4.24a</b>) and the isomer with the t-butyl group axial and the trimethylammonium group equatorial, in rapid equilibrium, as described in cases 1 and 2, above.)</p>
<p class="indent">The behaviour of trimethylammonium cyclohexane (<b>4.27</b>), is, as expected, somewhere in between. Though there is no t-butyl group to fix the conformation, the trimethylammonium group is itself large enough to enforce a strong preference for the equatorial conformation shown. It is a fair assumption, based on the result with <b>4.24e</b>, that this conformation gives only demethylation, and that the small but significant amount of elimination goes by way of the axial isomer (not shown).</p>
<p class="indent">This sort of evidence shows clearly that a stereoelectronic effect exists in this system, and even that it must be substantial. To quantify the effect accurately is a more difficult problem. For present purposes it is enough to note that observed differences in rate or product ratios contain information mostly about conformational preferences, and allow only minimum estimates of stereoelectronic effects.</p>
