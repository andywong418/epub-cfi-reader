<p class="noindent">A molecule&#x2019;s bonding electrons serve not only as its skeleton, but also as a rudimentary nervous system. They relay the effects of local perturbations to other centres, more or less efficiently, depending on distance and geometry. Thus, in principle, every nucleus in a molecule can sense the presence of a strongly electronegative atom or group, or the approach of another molecule, or the changes in electron density that happen when bonds are made or broken.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice significant effects are quite localised, and it is these that give rise to stereoelectronic effects. They can have profound effects on molecular conformation and reaction mechanism, and are fundamental to a proper understanding of structure and reactivity.</p> 
<p class="indent">The typical stereoelectronic effect involves an electronic interaction which stabilises a particular conformation or transition state: that is to say, it is fully expressed only when the correct geometry is achieved. Familiar examples are the inversion of configuration involved in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction at sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised carbon, which is direct evidence for &#x2018;backside&#x2019; attack by the nucleophile:</p>

<p class="noindent">and the idea that a nucleophile adding to the sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised carbon atom of a carbonyl group approaches from above or below, rather than in the plane defined by the group.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Nucleophilic addition to sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised carbon is discussed in detail in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The evidence in this second case is more subtle. We cannot &#x2018;see&#x2019; the way two molecules interact to form a bond, except as a theoretical exercise on the computer. But the imaginative use of evidence from series of crystal structures provides a vivid insight into what happens when a nucleophile approaches a willing carbonyl group. The most famous example is worth retelling.</p>
<p class="indent">Crystallographers B&#x00FC;rgi and Dunitz identified a remarkable structural correlation in the structures of a series of amino-ketones. The amine nitrogens are close to the carbon atoms of the carbonyl groups in these compounds, either because they are in the same molecule, or because they are brought close together by crystal packing. The closer the approach of the <a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Chapter 1 Introduction</a>nitrogen, the more the carbonyl carbon is seen to be displaced from the plane defined by its three substituents. This displacement is not repulsive, as might reasonably have been expected when two centres come into van der Waals contact, but evidently attractive, because the displacement is <i>towards</i> the nitrogen atom. (For example, <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig1.1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows the actual geometry of this interaction in the crystal of the eight-membered ring of the alkaloid clivorine.)</p>

<p class="indent">In every case the amine nitrogen is observed to lie symmetrically above the ketone group, and the N&#x00B7;&#x00B7;&#x00B7;C=O angle is close to the tetrahedral angle of 109&#x00B0;28&#x2032; The conclusion is that this - the so-called B&#x00FC;rgi-Dunitz angle - defines the preferred geometry of approach for nucleophilic addition of amine nitrogen - and presumably of other nucleophiles also - to ketone carbonyl.</p>
<p class="indent">In practice there is a preferred geometry for practically every interaction between molecules, or parts of a molecule. The rules are relatively simple, and not difficult to work out from the principles described in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, but they are quite fundamental to the way we think about chemistry. Every serious student should try to develop a &#x2018;feel&#x2019; for the way molecules behave, and especially for the &#x2018;rules of engagement&#x2019; which operate when molecules meet and react. The good news is that only a very small number of basic interactions is involved. For example, the stereoelectronic effects controlling the addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group also give rise to the special selectivities observed in cyclisation reactions involving the additions of nucleophiles to sp<sup>2</sup>-carbon (<b>1.1 &#x2192; 1.2</b>):</p>

<p class="sidebar">The cyclic acetal exists preferentially in the conformation (<b>1.3a</b>) with the methoxy-substituent axial, even though the usual conformational preference, based on substituted cyclohexanes, is for the equatorial position.

<p class="indent">This effect is not just an academic curiosity. It controls or at least influences the conformations of key biological compounds like saccharides and phosphate diesters; and in polymeric structures the effects are multiplied hundreds or thousands of times. So - since structure and function are inextricably related in biology - an understanding of stereoelectronic effects is as essential for the thinking structural biologist as for the chemist.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Useful general texts are described in the Preface. More specialised references appear at the end of each chapter.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Because they involve the properties of electrons in molecules stereoelectronic effects are described most appropriately in the language of orbital-orbital interactions, and the detailed discussion in the rest of this book is based on the relevant ideas and concepts introduced in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
