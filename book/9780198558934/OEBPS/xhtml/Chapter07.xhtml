<h1 class="chaptitle">7<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangements and fragmentations</h1>
<p class="noindent">So far we have considered almost exclusively short-range stereoelectronic effects, through space or through just one bond. This chapter brings together two groups of reactions of synthetic importance and mechanistic interest, where the key interactions are through two or three bonds.</p>
<p class="indent">Ionic reactions happen when a powerful enough electron-donor interacts with a powerful enough electron-acceptor. When two such orbitals are present in the same molecule, <i>but not in a position to interact directly</i>, they may still interact strongly enough to cause a reaction. They can do this by involving orbitals of the intervening framework.</p>
<p class="indent">We start with a simple example - the interaction of an alkoxide anion with an alkyl halide. Interaction through space leads to an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. If this happens when both are on the same molecule a cyclic ether is the likely product, from a favoured exo-tet reaction (see <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#page_28">page 28</a>). But in some systems, particularly where the geometry prevents the direct interaction, quite different chemistry results (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig7.1">

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Rearrangement (<a href="#fig7.1">Reaction 2</a>) may be observed even in some conformationally mobile systems, where it must compete with epoxide formation. The corresponding cyclisation (to form a 4-membered cyclic ether) in competition with <a href="#fig7.1">Reaction 3</a> in a mobile system is a 4- exo-tet reaction &#x2013; favoured but particularly slow.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">With alkoxide oxygen and halogen on the same carbon the halide ion is rapidly eliminated, to give the C=O group (<a href="#fig7.1">Reaction 1</a>). If they are on vicinal carbons the formation of C=O and the elimination of halide are still thermodynamically desirable, but no direct HOMO/LUMO interaction is available to bring this about. The reaction requires a specific <i>rearrangement</i> of the carbon skeleton (<a href="#fig7.1">Reaction 2</a>, R = H, alkyl or aryl), as discussed below. Finally, if the two are separated by three atoms (all carbon in the example shown as <a href="#fig7.1">Reaction 3</a>), breaking the central C&#x2014;C bond allows the desired formation of C=O and the elimination of halide, in a sort of double elimination. This is a <i>fragmentation</i> reaction. Rearrangements and fragmentations provide subtle ways of reorganising the carbon skeleton, <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 7 Rearrangements and fragmentations</a> predictable since both are subject to well-defined stereoelectronic effects. The synthetic chemist needs to understand them well enough be able to use them creatively - and should never be taken by surprise by either!</p>
<p class="indent">To analyse the stereoelectronic interactions involved it is best to start at the leaving group end. The initial interaction is the familiar &#x03C3;<sub>C&#x2013;C</sub>-&#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub>, between the best donor &#x03C3;-bond (of up to nine available on vicinal carbons) and the anti bonding orbital of the C&#x2014;X bond. (Or the vacant p-orbital of a carbocation if the leaving group has already left.) We know that this interaction is strongest in the antiperiplanar conformation (<b>7.1</b>), as we saw for example for the E2 reaction (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_65">page 65</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Most rearrangements and fragmentations are electrophilic, driven primarily by the departure of the leaving group. But - as usual - what is important is the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO involved: so reaction may still occur with a relatively poor leaving group if the electron-density at the donor end is high enough.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/77_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">As the bond to the leaving group breaks (<b>7.2</b>) &#x03C3;*<sub>C&#x2013;X</sub> becomes more electrophilic, until it eventually becomes the vacant p-orbital of a carbocation, stabilised by &#x03C3;-donation from all available bonds on vicinal carbons. What happens next depends on how effectively positive charge can be accommodated at each of the three carbon centres directly involved - labelled &#x03B1;, &#x03B2; and &#x03B3; in <b>7.2</b>. If the carbocation formed at C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> (<b>7.3</b>) is sufficiently stable this first step may define the overall reaction, for example as S<sub>N</sub>1 or El.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Carbocations are stabilised strongly by electron-donating substituents (&#x03C3; or &#x03C0;-donors). A strong &#x03C0;-donor like the alkoxide oxygen in Reactions 1-3 of <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.1">Fig. 7.1</a> will control the overall reaction.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If C&#x03B3; gives the most stable cation, the C&#x2014;C bond can break, to generate an alkene (<b>7.4</b>). The carbocation formed then reacts further to give products, which depend in the usual way on the conditions. The stereoelectronic effects involved in the stabilisation of this cation, and favouring fragmentation, are discussed in the next section.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/77_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The most complicated case arises when the carbon centre best able to accommodate the positive charge is C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub>, vicinal to the C&#x2014;X bond. The result in this case is a rearrangement, involving the migration of C<sub>&#x03B3;</sub> from C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub> to C<sub>&#x03B1;</sub> <i>with the electrons of the &#x03C3;-bond</i> (<b>7.5</b> &#x2192; <b>7.6</b>). Rearrangement reactions are discussed in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sec7.2">section 7.2</a>, below.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Fragmentations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Fragmentation reactions are observed when a strong electron donor interacts with a good leaving group three carbons away. The simplest case is the acid- catalysed fragmentation of a 1,3-diol to an alkene and a ketone or aldehyde (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). In the reverse direction this reaction is useful in synthesis, when the diol is thermodynamically favoured.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig7.2">
<img src="../images/fig_7.2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 7.2</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Control is better if one of the oxygens is functionalised, and the reaction provides a useful route to strained medium-sized rings. An example is the fragmentation of the decalin <b>7.7</b>, which is converted in base to the cyclodecenone <b>7.8</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/78_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This is the model for a large number of related reactions, which have in common the interaction of a donor oxygen and an acceptor C&#x2014;O &#x03C3;* or &#x03C0;*-orbital. They include such familiar cases as the retro-aldol reaction, the decarboxylation of (&#x03B2;-ketoacids and the alkaline cleavage of 1,3-diketones. The addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group is a simple way to generate a donor oxyanion, and where the addition is sufficiently selective clean reactions are observed. Thus <b>7.9</b> gives acetate and cycloheptanone in almost quantitative yield. (The corresponding cyclohexanone derivative gives mainly ring-opening product.)</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-4.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that <b>7.9</b> is a 1,3-diketone, and converted in base mainly to the delocalised anion, which is protected from the cleavage reaction.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">In all these cases the reaction depends on the geometry of the system. The direction of the lone pairs on the donor O<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is not fixed, so the decisive requirement is for efficient overlap between the bond being broken and the terminal acceptor orbital. The requirements for efficient overlap are familiar from previous chapters: the bond being broken should be perpendicular to the plane of the carbonyl group for overlap with <img src="../images/in50_01.jpg" alt="images"/>, or antiperiplanar to <img src="../images/in50_02.jpg" alt="images"/>, exactly as for an elimination reaction. Thus the equatorial mesylate <b>7.7</b> fragments as shown above (the relevant antiperiplanar bonds are in bold). The axial isomer would react quite differently.</p>
<p class="indent">The geometry of the interaction which stabilises the developing cation at C<sub>&#x03B3;</sub> is well-defined for cyclic ethers and amines. Reaction requires good, preferably antiperiplanar overlap for the interaction with the donor orbital. Ideal geometry is found in bridgehead amine derivatives such as <b>7.11</b> and <b>7.12</b>: these fragment to form cyclic imines, which are further hydrolysed to C=O groups under the conditions.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">If the geometry does not allow good overlap the reaction simply does not happen. Thus the amine tosylate <b>7.13</b> does not fragment. The lone pair on nitrogen can occupy either axial or equatorial positions, but it cannot get antiperiplanar to the C&#x2013;C bond antiperiplanar to C&#x2013;OTs because this position is taken by a ring bond. (The relevant antiperiplanar bonds are in bold in <b>7.13</b>.) The result is a mixture of El and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions, as for the corresponding decalin <b>7.13a</b>, which reacts 2-3 times faster. Fragmentations like those shown for <b>7.11</b> and <b>7.12</b> are much faster than the El and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions of the carbocyclic analogues.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Whole books have been written about rearrangement reactions, including one in this series, so the discussion here is limited to general points about the stereoelectronic effects involved.</p>

<section id="sec7.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">7.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Rearrangements</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although various sorts of rearrangements are known, the most common and important are 1, 2-shifts, as depicted above (<b>7.5 &#x2192; 7.6</b>). The migratinggroup can be alkyl, aryl or hydride (<i>not</i> a proton: <b>H</b> migrates with its pair of electrons), and, as before, the acceptor orbital can be &#x03C3;<sup>*</sup>, &#x03C0;<sup>*</sup> or a vacant p-orbital.</p>
<p class="indent">The migration of an alkyl group involves retention of configuration at the migrating centre C<sub>&#x03B3;</sub>, as indicated in <b>7.6</b>, and as prescribed by the orbital-orbital interactions involved. The simple orbital picture which gives the best feel for the stereoelectronic situation is illustrated in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#fig7.3">Fig. 7.3</a>, representing the interconversion of two carbocations <b>7.14</b> and its isomer <b>7.14</b>&#x2032;. As usual the donor and acceptor orbitals should be coplanar, and specifically antiperiplanar to each other when the acceptor is &#x03C3;<sup>*</sup>. The stereochemistry at the other two centres is what would be expected, ranging from complete inversion to complete racemisation if a carbocation is a full intermediate. The reaction is in principle reversible (and thus symmetrical in relevant cases, sometimes leading to unexpected racemisations).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-0.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The structure <b>7.15</b> (<i>not</i>an intermediate, possibly a transition state) is stabilised by a two-electron bonding interaction between the three centres involved. Each centre becomes electron-deficient in the course of the reaction, as indicated by the favourable effects of electron-donating substituents, but the migrating group retains its stereochemistry throughout.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig" id="fig7.3">
<img src="../images/fig_7.3.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 7.3</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The stereochemistry is simplest in migrations across a double bond, and the requirements are more restrictive than for eliminations. Here the migrating group must be antiperiplanar to the leaving group. Thus the Beckmann rearrangement gives anintermediate <b>7.16</b> with the positive charge delocalised onto the adjacent nitrogen atom:</p>
 
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/80_01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The same structural features which are particularly effective in stabilising a positive charge at C<sub>&#x03B3;</sub> are equally effective at C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub>. So we are not surprised that two of the reactions of this sort which are familiar to every organic chemist involve stabilisation of C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub> by an adjacent hetero-atom donor.Thus, although the contribution of the oxime nitrogen is essential to the Beckmann rearrangement, additional stabilisation of C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub> by an oxyanion makes the reaction easier still. This is the basis of an important class of reactions in which amide derivatives (<b>7.17</b>) with a leaving group on nitrogen are converted to isocyanates (<b>7.18</b>), and thence to amines or their derivatives with the original acyl group R on nitrogen (see <a href="#prob_7.4">Problem 7.4</a>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-18.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that the orbitals directly involved in this rearrangement all lie in the plane of the &#x03C0;-system. This includes the lone pair on nitrogen, which evidently finds a way to interact with the developing carbocation at C<sub>&#x03B2;</sub>, unpromising though the geometry looks.</p>
