<h1 class="chaptitle">2<span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</b></h1>
<p class="noindent">This chapter introduces some of the ideas on which current thinking about electrons in molecules is based. Always remember that in science, although facts (usually) remain constant, explanations may change. The ideas presented here come originally from modern theoretical chemistry, and have developed over the last twenty years into our most powerful and creative way of thinking about reactivity. The ideas have been simplified to suit the organic experimentalist, who is assumed to be non-mathematical, but has some ability to visualise objects in three-dimensions. So they are most useful, and most powerful, in a pictorial form which fits in with the way we represent molecular structures.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Orbital-orbital interactions: from AO to MO</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">To avoid making elementary mistakes it is important never to lose sight of what our pictorial representations mean. So we start here from the beginning, with the simplest possible theoretical picture (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>) of the formation of a bond between two identical atoms.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig2.1">

<p class="sidebar">This picture represents the interaction of two atomic orbitals (AO, identical in this case). The vertical axis is a (qualitative) energy scale and the horizontal axis gives some unspecified indication of distance on the molecular scale. The solid lines represent orbital energy levels.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The AOs might be the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms or the 2p orbitals of two fluorine atoms. When they are brought together they interact to form the two new <i>molecular</i> orbitals (MO) in the centre of the diagram, one of which is lower, the other higher in energy. If the interaction is strong enough &#x2013; that is to say, if the energy of the lower MO is low enough relative to the two starting AOs &#x2013; electrons that were originally in the atomic orbitals will prefer to occupy the new <i>bonding</i> MO. The result will be a covalent bond &#x2013; as long as the original AOs contained a total of only two electrons. If both AOs contribute two electrons, two of the four electrons involved would have <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>to be accommodated in the higher energy <i>antibonding</i> MO, cancelling out the energy gain involved in populating the bonding MO. The result is net antibonding, and a repulsion rather than an attractive interaction results.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-16em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The properties of an orbital are those of an electron contained in it. It is normal practice, illogical though it may sound, to talk of &#x2018;vacant orbitals&#x2019;. The properties of vacant orbitals are those calculated for electrons occupying them.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Remember that an orbital can accommodate up to two electrons. An odd number means we are dealing with radical chemistry. This situation is discussed in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">This conclusion is the basis of the following generalisation, which has far-reaching consequences: it provides the theoretical framework not just for covalent bond formation, but also for many of our ideas about stereoelectronic effects:</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0.5em;">The rules governing such orbital-orbital interactions are familiar. For a strong bonding/antibonding interaction:</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Interactions between molecules: HOMO and LUMO</h2>
<p class="noindent">We can use the same basic picture (<i>cf</i>. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>) for thinking about interactions &#x2013; including reactions &#x2013; between molecules. The orbitals involved may be non-bonding, like the lone pair electrons of an amine, or they can be bonding MOs &#x2013; e.g. the &#x03C0;-electrons of an alkene &#x2013; but the basic rules are the same. They need only a certain amount of interpretation in more complex situations.</p>
<section id="sec2.2.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Rule 1: The interacting orbitals must be close in energy</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> the interacting orbitals are identical, so clearly this first condition is met. But the great majority of reactions between molecules involve interactions between non-identical orbitals, so the resulting picture is no longer symmetrical (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). The key parameter is now the difference in energy between the filled orbital of molecule 1 and the new bonding MO.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig2.2">
<img src="../images/fig_2.2.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 2.2</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">This difference decreases as the difference in energy between the two interacting orbitals increases, until eventually significant bonding is no longer observed.</p>
<p class="indent">The requirement that the interacting orbitals must be close in energy means that for ionic reactions between molecules only one or two orbitals <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>(often called the <i>Frontier Orbitals</i>) on each molecule are capable of productive bonding interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider for example the interactions between the two identical molecules represented by the orbital diagrams shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>. Clearly the strongest &#x2013; perhaps the only &#x2013; significant two-electron, bonding interactions will be between the pairs of orbitals indicated by the dashed arrows. These are respectively the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, known by their initials as the HOMO and the LUMO.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption-aside-center"><b>Fig. 2.3</b></figcaption>

</aside>
<p class="indent">If the two molecules involved are not identical the picture is unsymmetrical (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>: <i>cf</i>. <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>). <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a> is derived from <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.3">Fig. 2.3</a> simply by raising the energy levels of molecule 2 uniformly relative to those of molecule 1. As a result all the orbital interactions between the molecules are different, and in particular there are now two different HOMO : LUMO interactions. The energy gap between HOMO (1), of molecule 1, and LUMO (2), the lowest unoccupied orbital on molecule 2, is now too large for a significant bonding interaction. But the energies of HOMO (2) and LUMO (1) have become correspondingly closer, so these orbitals interact more strongly than before.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">This convergence of frontier orbital energies happens whenever the energy of the HOMO &#x2013; by definition the electron donor &#x2013; is raised, or the energy of the LUMO of the electron acceptor is lowered.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec2.2.2" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Rule 2: The interacting orbitals must overlap efficiently</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">This requirement has two related aspects. For efficient overlap the orbitals concerned must, of course, be able to approach each other closely enough; and they must be comparable in size. Orbital size and shape give an indication of local electron density, which appears in the solution of the wave equation for a given MO in the form of numerical coefficients at each atomic centre. For thinking about reactivity in typical situations very simple qualitative ideas will serve.</p>
<a id="page_6" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 6, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>
<p class="noindent">Consider the &#x03C0;-system of the carbonyl group. We know that the electron- density is concentrated in two regions, above and below the nodal plane, and is polarised towards the more electronegative oxygen atom. This is reflected in a higher coefficient at oxygen for the &#x03C0;-bonding MO. Rather than trying to draw a convincingly distorted &#x03C0;-system (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>) it is convenient to represent this situation in terms of the two AO&#x2019;s involved (p-orbitals on C and O), but to give them different sizes (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>). The sizes represent, usually qualitatively, the orbital coefficients of interest.</p>
<p class="indent">The same representation of the corresponding antibonding orbital, commonly the LUMO (&#x03C0;<sup>*</sup>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a>) for a carbonyl compound, shows that the relative sizes of the coefficients on C and O are reversed, with the larger coefficient now on carbon. When a carbonyl compound reacts with a nucleophile the decisive interaction is between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the antibonding, &#x03C0;<sup>*</sup>-orbital of the C=O group as the LUMO. In terms of <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>, Molecule 1 represents the carbonyl compound, because it has a low LUMO, while the nucleophile, which may be presumed to have a high HOMO, acts as Molecule 2. Overlap with the HOMO of the nucleophile is more efficient at the LUMO centre with the larger coefficient, rationalising the observed preference for nucleophilic addition at carbon.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course everyone knows that nucleophiles add to carbonyl carbon, and orbital-orbital interactions are not the only factor controlling even the kinetic products of such addition reactions. The object of this exercise is to introduce a systematic way of thinking about reactivity, which can be applied with confidence to unfamiliar situations. The next stage is to look at the symmetry of the orbital-orbital interactions involved.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Orbital coefficients are a guide to reactivity. The larger coefficient on the oxygen atom in the &#x03C0;-bonding orbital of the C=O group (the HOMO) tells us that electrophilic attack is expected at oxygen; while the larger coefficient of the LUMO at carbon indicates that nucleophiles will attack here.</p>

<section id="sec2.2.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Rule 3: The interacting orbitals must have suitable symmetry</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just as molecular structure can be explained in terms of the symmetries of the bonding orbitals involved, so stereoelectronic effects on reactivity can be explained in terms of the geometries of orbital-orbital interactions. And the geometries of orbital-orbital interactions depend on the symmetries of the orbitals involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus two orbitals each with axial symmetry interact most efficiently through space along a common axis. Proton transfer reactions involve substitutions at hydrogen: in frontier orbital language the non-bonded electron pair (lone pair) of the base, acting as the HOMO, interacts with the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"> <msubsup> <mi>&#x03C3;</mi> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mn>H</mn> <mo>&#x2212;</mo> <mn>X</mn> </mrow> <mo>&#x22C6;</mo> </msubsup> </math> orbital of the acid, acting as the LUMO. The lone pair of a typical base, say NH3, is an sp<sup>3</sup>-hybrid orbital with an axis of symmetry, and thus defined directionality, while the H&#x2014;X bond of the acid (<a href="#rea2.1">Reaction 2.1</a>) defines the axis of symmetry of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"> <msubsup> <mi>&#x03C3;</mi> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mn>H</mn> <mo>&#x2212;</mo> <mn>X</mn> </mrow> <mo>&#x22C6;</mo> </msubsup> </math> orbital. Thus the most efficient overlap between the two occurs along the common axis, as shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Proton transfers between ordinary acids and bases occur along a preformed hydrogen bond, and hydrogen bonds are readily &#x2018;seen&#x2019; in crystal structures because the two heavy atom centres involved are brought closer together than expected from the sum of their van der Waals radii. Though individual preferences may be overridden by rigidly fixed geometries or crystal packing forces, the clear general preference is for hydrogen bonds to form in the direction expected for the axes of the lone pair orbitals involved. For example, carboxylic acids exist almost invariably in the crystal, and often also in solution, as hydrogen-bonded dimers, with the structure shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>. The O&#x2014;H bonding orbitals, and the lone pairs on the carbonyl oxygen atom of the carboxyl group, are sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised, and can form two linear hydrogen bonds as shown, along the axes of the orbitals concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">Now consider the addition of a nucleophile to a carbonyl group. We use NH<sub>3</sub>, as before, so we know that the HOMO is the same as in <a href="#rea2.1">reaction 2.1</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>). The LUMO is now <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"> <msubsup> <mi>&#x03C0;<!-- ? --></mi> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mn>C</mn> <mo>=</mo> <mn>O</mn> </mrow> <mo>&#x22C6;<!-- ? --></mo> </msubsup> </math>, so to predict the geometry for optimal orbital overlap we must look more closely at the geometry of this orbital. The representation shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.6">Fig. 2.6</a> is good enough for most purposes, but we know that the lobes of &#x03C0;<sup>*</sup>-orbitals are in fact slightly splayed out, as shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a>, with their centres of electron-density beyond the two nuclei involved.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The centres of electron-density of the separate lobes of antibonding orbitals generally lie beyond the nuclei involved in the bond concerned. This is a logical result of electrostatic repulsion: the volume between the two nuclei is already occupied by the electrons of the a and the &#x03C0;-bond. (The lower energy bonding orbital is always filled first.)</p>

This is exactly the conclusion (a &#x2018;Blirgi-Dunitz angle&#x2019; close to 109&#x00B0;: see pages 1-2 above) derived from experiment. So <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.9">Fig. 2.9</a> shows how we visualise the geometry of this important reaction. Experimental evidence of this sort is available in only a few, specially favourable cases; but the analysis in terms of the frontier orbital interactions is always possible.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.3 <b>Hard and soft acids and bases</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Frontier orbital (HOMO/LUMO) interactions are not the only factor involved in determining overall reactivity, though they are of course crucial in determining stereoelectronic effects. Interactions between molecules are also subject to electrostatic effects, which are not intrinsically directional, and are particularly important for reactions of charged species.</p>
<a id="page_8" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 8, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>
<p class="indent">This is illustrated very clearly by the following comparisons of reactivity in simple systems:</p>
<figure class="fig" style="margin-left:-2em;">
<img src="../images/8_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The differences in rate are substantial. Hydroxide ion removes a proton from H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> much faster than does iodide, yet iodide displaces bromide from methyl bromide faster than does hydroxide. Since the HOMO involved is the same for hydroxide or for iodide in each case, changing the LUMO cannot affect the relative strengths of the HOMO/LUMO interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">The accepted explanation is that the reactions of iodide ion are primarily frontier-orbital controlled, while those of hydroxide are not. Iodide has a high HOMO, which interacts strongly with low LUMOs. The HOMO of hydroxide is a lone pair on the much more strongly electronegative oxygen, so of lower energy. But for the same reason the negative charge density is more strongly attached to the oxygen nucleus, and thus <i>more localised</i> than it is in the large and diffuse 5p non-bonding orbitals of iodine. Electrostatic effects will therefore be stronger for reactions of hydroxide, and strongest for reactions with cations like H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, while the HOMO/LUMO interaction is strongest for the reaction of iodide with neutral MeBr.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus predicting which of two possible reactions is preferred is not entirely trivial. A nucleophile (Lewis base) may be more reactive than another towards one electrophile (Lewis acid), but less reactive towards others. To simplify the analysis the ideas involved are summarised qualitatively in terms of hard and soft (Lewis) acids and bases (HSAB). Hard acids react preferentially with hard bases, soft with soft. In HSAB terms, hydroxide is a hard nucleophile and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> a hard electrophile, so they react preferentially with each other. The more polarisable iodide is a soft nucleophile, and prefers to react with soft electrophiles, like MeBr. The pattern of reactivity can be summarised as follows:</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Ambident nucleophiles</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The same sort of differences of reactivity, between different nucleophilic centres towards different types of electrophile, is also observed when the two centres concerned are in the same molecule. A group containing two different nucleophilic centres is called an <i>ambident nucleophile</i>. Familiar examples are cyanide and nitrite, and enolate anions (<b>2.1</b> &#x2013; <b>2.3</b>).</p>

<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Reactions such as those shown in <b>2.1 &#x2013; 2.3</b> do not usually take place in a vacuum, but in solution in a more or less polar solvent. Selective solvation of the two centres of an ambident nucleophile can have a major effect on the relative reactivity of the two centres. Hydrogen bonding solvation by protic solvents, in particular, stabilises selectively and so deactivates more highly charged centres.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In all three cases the soft and the hard centre make up part of the same delocalised system. Each nucleophilic centre reacts preferentially with a complementary electrophile. Thus each of the three anions prefers to be alkylated at the softer centre (arrows, <b>2.1</b> &#x2013; <b>2.3</b>) Protonation, in contrast, is faster at the more electronegative centre, where the negative charge is concentrated.</p>

<p class="indent">Take, for example, the important enolate anion (reaction <b>2.3</b>). This has two <i>&#x03C0;</i>-bonding orbitals (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>). In the lowest energy orbital the electron density is concentrated on oxygen, as expected from its higher electronegativity. But in the HOMO the largest coefficient is on the end carbon atom, indicating that this is where frontier-orbital controlled electrophilic attack is most favourable. (The total charge, given by the sum of the coefficients for &#x03C8;<sub>1</sub> and &#x03C8;<sub>2</sub>, remains greater on oxygen than on carbon.)</p>
<p class="indent">The reactions at the softer centres are under full frontier-orbital control, and can therefore be expected to be subject to stereoelectronic effects. But HOMO/LUMO interactions are also one of the attractive forces between reacting hard centres. So &#x2013; other things being equal &#x2013; the <i>geometries</i> involved will still generally be those indicated by the orbital-orbital interactions. <a id="page_10" class="page">Page 10, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>

<h2 class="h2">2.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Geometrical restrictions on orbital overlap</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many of the most interesting stereoelectronic effects on reactivity discussed in the later chapters of this book result from geometrical restrictions on orbital overlap. There is in principle no geometrical restriction on interactions between orbitals of separate molecules, apart from any imposed by steric effects. Through-space interactions between two orbitals on the same molecule, on the other hand, are subject to the constraints imposed by its structure, and this idea will be developed further in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.2">section 4.2</a>). Through-bond interactions also clearly depend on the geometrical arrangements about the bond involved. The basic idea is a simple one, and is introduced here in the context of the structures of alkenes. It can have important effects on reactivity, and is discussed further in <a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sec4.1">section 4.1</a>) under the sub-heading of Electronic Strain.</p>

</figure>
<p class="sidebar">Note that trans-alkenes are normally <i>more</i> thermally stable than cis-alkenes, for steric reasons.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">An alkene with a twisted double bond is a reactive alkene, because <i>&#x03C0;</i>-overlap between the adjacent p-orbitals is reduced. The larger the angle of twist, the less stable is the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-bond. Thus trans-cyclooctene (<b>2.4</b>), the smallest-ring cycloalkene that is stable, is thousands of times more reactive towards electrophiles than is the unstrained cis-isomer (<b>2.5</b>). Trans-cycloheptene is not thermally stable: it is not possible to join the two allylic carbons (starred in <b>2.4</b>) by a 4-carbon chain and especially not a 3-carbon chain without twisting them too far out of the plane of the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-system.</p>
<p class="indent">The same effect is observed if the double bond is at a bridgehead, and is the basis of Bredt&#x2019;s rule: which says that double bonds are prohibited at the bridgehead positions of caged bicyclic systems. Here too the rule is relaxed when the rings become large enough to accommodate the alkene unit without prohibitive distortion. Thus <b>2.6</b> has only very transitory existence, while <b>2.7</b> can trapped reasonably comfortably and <b>2.8</b> can be isolated.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/10_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Although there is also angle strain involved with many such structures, it is the twisting of the double bond which is the key to their instability. Thus cyclopropene (<b>2.9</b> clearly suffers from enormous angle strain, but is (by definition!) planar. It is, not surprisingly, a highly reactive alkene, because much angle strain is relieved in reactions which convert the two sp<sup>2</sup> carbons to sp<sup>3</sup>. But it is stable at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.</p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The preferred planar structure of an alkene can be distorted in several different ways. All of them weaken the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-bond, which requires the p-orbitals of the adjacent carbon atoms to be parallel to each other (<b>2.10a</b>). Simple twisting about the central C&#x2013;C bond (<b>2.10b</b>) clearly reduces the efficiency of the overlap. In terms of the orbital interaction diagram on <a href="#page_3">page 3</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>) the new bonding MO which results is of higher energy than it would be if overlap were optimal. Since this is the HOMO for reactions of the system <a id="page_11" class="page">Page 11, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>with electrophiles, frontier orbital interactions with a given LUMO are stronger, and reactivity is increased.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/11_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The effect &#x2013; like all stereoelectronic effects of this sort &#x2013; is not on-off, but incremental, and depends on the angle &#x03B8; between the axes of the p-orbitals. The efficiency of <i>&#x03C0;</i>-type overlap depends approximately on cos &#x03B8;, falling off gently for small angles of twist (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>) but becoming zero at &#x03B8; = 90&#x00B0; (<b>2.10</b>) . At this point all <i>&#x03C0;</i>-bonding is lost &#x2013; each p-orbital lies in the nodal plane of the other &#x2013; and the two electrons that would have formed the bond must choose between the two separate orbitals. Other things being equal, the likely outcome is that they choose to separate, to form a 1,2-diradical (see <a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>2.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>The status of lone pair electrons</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Organic chemists generally think about molecular structure in terms of fixed nuclei connected by localised bonding orbitals, which fit precisely the observed geometry of the system. Non-bonding electron pairs, or lone pairs, like that of NH<sub>3</sub> in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>, are treated as orbitals much like other, bonding orbitals at the same centre: except that they are likely to be of higher energy because they are bonded to only one, rather than two, nuclei. Lone pairs are therefore the HOMOs in many systems, and of particular importance for reactivity.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no doubt that lone pairs exist, much as represented in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7">Fig. 2.7</a>. Apart from the evidence from hydrogen-bonding discussed above, special crystallographic techniques reveal significant electron-density in the expected regions, consistent with high-level calculations (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>); molecular mechanics calculations are inaccurate unless lone pair electron density is specifically included; and the conformational properties of amines show that the lone pair on nitrogen has steric requirements comparable with those of an N&#x2013;H bond. The steric requirements of lone pairs on oxygen are also significant, but smaller, as is to be expected for a more electronegative element.</p>
<a id="page_12" class="page" style="width:60%">Page 12, Chapter 2 The electronic basis of stereoelectronic effects</a>
<p class="indent">A particular and rather subtle problem arises with the two lone pairs of saturated oxygen. Amines are clearly sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised, with close-to-tetrahedral angles at nitrogen. The bond angles at oxygen of ethers and alcohols are also close to tetrahedral, and if the lone pairs are considered explicitly they are usually represented as two equivalent sp<sup>3</sup>-hybrid orbitals (<b>2.13a</b>). Theoreticians prefer a representation in terms of a pair of unhybridised orbitals (<b>2.13b</b>), one with jt and one with <i>&#x03C3;</i>-symmetry, but the two pictures are mathematically equivalent, and equally valid. In either case the electron-densities of the two orbitals must add up to give the actual electron-density distribution, roughly as shown in <b>2.13c</b>). We will use sp<sup>3</sup>-hybrid lone pairs, as in <b>2.13a</b>, which experience shows is the most useful and convenient representation for thinking about reactivity in organic molecules.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/12_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly the two lone pairs on sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised oxygen, in carbonyl compounds, nitro-groups, and so on, are represented as sp<sup>2</sup>-hybrid orbitals <b>(2.14).</b> The simple rule is to assume that hybridisation at oxygen or nitrogen is the same as at the carbon atom they are connected to, and to draw lone pair orbitals with the appropriate geometry.</p>
