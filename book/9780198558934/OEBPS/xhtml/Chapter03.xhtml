<p class="noindent">The single most important principle of conformational analysis is that rotation about single bonds is not free, but restricted by energy barriers which depend on the substituents at the ends of each bond. Other things being equal, staggered conformations are preferred, with large, sterically demanding groups antiperiplanar - i.e. as far away from each other as possible. The preferences are easily understood in terms of steric repulsion between groups: which are in fact interactions between (usually bonding) orbitals. The general orbital interaction picture shown in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1">Fig. 2.1</a> (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_3">page 3</a>) tells us that (four-electron) interactions between filled orbitals are antibonding, and thus repulsive. These repulsive interactions are largest in eclipsed conformations (<b>3.1</b>) and minimised in staggered conformations (<b>3.2</b>). It is often convenient to discuss torsion angles in these systems using Newman projections (e.g. <b>3.3</b>).</p>

<p class="sidebar">The geometrical relationships between groups in staggered conformations, shown above relative to R*, are called <i>synclinal (sc</i>, in practice more often called gauche), <i>anticlinal (ac</i>, not much used), and <i>antiperiplanar</i> (<i>ap</i>)</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The rules are based on the observed structures of innumerable saturated compounds. The few exceptions in such systems are usually special cases, where a simple explanation proves the rule. However, as one must expect, rules or explanations based on a single effect hold only as long as other effects are insignificant. And other effects do become significant, and sometimes dominant, when the C&#x2013;H or C&#x2013;C bonds of <b>3.3</b> are replaced by lone pairs, strongly electronegative groups, or &#x2013; especially &#x2013; both at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">The systems of particular interest are described by the general structures <b>3.4, 3.5</b> and <b>3.6</b>. Of these, <b>3.4</b>, which includes acetals and related compounds, is the most important. Vicinally disubstituted compounds (<b>3.5</b>) have some related properties of interest: while the conformations of systems <b>3.6</b>, which include hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine and their derivatives, fit neatly into the general picture.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>The anomeric effect</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">One reason why saturated oxygen can be regarded as sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised (see above, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#page_12">page 12</a>) is that the conformations of aliphatic ethers are much the same as those of the corresponding hydrocarbons. The preferred conformation of methyl ethyl ether, for example, is antiperiplanar, just like that of &#x201C;-butane <b>(3.2 = 3.3</b>, R = CH3); and tetrahydropyran (<b>3.7</b>) exists in the chair conformation shown, closely similar to that of cyclohexane (<b>3.8</b>).</p>
<p class="indent">The rules of conformational analysis tell us that the preferred form of a substituted cyclohexane has the maximum number of substituents in equatorial positions (because in this conformation the number of 1,3-diaxial interactions is minimised). The same applies to substituted tetrahydropyrans (though there are quantitative differences, as discussed below). In the 2-alkyl-substituted derivative <b>3.9</b>, for example, the equatorial conformer <b>3.9e</b> is preferred.</p>
<p class="indent">So we are not surprised &#x2013; indeed, rather pleased &#x2013; to learn that glucose, which is the most abundant naturally-occurring sugar, exists preferentially in the form <b>(3.10e</b>, &#x03B2;-D-glucopyranose) with all five substituents on the tetrahydropyran ring equatorial. At first sight the usual rules of conformational analysis seem to explain sugar conformations very well.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/14_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that we are dealing here with two different sorts of equilibrium. <b>3.9e</b> <img src="../images/in07_1.jpg" alt="images"/> <b>3.9a</b> are conformational isomers of a single compound, interconverting by ring inversion &#x2013; simple rotations about single bonds. But <b>3.10e</b> is not a conformational isomer of <b>3.10a</b>, buta diastereoisomer, with one of the five stereocentres inverted. Isomerisation thus requires bond-breaking and bond-making at the centre concerned. The reaction involved is the ring-opening &#x2013; ring-closing equilibration of the hemiacetal at C(1), which is known as the <i>anomeric centre.</i> The two diastereoisomers, <b>3.10a</b> and <b>e</b> (which are technically epimers in this situation), are called <i>anomers.</i></p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This happy state of affairs does not survive closer scrutiny. It is possible to estimate the position of conformational equilibrium for substituted cyclohexanes with high accuracy, and when the same methods are applied to the tetrahydropyran rings of pyranose sugars like glucose, clear and systematic discrepancies appear. Glucose in solution in water at 25&#x00B0;C does prefer the equatorial form <b>3.10e</b>, but only just. The actual equatorial:axial ratio at equilibrium is 64:36, significantly smaller than estimated, with several times more axial isomer than expected on classical conformational grounds. What is more, even in the glucose system the parent molecule turns out to be an exception: for most simple derivatives the axial anomer predominates, especially if the substituent at the anomeric position is strongly electronegative; as shown by the data in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.1">Table 3.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_15" class="page">Page 15, Chapter 3 Effects on conformation</a><span class="space">&#160;</span><span class="space">&#160;</span>This pattern is general. An electronegative substituent in the anomeric position of a pyranose, and generally in the 2-position of a tetrahydropyran ring (<b>3.11</b>), shows a definite preference for the axial position.</p>

<p class="indent">This unexpected preference is the anomeric effect. For OH and OR groups it is comparable with the steric preference for the equatorial position, and for the most electronegative groups it is substantially greater. All three halogen derivatives of the tribenzoate ester (<b>3.12</b>, X = F, CL and Br: Bz = PhCO) of xylose, for example, exist in the form (<b>3.12a</b>) with the halogen in the axial position, even though this means that the three ester groups must also be axial.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Measuring the anomeric effect</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The anomeric effect is obtained experimentally from measurements of the axial:equatorial ratio at equilibrium for suitable tetrahydropyran derivatives. These ratios are usually expressed as free energies, corrected for the steric preference of the group for the equatorial position, which works in the opposite direction. There are some complications with this correction, which allow some insight into the way we should think about such questions.</p>
<p class="indent">The relevant steric preference is that for a substituent in the 2-position of tetrahydropyran. This is not exactly the same as in a cyclohexane, but because almost all the available data refer to substituents on cyclohexane, most published estimates of anomeric effects are based on them. It would be possible to apply these data more rationally if a suitable conversion factor could be applied, and some progress has been made in this direction. The analysis is as follows.</p>
<p class="indent">2-Alkyl-substituted tetrahydropyrans actually show a stronger preference for the equatorial conformation <b>3.9e</b> than do the corresponding R-substituted cyclohexanes. The 1,3-diaxial interactions which destabilise the axial conformer <b>3.9a</b> are stronger in this system because C&#x2013;O bonds are shorter than C&#x2013;C bonds, bringing the axial H and R groups shown in <b>3.9a</b> closer than they would be in the corresponding cyclohexane <b>3.13a</b>.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/15_3.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The distance between carbon atoms 2 and 6 of tetrahydropyran (<b>3.9</b>, R = H) is 2.35&#x00C5;, 7% less than the corresponding distance in cyclohexane. Axial substituents on these carbons are in van der Waals contact.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:1em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Equatorial preferences for substituents in cyclohexanes are called A-values, and are expressed as free energies, (&#x2206;G&#x00B0;) for the equilibrium <b>3.13e</b> <img src="../images/in07_1.jpg" alt="images"/> <b>3.13a</b>.</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent">For small alkyl substituents R the equatorial preferences for systems <b>3.9</b> are about 50% greater than for the cyclohexanes <b>3.13</b>. This figure can be used to make a rough estimate of the equatorial preference for any substituent <b>R</b> in the 2-position of tetrahydropyran (<b>3.9</b>) if the equatorial preference in cyclohexane (A-value) is known. It is assumed that for alkyl substituents <a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Chapter 3 Effects on conformation</a>only steric factors are significant. For electronegative substituents <b>X</b> we know that the axial:equatorial ratio for the tetrahydropyran derivative <b>3.9</b> reflects both steric and anomeric effects. To separate the two the steric component has to be estimated: one suggestion is to add about 50% to the known A-value (&#x2206;G&#x00B0;<sub>cyclohexane</sub>). Some representative values for all these parameters are shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a>. The estimated anomeric effect (final column) has not been corrected.</p>

<p class="sidebar">The free energy differences &#x2206;G&#x00B0; in <a href="#tab3.2">Table 2</a> ((columns 3-5) are average values, for the equilibrium formation of the axial isomer (e.g. <b>3.11 e</b> <img src="../images/in07_1.jpg" alt="images"/> <b>3.11 a</b>). Thus a positive value indicates a preference for the equatorial isomer. The values are known to vary with solvent, and differences of &#x00B1;1 kJ/mol are not significant.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The final column gives the magnitude of the anomeric effect for the group <b>X</b>, in <b>kJ</b>/mol. The effect increases with increasing electronegativity of the group concerned, and for the halogens is large enough to dominate conformational equilibria even for systems with several other substituents with opposite preferences (see <b>3.12</b>, above).</p>
<p class="indent">The examples given in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#tab3.2">Table 3.2</a> are chosen to cover those types of substituent which show significant anomeric effects. For groups which are only weakly electronegative any anomeric affect is small. The uncertainties involved in measuring an accurate value therefore mean that for a number of groups it is not certain whether an effect exists. This situation is fertile ground for the specialist, but for most purposes whether such groups &#x2013; CN and C0<sub>2</sub>Et are examples &#x2013; exhibit an anomeric effect is not important.</p>

<section id="sec3.3" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2"><b>3.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>The anomeric effect is general</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The anomeric effect is a fundamental stereoelectronic effect, not limited either to acetals or to ring-systems. The conformation of the aglycone end of a glycoside, for example, shows a related conformational preference, which on inspection turns out to be basically the same effect, acting at the other end of the acetal group at the glycosidic centre. Thus the anomers of a glucoside prefer - other things being equal - conformations <b>3.14a</b> and <b>3.14e</b>. This is called the exo-anomeric effect. This preference is an important factor in the determination of the three-dimensional structure of polysaccharides, and is observed in simple tetrahydropyran acetals also (e.g. <b>3.15</b>).</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-8em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The <i>agtycone</i> (literally, the part of the structure that is not sugar) is shorthand for a group (OR in <b>3.14a</b>) attached to a sugar residue.</p>

<p class="indent">The feature common to all these structures is a preference for a gauche (or <i>synclinal</i>, see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_13">p. 13</a>) arrangement (<b>3.16</b>) about the central acetal C&#x2013;O bonds. This is possible for both of these bonds simultaneously only in the axial geometry (<b>3.16</b> corresponds to <b>3.15a</b>). For equatorial compounds <b>3.15e</b> corresponds to <b>3.17:</b> the conformation about the exocyclic bond is gauche, but the ring enforces the antiperiplanar conformation about the endocyclic C&#x2013;O bond. (Remember that a bond to an equatorial substituent is always antiperiplanar to two ring-bonds in the chair conformation of a six-membered ring).</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In acyclic systems there is no overriding conformational restriction, and the stereoelectronic preference for the gauche arrangement is observed &#x2013; again, other things being equal. Thus dimethoxymethane exists in the gauche, gauche conformation (<b>3.16</b>, R = CH<sub>3</sub>), as do many other acyclic acetals and their derivatives.</p>
<p class="indent">Such conformational preferences are not limited to rotations about C&#x2013;O bonds, though these are the most obvious since only a single bond is involved at the oxygen end. The simplest extension is to sulphur compounds.</p>
<section id="sec3.3.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Effects at sulphur</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The evidence for an anomeric effect about the C&#x2013;S bond is clear-cut, though quantifying it is less so. Comparable or even greater amounts of axial isomer are seen when tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives are compared with the parent, oxygen, heterocycles; increasing as expected with the electronegativity of the group (<b>X</b> in <b>3.18</b>) concerned.</p>

<p class="sidebar">Standard bond lengths for C&#x2013;O, C&#x2013;C and C&#x2013;S single bonds are 1.43,1.54 and 1.82A, respectively. Note that, compared with C&#x2013;C, the increase in length for C&#x2013;S is significantly greater than the decrease on going to C&#x2013;O.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This does not mean that the anomeric effect is actually stronger for the sulphur derivative: C&#x2013;S bonds are significantly longer than C&#x2013;C, so that the repulsive 1,3-diaxial interactions which disfavour axial conformations are in any case reduced in <b>3.18a</b>. This effect is greater still in dithianes (<b>3.19</b>, <b>3.20</b>) and trithianes (<b>3.21</b>). Thus trans-2,3-dichloro-l,4-dithiane, like the corresponding dioxan, exists in the crystal and in solution in the diaxial conformation (<b>3.19</b>); there is no evidence for any significant amount of equatorial isomer in solutions of the benzoyl derivative <b>3.21</b>; and even the ester group has a clear preference for the axial position in <b>3.20</b>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Effects at nitrogen</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Amine nitrogen is not electronegative enough to produce a significant anomeric effect as a substituent on a tetrahydropyran (X in <b>3.11</b>, above), but the conformational preferences of alkyl groups attached to ring-nitrogens show that similar effects are at work. For example, an N-alkyl group is axial in the predominant conformations of both <b>3.22</b> and <b>3.23</b>, and the same is true for <b>3.24</b> even when the axial group is t-butyl.</p>

<p class="noindent">Acetals are the most important of a number of classes of compounds with two, three or four hetero-atoms on the same central carbon. In general terms, the more electronegative the substituents the more stable the system: but more and larger substituent groups mean increased steric strain. The stereoelectronic effects of interest are discussed most conveniently in the context of the familiar systems (<b>3.4</b>) with two hetero-atoms.</p>

<p class="indent">The second hetero-atom Y in such a molecule has a profound effect on the bond (C&#x2014;X) to the first. When the two substituents are identical (X = Y) the system shows special stability: the C&#x2014;Cl bonds of methylene chloride, CH<sub>2</sub>CI<sub>2</sub>, or the C&#x2014;O bonds of (MeO)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, for example, are shorter and stronger, and thus harder to break, than those of the corresponding CH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;X compounds. In the extreme case the C&#x2014;F bonds of CF<sub>4</sub> are 5% shorter than those of methyl fluoride, and the decrease is monotonic with increasing numbers of fluorine atoms. The stereoelectronic origin of the effect is still under active discussion &#x2013; and likely to remain so. This is the extreme case &#x2013; F is the most electronegative element, its lone pairs are the most vestigial, and there is no relevant conformational evidence.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-12em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">The low reactivity of methylene chloride (CH<sub>2</sub>CI<sub>2</sub>), which is a useful inert solvent for organic reactions, is familiar. Symmetrical acetals are not generally thought of as inert, but in fact they react only when a proton or Lewis acid is attached to one of the oxygens, thus making the <i>reacting</i> system strongly unsymmetrical.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the case of an acetal much more evidence is available. The substituent groups on the two oxygens adopt specific conformations, which reflect stereoelectronic as well as steric requirements, and they can be varied, together or independently, to probe further.</p>
<p class="indent">We have seen that the preferred structure (<b>3.16</b>) of an acetal has the gauche conformation about both central C&#x2014;O bonds. This puts lone pairs antiperiplanar to both these bonds. Since we know that this conformation is not favoured sterically, we can safely conclude that the preference is stereoelectronic, and dictated by the presence of the lone pairs. Other significant evidence is that the lengths of the two central C&#x2014;O bonds differ <a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Chapter 3 Effects on conformation</a>if the acetal is electronically unsymmetrical. An example is any aryl alkyl acetal <b>(3.26)</b>. It is found that the C&#x2014;OAr bond is longer than C&#x2014;OMe, and this difference increases for Ar groups with electron-withdrawing substituents.</p>

<img src="../images/19_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The same effect lengthens the axial C&#x2014;Cl bond <i>a</i> in <i>cis</i>-2, 3-dichloro-l,4-dioxan <b>(3.27)</b> but not the corresponding equatorial bond <i>e.</i> (The bond lengths are 1.819 and 1.781 &#x00C5;, respectively: a difference far greater than the errors involved in the measurement.) Here too there is a lone pair on the adjacent oxygen antiperiplanar to the bond affected.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest explanation for all these effects is that there is a stabilising, two-electron interaction (expressed in terms of curved arrows as <b>3.28</b> <img src="../images/in07_2.jpg" alt="images"/> <b>3.29</b>) between the non-bonding electron pair on oxygen and the vacant <i>&#x03C3;</i>*-orbital of the adjacent C&#x2014;O or C&#x2014;CL bond (thus n<sub>O</sub>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>c&#x2014;o</sub> <sup>or</sup> n<sub>O</sub>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;CL</sub>). The oxygen lone pairs are the HOMOs in these systems, the antibonding orbital of the <i>&#x03C3;</i>-bond to the most electronegative substituent is the LUMO, and the antiperiplanar geometry allows optimal overlap. (As shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a> the orbitals involved have the same symmetry, and are held parallel to each other in this conformation.)</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">This interaction explains all the main features associated with the anomeric effect: the changes in bond lengths at the acetal centre are predicted, since a contribution from structure <b>3.29</b> will have the effect of lengthening the C&#x2014;X bond, and shortening the C&#x2014;O bond, as observed. And if the effect is stabilising, as a two-electron interaction is known to be, it will be most effective when the geometry is antiperiplanar (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>), thus accounting for the preference for gauche conformations about acetal C&#x2014;O bonds. It also predicts that acetals can be unsymmetrical purely because of their geometry. A case in point is the tricyclic system <b>3.30</b>, in which one oxygen (<i>a)</i> is axial but the second equatorial (<i>e</i>) with respect to the other ring. The conformation at the acetal centre corresponds to <b>3.17</b> (above, <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_17">p. 17</a>). The two C&#x2014;O bonds differ significantly in length, with the bond to the axial oxygen (<i>a</i>) the longer: as expected, since only this C&#x2014;O bond is antiperiplanar to a lone pair on the other oxygen atom.</p>

<p class="indent">The interaction shown in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a> is represented in terms of curved arrows as <b>3.28</b>, corresponding to &#x2018;resonance&#x0027; between the two structures <b>3.28</b> and <b>3.29:</b> neither of which represents the actual structure as well as a combination of the two. This process has been called no-bond resonance, or <a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Chapter 3 Effects on conformation</a>sometimes negative hyperconjugation (see below). In terms of <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a> a better general designation is a-delocalisation.</p>
<p class="indent">The arrows of <b>3.28</b> represent an effect on the ground state of an acetal or related system, but the same arrows can also represent a real reaction, in which the C&#x2013;X bond is broken. This is a formal connection between stereoelectronic effects on ground state structure and reactivity, and is discussed in more detail in later chapters.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">&#x2018;Delocalisation&#x2019; in its various guises is a useful way of bridging the gap between the complex electronic structures of even quite simple molecules and our simplified picture of bonding. It is a price we pay for the convenience of describing structures in terms of localised orbitals.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">This picture, involving <i>&#x03C3;</i>-delocalisation, is the generally accepted interpretation of the anomeric and related effects, and is the one used in the rest of this book. Other rationalisations have been offered, and are discussed in the specialised texts listed at the end of this chapter. None of them has the power and simplicity of the explanation in terms of n&#x2013;<i>&#x03C3;</i>* interactions, as described above. This does not necessarily mean that this interpretation is formally or rigorously correct; simply that it is the best and most convenient currently available to the organic chemist. The most important caveat for the user in the laboratory is not that the ideas may conflict with new results of theory, but that they should be applied with due care. The effects concerned have important consequences but they are not large in energy terms, and are always in competition with other steric and stereoelectronic effects; which in many situations will be stronger.</p>

<p class="noindent">The basis of the anomeric effect is thus taken to be a two-electron bonding interaction between a lone pair on oxygen and the antibonding <i>&#x03C3;</i>* orbital of a bond on an adjacent atom: this interaction being strongest when the two orbitals concerned are antiperiplanar (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If we think of organic structures in terms of localised orbitals we must accept that such interactions, between filled and vacant orbitals, are the rule rather than the exception. Every a-bond is also a potential donor orbital (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>: compare <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>).

<p class="indent">In principle there are six such interactions about every single bond in the staggered conformation, each with the correct geometry for optimal overlap. Thus in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#fig3.3">Fig. 3.3</a> each bonding orbital at the far end of the C&#x2013;C bond, <i>viz.</i> C&#x2013;R, C&#x2013;X and C&#x2013;Y, is antiperiplanar to a bond (C&#x2013;c, C&#x2013;b and C&#x2013;a, respectively), and thus an antibonding orbital, at the other end: and vice versa. However, such effects become significant only when they are particularly strong. A strong HOMO-LUMO interaction requires a high HOMO and a low LUMO, and it is this combination &#x2013; a lone pair in the correct position to overlap with the <i>&#x03C3;</i>*-orbital of a bond to a strongly electronegative group &#x2013; which makes the n&#x2013;<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C</sub>_<sub>X</sub> interaction important in controlling the conformations of acetal and related structures.</p>
<p class="indent">All this can be summarised in an important generalisation:</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the conformation which best satisfies this preference is actually observed depends on the details of the bond in the molecule concerned; but it is an essential part of any reasoned assessment of the factors involved in determining conformation.</p>
<p class="indent">This reasoned assessment requires an idea of the order of donor and acceptor capability of typical bonds: that is to say, the relative energy levels of the HOMOs and LUMOs concerned.

<h3 class="h3"><b>The gauche effect</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="noindent">The broad generalisation in the box above also provides a simple explanation of the gauche effect, the preference for the gauche conformation observed for systems X&#x2014;C&#x2014;C&#x2014;Y, where X and Y are strongly electronegative groups, usually halogens. For example, 1,2-difluoroethane prefers the gauche conformation (<b>3.31</b>) in all solvents. In this conformation each C&#x2014;F bond is antiperiplanar to a C&#x2014;H bond, and the favourable <i>&#x03C3;</i><sub>C&#x2013;H</sub>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>*<sub>C&#x2014;F</sub> interactions possible in this conformation outweigh the steric preference for the conformation with the two fluorines antiperiplanar.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-7.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="figure-aside-center">
<img src="../images/21_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The same effect is involved in the preference of the fluorine atom of 5- fluoro-l,3-dioxane (<b>3.32</b>) for the axial conformation. And is presumed to explain why it has so far proved impossible to prepare the innocuous-looking acetal <b>3.33</b>, with the trans ring-junction, from glyoxal and ethylene glycol.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/21_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A gauche effect is also observed for systems which have two adjacent electronegative atoms, which by definition bear lone pairs. Simple examples are H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which have the S&#x2014;H and O&#x2014;H bonds almost perpendicular to each other in the Newman projection (e.g. <b>3.34</b>). Here there are no other substituents to make steric demands and the resulting conformation (as always) reflects the dynamic balance between competing steric and stereoelectronic effects. The stereoelectronic effect in this case can be interpreted in the usual way, as a preference for lone pairs to be antiperiplanar to C&#x2014;H bonds, which are not very convincing as acceptor orbitals, but at least better than another lone pair. In fact it is easiest to think <a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Chapter 3 Effects on conformation</a>of these systems as preferring to avoid conformations with lone pairs antiperiplanar to each other. For example, the expected steric preference of the tetraalkyl hydrazine <b>3.35</b> for the diequatorial conformation is almost balanced by this stereoelectronic effect, so that the equilibrium mixture contains almost 40% of the axial-equatorial conformer <b>3.36</b>, which has the lone pairs gauche rather than antiperiplanar, as they are in <b>3.35</b>.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Effects at sp<sup>2</sup>-centres</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">n-<i>&#x03C3;</i>* and <i>&#x03C3;</i>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>* interactions are not limited to saturated systems. They may even be stronger when the centres involved are Jt-bonded, because the interatomic distances will be shorter and overlap be more efficient as a result. But conformations about double bonds will not be affected directly because they are determined by the requirements of the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-bond, compared with which the much weaker n-<i>&#x03C3;</i>* and <i>&#x03C3;</i>-<i>&#x03C3;</i>* bonding are second order effects.</p>
<p class="indent">Effects become apparent across formal single bonds between sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised centres, such as the C&#x2013;O-alkyl bonds of esters (<b>3.37</b>). We concluded at the end of <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> that hybridisation at oxygen or nitrogen is the same as at the carbon atom they are connected to. Thus the O-alkyl oxygen of an ester is sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised, as we know from the observed trigonal bond angles at this centre. The second important structural feature is the well-known preference for the <b>Z</b> (<b>3.37Z</b>) rather than the E-conformation (<b>3.37E</b>), which might be expected to be favoured on steric grounds (certainly for formate esters (<b>3.37, R = H</b>).</p>

<p class="sidebar">Note that the arrows shown in <b>3.37Z</b> involve specifically the oxygen lone pair and the a-bond of the C=O group, i.e. two orbitals in the plane of the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-system. They do not involve the <i>&#x03C0;</i>-system.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The simple explanation is that <b>3.37Z</b> is stabilised by the n-a*<sub>C</sub>_<sub>O</sub> interaction possible between the (sp<sup>2</sup>-hybrid) lone pair on the O-alkyl oxygen and the a* antibonding orbital of the C=O group (arrows in <b>3.37Z</b>). This interaction is not possible in the E-conformation, which is enforced for most lactones (<b>3.38</b>), and is thought to account for their increased reactivity compared with ordinary esters. Such relationships between conformation and reactivity are one of the main topics of the next chapter.</p>
