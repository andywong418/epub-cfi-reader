<p class="noindent">Stereoelectronic effects on radical reactions arise from geometrical preferences for optimal orbital-orbital interactions, in the same way as the effects on ionic reactions discussed in previous chapters of this book. The geometries of the relevant orbital-orbital interactions are the same as in the corresponding ionic reactions because the orbitals involved are the same. What is different is that the interacting orbitals contain an odd number of electrons.</p>
<p class="indent">Stereoelectronic effects on reactivity are generally simpler than for ionic reactions because the reactions are simpler. To illustrate the point consider the radical chlorination of an alkane.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-2.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Radical substitution reactions are conveniently written with singleheaded arrows (an equivalent set can be drawn in the reverse direction).</p>

<p class="sidebar">The shorthand for such a reaction is S<sub>H</sub>2; similar to S<sub>N</sub>2, with the H standing for Homolytic.Radical reactions, which do not usually involve charged groups, are typically insensitivejto solvent effects. Solvation is therefore not an important complicating factor in most radical mechanisms</p>

<p class="noindent">The products of the reaction arise in the propagation step or steps, which have to compete with the very fast recombination process. Recombination is generally diffusion-controlled - so fast that reaction occurs every time two radicals (with opposite spins) meet. Thus only very fast - which in practice means simple - propagation reactions are possible. Rearrangements are rare, and radical substitutions, like those in the propagation steps above, take place almost exclusively at singly bonded centres: i.e. at H or halogen (occasionally also at O or S). We may assume that the orbital-orbital interactions involved are subject to the usual stereoelectronic effects, but these reactions have no observable stereochemical consequences at the centres concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">The rare examples of radical substitution at carbon almost invariably involve the weak C&#x2013;C bonds of cyclopropanes. The addition of chlorine to 1, 1-dichlorocyclopropane, for example (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.1">Fig. 8.1</a>), is thought to involve an S<sub>H</sub>2 process as the first propagation step, and has been shown to go with inversion of configuration: like an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, and no doubt for basically the same reasons. (The second step is not stereospecific, as is to be expected if the radical <b>8.1</b> is a full intermediate.)</p>

<p class="indent">This is an exceptional case, and it is no coincidence that the bond being broken is particularly weak (the formation of <b>8.1</b> involves the cleavage of a weak C&#x2013;C bond and the formation of a stronger C&#x2013;Cl bond). Reaction is further favoured in this case because the radical formed is stabilised by the two chlorine atoms.</p>
<section id="sec8.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">8.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Stability of radicals and reactivity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Because radicals react with low activation energies transition states for their reactions are close in structure to the radical intermediates (the Hammond Postulate: see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_42">page 42</a>). So the major factor controlling reactivity in radical reactions is the stability of the reactant and product radicals concerned. Here there is an important difference from polar intermediates: <i>any</i> feature which stabilises either a carbocation or a carbanion will stabilise a radical. This is because a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) can be involved in bonding interactions with either filled or vacant orbitals. The principle involved is illustrated in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig8.2">

</figure>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-15.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar"><a href="#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a> shows two separate orbital interaction diagrams, showing how the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of a radical can interact productively with either a high-energy occupied orbital (HOMO, right to left interaction) or with a sufficiently lowlying vacant orbital (LUMO, left to right). In practice the SOMO interacts with every filled or vacant orbital within range, but the interactions with the HOMO and the LUMO will be the strongest and most significant.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Consider first the interaction of the SOMO with the filled orbital, labelled HOMO. Two of the three electrons involved can be accommodated in the resultant bonding orbital, while the third must go into the new antibonding orbital. The net result is bonding, because two electrons are now in a lower energy orbital, while only one has gone up in energy. The picture is simpler when the SOMO interacts with a vacant orbital (LUMO in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.2">Fig. 8.2</a>). Now there is only a single electron to be accommodated. It will go into the new bonding orbital, which is lower in energy than the original SOMO; so again the net interaction is bonding.</p>
<a id="page_84" class="page" style="width:60%;">Page 84, Chapter 8 Radical reactions</a>
<p class="indent">As a result radicals are stabilised, and thus formed faster, in systems where the unpaired electron is in an orbital (the SOMO) which can interact with either a donor or an acceptor orbital, (or with both at the same time). This can be p, &#x03C0; or &#x03C3; in type. Some reactions in which stabilised radicals are formed are shown in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a>. The geometries of the interactions are not new, though at first sight some of the results are surprising. The H atom removed from an alcohol, for example, comes not from oxygen but from the carbon atom next to it (<b>8.2</b>). The radical formed is the one with the most efficient delocalisation, with the SOMO interacting with a lone pair on oxygen (<b>8.3</b>). The oxygen of a carbonyl group is also effective enough as a lone-pair donor to stabilise an acyl radical (<b>8.4</b>). Other examples in <a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.3">Fig. 8.3</a> are more familiar; but note that H is removed equally easily from CH<sub>2</sub> next to C=C and C=O.</p>

<p class="indent">In the absence of strong delocalisation the structure of an alkyl radical can conveniently be thought of as intermediate between that of a carbocation and a carbanion. There is relatively little difference in energy between planar and pyramidal forms, so inversion at a radical centre is rapid and stereochemistry is not preserved (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.4">Fig. 8.4</a>). Similarly, radicals are formed at bridgeheads, where they must be pyramidal, more easily than are carbocations (though more slowly than in acyclic systems).</p>

<p class="noindent">Note that the effect of an adjacent oxygen is comparable with that of a benzene ring; but that it requires efficient overlap of the oxygen lone pairs with the radical (<b>8.3</b>), in the same way as stabilisation of a cationic centre at a comparable position (see above, <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_41">page 41</a>). Thus the bridgehead C&#x2013;H bond (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.5">Fig. 8.5</a>) does not react at a significant rate; similarly axial C&#x2013;H bonds of 1,3-dioxans (<b>8.5a</b>), with antiperiplanar lone pairs, react some ten times faster than those of the equatorial isomers (<b>8.5e</b>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Intramolecular reactions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The easy abstraction of hydrogen from a C&#x2013;H bond is unique to radical chemistry, and the intramolecular version is one of the commonest of all radical reactions. There is a strong preference for reaction through a six-membered cyclic transition state, even when other ring sizes would give more stable radicals. Clearly there is no stereoelectronic barrier to the reaction, though we saw in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_36">page 36</a>) that the linear transition state for an intramolecular &#x2018;S<sub>N</sub>2&#x2019; reaction cannot be accommodated in a 6-ring. The difference is that even though a linear transition state (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>) may be preferred for radical substitution at H (to minimise steric and electrostatic interactions), the preference is not a strong one. The C&#x2013;H &#x03C3;-bonding orbital (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.6">Fig. 8.6</a>) is not as strictly directional along the axis at the H-end as a C&#x2013;C bond, because of the symmetry of the original hydrogen (ls-orbital) component.</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig8.6">
<img src="../images/fig_8.6.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 8.6</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">The 1, 5-hydrogen transfer is therefore rapid, and can take advantage of the usual advantage of an intramolecular reaction, because the non-linear transition state (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.7">Fig. 8.7</a>) can be accommodated without significant strain in a 6-membered ring. (1, 4-hydrogen transfers, which must go through 5-membered transition states, are much slower: presumably the transition state can tolerate only so much bending.)</p>

<h2 class="h2">8.3<span class="space">&#160;</span>Reactions involving diradicals</h2>
<p class="noindent">The reactions of diradicals, with two radical centres in the same molecule, are complicated by the problem of spin multiplicity - whether the two have paired or unpaired spins. If we ignore this complication the chemistry is very simple. The two radicals do their best to interact with each other, and the usual result is cyclisation by recombination.</p>
<p class="indent">1, 4-Diradicals are close enough to interact through bonds, and will fragment if the geometry is right. Since the orbitals involved are the same, albeit half occupied in two cases, the stereoelectronic requirements are the same as for ionic fragmentations (see above, <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#page_78">page 78</a>). The antiperiplanar geometry is preferred (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fig8.8">Fig. 8.8</a>)</p>
<figure class="fig" id="fig8.8">
<img src="../images/fig_8.8.jpg" alt="images"/>
<figcaption class="figurecaption"><b>Fig. 8.8</b> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">1, 3-Diradicals prefer to cyclise rather than to rearrange. They occur most commonly as intermediates in the addition of 1, 1-diradicals - triplet carbenes - to alkenes, and cyclisation is typically fast enough to be in competition with rotation about the new C&#x2013;C single bond (<b>8.6</b>), as shown by the loss of the alkene stereochemistry.</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/86_01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">One of the easiest ways of generating 1, 2-diradicals is by the photochemical activation of &#x03C0;-systems. When a photon of the right wavelength is absorbed an electron is promoted, usually from the HOMO, to a higher electronic energy level, most often the LUMO. The result is to break the bond concerned, since this puts an electron in the antibonding orbital, cancelling the effect of the remaining bonding electron. If a &#x03C3;-bond were involved two separate radicals would be produced, but in the case of a &#x03C0;-bond these are held together by the &#x03C3;-framework. The preferred geometry of the excited state of a simple alkene has the two half-filled orbitals perpendicular to each other (<b>8.7</b>), so the relaxation process can produce either cis or trans alkene. This is often the most convenient route to the other geometrical isomer.</p>

<p class="sidebar">The perpendicular orbitals in <b>8.7</b> are drawn for clarity as p-orbitals. They are of course &#x03C0; and &#x03C0;<sup>*</sup>.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The photochemistry of carbonyl compounds also involves diradicals, often of more than one sort. It is described in the following section.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec8.4" epub:type="chapter">
<h2 class="h2">8.4<span class="space">&#160;</span>Photochemistry of C=O compounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">The photochemical activation of a saturated ketone or aldehyde is of special stereoelectronic interest. The LUMO is <img src="../images/in50_01.jpg" alt="images"/>, as expected, but the HOMO is not &#x03C0;<sub>C=O</sub> but one of the lone pairs on the carbonyl oxygen. This has two interesting consequences. First, the resulting excitation (<img src="../images/in50_03.jpg" alt="images"/>) is formally forbidden, since the orbitals concerned are orthogonal, and the lone pairs lie in the node of the &#x03C0;-system. This has the effect in practice of making the absorption (near 330 nm) particularly inefficient. Nevertheless, excitation does happen.</p>
<p class="indent">The second effect follows from the first: once excitation has occurred the two radical centres behave - and in particular react - independently, because the two singly occupied orbitals are orthogonal (<b>8.8</b>).</p>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/87_02.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">Thus radical additions can be initiated either by the more electrophilic oxygen radical centre, interacting with the HOMO of an alkene (and going through the more stable 1, 4-diradical <b>8.9</b>); or by the carbon-centred radical, interacting with an alkene LUMO. In each case the product is a 4-membered ring, formed by way of the more stable 1, 4-diradical (<b>8.10</b> in the second case); but the direction of addition is controlled by the HOMO/LUMO interactions.</p>

<section id="sec8.4.1" epub:type="chapter">
<h3 class="h3"><b>Intramolecular reactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of an easy intermolecular reaction, photochemically excited C=O compounds undergo rapid intramolecular processes, which end up with the tworadical centres terminating each other. Two of these processes are of major importance, and both are initiated by the reactive oxygen radical centre.</p>
<p class="indent">The planar relationship of the unpaired electron on oxygen and the bonds at the carbon centre allows the eliminative cleavage of the (presumably) antiperiplanar C&#x2013;C bond (<b>8.11</b>). Further reactions include a second C&#x2013;C cleavage to produce CO, followed by recombination of the two alkyl radicals.</p>
<aside class="right" style="margin-top:-6.5em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar">Note that both processes described in this section, initiated by the sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridised radical centred on oxygen, happen also to the radical cations produced in electron-impact mass spectrometry.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="fig">
<img src="../images/88_01.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In competition with this &#x03B1;-cleavage is the rapid abstraction of a hydrogen atom, from any C&#x2013;H bond available at the correct distance (remember that a 6-membered cyclic transition state is required). This produces a 1, 4-diradical (<i>cf</i>. <b>8.9</b>), which can cyclise to form a cyclobutanol (<b>8.12</b>) or fragment if the overlap is favourable in an accessible conformation. This reaction produces two &#x03C0;-systems, one of them an enol (<b>8.13</b>). This rapidly ketonises, but can be observed directly under the right conditions.</p>
