<p class="noindent">Activation&#x2014;i.e. the attachment of a leaving group to the acyl carbon of the carboxy component, to enable attack by the amino group of the amino component&#x2014;is necessary because ordinary carboxylic acids simply form salts with amines at ambient temperature; the transformation of these salts directly into amides requires severe heating which is quite incompatible with the presence of other functional groups or any structural subtlety. Acidic catalysis, which is effective in bringing about the acylation of simple alcohols by carboxylic acids without the need for other activation, is of no help to direct amide formation because amines are basic, so their availability is diminished under acidic conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">There are three different ways of coupling along the lines of <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-1">Scheme 5.1</a>,	although the distinctions are blurred and the fundamental chemistry is universal: (a) those in which a reactive acylating agent is formed from the carboxy component in a separate step or steps, followed by immediate treatment with the amino component; (b) those in which an isolable acylating agent is formed separately, and may even be purified before aminolysis; and (c) those in which the acylating intermediate is generated in the presence of the amino component, by the addition of an activating agent to a mixture of the two components. The activation in (a), (b), and (c) is usually achieved by reaction of the carboxy component with an electrophilic reagent, either by addition (e.g. <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-2">Scheme 5.2</a>) <a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Chapter 05: Peptide bond formation</a>or by substitution (e.g. <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-3">Scheme 5.3</a>). It is often the case with type (c) procedures that the activation involves a cascade of acyl-transfer reactions, with more than one species a candidate for consideration as the activated intermediate which suffers aminolysis.

<p class="indent">Ideal chemistry would allow peptide bond formation to be carried out rapidly and quantitatively under mild conditions, avoiding side-reactions, without challenging the integrity of adjacent chiral centres, and generating only easily removed co-products; it would be applicable equally to the addition of one residue at a time (&#x2018;stepwise synthesis&#x2019;) and the conjunction of long sequences of amino acids (&#x2018;fragment condensation&#x2019;). Within the scope of <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-1">Scheme 5.1</a>, limited though it seems, the imagination of peptide methodologists has found many and diverse possibilities to explore. Scores of these have been shown to be feasible in simple exercises, but a rather small number have been regularly applied in real synthetic problems.

The reagents traditionally used for acyl chloride formation (thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, etc.) are, however, too vigorous to be compatible with complex or sensitive substrates and, furthermore, most simple acylamino acid chlorides cyclize spontaneously to give oxazolones and hence racemic peptides (see <a href="#sec_5.1.2.2">Section 5.1.2.2</a>). Z amino acid chlorides are isolable but unstable, decomposing to <i>N</i>-carboxyanhydrides on warming (path a): although they cyclize to give benzyloxyoxazolones under basic conditions (path b), optically active peptides can be isolated after reaction with amino esters, but these and all other kinds of acid chloride were for many years rarely used for peptide bond formation because so many more subtle methods were available. This position was altered dramatically by the discovery that Fmoc amino acid chlorides and also fluorides are easy to prepare, and are rather stable convenient intermediates (e.g. <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-6">Scheme 5.6</a>).

<p class="noindent">The use of acyl azides for peptide bond formation was introduced by Curtius a hundred years ago, but is still a significant procedure. The hydrazides from which the azides are generally made (their production from acyl chlorides is of no interest in the present context) may be obtained by hydrazinolysis of a protected amino acid or peptide ester, or by selective deprotection of a peptide derivative which has been constructed using a blocked hydrazide for carboxy-terminal protection. Conversion to the azide was usually achieved in the early days by adding <a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Chapter 05: Peptide bond formation</a>sodium nitrite to a solution of the hydrazide in a mixture of acetic and aqueous hydrochloric acids, at around or just below 0 &#x00B0;C. This works well in simple cases, but one of the procedures of Honzl and Rudinger (1961), the best of which involves dry acid and a nitrite ester in a dry organic solvent at a lower temperature, is now generally preferred. The azides are subjected to aminolysis without isolation or delay once formed. The essential chemistry of the approach is summarized in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-7">Scheme 5.7</a>.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Azide aminolysis can be sluggish: it is advantageous to run the procedure in the presence of HOCt (see <a href="#page_33">p. 33</a>), which leads to <i>in situ</i> formation of a more reactive active ester intermediate.</p>

<p class="indent">Numerous side-reactions attending the formation and use of peptide hydrazides and azides have been recognized, and the azide method has not been used routinely for building up peptide chains stepwise since cleaner methods became available in the 1950s, but it remained completely paramount as a technique for segment condensation until recently. This was partly due to the ways in which the conversions outlined in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-7">Scheme 5.7</a> lend themselves to the production of activated intermediates from protected peptides, but the main consideration was the fact that the coupling of acylpeptide azides was found to be free from racemization. In fact, for many years it appeared that racemization of acylpeptide azides never took place, and confidence in this was one of the cornerstones of peptide synthesis strategy. It is now known that the chiral integrity of acylpeptide azides is not unshakably secure; racemization does occur with excess base in polar solvents, and epimeric peptides have been isolated after fragment condensation by the azide method. Nevertheless, it does seem that the azide technique is less liable to result in racemization than most methods, and with careful control of conditions it can be kept at very low levels.</p>

In all cases, the primary activating event is addition of the carboxy group to the carbodiimide functionality to give an <i>O</i>-acylisourea (<b>6</b>), which is a potent acylating agent (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-17">Scheme 5.17</a>). Direct peptide coupling with DCCI is in principle very simple, involving mere mixing of the amino and carboxy components with DCCI in equimolecular amounts in an organic solvent, at ambient temperature or a little below. <i>O</i>-Acylisourea formation is rapid, leading to peptide either by immediate aminolysis or via a symmetrical anhydride, with the concomitant formation of dicyclohexylurea (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-18">Scheme 5.18</a>). Since the urea <a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Chapter 05: Peptide bond formation</a>is only sparingly soluble in most solvents, its separation from the desired product is very straightforward in solution synthesis.

But the intermediates shown in <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-18">Scheme 5.18</a> are highly reactive, and side reactions can intervene, especially if the amino component is dilatory. Extensive racemization takes place with susceptible carboxy components. Furthermore, the collapse of the <i>O</i>-acylisourea by intramolecular acyl transfer sometimes competes significantly with the desired attack by external nucleophiles. When this happens, the much less reactive <i>N</i>-acylurea <b>7</b> is formed; contrary to what was at one time supposed, this can also be formed by an intermolecular reaction between the urea and a symmetrical anhydride, especially in solvents like DMF. <i>N</i>-Acylurea formation not only reduces the yield, but may give rise to purification problems. This difficulty, and the danger of racemization, can both be greatly reduced by performing the coupling in the presence of a suitable &#x03B1;-nucleophile which is able to react very rapidly with the <i>O</i>-acylisourea before side-reactions can intervene. An acylating agent of lower potency is formed, which is still reactive with respect to aminolysis, but which is more discriminating and does not lead to racemization or other side-reactions. Numerous possible additives, which in effect generate an active ester <i>in situ</i>, have been investigated: <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide was the first, but 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (<b>8</b>,HOBt) has been the one most regularly used so far (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-19">Scheme 5.19</a>).

As the initial step is an anion-cation reaction, it is favoured in the less polar solvents, but any inert solvent may be used successfully, including DMF. The BOP reagent is a stable crystalline substance; it is applicable in both solid phase and classical solution work. The first serious threat to DCCI, it advanced rapidly in popularity, even for coupling acylpeptides, despite clear evidence that there was an unacceptable risk of racemization in that application. There was also a safety reservation about the BOP reagent, in that the co-product generated by its use is hexamethylphosphoramide, a highly toxic substance. For this reason numerous closely related phosphonium salts were developed, but these are in turn being pushed aside by reagents such as TBTU and HATU, which work similarly. These reagents are obtained by reaction of <b>8</b> or <b>9</b> respectively with the tetra- methylchloroformadinium cation <b>11</b> (generated by the action of phosgene or oxalyl chloride on tetramethylurea). At the outset, TBTU and HATU were formulated and named as uronium salts&#x2014;hence the U in the acronyms. These acronyms remain in use, despite the fact that it has been discovered that&#x2014;in the crystalline state at least&#x2014;both TBTU and HATU are actually guanidinium derivatives. In solution it may be that the two forms coexist: either could react with a carboxyl component to give an activated ester intermediate, so it makes no difference to the outcome. HATU seems to be the best reagent of the class, succeeding in difficult sterically hindered couplings and giving minimal levels of racemization when this is a danger (see Section 5.1.2 below). The use of HATU undoubtedly involves the formation of 7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl esters, which are of very high reactivity to amino groups, probably because of intramolecular general base catalysis as shown in structure 12.</p>

<p class="noindent">Attempts to use ester aminolysis (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-22">Scheme 5.22</a>) for peptide synthesis were first made in the very infancy of the subject, with little success. It was realized in the early 1950s that the reaction would be facilitated by use of better leaving groups, as in esters of phenols and other similarly acidic functionalities. In contrast to the familiar case of ester saponification, the aminolysis of phenyl esters in organic solvents proceeds with rate limitation by the collapse of the tetrahedral adduct, not its formation, so the leaving ability of the ester group is probably the most important consideration. Since those early days, a very large number of different &#x2018;active esters&#x2019; has been investigated, but only half a dozen or so types (e.g. 13-16) have been much used. Active esters are most commonly prepared</p>

The cleanliness of the reaction makes the active ester method, especially when <a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Chapter 05: Peptide bond formation</a>the more reactive types of ester are used, appropriate for repetitive classical regimes which dispense with isolation of intermediate peptides, as by-products accumulate slowly. The more reactive active esters are also valuable in solid phase synthesis. Less complete protection than is advisable with more reactive intermediates is often sufficient with an active ester. Although salt couplings, in which the amino component has a free carboxy group, can be performed by other preactivation techniques (but obviously not with direct coupling reagents), active esters give the best results with this device (e.g. <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sch5-25">Scheme 5.25</a>).

Choice is partly dictated by sheer reactivity, but the ease of co-product removal is also an important consideration. Thus for a water-insoluble protected peptide product, a succinimido ester coupling is especially convenient, because <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide is very water-soluble. But for a water-soluble product, a halophenyl ester may be best, because halophenols are ether-soluble.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider the synthesis of an all-L peptide comprising <i>n</i> chiral residues, from optically pure &#x03B1;-amino acids. If the operations needed for the incorporation of each residue result in conversion of a small fraction <i>f</i> of each residue to the D-form, and the epimers are carried through without separation, then the end product will consist of the required all-L peptide and a blend of other peptides in approximate proportions (1 &#x2013;<i>fn</i>): <i>fn.</i> For a synthesis of a 50-residue peptide in which 1&#x0025; D-residue formation takes place at each stage, only half the final product will have the required all-L stereochemistry.

Inessential exposure to strong bases is clearly to be avoided, but the best way of responding to the other factors is not so obvious, because what matters is not the rate of racemization <i>per se</i>, but the balance between the rates of racemization and coupling, and this is much more difficult to make reliable generalizations about.
