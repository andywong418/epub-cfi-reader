<p class="noindent">Hundreds of peptides and proteins have been synthesized by the so-called &#x2018;classical&#x2019; solution approach to peptide synthesis. The flexibility of the approach makes it impossible to convey its full scope with a few examples, and we must content ourselves with three historically important and spectacular successes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Oxytocin (<b>1</b>) is involved in the control of uterine contraction during labour, and of milk release afterwards. It was the first peptide hormone to be synthesized, by du Vigneaud and his collaborators, who reported in 1953, but the methods employed are largely of historical interest only. A later, improved, synthesis by du Vigneaud with Bodanszky is much nearer to present-day practice in both strategy and tactics (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sch8-1">Scheme 8.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Oxytocin and its close relative vasopressin have both been subjected to exhaustive structure-activity studies, during the course of which hundreds of synthetic analogues have been synthesized. As an example of an entirely different approach, consider the synthesis of the biologically active [7-(azetidine-2-carboxylic acid)]-analogue (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sch8-2">Scheme 8.2</a>).

</figure>
<p class="noindent">The gastrins are peptide hormones which can be isolated from the antral region of the stomach. They stimulate gastric secretion. In most mammals there are at least three forms, which are derived from a common precursor, in circulation; these forms may or may not be sulphated at tyrosine, and there are species variations, so there are many gastrins. We shall take the first Liverpool synthesis of porcine gastrin I <b>(2)</b> <a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Chapter 08: Solution peptide synthesis</a>as our example. A fragment condensation strategy was adopted, with three main fragments of comparable size, which were chosen to exclude methionine from the central fragment, and thus permit the employment of hydrogenolysis in its preparation. Fragment conjunction was performed at such points or by such methods as the racemization rules dictated. The strategy used enabled biological testing to be carried out on partial sequences, and led rapidly to the important conclusion that the essential features for activity were all contained in the <i>C</i>-terminal tetrapeptide. The synthesis, which is shown in Schemes 8.3&#x2013;8.6, was not without snags, but it set the style for many others, both at Liverpool and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="noindent">only one of 12 possible ways in which the A and B chains can combine, and there are also 4 possibilities for the formation of internally bridged single chains; for A&#x2013;A and B&#x2013;B combinations (48 and 2 respectively); and innumerable products comprising more than two chains. Chinese scientists nevertheless managed to define conditions which allowed them to isolate essentially pure crystalline insulin. Their synthesis was not, however, a controlled synthesis, which was only achieved (for the human hormone this time) after methods for the stepwise formation of disulphide bonds had been developed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Nature does not have this problem, because <i>in vivo</i> insulin is derived from proinsulin, a single chain precursor in which the A and B sequences are linked by a connecting peptide. Proinsulin spontaneously adopts a conformation in which the disulphide links form correctly, after which enzymic excision of the connecting peptide gives insulin.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">The first completely controlled total synthesis of human insulin is sketched in broad outline in Schemes 8.8&#x2013;8.10: its key features are the selective removal of a trityl group in the presence of Bpoc and other acid- labile groups (a nearly maximal protection approach was adopted, with all hydroxy, amino, and carboxy groups blocked by <i>t</i>-butanol-derived protection; histidine, arginine, and amide side-chains were unprotected); <a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Chapter 08: Solution peptide synthesis</a>the use of the sulphenyl thiocarbonate method to make the unsymmetrical two-chain disulphide starting material; and the selective formation of a disulphide bridge between two Cys(Trt) residues in the presence of Cys(Acm), leaving the latter free for the separate, final disulphide ring closure.</p>

<p class="indent">The human insulin used clinically is not manufactured by this route, however: most of it (several tons a year) is made by recombinant DNA technology, and the balance is produced by enzymatic modification of the porcine hormone.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases of insulin and ribonuclease are not limiting cases, either in terms of size or complexity, but the many protein syntheses achieved in more recent years have mostly employed strategies in which solid phase techniques (see next chapter) are used to reach oligopeptide intermediates which are then assembled in homogenous solution (as for GFP, see final chapter), either by analogy with the methods exemplified in this chapter, or by ligation procedures.</p>
