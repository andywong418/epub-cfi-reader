<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">The last four chapters have presented a summary catalogue of the principal methods by which the various individual reactions and stages of a peptide synthesis may be carried out. It is now necessary to consider how a coherent plan can be drawn up, and the appropriate methods chosen, for a synthesis of many stages.</p>
<p class="indent">If we focus on peptide bond formation, and ignore all the other synthetic niceties, we see that a tripeptide can in principle be assembled from amino acids by two strategies, which we will call the [1 &#x002B; (2 &#x002B; 3)] strategy and the [(1 &#x002B; 2) &#x002B; 3] strategy (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-1">Scheme 7.1</a>). These are both</p>

<p class="noindent">&#x2018;stepwise elongation&#x2019; strategies, in which we start with one residue and add the others one at a time. For a tetrapeptide, however, there are five strategies, of which four are similarly stepwise, but one of which is &#x2018;convergent&#x2019;, in that the amino acids are first joined into dipeptide fragments, and these are then condensed together. <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-2">Scheme 7.2</a> shows one</p>
<figure class="fig1">
<img src="../images/pg_57_2.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
<p class="caption" id="sch7-2"><b>Scheme 7.2.</b> The three other stepwise approaches not shown are &#x007B;[(1 &#x002B; 2) &#x002B; 3] &#x002B; 4&#x007D;, &#x007B;[1 &#x002B; (2 &#x002B; 3)] &#x002B; 4&#x007D;, and &#x007B;1 &#x002B;[(2 &#x002B;3)&#x002B;4]&#x007D;.</p>
<p class="noindent">of the stepwise strategies and the convergent alternative. The verdict of the arithmetic demon on their relative merits is instructive. If there is an 80&#x0025; yield at each stage, then the &#x007B;1 &#x002B; [2 &#x002B; (3 &#x002B; 4)]&#x007D; stepwise elongation <a id="page_54" class="page">Page 54, Chapter 07: Strategy and tactics</a>synthesis will give an overall yield based on residue 4 of 52&#x0025;, but the convergent fragment condensation strategy will give 64&#x0025;.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar calculations on more extended syntheses argue even more strongly in favour of the &#x2018;fragment condensation&#x2019; approach. The same approach has, in the abstract, two further advantages over the &#x2018;stepwise&#x2019; approach. Firstly, if small fragments are combined to make one which is larger, the differences between the desired product and everything else ought to facilitate its isolation, whereas the addition of residues one at a time would result only in progressive small changes in chemical character and molecular size, with consequently greater isolation and purification problems. Secondly, in a fragment condensation approach, personnel can be assigned each to their fragments to work simultaneously in parallel, but the obstacles of a stepwise synthesis must be negotiated sequentially. There is also an attraction, for certain kinds of programme, in the scope a fragment condensation strategy offers for producing a set of related analogues with variable sequences in one region.</p>
<p class="indent">But there are contrary considerations. Fragment condensation is better performed at some positions than others, so it is a constrained strategy, and its protective group tactics are in general more complicated than those of a stepwise synthesis strategy from the carboxy end, which is the preferred stepwise approach.</p>
<p class="indent">For a classical &#x2018;solution synthesis&#x2019;, the optimum approach is usually stepwise synthesis of fragments for assembly in an overall convergent strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">The principal strategic constraint is the desirability of proceeding in such a way as to minimize the risk of racemization throughout. There is no real risk except at the activated amino acid residue during the activation and peptide bond formation stages. Furthermore, if the azide or DCCI/HOBt procedures are used, racemization is usually slight, with small peptides at least; and if the carboxy component is an alkoxycar- bonyl, trityl, or Nps amino acid, or an acyl peptide with <i>C</i>-terminal proline, racemization is hardly ever significant, whatever the coupling procedure; if the carboxy component is an acylpeptidylglycine, then the activated residue has no chirality to be concerned about. The situation is summarized in Table 7.1. It is clear that, from a racemization point of view, the only acceptable strategies are those in which as many as possible of the peptide bonds in the target are formed as in column A, with the rest being formed as in column <b>B</b>. Even strict adherence to these rules gives no guarantee with fragment condensations, but the traditional view that any racemization would be a disaster without remedy is somewhat belied by the fact that there have been cases where epimeric peptide contaminants arising from azide or DCCI/additive fragment condensations have been separated by countercurrent distribution, a most powerful technique. Advances in separation technology are taking place all the time, and it may be that the traditional view was unduly pessimistic, but it will clearly always be desirable to plan on the basis of minimizing the danger of racemization.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not possible to generalize to any great extent about strategic decision-making. There are too many variables. The scale, complexity, and composition of the target, and also the context in which the target is set, all have to be reckoned with. Di- and tri-peptides can only be made, and tetrapeptides are perhaps best made, by stepwise synthesis. Completely stepwise solution synthesis has been taken beyond twenty residues (e.g. porcine secretin, 27 residues) but from, say, five or six residues upwards, a fragment condensation strategy or (to an increasingly dominant degree) a stepwise solid phase synthesis (see later) is now more likely to be favoured. The number and distribution of glycine and proline residues are important determinants in the detailed design of a fragment condensation strategy, and if there are disulphide bridges the way in which these are to be constructed must usually be considered first and the rest of the synthesis planned around them. If there is a problem-child (Met or Trp in particular) in the target, it will be preferable to introduce it late in the synthesis. It is also prudent to maintain flexibility where possible, so that if it happens that the first chosen order of fragment assembly fails, then a different order of assembly of the same fragments can be tried. Thus the attempted conjunction of four fragments A, B, C, and D by &#x007B;[A &#x002B; (B &#x002B; C)] &#x002B; D&#x007D; or &#x007B;A &#x002B; [(B &#x002B; C) &#x002B; D]&#x007D; strategies would be unsatisfactory if the BC intermediate proved unreactive or insoluble. In such a case a strategic switch to [(A &#x002B; B) &#x002B; (C &#x002B; D)] or <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, Chapter 07: Strategy and tactics</a>&#x007B;[(A &#x002B; B) &#x002B; C] &#x002B; D&#x007D;, by avoiding the troublesome intermediate, might nevertheless succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">And now to protective group tactics. Consider the relatively trivial target GlyLysGly, which is best approached with the stepwise strategy outlined in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-3">Scheme 7.3</a>. The minimum requirement for this to be</p>

</figure>
<p class="caption" id="sch7-3"><b>Scheme 7.3.</b> Conditions: i, coupling; ii, selective deprotection; iii, complete simultaneous deprotection.</p>
<p class="noindent">workable is that the protecting group P<sup>2</sup> must be orthogonal to the protecting groups P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>3</sup>. P<sup>2</sup> is termed a &#x2018;temporary&#x2019; protecting group, because it is only in position for a brief phase of the synthesis; P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>3</sup> are called &#x2018;permanent&#x2019; protecting groups because they accompany the residue they protect from its incorporation until the final deprotection. There are many ways of satisfying the orthogonality requirement. <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-3">Scheme 7.3</a> illustrates the four most important tactical approaches using well-tried protecting groups (Table 7.2), which can by extension of the same principles be used for more complicated examples. But not all tactics are applicable all the time. Tactics A and B(b), for example, would generally be precluded by the presence of methionine or cysteine in the target.</p>
<p class="indent">The discussion has so far been framed in solution synthesis terms, but is equally relevant to the solid phase technique (see later): <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-3">Scheme 7.3</a> represents a solid phase synthesis if P<sup>1</sup> is the resin carrier, which can be regarded as the <i>C</i>-terminal permanent protecting group, and tactics B(a) and D are in fact the tactics of the Merrifield and Sheppard methods of solid phase synthesis respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">The tactical issues are a little more complex in fragment condensation strategies. In general such strategies require, <i>inter alia</i>, the stepwise preparation of a number of peptide acids or activatable derivatives with differential protection which enables further elaboration from the amino terminal after fragment condensation. The necessary intermediates may be reached by salt couplings, or through fully protected peptides&#x2014;which must then have two orthogonal types of temporary protection, as well as permanent protection for the side-chains which is orthogonal to both types of temporary protection. Suppose, by way of illustration, that a <a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, Chapter 07: Strategy and tactics</a>chosen strategy calls for a Lys(Boc)Lys(Boc) dipeptide fragment to be inserted between two other fragments, to make a structure &#x2014;COLys(Boc)Lys(Boc)NH&#x2014;. The salt coupling stratagem might be employed here, as in <a href="Chapter07.xhtml#sch7-4">Scheme 7.4</a>, or methyl ester protection could be used</p>

<p class="noindent">as in Schemes 7.5 or 7.6. The reader should by now be able to see several other variations too.</p>
<p class="indent">A tactical decision which has so far not been faced in this chapter is whether or not to protect side-chains at all in those cases where it can be regarded as optional (Met, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Arg, Asn, Gln, Trp; in some situations also Asp and Glu). Minimal protection has the attractions of using simpler (hence cheaper) amino acid derivatives as starting materials, and offering fewer opportunities for side-reactions at the final deprotection stage. On the other hand, solubility in organic solvents may become a problem with large numbers of unblocked polar groups, and in repetitive syntheses where there is no purification of intermediates&#x2014;solid phase methods in particular&#x2014;the consequences of minor side-reactions can accumulate and become serious. With Met there is uncertainty about whether or not it is advantageous to protect the side-chain, but with all other side-chains maximal protection is current practice.</p>
<p class="indent">Other things being equal, the best tactical approach for any synthesis will be that for which the final complete deprotection is performed in a single operation, under the mildest possible and most reliable conditions. Acidolysis (unlike catalytic hydrogenolysis, which can be confounded unpredictably by catalyst poisoning, precipitation of partially deprotected material, and inordinate slowness) rarely fails to proceed according to the rulebook. Side-reactions attributable to electrophilic species generated by the cleavage are a problem, but there <a id="page_59" class="page">Page 59, Chapter 07: Strategy and tactics</a>have been very through studies which give a partly rational and partly empirical basis for minimizing such difficulties by the addition of scavengers. Tactics A, C, and D are therefore generally preferable to tactics B.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Exercises</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before proceeding to the next chapter, readers might well with advantage consider how the principles outlined in this chapter could be applied to the synthesis of the following.</p>
<p class="indent">ProLeuGlyNH2</p>
<p class="indent">GlyProTrpMetOMe</p>
<p class="indent">BocTrpMetAspPheNH2</p>
<p class="noindent">One solution for each case can be found in the section on porcine gastrin I (<a href="Chapter08.xhtml#sec_8.2.2">Section 8.2.2</a>), but there are many possibilities.</p>
<p class="indent">No attempt is being made in this Primer to cover the synthesis of cyclopeptide structures, in which terminal or side-chain amino and carboxy groups form peptide or side-chain amide links respectively. Such structures occur in diverse important natural products, and are also important in drug design. The principles and reagents involved in their synthesis are the same as for linear peptides, with two special twists. Firstly, it is necessary to manouevre so that only one amino group and only one carboxy group can be exposed at the same time in a late linear intermediate, which imposes constraints on protecting group strategy. And secondly, it is usually necessary to perform the cyclization by coupling the amino and carboxy groups of the late linear intermediate under high dilution conditions, to favour intramolecular cyclization over intermolecular oligomerization. This is a general principle in the formation of macrocycles, unless there is assistance to cyclization by interaction with a template, or fortuitous conformational effects operate. With these considerations in mind, devise a reasonable synthesis of the following, in which the pentapeptide AlaLysGlyGluAla is cyclized with a peptide bond between its terminal groups and an amide bridge between its functional side-chains.</p>
