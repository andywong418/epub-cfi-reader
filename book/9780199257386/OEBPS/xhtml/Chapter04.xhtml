<h1 class="main">4<span class="space">&#160;</span><i>&#x03B1;</i>-Carboxy protection</h1>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">With respect to acylation, the amino groups of amino acids and peptides are considerably more nucleophilic than their carboxy groups are. It follows that amino acids and peptides with unprotected carboxy groups can be used for peptide bond formation, if separately preactivated carboxy components are employed. Many reactions of this kind have been carried out successfully, but a policy of maximal protection is often adopted even when it is not strictly essential, because of solubility advantages, product isolation, and so forth. If they are to be unambiguous, procedures where the carboxy component is activated in the presence of the amino component absolutely require the carboxy group of the latter to be selectively blocked. The usual means of carboxy protection is esterification; the parent carboxylic acid can be regenerated from the esters by acyl-oxygen or alkyl-oxygen fission. The fundamental alkyl-oxygen cleavage chemistry is qualitatively the same as for alkoxycarboxyl groups (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.1">Section 3.1</a>), which are of course esters of a special kind.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.1.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Methyl and ethyl esters</h3>
<p class="noindent">There is no significant distinction to be drawn between methyl and ethyl esters, and the remarks to be made about the former apply more or less equally to the latter.</p>
<p class="indent">Amino acids react easily with hot methanolic hydrogen chloride, to give the corresponding methyl ester hydrochlorides, usually as stable crystalline materials. Treatment with thionyl chloride and methanol is a convenient alternative procedure. The hydrochlorides can be neutralized to give the corresponding free bases, which are distillable liquids in some cases, but which deteriorate quite rapidly at room temperature. The free base forms are therefore generated from the hydrochlorides by neutralization <i>in situ</i> when required, normally with a tertiary amino such as triethylamine.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">The decomposition of &#x03B1;-amino esters involves self-aminolysis; diketopiperazines are the main products (cf. <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sch4-1">Scheme 4.1</a>).</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Methyl esters provide good carboxy-protection, and survive well not only most peptide bond forming procedures, but also most deprotective operations. They are not affected at ambient temperature by HBr/AcOH, TFA, catalytic hydrogenolysis conditions, thiols, or amines in organic solvents, so the selective removal of amino-protecting groups from peptide methyl ester derivatives presents no difficulty. The peptide methyl esters are usually isolated as salts, or carried forward immediately. Problems are sometimes encountered at the dipeptide stage, because dipeptide methyl ester free bases cyclize to diketopiperazines (DKPs) rather easily (<a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sch4-1">Scheme 4.1</a>), but methyl esters are otherwise stable and <a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Chapter 04: &#x03B1;-Carboxy protection</a>trouble-free protecting groups <i>en route.</i> The trouble is that they are a little too stable, and their ultimate deprotection calls for rather vigorous treatment. Saponification is sometimes satisfactory, but even when it is carried out under carefully controlled optimized conditions, alkali may cause racemization and other side-reactions, such as hydantoin formation (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sch3-3">Scheme 3.3</a>). Hydrazinolysis is an attractive alternative when further elaboration of the protected carboxy group is to be carried out, because the hydrazide produced can be used directly in an azide coupling (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.1.1.2">Section 5.1.1.2</a>), but hydrazinolysis is not an entirely reliable procedure with peptides of any complexity either.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.1.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>Benzyl esters</h3>
<p class="noindent">Amino acid benzyl esters are best prepared by 4-toluenesulphonic acid- catalysed esterification with benzyl alcohol, driven by azeotropic removal of water in a Dean and Stark apparatus. They are isolated as their 4-toluenesulphonate salts. The corresponding free bases are, like amino acid methyl esters, unstable, and free base dipeptide benzyl esters are prone to DKP formation. Benzyl ester groups are cleaved by saponification and by hydrazinolysis. More importantly, they are cleaved by HBr/AcOH, HF, and by catalytic hydrogenolysis, but not by TFA. Their response to acidic media is similar to that of the Z group, with a slightly lower sensitivity, and the remarks about the mechanism, side-reactions, and substituent effects made in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a> apply here also.</p>

<p class="noindent">and benzyl esters, amino acid <i>t</i>-butyl esters are stable in the free base form, because the <i>t</i>-butyl ester function is very inert to nucleophilic and basic attack, unless there are especially favourable possibilities for intramolecular nucleophilic attack, that is: aspartimides may be formed even from <i>t</i>-butyl esters (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.3">Section 6.3</a>), although DKPs are not easily formed from dipeptide <i>t</i>-butyl esters.</p>

<p class="indent">The stability and lability of <i>t</i>-butyl esters generally parallel, as would be expected, the properties of the Boc group. As with benzyl esters versus <a id="page_24" class="page">Page 24, Chapter 04: &#x03B1;-Carboxy protection</a>Z groups, <i>t</i>-butyl esters are slightly less sensitive to acidolysis than Boc groups. The standard TFA treatment cleaves all protecting groups based on <i>t</i>-butanol, but, by using carefully controlled exposure to milder conditions, it is in some cases just possible to differentiate between a <i>t</i>-butyl ester and a Boc group, and to cleave only the latter. The difference, which is probably to be ascribed to the easier protonation of the carbamate functionality, is not, however, sufficient to be the basis of a routine procedure.</p>

<p class="noindent">Phenyl ester carboxy-protection was devised in response to the need for smooth carboxy-deprotection in the presence of acid-sensitive groups. Phenyl ester salts are easily prepared (e.g. <a href="Chapter04.xhtml#sch4-3">Scheme 4.3</a>), and are usually</p>

<p class="noindent">rather nicely crystalline materials. The group is compatible with standard coupling and isolation routines: it is completely stable to acidic media as well as to catalytic hydrogenolysis conditions. Alkali causes cleavage more rapidly than with methyl esters, but it is the extraordinary susceptibility of phenyl esters to attack by peroxide ion (a so-called &#x03B1;-effect nucleophile) which makes this method attractive. Treatment with an equivalent amount of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous DMF, at an apparent pH of 10.5 for 15 minutes, suffices for quantitative cleavage. At this pH, the problems associated with normal saponification are not observed. The cleavage no doubt generates the corresponding peracid first, but peracids are, especially when &#x03B1;-electron-withdrawing groups are present, unstable in alkaline solution, so it is the carboxylic acid which is isolated. Peroxide-sensitive residues (Met, Trp, Cys) apparently present no great problem if the deprotection is run in the presence of excess dimethyl sulphide.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-14em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">It is found that nucleophiles with an electronegative atom having a free electron pair next to the nucleophilic atom show enhanced nucleophilic reactivity versus acyl carbon. This is the &#x2018;&#x03B1;-effect&#x2019;, but it is doubtful whether it can be ascribed to a single factor (polarizability and relatively low steric hindrance are probably significant). Hydrazine also shows enhanced nucleophilic reactivity in acyl transfer reactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3">4.1.5<span class="space">&#160;</span>Phenacyl esters</h3>
<p class="noindent">Carboxy-protection by phenacyl ester (&#x2013;CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COPh,&#x2013;CO<sub>2</sub>Pac) formation is simply achieved by reaction of carboxylate groups with phenacyl bromide, BrCH<sub>2</sub>COPh. The protecting group has some complications associated with the fact that a ketonic carbonyl group is present, but has the advantage of stability in dry acidic conditions, combined with removability by zinc-acetic acid, making it orthogonal to protecting groups based on <i>t</i>-butanol or benzyl alcohol. It is not a universally fashionable protecting group, but is favoured in Japan&#x2014;for an awe-inspiring example see the final chapter.</p>
