<p class="noindent">Proteins are natural polymers which are assembled under nucleic acid control from a menu comprising L-<i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino acids of general structure 1 and the &#x2018;imino&#x2019; acid L-proline (2): see Table 1.1. Amide or &#x2018;peptide&#x2019;</p>

<p class="noindent2">Some specialized proteins contain residues which are not in theTable. Several involved in blood clotting and calcium metabolism, for example, contain <i>&#x03B3;</i>-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues, with R &#x003D; &#x2013;CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>, which bind Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> tightly. As with most &#x2018;unusual&#x2019; amino acids found in proteins, the unusual feature is introduced after backbone assembly from &#x2018;normal&#x2019; proteinogenic amino acids. But at least one rare protein amino acid, selenocysteine, is incorporated as such under nucleic acid control.</p>

Proteins may be acidic, basic, or neutral. They may be globular and soluble, or fibrous and insoluble. Their molecular weights span a range which extends from a few thousand to several million. They are present in abundance and diversity in every part of every living on Earth. Their indispensability was recognized long before anything about them could be understood in present-day terms, and is the origin of the name &#x2018;protein&#x2019;, which is derived from the Greek <i>&#x03C0;&#x03C1;?&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;?&#x03C3;</i>, ranked first.</p>
<p class="indent">Peptides are molecules constructed in essentially the same way as proteins, but on a smaller scale. The terms &#x2018;peptide&#x2019; and &#x2018;protein&#x2019; are used very inconsistently in the literature of the subject. &#x2018;Protein&#x2019; is appropriate in current usage for any macromolecule incorporating more than about fifty of the usual <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino residues assembled under nucleic-acid direction, or for a close synthetic analogue. The classification &#x2018;peptide&#x2019; is suitable for molecules with fewer amino acid residues than this, whatever the amino acids and however produced, even if there is extensive modification after assembly of the residues by peptide bond formation. A prefix is often applied to indicate the number of residues&#x2014; e.g. tripeptide, three residues. <a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Chapter 01: Introduction</a></p>
<p class="indent">The full structural formula of vasopressin <b>(4),</b> a pituitary nonapeptide which was one of the first of the peptide hormones to be synthesized (1954), and which is, from today&#x2019;s vantage point, a very simple example, is too complex to be taken in at a glance. A system of highly abbreviated formulae has been developed to present such structures. In this system, each amino acid has a three-letter code, derived from its trivial name. A one-letter code has also been agreed for the proteinogenic amino acids (i.e. those found in proteins), but it is more useful in connection with amino acid sequence data than for peptide syntheses. The simplification which can be achieved with the three-letter code is well illustrated by comparison of the full <b>(4)</b> and abbreviated <b>(5)</b> formulae for vasopressin. Together with cryptic symbols for substituents, the three-letter codes can be used to formulate any amino acid or peptide derivative, including synthetic intermediates. An International Commission has recommended detailed conventions which are, with minor aberrations, universally observed. Their system, which will be used throughout this book, is outlined in <a href="Appendix_A.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, along with lists of amino acid codes and substituent symbols. Fluency with the system will be assumed, and readers are advised to study <a href="Appendix_A.xhtml">Appendix A</a> before going further. The abbreviations used for common reagents and solvents are also defined there.</p>

<p class="indent">Catalytic proteins&#x2014;enzymes&#x2014;mediate practically all the operations in the molecular business of biology. Biochemical balance is also regulated by hormones, the majority of which are proteins or peptides. Membranes contain proteins which control permeability, and help to pump solutes through against thermodynamic gradients. Many neuroactive peptides and proteins with complex interrelationships have been identified in the brain. Selectively toxic peptides and proteins are deployed by many species, either for defence against predators, or in aggressive competition for limited nutrient resources. The venoms of snakes, bees, and wasps, for example, are evil cocktails of this sort; the lethal bacterial toxin responsible for botulism is a protein of high molecular weight; the principal poisonous constituents of the notorious toadstool <i>Amanita phalloides</i> are complex cyclic peptides; and antibiotics such as penicillin are, though modified almost beyond recognition as such, nevertheless peptides of a kind. The toxic peptides of bacteria and fungi are of special chemical interest because they are structurally very varied, incorporating D- as well as L-configurations, and amino acids which are often quite different from those of proteins. Carrier proteins transport smaller molecules from one location to another. Haemoglobin, loading and unloading oxygen as required, is a familiar example. Skin, bone, hair, horn, tendon, muscle, feather, tooth, and nail are all largely proteinaceous, as are spider&#x2019;s webs, larval cocoons, and antarctic fish antifreeze agents. The immune system, with which animals defend themselves against invasive parasites, employs proteins to recognize and reject foreign molecules, exercising exquisitely precise discrimination between self and not-self. Even genetics requires proteins, because although the genetic information is encoded in nucleic acid structures, the DNA is highly organized in compact association with basic proteins called <a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Chapter 01: Introduction</a>
histones, and an array of other proteins is necessary for genetic expression and control. Furthermore, the genes dictate only protein amino acid sequences. These determine three-dimensional structure, from which all else flows. All the data necessary to specify that an organism will have the form and characteristics of an orchid, an oryx, or an orangutan is written in the amino acid sequences of its proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent2">That the 3D (tertiary) structure of a protein is determined by the amino acid sequence (primary structure) of the protein or a precursor is well proven (see Section 9.2.2.2), but it is not yet possible to predict tertiary structures from sequence data.</p>

<p class="indent">It follows that there are few aspects of biology which cannot be illuminated by experiments using peptides or proteins. Nor is the interest merely academic, for peptides and peptide-related structures can influence endocrine, neurological, immune, and enzymic processes with high specificity and prodigious potency. They therefore have varied applications or potential in medicine: in the regulation of fertility; the control of pain; the stimulation of growth; the therapy of cancer, cardiovascular problems, connective tissue diseases, digestive disorders, mental illness, and infections by pathogens. Several peptide drugs are in widespread clinical use, necessitating their manufacture by the kilo, and are big business. Such drugs all ultimately depend on the selective activation or inhibition of an existing part of the biochemical apparatus, by the specific recognition of, and interaction with, natural receptors or active sites&#x2014;a universal theme of peptide and protein biochemistry. Then there is the prospect of synthetic peptide vaccines. If the immunologically significant parts of a protein can be mapped, then in principle they can be mimicked in a synthetic peptide vaccine, which can be used to immunize against the agent they belong to. This strategy, avoiding as it would the hazards and limitations of making and using vaccines in the traditional way, has already been shown to be feasible, and seems certain to become very important. And now it also begins to be possible to conceive a fundamentally new kind of approach to peptide and protein applications. Much remains to be discovered about the relationship between amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure, and function, but an unrestrained imagination can look forward to the time when the chemist will be able to design and construct entirely unnatural peptides and proteins with predetermined novel properties.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-20em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">Examples of synthetic peptide drugs include Synacthen&#x00AE; (an adrenocorticotrophin fragment, for the therapy of rheumatic diseases, bronchial asthma, allergic disorders, skin conditions, etc); DDAVP&#x00AE; (a vasopressin analogue, for the treatment of <i>diabetes insipidus</i>); Sandimmun&#x00AE; (cyclosporin A, a cyclic peptide immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation); Calsynar&#x00AE; (salmon calcitonin, for the assessment and management of hypercalcaemia, Paget&#x2019;s disease, bone cancer, etc); and Zoladex&#x00AE; (an analogue of LH-RH, luteinising hormone releasing hormone, for the treatment of prostate cancer and endometriosis). Zoladex sales alone are variously estimated at &#x00A3;300 to &#x00A3;500 million a year. See the review by Loffet, details in <a href="Appendix_B.xhtml">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The demand for peptides and proteins is thus enormous, and rising all the time. Natural sources can provide a great variety, sometimes freely and in quantity, but the range is limited to what happens to be there, and more often than not only miniscule amounts can be isolated. The manipulation of biological systems by genetic engineering is an increasingly sophisticated art, and will no doubt become the principal means of manufacture for many natural and unnatural amino acid sequences. For example, insulin, a mini-protein of two chains and about fifty amino acid residues, which is essential for the treatment of <i>diabetes mellitus</i>, was formerly obtained from beef or pig pancreatic tissue. Because insulins from these sources are not quite identical with human insulin, some patients become sensitized against what are, to their systems, foreign substances. The obvious solution is to administer the human hormone. This demand could never adequately be met from natural sources, but most of the human insulin needed is now being prepared commercially by recombinant DNA technology. Several other <a id="page_5" class="page">Page 5, Chapter 01: Introduction</a>important peptides are being produced in the same way. However, each such instance requires developmental work, and the approach is at present restricted in the face of structural novelty. Chemical synthesis, on the other hand, is in principle applicable to any target. Since medicinal chemists commonly turn to unnatural analogues in search of metabolic stability, and the screening of large numbers of variants is generally necessary in the development of a new drug, chemical peptide synthesis is likely to remain an essential tool for the forseeable future. It can be estimated that over five thousand people are engaged full-time in such work worldwide at the present time.</p>
<p class="indent">The aim of this book is to outline the principal chemical methods which are available for the synthesis of &#x03B1;-amino acids and peptides. Ruthless selectivity will be necessary, and there will be no space at all for technical matters (a deficiency greatly regretted, for this is a field in which the advances of the last four decades have been dependent on technology as well as chemistry). Similarly, even a rudimentary coverage of principles will leave little room for real examples. The subject and the molecules it has tackled with success are just too big. Furthermore, we cannot in the space available stray far from the proteinogenic amino acids and &#x2018;ordinary&#x2019; peptides, although the synthesis of peptides containing other amino acids and non-protein structural features is of very great importance.</p>

<p class="noindent2">The synthesis of &#x2018;peptidomimetic&#x2019; drug candidates, which have overall functionality and shape related to peptide leads, but metabolically stable non-peptide backbones, is a diverse and important field, but is beyond our scope.</p>

<p class="noindent">proteinogenic amino acids all interfere with the reactions available for peptide bond formation to some degree, and usually require protection orthogonal to at least one of the <i>&#x03B1;</i>-function protection methods chosen, which limits choice and adds to the number of operations. An alternative <a id="page_7" class="page">Page 7, Chapter 01: Introduction</a>approach is to separate the carboxy activation and coupling stages. In this case, the amino component may be attached by a &#x2018;salt coupling&#x2019;, without the need to protect its carboxy group, provided exchange of activation between the free and activated carboxy groups does not intervene (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sch1-5">Scheme 1.5</a>). This strategem reduces the number of protecting</p>

<p class="noindent">group manipulations, but introduces an extra operation at the coupling stage, and may be disadvantageous for other reasons such as solubility.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, all the transformations in a peptide synthesis must needs be performed without loss of stereochemical integrity at any of the chiral centres, if a product free of very similar, and possibly inseparable, diastereoisomeric contaminants is to be obtained. Lastly, the final removal of all the protecting groups must be carried out without destruction of the peptide backbone or other side-reactions. All of which makes the unambigious synthesis of large peptides sound unattainable. In practice things are not quite as bad as this. To start with, although unusual amino acids may have to be synthesized (<a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) and appropriately derivatized (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapters 3</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">5</a>) before peptide synthesis can begin, the requisite derivatives of all the standard amino acids, protected and ready for incorporation, are commercially available. And the methodology of the subject has now been finely tuned, automated synthetic techniques have been developed, and modern purification technology can in fact cope with very complex mixtures.</p>
<p class="indent">It is convenient to discuss the chemistry and merits of the main kinds of protection and of the reactions available for peptide bond formation in turn (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapters 3</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">6</a>), but it must be understood that no rigid rules can be laid down prescribing the best weapons or plan of attack for any particular synthesis. The protecting groups and coupling procedures must be able to work together without conflict, and the overall strategy and orchestration (<a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapters 7</a>&#x2013;<a href="Chapter09.xhtml">9</a>) require judicious planning just as much as the individual steps call for care in the selection of the optimal methods.</p>
