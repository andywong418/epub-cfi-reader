<p class="noindent">The beautifully simple idea of solid phase peptide synthesis was first detailed by Merrified in 1963, in a publication which, unusually for an important modern scientific paper, bore his name as sole author. The principle is outlined in <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-1">Scheme 9.1</a>. The term &#x2018;solid phase&#x2019; is actually</p>

Every facet of every stage of <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-1">Scheme 9.1</a> has been subjected to detailed scrutiny with a view to optimization. <a id="page_68" class="page">Page 68, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Instrumentation has been developed to enable the repetitive parts to be carried out fully automatically, with delivery of measured quantities of the appropriate reagents, protected amino acids, and solvents according to predetermined protocols. Once set up and started, such automated &#x2018;synthesizers&#x2019; need neither the intervention nor the presence of any operator. Less sophisticated systems comprising the plumbing but not the programming facilities are available for convenient &#x2018;manual&#x2019; solid phase synthesis by an operator. These have the advantage that the operator can keep an eye on things and take remedial action if failures of chemistry or technology are detected, but the rapid developments in automated monitoring which are taking place will probably eventually enable feed-back control without an operator even for non-routine cases. The whole area has become a booming multimillion dollar business, with numerous international companies competing to supply specialized equipment and consumables. Small-scale academic applications get most space in the literature, but there are important large-scale industrial applications of solid phase synthesis too, although most industrial peptide production still depends on classical solution methods. In the necessarily superficial account of solid phase peptide synthesis which follows, we shall confine ourselves to the chemistry involved, but we should remember all the time that there is a sophisticated supporting technology.</p>

<p class="indent">As a means to an end, the approach was welcomed with enthusiasm by biochemists and others who were impatient for peptides, but who were perhaps not much interested in the synthetic chemistry <i>per se.</i> In part as a reaction to this, those of a more chemical inclination were at first very critical and patronizing. There was a feeling about that organic synthesis without the meticulous characterization of intermediates was bad science, and not really cricket. But solid phase methods now dominate synthetic peptide research, and the principle has been successfully extended to other fields as well, especially peptide sequence analysis and oligonucleotide synthesis. For peptide synthesis, Merrified and others have developed his original chemistry to a fine art (<a href="#sec_9.2">Section 9.2</a> opposite), while Sheppard and his school have taken Merrifield&#x2019;s <a id="page_69" class="page">Page 69, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>basic concept and remodelled it very successfully with alternative chemistry (<a href="#sec_9.3">Section 9.3</a> on <a href="#page_75">p. 75</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">9.2<span class="space">&#160;</span>The Merrifield approach</h2>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_9.2.1">
<h3 class="h3">9.2.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Principles</h3>
<p class="noindent">A year after his preliminary publication establishing the solid phase principle, Merrifield described a synthesis of bradykinin (see <a href="#sec_9.2.2.1">Section 9.2.2.1</a>) which has served as the prototype for the standard approach associated with his name. In this approach, polystyrene crosslinked by the incorporation of a small amount of divinylbenzene is chloromethy- lated (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-2">Scheme 9.2</a>), and the target peptide <i>C</i>-terminal amino-acid residue, <i>N</i>-&#x03B1;-protected with a Boc group, is attached to the polymer by nucleophilic displacement. Deprotection with mild acid followed by neutralization gives a free amino group, to which the second amino acid residue can be coupled by means of DCCI. The deprotection, neutralization, and coupling stages can be repeated with appropriate Boc amino acids until the target sequence is fully assembled. Side-chains are blocked with permanent protecting groups derived from benzyl alcohol, or other suitable groups which resist the mild acid required for removal of the temporary &#x03B1;-Boc protection. At every stage, after the attachment, deprotection, neutralization, or coupling reaction, the completely insoluble polymer-peptide conjugate is washed exhaustively to remove excess reagents and coproducts. Finally, treatment with strong acid simultaneously strips off all the protecting groups and cleaves the benzyl ester polymer-peptide link (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-3">Scheme 9.3</a>), giving the crude required <a id="page_70" class="page">Page 70, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>peptide. From the attachment of the first residue to the addition of the last, the peptide-resin conjugate remains in the same vessel, retained there by the sintered glass partition through which all the washings pass to waste.</p>
<p class="indent">The main problems encountered relate to (a) non-quantitative reactions; (b) incomplete orthogonality between the temporary blocking groups and the permanent blocking groups (which include the peptide- polymer link, cleavage of which results in solubilization and loss of peptide); and (c) side-reactions, especially at the final complete deprotection and cleavage from the carrier.</p>
<p class="indent">If any <i>N</i>-terminal residue of the peptide-polymer conjugate remains unacylated after any coupling stage, this will lead to an end product which is contaminated with incomplete sequences. The unreacted residue may be successfully coupled in a subsequent cycle, in which case the resulting contaminant is a deletion peptide; if it is not, then a truncated target sequence results. Elementary arithmetic leads to the conclusion that near-quantitative reactions are essential. For a synthesis of 10 cycles, even if each coupling stage is 99&#x0025; complete and there is no termination of chain growth to give truncated sequences, the end product is only about 90&#x0025; pure target peptide, the 10&#x0025; being largely made up of the 10 possible single-residue deletion peptides; for 100 cycles, the end product will be about 36&#x0025; pure, with 38&#x0025; of single-residue deletion contaminants (of which there are 100 possibilities), 18&#x0025; of two-residue deletion contaminants (of which there are some 5000 possibilities), the bulk of the remainder being made up of three- or four-residue deletions (of which there are over 4 000 000 possibilities).</p>
<p class="indent">Early critics maintained that these calculations exposed a hopeless situation: the level of completeness required to give purifiable end peptides was beyond attainability. This view can now be seen to have been too dismissive, on three counts.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, in favourable cases, coupling can in fact be pushed to very nearly 100&#x0025; by use of excess acylating agent, or performing the coupling stages more than once; the use of highly activated intermediates like symmetrical anhydrides may be advantageous. Completeness can be monitored by colour tests for residual free amino groups&#x2014;the Kaiser test, based on the reaction of peptide-polymer samples with ninhydrin, has been the standard method. Unfavourable cases, where a residue on the polymer proves resistant to coupling, are often due to aggregation or ordering of the peptide chain concealing the group to which access is necessary; now that there is some understanding of this kind of problem, it can be eased by taking deliberate steps (such as adding salts) to disrupt undesirable interactions. If despite such measures the amino groups of a few chains fail to couple, the consequences can be limited by &#x2018;capping&#x2019; with acetic anhydride to terminate the further growth of these chains and prevent the appearance of single-residue deletion peptides in the end product. Some protocols involve performing double couplings and a capping operation in every residue cycle to be on the safe side.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-15em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1a">
<img src="../images/pg_74_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
</figure>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Secondly, it was a premise of the early critics that separation techniques would never be able to cope with the kind of purification problem that the solid phase approach would pose with peptides of any <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>size. In the meantime, however, advances in separation and characterization technology have been far greater than could have been anticipated.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-2em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">HPLC with on-line electrospray mass spectrometry to identify peptides as they emerge, for example, is an enormously powerful technique applicable to tiny amounts.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">Thirdly, experience has shown there are in any case many applications for synthetic peptides where inhomogenous preparations, provided they are used critically, can nevertheless give valuable results. A striking example is Geysen&#x2019;s approach to the investigation of antigenic determinants (&#x2018;epitope mapping&#x2019;), in which large numbers of related peptide sequences are assembled simultaneously by parallel multiple Merrifield synthesis on batteries of polyethylene rod supports, each of which has its own reactor well. The peptides are assembled on aminoalkyl appendages which are anchored to the rods by graft polymerization; they are deprotected and investigated for antibody binding whilst still attached to the rods. All the probes thus made must be inhomogenous, but the differences between their principal components still show up, enabling rapid screening.</p>
<p class="indent">In view of the initial criticisms levelled at the solid phase peptide synthesis approach, it is ironic that deliberately generated mixtures have also proved valuable. If mixed amino acid derivatives are used in carefully thought-out combinations, &#x2018;peptide libraries&#x2019; result which enable oligopeptide sequences to be screened in vast groups. This makes it possible to home in on biologically active structures without the need to carry out large numbers of individual syntheses, as in a classical structure-activity study. &#x2018;Combinatorial synthesis&#x2019;, like the solid phase concept itself, has also been exported from peptide synthesis to other sectors of bioorganic chemistry.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-4em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="noindent2">See <i>Combinatorial Chemistry,</i> in the Oxford Chemistry Masters series.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">In the standard Merrifield approach, the differentiation between the temporary &#x03B1;-amino protection on the one hand, and the permanent side- chain protection and peptide-resin link on the other, is dependent on the much greater acid-lability of Boc groups than benzyl ester and related groups. The difference is perfectly sufficient for syntheses involving a modest number of steps, but slight side-chain deprotection of Lys(Z) residues can occur under Boc-cleavage conditions, leading to the formation of branched peptides; and some loss of peptide from the peptide-resin conjugate takes place at each Boc-deprotection, because the benzyl ester anchor is not entirely resistant to acidolysis. These problems can be met by tuning the acid-lability of the bonds concerned with appropriate substituents. For example, the loss of side-chain protection from lysine under Boc-acidolysis conditions can be greatly reduced by the use of Lys[Z(2Cl)] instead of Lys(Z), and the loss of peptide from the conjugate can be diminished by attaching the first residue through a benzyl ester link of electronically moderated acid-lability, as with 4-hydroxymethylphenylacetamidomethylpolystyrene carriers, or PAM resins (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-4">Scheme 9.4</a>). There is a chemical balancing act to be performed here, because the very modifications which endow side-chain protection and peptide-polymer connections with greater stability necessarily require more severe final acidolysis, and consequently greater risk of side-reactions at that stage, which is problematic for this reason in any case. The original HBr/TFA reagent has been largely superseded by liquid HF, despite the serious hazards and technical difficulties associated with it (commercial services for the performance of HF cleavage are on <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>offer), and, as yet less well tried, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid (TFMSA). Scavengers are essential, and a great deal of effort has been invested in the definition of optimum conditions. In particular, it is found best to execute HF cleavage in two stages. In the first stage, HF diluted with substantial amounts of dimethyl sulphide is used to cleave the more labile benzyl-oxygen bonds, under what are presumed to be S<sub><i>N</i></sub>2- promoting conditions. In the second stage, neat HF is used to cleave groups which survive the first stage&#x2014;Arg(Tos), Arg(NO<sub>2</sub>), for example. The point of this so called &#x2018;low-high&#x2019; HF procedure is that it avoids the exposure of the peptide to the benzyl cations which would result from a one-step neat HF treatment, since neat HF favours <small>S<sub><i>N</i></sub>1-</small>fission of benzyl- oxygen bonds.</p>

For the synthesis of these in the oxytocin and vasopressin field, ammonolysis has been used with considerable success to cleave benzyl ester peptide-resin links. Carriers for more general use have also been developed: in these, the first residue is attached through an amide link which is designed to undergo polymer-nitrogen fission on strong acidolysis at the end of the synthesis (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-5">Scheme 9.5</a>). <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a></p>

<p class="noindent2">A classical solution synthesis of this enzyme was reported by Yajima and Fujii ten years later.</p>
</aside>
<p class="noindent">The solid phase synthesis of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, which has 124 residues and 4 disulphide bridges, by Gutte and Merrifield, was first announced in 1969: refinements and details of the work appeared in 1971. Essentially the same methods as had been used for bradykinin were employed, with HF for final cleavage from the resin and side-chain deprotection. It was not possible to isolate completely pure synthetic enzyme with the separation methods then available, but 0.4 mg material with a specific activity of 78&#x0025; was eventually obtained. There was no protective differentiation between the SH groups, and oxidation to give disulphide bridges was therefore uncontrolled, but this is a favourable case for it to take place spontaneously to give the natural structure. This work demonstrated convincingly, to all but a shrinking residue of determined sceptics, the power and potential of the solid phase approach. It had taken only a decade for the concept to be brought to this fruition, which also provided the first proof of an important fundamental principle, namely that the natural three-dimensional structure of a protein is determined by the amino acid sequence alone. This principle <a id="page_74" class="page">Page 74, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>was universally believed (if it was not so, what did control three- dimensional organization, and how could the information be stored and transmitted?), but the experimental evidence up to that time fell short of complete proof. Proteins had been structurally disrupted and deactivated, and then shown to reorganize (in certain favourable cases) into active structures spontaneously on removal of the disorganizing influences. But such experiments were open to the criticism that the disorganized forms might retain some structural information in organized regions, which could survive to nucleate regeneration of the correct active structures. No such objection could be levelled at the formation of enzymically active ribonuclease by total synthesis, since the only structural information put into its construction was the amino acid sequence.</p>

<p class="indent">The main chemical problems encountered by Merrifield and Gutte were due to (a) incomplete coupling; (b) loss of side-chain protection; (c) loss of peptide from the resin (more than 1 &#x0025; at each stage); and (d) side-reactions caused by HF. There have been advances on all these aspects in the intervening 20 years, and the synthesis of large peptides by the Merrifield approach, while by no means routine, is now not so daunting. The main differences are the use of faster and cleaner coupling procedures, side-chain protection of greater stability, PAM resins, and moderated HF final deprotection/cleavage. Recent examples include <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>HIV-1 processing protease (99 residues; the synthetic enzyme was required for the development of inhibitors as potential AIDS drugs; its structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography; numerous close analogues have also been synthesized).</p>

<h3 class="h3">9.3.1<span class="space">&#160;</span>Principles</h3>
<p class="noindent">In 1971 Sheppard argued that it would be desirable in solid phase synthesis for the polymeric carrier to be chemically similar to the growing peptide chain, so that both carrier and peptide could be well solvated by dipolar aprotic solvents, to give an open gel system in which there was free access of reagents to reactive sites. This was in contrast to the situation with peptides attached to Merrifield cross-linked polystyrenes, where the favoured solvent for swelling the polymeric matrix (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) was unable to solvate the conjugated peptide chain well and thereby inclined to encourage its aggregation (depending on the sequence and side-chain protection), reducing the availability of reactive groups. This line of thought led to the introduction of polyamide carriers into solid phase peptide synthesis in place of polystyrenes. Although there has been a great deal of chemical and technological cross-fertilization between the two methodologies, they have developed in parallel, and remain distinct approaches: that associated with Merrified employing polystyrenes, usually with Boc &#x03B1;-protection; and that associated with Sheppard employing polyamides, usually with Fmoc &#x03B1;-protection (hence the common expression &#x2018;Fmoc polyamide synthesis&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="indent">The standard Sheppard carrier is derived from a cross-linked polyacrylamide incorporating a number of sarcosine methyl ester side- chains (&#x2018;Pepsyn&#x2019;: <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-7">Scheme 9.7</a>); the side-chains are extended by treatment</p>

<p class="noindent">preferred for the coupling stages: very high levels of incorporation are attainable, even with sequences recognized as difficult in standard Merrifield synthesis. The &#x03B1;-Fmoc, &#x03C9;-mild-acid-labile protecting group <a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a>tactics normally used differ with advantage from the &#x03B1;-Boc, &#x03C9;<i>-</i>strong- acid-labile tactics of the standard Merrifield approach in two ways: (a) the &#x03B1;<i>/&#x03C9;-</i>protection is absolutely orthogonal as opposed to nearly orthogonal; and (b) the final deprotection can be carried out under much gentler conditions. Further, a single solvent, DMF, is generally used at all stages, reducing the number of wash operations needed, and avoiding difficulties due to swelling and contraction of the polymer with solvent changes. A range of manual and automatic synthesizers appropriate for this approach is available, and rapid technical advances which are outside the scope of this book are taking place, especially in polymeric carriers and supporting systems, in instrumentation for continuous flow operation of the synthesis, and in monitoring with feedback control.</p>
<p class="indent">We have alluded several times to the common and serious problem in solid phase peptide synthesis which arises from the tendency of certain sequences to self-aggregate on the resin. This reduces the accessibility of the <i>N</i>-terminal group to reactants in solution, which interferes with coupling, deprotection, and monitoring methods based on end-group detection. The problem usually appears, if it is going to, after six or seven residues have been added, when it becomes necessary to use extended reaction times, repeated reaction cycles, hyper-reactive acylating agents, or aggregation-disrupting media, in order to continue chain-assembly. It can be a losing battle. There is now a measure of understanding of the phenomenon, and it is recognized that some kinds of sequence and residue (and hence side-chain protection) are more prone to it that others. But it cannot be predicted with confidence when it will be encountered and when not. Nor would we expect to be able to predict this at the present stage of conformational understanding in peptide and protein chemistry. It is clear enough, however, that backbone to backbone hydrogen-bonding is a major factor, and that it cannot take place if there is <i>N</i>-substitution at intervals. Reversible blockade of occasional peptide bond nitrogens is therefore desirable. This is not as easily achieved as it sounds, because <i>N</i>-substitution militates against efficient coupling, and adds to the final deprotection. An extremely ingenious solution has been found by Sheppard and Johnson, who recommend the incorporation of an <i>N</i>-Hmb-residue at frequent intervals by coupling a bis-Fmoc-Hmb- amino acid. At the next coupling stage after removal of the two Fmoc groups, there is an assisted pathway for acylation which overcomes the steric hindrance (<a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-9">Scheme 9.9</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">It is a sad but inevitable fact that a high proportion of the lively young people who will, one hopes, read this little book, will lose their reason to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease in their declining years. Unless, that is, an understanding of the condition enables preventative medicine to intervene. It is at present an inscrutable syndrome, but it is recognized that the presence of extracellular insoluble proteinaceous deposits (known as amyloid plaques) in the brains of stricken individuals is a pathological characteristic. Attention has consequently focused on these plaques, the major constituent of which is a 42- or 43-residue peptide designated <i>&#x03B2;</i>A4. The synthesis of the 43-residue isoform <i>&#x03B2;</i>A4(1&#x2013;13) is therefore of special interest, as it should open up possibilities for studying it and analogues. It is an excruciatingly difficult synthetic target, because <i>C</i>-terminal sequences show a high tendency to aggregate and frustrate chain assembly, and the end product is exceedingly insoluble, making purification difficult. Johnson has recently cracked both problems by use of the Hmb backbone protecting group. During assembly of the sequence, the Hmb group inhibited aggregation. Acetylation of the Hmb groups at their phenolic oxygens while the protected peptide was still attached to the carrier enabled them to survive TFA side-chain deprotection and detachment from the resin: the penta-AcHmb derivative released was soluble to an extent of 10&#x0025; w/v in 0.1&#x0025; TFA- MeCN, in which the fully deprotected peptide is virtually insoluble. Purification by chromatography was possible at this stage. Hydrazino- lysis then removed the <i>O</i>-acetyl substituents and restored the acid-lability of the Hmb groups, which could then be stripped off with TFA. Although this synthesis, which is summarized in Table 9.2 and <a href="Chapter09.xhtml#sch9-10">Scheme 9.10</a>, was one of the first to use backbone blockade and will no doubt be improved on, it was a remarkable achievement with an intractable peptide. <a id="page_80" class="page">Page 80, Chapter 09: Solid phase peptide synthesis</a></p>

<p class="noindent">So what is the best way of making a peptide? The history of the subject shows that any generalization is likely to be a hostage to fortune, but the answer seems to be at present that solution methods are best for very small peptides , solid phase methods win for intermediate sizes (with some version of the Sheppard approach having the popular vote), and the way for proteins is solution assembly of fragments made by solid phase procedures.</p>
