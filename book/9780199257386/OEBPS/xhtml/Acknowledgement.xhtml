<p class="fmnoindent">Although the coverage of amino acid synthesis was new, the greater part of the 1992 printing of this primer was a distillate of the chapters on fundamentals which appeared in my book The chemical synthesis of peptides (OUP, 1991, reprinted in paperback 1994). I remain grateful for permission to use this material, but ten years have passed, and there have been three reprints in the meantime, each with additions and corrections. There are further extensive additions and adjustments in this second edition of the primer, which now supersedes my 1991 book altogether in giving, albeit more briefly, my view of the chemical essentials of mainstream peptide synthesis today.</p>
