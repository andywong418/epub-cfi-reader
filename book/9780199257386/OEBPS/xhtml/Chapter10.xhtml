<p class="noindent">The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish <i>Aequorea victoria</i> is a single chain protein of 238 residues. The fluorophore is formed by a unique and incompletely understood backbone modification of the region -Ser<sup>65</sup>-Tyr<sup>66</sup>-Gly<sup>67</sup>&#x2014;which is spontaneous when conditions are right.</p>

<p class="indent">The gene for the sequence can be made to express itself in other organisms, and GFP is being used as a visible marker in wide range of molecular biology and biomedical work.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time its synthesis was undertaken by Sakakibara and his team, GFP was some hundred residues longer than the longest sequence which had been prepared chemically , and it is still at the time of writing the biggest protein to have been synthesized. That obviously makes it a case of particular interest. By the yardsticks of classical organic chemistry, the yields in the final stages were not good after purification, and characterization was not complete, but those would be petty criticisms of a monumental achievement. It involved over 500 separate chemical reactions starting from protected amino acids. But it is more a monument to technical skill, patience and labour than to novel chemistry&#x2014;the chemical procedures used were at several points subtle refinements of usual practice, but do not involve new principles. The general strategy adopted had been worked out on much smaller molecules. The overall plan of attack was one based on fragment condensation in solution with almost maximal relatively stable side-chain &#x2018;permanent&#x2019; protection (Table 10.1) in conjunction with Boc &#x03B1;-amino &#x2018;temporary&#x2019; protection. Short protected fragments of about 10 residues each, mostly chosen to have <i>C</i>-terminal Gly or Pro, were prepared by stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS; Table 10.2 ); these short fragments were assembled on four fronts to give four major fragments of 50-60 residues which were coupled in pairs to give two fragments of roughly equal size which were then combined and deprotected (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml#sch10-2">Scheme 10.2</a>). <a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Chapter 10: GFR a tour de force</a></p>

<p class="indent">There were four main considerations behind the choices listed in the above table. <i>First</i>, survival of &#x03B1;-Boc acidolysis conditions; all pass that test except Xan, which is only marginally less acid-labile than Boc. But since side reactions involving the amide side-chain take place mainly when the &#x03B1;-carboxyl is activated for coupling (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sch6-18">Schemes 6.18</a> and <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sch6-19">6.19</a>), it did not matter that Xan groups were lost during the next Boc acidolysis after Asn or Gln incorporation. <i>Secondly</i>, survival of the basic/ nucleophilic conditions for detaching protected fragments after SPPS assembly (see Table 10.2 below): the usual Z(2Br) group for Tyr failed on that, and so the Pen group was devised&#x2014;similarly, formyl proved unsuitable for Trp and so Hoc was developed. <i>Thirdly</i>, survival of phenacyl reductive cleavage conditions: all are satisfactory on that score. <i>Fourthly and finally</i>, removability by HF treatment: all except Acm are cleaved by HF, and in that case a subsequent treatment with Hg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> was necessary.</p>

<p class="noindent2">Protected peptides anchored through an acid-stable, base-labile ester can be assembled on this carrier by a Merrifield approach (&#x03B1;-Boc, acid resistant side-chain blockade). Base treatment (<i>cf.</i> Fmoc cleavage) gives peptide free acids with all <i>N</i>-terminal and side-chain protection intact.</p>

<p class="noindent">The short protected peptide acids were all thoroughly purified, and, in cases where the strategy required it, the <i>C</i>-terminal carboxy group was converted to a Pac ester by treatment with phenacyl bromide. No His(Bom) residues, which would probably have reacted with phenacyl bromide, were present in these cases. Boc cleavage was with TFA, and WSCI (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#page_32">p. 32</a>) was used as coupling reagent, with HOOBt as additive instead of the more popular HOBt. As the terminal residue of the carboxy component was Gly or Pro in most couplings, there was no risk of racemisation. Where this was not the case, no difficulty was encountered in practice. The principal problem was solubility, and the the venture turned as much as anything on the fact that mixtures of chloroform and TFE or phenol were good solvents for the protected intermediates and also compatible with the coupling chemistry. For the Pac cleavage stage hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was added to assist dissolution when necessary. About 700 mg of the fully protected complete sequence Boc[l-238]OBzl was obtained. Treatment of 465mg with HF at -5&#x00B0; for an hour in the presence of a similar amount of cysteine and a large excess of cresol as scavengers removed all except the Acm protecting groups and gave an opportunity for purification (gel filtration, and HPLC) and characterization&#x2014;amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry gave results in accord with theory for H[l-238(Acm<sub>2</sub>)]OH, and capillary zone electrophoresis was consistent with homogeneity. At this stage there was 33mg in hand. Finally the Acm groups were removed with Hg <small>(OAc)</small><sub>2</sub> in 50&#x0025; acetic acid, and after gel filtration and treatment under the conditions used for renaturing GFP after denaturation, the synthetic protein solution developed fluorescence characteristics identical to the native protein. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all, however, is that in reflecting on this and numerous other major syntheses performed by broadly the same approach, Sakakibara said in 1997 T am certain in general that we are able to synthesize an ordinary 100- <a id="page_84" class="page">Page 84, Chapter 10: GFR a tour de force</a>residue protein within several months and a 200-residue protein within a year.&#x2019;</p>
