<p class="noindent">Specific peptide bond formation with the &#x03B1;-amino group of lysine requires prior blockade of the &#x03B5;-amino group. The necessary differentiation can be achieved by using the fact that the side-chain amino group is the more basic and nucleophilic because there is an electron-withdrawing group next to the &#x03B1;-amino group (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sch6-1">Scheme 6.1</a>), or by taking advantage</p>

But cyclic, branched, and conjugated structures involving respectively cyclization, the attachment of other peptides and the conjugation of carbohydrate or other moieties through specific side-chains, are also very important. The construction of such assemblies demands the availability of protective group combinations with additional dimensions of orthogonality.

<p class="noindent">Controlled peptide bond formation involving the &#x03B1;-carboxy group of either aspartic or glutamic acid absolutely requires obstruction of the other carboxy group.

The necessary intermediates can be obtained by, <i>inter alia</i>, the routes outlined in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sch6-7">Scheme 6.7</a> (illustrated for Glu: analogously for Asp). The differentiations between the carboxy groups shown depend, in the case of the acid-catalysed esterification, on the fact that the &#x03B1;-carboxy group is deactivated by a nearby protonated amino group, and, in the case of the anhydride ring-opening, on the fact that the more electrophilic carbonyl is the one adjacent to the electron-withdrawing acylamino function.

<p class="indent">The intrinsic reactivity of the two side-chain nitrogens is similar. Unhindered alkylating agents give not only monosubstituted products, but also some disubstitution, as monoalkylation blocks one nitrogen without deactivating the other. The &#x03C4;- and &#x03C0;-monoalkyl derivatives are typically formed in around 3:1 proportions, but severe steric hindrance in the reagent shifts the balance in favour of the former, so that trityl chloride is regiospecific for the &#x03C4;-position. Only monosubstitution occurs with acylating and arylsulphonylating agents, because the electron- withdrawing effect of an acyl or arylsulphonyl group sited on one nitrogen is transmitted across the ring and depresses the nucleophilicity of the other. Acetic anhydride is regiospecific for the &#x03C4;-position, apparently because of thermodynamic control, but hindered or electronically deactivated acylating agents (chloroformates, Boc<sub>2</sub>O, carbamoyl chlorides) give significant amounts of &#x03C0;-product.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of writing, the best acid-labile protecting group available is &#x03C4;-trityl <b>6</b>. It is very stable to bases and is suitable for use together with Fmoc temporary protection. It is cleaved by aqueous TFA at room temperature, but the &#x03C0;-nitrogen remains free so racemisation is a problem. In conjunction with Boc &#x03B1;-protection, &#x03C0;-benzyloxymethyl (Bom) protection is ideal: it resists TFA, but is cleaved by HF or HBr/AcOH and (less reliably) by catalytic hydrogenolysis: the preparation of BocHis(Bom)OH 7 is outlined in <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sch6-22">Scheme 6.22</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.9<span class="space">&#160;</span>Tryptophan</h2>
<p class="noindent">The indole ring of tryptophan does not interfere with peptide bond formation, but captures electrophiles with great ease at several sites, especially the 2-position, and even under relatively mild acidic deprotective conditions competitive scavengers are essential. For protection to be of assistance in diminishing the problem, it is not sufficient merely to block one position&#x2014;as much &#x03C0;-electron density as possible must be drained from the whole system. The nitrogen is the only ring position for which reversible protection has been investigated. Formyl (For) has been used, but is inconveniently unstable to nucleophiles, and the Boc group is better in that respect: the key intermediate 8 is commercially available. At the final deprotection stage of a synthesis with this intermediate the side-chain deprotection proceeds to the carbamate stage on TFA treatment, but an electron-withdrawing influence remains in place and continues to protect the vulnerable ring while the other protecting groups are being removed. Carbon dioxide loss occurs spontaneously to give the fully deprotected indole side-chain during normal aqueous workup procedures.</p>

<p class="noindent">The special structure of proline gives it two impediments in synthesis (some steric hindrance to acylation at the secondary amino group; the susceptibility of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds to reduction by sodium in ammonia), but also gives it a resistance to base-catalysed racemization which is unique among the chiral protein building blocks. From a strategic point of view, this is a vital fact, because it allows any coupling from a proline carboxy group, including an acylpeptide fragment coupling, to be performed without racemization.</p>

<p class="indent">The ordinary oxazolone racemisation mechanism pathway (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.1.2.2">Section 5.1.2.2</a>) is not possible with activated acylprolines because they have no NFL Cyclisation to an oxazolonium cation <b>9</b> can take place, and such cations are optically labile, but much more vigorous conditions than are employed in peptide synthesis are required. For example, if proline is refluxed with acetic anhydride, an oxazolonium intermediate is generated, and racemic acetylproline is obtained on aqueous workup.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.11&#160;&#160;Glycine, phenylalanine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine</h2>
<p class="noindent">These amino acids have no side-chain functionality, but peptide synthesis with them can still be problematic. Paradoxically, glycine, achiral and without any side chain at all, is sometimes difficult to deal with, because the unimpeded access to peptide bonds involving it allows side reactions such as hydantoin formation. The same consideration facilitates strong interchain hydrogen bonding, which tends to make peptides with a high glycine content rather insoluble. Of the rest, phenylalanine is usually simple to work with, but may suffer reduction to cyclohexylalanine if extended catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction times cannot be avoided, and the coupling of valine and isoleucine derivatives is relatively slow for steric reasons (which is more than a matter of time and patience: slow coupling enables side-reactions of all kinds to compete more seriously). Only alanine and leucine have a completely clean record.</p>

<p class="noindent">We exceed our brief slightly, but it is worth mentioning the three general classes <b>11-13,</b> which can all be manipulated by the methods used for the proteinogenic amino acids, with only minor differences in experience. Peptides incorporating residues of <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> are not rare, and several are clinically important. Peptides containing residues of <b>13</b> are uncommon, but interesting because it has been shown recently that <i>&#x03B2;</i>-peptide chains can adopt organized conformations in solution, a characteristic formerly thought unique to &#x03B1;-peptides.</p>
