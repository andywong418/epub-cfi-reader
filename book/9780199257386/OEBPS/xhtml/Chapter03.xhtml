<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">If an &#x03B1;-amino group is to be protected in the context of peptide synthesis, its nucleophilic reactivity must be suppressed, by draining its electron density away into an appropriate substituent, or by concealing it altogether behind a screen of gross steric hindrance. To be useful, protection according to one or both of these simple principles must be achieved easily at the outset; the protecting group should introduce no problems of its own while in position; it must stay firmly at its post as long as it is needed; and when its job is done, it should slip quietly away on command, under conditions which have no adverse effects on the rest of the structure being assembled&#x2014;all without jeopardizing the chiral integrity of nearby chiral centres. Except in the special case where, at the end of a synthesis, several protected functionalities have to be exposed simultaneously to give the completed target molecule, there may be the additional requirement that the amino-protecting group should be orthogonal to the other protecting groups which are in play.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent">These are demanding criteria, ruling out of serious consideration all simple alkanoyl groups, which in some respects might seem obvious candidates. Thus, nothing could be more straightforward than acetylation, which satisfies the fundamental requirement of suppressing nucleophilic reactivity very well, and is hydrolytically reversible. Unfortunately, the severe conditions required for hydrolytic deacetylation devastate most peptide chains too. This difficulty can be eased by building in the potential for mild intramolecular deprotection, as in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sch3-1">Scheme 3.1</a>, but the protecting group so derived is nevertheless still quite</p>

The benzoyl and 4-toluenesulpho- nyl (&#x2018;tosyl&#x2019;) groups can be dismissed similarly&#x2014;their introduction is trivial, and they are good electron-withdrawing groups, but they otherwise fail to fit the bill.</p>
<p class="indent">The development of &#x03B1;-amino-protecting groups which do meet the necessary specifications has entailed an extended investigation of a very large number of variations on a number of themes. Many subtly different groups have been proposed, but only those of real practical importance or promise will be reviewed. <a id="page_14" class="page">Page 14, Chapter 3: &#x03B1;-Amino protection</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Amino groups are easily converted to alkoxycarbonylamino derivatives 1 (otherwise &#x2018;urethanes&#x2019; or &#x2018;carbamates&#x2019;), which are both amides and esters. As amides, the derivatives 1 have low nucleophilic reactivity at</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">nitrogen. As esters, although they have relatively low reactivity with respect to acyl-oxygen fission, they can be degraded by alkyl-oxygen fission to the corresponding carbamic acids. Since carbamic acids decarboxylate spontaneously under practically all conditions, alkyl- oxygen fission regenerates the parent amine. Alkyl-oxygen fission can be achieved in a great variety of ways, depending on the alkyl group. Most of the amino-protecting groups of the first rank depend on these simple principles, and on the further vital fact that the alkoxycarbonyl derivatives of &#x03B1;-amino acids are very nearly immune to racemization (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).</p>

HBr/AcOH is a highly corrosive system, and it is perhaps surprising that most simple peptides survive it, and other highly polar and acidic media, unharmed, but some do not. There are deleterious effects in more complicated cases, especially if certain susceptible side-chains are present (see Chapter 6). These problems are usually blamed on the generation of electrophilic species&#x2014;benzyl cations 
<a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, Chapter 3: &#x03B1;-Amino protection</a>or their equivalents&#x2014;which can attack electron-rich side-chains (e.g. Trp, Tyr, Met). Additives like anisole and dimethyl sulphide diminish difficulties of this kind, by acting as &#x2018;scavengers&#x2019; for such species. Exactly what &#x2018;scavenging&#x2019; means in this context is more complicated than it sounds, because most of the popular scavengers are also soft nucleophiles. They can intervene not only simply by sequestering any electrophiles before havoc is caused, but also by themselves acting directly as nucleophiles in the cleavage stage itself, assisting it and smoothing its path by shifting its position in the mechanistic spectrum towards the S<sub><i>N</i></sub>2 extreme. Increasing the acidity and or polarity accelerates the cleavage; liquid HF and HBr/TFA both remove Z groups rapidly. With these powerful reagents there is probably a more S<sub><i>N</i></sub>l-like mechanism in operation, so problems from wandering electrophiles (which, furthermore, enjoy a longer lifetime because the solvent is less nucleophilic) are more serious, and scavenging additives assume a correspondingly more important role.</p>

But catalyst-poisoning by divalent sulphur (Met, Cys, trace contaminants from the use of sulphur-containing reagents) is a problem. Special procedures, involving the use of liquid ammonia as solvent, or a very large excess of catalyst in acetic acid, have been devised to enable catalytic hydrogenolysis to be performed notwithstanding the presence of sulphur, but these conditions are not well tried. Deprotection by catalytic hydrogenolysis is generally regarded as out of the question if divalent sulphur must be present. This limitation apart, it is a very attractive method.</p>

<p class="noindent">The alkoxycarbonyl family of amino-protecting groups has dominated the field for many years. They will probably continue to do so indefinitely, because the scope they offer for building in relative stability and selective cleavability to order is combined with the fact that the chiral integrity of alkoxycarbonyl amino acids is practically unassailable. This last virtue is not unique to the class, however, and we shall now outline the characteristics of two important protecting groups of very different chemical types which also permit racemization-free manipulations (there are others, too).</p>
