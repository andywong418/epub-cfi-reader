<p class="noindent">In this chapter we will look at synthetic macrocyclic receptors for cations. Many of the receptors discussed bind cations <i>via</i> electrostatic ion-dipole interactions, and in some cases are enhanced by the formation of hydrogen bonds. A range of concepts will be introduced including the template effect, optimal spatial fit and preorganisation.</p>


<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-6.0em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">It should be noted that other non- macrocyclic ligands ranging from hexadentate ethylene &#x002D; diaminetetracarboxylate (EDTA<sup>4-</sup>) to metal coordinating proteins are also effective cation binding agents. They are, however, beyond the scope of this chapter.</p></aside>

 Why bind cations?</h2>

<p class="noindent">Cations play many roles in <i>biological processes.</i> Concentration gradients of cations across cell membranes maintain potentials that are used to transport organic substrates into cells. They trigger muscle contraction and are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. Metal cations are present at the active sites of many enzymes playing catalytic roles. Additionally, metal cations play vital roles in enzymes, stabilizing the polypeptide tertiary structure. They may also be transported in proteins (for example iron is transported in transferrin - see Fenton&#x2019;s Biocoordination Chemistry primer).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Medically important</i> metal complexes include complexes of paramagnetic lanthanide cations (e.g. Gd<sup>3&#x002B;</sup>) that are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of soft tissue (see <a href="Chapter07.xhtml">chapter 7</a>). Complexes of platinum (e.g. cis-platin) have been shown to coordinate to DNA, disrupting replication, and therefore hindering the growth of tumor cells (see Wilkins and Wilkins&#x2019; Inorganic Chemistry in Biology primer).</p>




<p class="indent3-ka">In <i>mining technology,</i> the design of receptors to selectively bind a particular metal ion in the presence of other cations is important in the extraction of a specific metal from a solution phase mixture <i>(e.g.</i> isolation of copper from copper ores containing mixtures of copper, iron, and cadmium).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The development of sequestering agents for <i>toxic</i> or <i>pollutant</i> metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury or plutonium may be used in chelation therapy for poisoning victims or in systems designed to remove such pollutants from the environment. Such sequestering agents are used to remove excess iron from sufferers of haemophilia.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">There has therefore been a great deal of effort aimed at producing selective receptors for cationic guest species.</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.2<span class="space">	&#160;</span> The synthesis of macrocycles</h2>



<p class="noindent">The majority of receptors in this Chapter (and indeed in this book) contain macrocyclic rings. We have already seen that Nature uses macrocyclic structuresfor metal ion binding in antibiotics such as valinomycin (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>). Additionally,<i>porphyrin</i> macrocycles are used to bind iron in haem groups, magnesium in chlorophyll a (<a href="#fig_2.1"><b>2.1</b></a>), a <i>corrin</i> macrocycle binds cobalt in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and a reduced form of a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle called a<a id="page_16" class="page">Page 16, 2 Cation Binding</a><i>corphin</i> (<a href="#fig_2.1">Fig. 2.1</a>) binds nickel in factor F-430 (<a href="#fig_2.1"><b>2.2</b></a>). We should therefore pause before we start looking at specific examples of the coordination properties of macrocyclic receptors and consider how macrocycles can be synthesized.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>High dilution techniques</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Macrocycle synthesis reactions carried out at <i>high dilution</i> favour cyclization over polymerization and can produce high yields of macrocyclic products. At high concentration polymerisation reactions dominate. The high dilution method is used in the synthesis of cryptands (the synthesis of [2.2.2]cryptand <a href="#scheme_2.1"><b>2.4</b></a> is shown in <a href="#scheme_2.1">Scheme 2.1</a>). In a typical synthesis, solutions of each component are slowly added dropwise to a large volume of solvent, keeping the concentration of the intermediate low. Another technique involves attaching one reagent to a solid support (isolating it and preventing polymerization) and then exposing the support to the second reagent.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Coordination template effects</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Metal ion templates are commonly used to increase yields of macrocycle formation. There are two classes of template effect - thermodynamic and kinetic (<a href="#scheme_2.2">Scheme 2.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>thermodynamic template effect</i> occurs when one product of a reaction is complementary to an added metal ion. In the absence of metal ion an equilibrium exists between the desired product and other species. However, on addition of the metal ion the desired product binds the metal ion, and the equilibrium is shifted in favour of the complex. This is illustrated in <a href="#scheme_2.2">Scheme 2.2a</a>) where a nickel-imine complex <a href="#scheme_2.2"><b>2.5</b></a> is formed in &#x003E; 70&#x0025; yield, whereas in the absence of nickel the imine is not the major product of the reaction.</p>

<figcaption style="width:100%"><p class="noindent"><b>Scheme 2.1</b> Cryptands (section)are synthesized using dilution techniques</p></figcaption></figure>


<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>kinetic template effect</i> is an organizational effect. The reactants wrap around the template, bringing their reactive sites into close proximity. Cyclization therefore becomes favoured over polymerization. This is shown in <a href="#scheme_2.2">Scheme 2.2b</a>) for the reaction of the nickel imine complex <a href="#scheme_2.2"><b>2.5</b></a> formed in<a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17,Chapter 1 Introduction</a> part a) with a bis-bromo compound forming macrocycle <a href="#scheme_2.2"><b>2.6</b></a>. The kinetic template effect is used in the synthesis of phthalocyanins such as <a href="#scheme_2.3"><b>2.7</b></a> (formed spontaneously on heating 1,2-dicyanobenzenes in the presence of metal ion templates, <a href="#scheme_2.3">Scheme 2.3</a>), crown ethers (<a href="#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>), and sepulchrates (<a href="#sec_2.7">Section 2.7</a>). In addition, metal cations have been used to direct the self-assembly of complex molecular architectures (see<a href="Chapter06.xhtml"> Chapter 6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Pioneering work on the use of metal ions as templates for macrocycle synthesis was conducted by Curtis and co-workers in the 1960s. Reaction of [Ni(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> with dry acetone gave a yellow crystalline product that was originally thought to be a simple Schiff base nickel (II) complex.However the product was found to be stable to very harsh conditions, such as boiling in alkali or acid, suggesting that it could not be the simple complex. It was eventually shown that the product was a macrocycle (<a href="#scheme_2.4"><b>2.8</b></a>-<a href="#scheme_2.4">Scheme 2.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Nelson and co-workers looked at Schiff base condensation reactions with diamines and diketones. They found that the condensation of 2,6- diacetylpyridine with 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diamine was influenced by the nature of the of metal ion template (<a href="#scheme_2.5">Scheme 2.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In the presence of smaller metal ions such as Mn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>,Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> or Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> a [1&#x002B;1] condensation occurs (that is one molecule of diamine condenses with one molecule of diketone) forming the small macrocycle <a href="#scheme_2.5"><b>2.9</b></a>. However, in the presence of larger cations (Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> or Pb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) a [2&#x002B;2] condensation occurs producing a larger macrocycle <a href="#scheme_2.5"><b>2.10</b></a> (this reaction proceeds through an intermediate containing two metal ions). This clearly illustrates that the choice of metal ion template is crucial in macrocycle synthesis.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, 2 Cation Binding</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>De-metallation</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">One disadvantage of template synthesis over high dilution methods is that once the macrocycle has been synthesized the metal ion template must be removed (without destroying the macrocyclic framework). In some cases this is virtually impossible (see sephulcrates in <a href="#sec_2.7">Section 2.7</a>). However there are several techniques commonly used to de-metallate macrocycles:</p>


<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em;">(a)&#160;For weakly coordinating metals it is sometimes possible to dissolve
 the macrocycle-metal complex in an organic solvent and then wash the organic phase with 
water. The water will effectively solvate the metal ion and remove it.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em;">(b)&#160;Addition of acid to macrocycles containing chelated amine groups can cause de-metallation. The acid protonates the amine groups so &#x2018;using up&#x2019;their electron pair in an N-H bond. This electron pair is then unavailable for metal coordination and the macrocycle will de-metallate. Removal of metals from Schiff base macrocycles may involve reduction of the Schiff base to its corresponding amine followed by protonation.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em;">(c)&#160;Addition of a strongly coordinating competitive ligand to the macrocycle-metal complex in solution can sequester the metal ion from the macrocycle. For example, addition of CN<sup>-</sup> to Sauvage&#x2019;s catenates and metallated trefoil knots (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#sec_6.3">Section 6.3</a>) removes the coordinated copper(I) metal ions. Other strongly coordinating ligands such as EDTA<sup>4-</sup> have also been used in this procedure.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em;">(d)&#160;By changing the oxidation state of a metal it is sometimes possible to switch from a kinetically inert complex to a labile one. For example inert complexes containing Cr(III) or Co(III) may be reduced to their Cr(II) or Co(II) oxidation states that are more labile. One of the other de-metallation procedures described above may then be used.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1em;">The following sections of this chapter describe specific examples of cation coordinating macrocycles beginning with the discovery of the crown ethers by Charles Pedersen.</p>

Crown ethers</h2>

<p class="noindent">The genesis of supramolecular chemistry may be traced back to the pioneering work of Charles J. Pedersen. Pedersen was an industrial chemist working for DuPont in New Jersey, USA. He was interested in making multidentate ligands for copper and vanadium and in 1960 was attempting to synthesize bis[2-(o-hydroxy-phenoxy)ethyl]ether <b><a href="#scheme_2.6">2.11</a></b> (<a href="#sec_2.6">Scheme 2.6</a>) when he made a fascinating chance discovery.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Whilst attempting to purify the expected product he isolated some white crystals in approximately 0.4&#x0025; yield. He found that addition of sodium salts increased the solubility of these crystals in methanol by a very large factor. The crystals were characterized by elemental analysis and mass spectrometry<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, 2 Cation Binding</a>and found to be a macrocycle (<a href="#fig_2.2"><b>2.12</b></a>) (<a href="#fig_2.2">Fig. 2.2</a>) formed due to the presence of catechol impurity and a sodium template ion in the second step of the synthesis. The systematic names to these compounds are rather long, and this prompted Pedersen to give this class of compound the trivial name <i>"crown ether</i>&#x2019; (because of their &#x2018;crown-like&#x2019; conformation in the solid phase) and this particular compound the name dibenzo[18]crown-6. [18] refers to the number of atoms in the macrocycle and 6 to the number of oxygen atoms in the ring.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Pedersen observed from a space filling model that a sodium ion can sit in the cavity of the crown, held by attractive electrostatic ion-dipole interactions between the alkali metal cation and the six oxygen donor atoms in the polyether rings. He recognized that the increased solubility of the macrocycle in hydroxylic solvents in the presence of sodium cations was due to the crown binding a sodium cation. This molecule was the first synthetically produced receptor for Group 1 metal cations. Pedersen was awarded the Nobel prize for this work in 1987 (jointly with Profs Jean-Marie Lehn and Donald J. Cram, some of whose work is discussed later in this Chapter).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A relationship exists between the cavity size, cationic radius and stability of the resulting complex (<a href="#table_2.1">Table 2.1</a>). The better the fit of the cation into the crown, the stronger the complex formed. This concept is referred to as<a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21,Chapter 1 Introduction</a><i>optimal spatial fit.</i> Frensdorff determined the stability constants of various crown ethers with cations in methanol by potentiometry and found, for example, that [18]crown-6 <b>(<a href="#fig_2.3">2.13</a>)</b> forms the most stable complexes with potassiumcations whereas [21]crown-7 <b>(<a href="#fig_2.3">2.14</a>),</b> a larger crown, binds caesium more strongly than potassium (<a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>).</p><figure class="fig1" id="fig_2.4"><img src="../images/page_21_1.jpg" alt="images"/>

<p class="indent3-ka">There is also structural evidence for this concept of optimal spatial fit. The crystal structures of the potassium, sodium and caesium complexes of [18]crown-6 are illustrated (<a href="#fig_2.4">Fig. 2.4</a>). The cavity size of [18]crown-6 is complementary for potassium ions (<a href="#table_2.1">Table 2.1</a>), and therefore [18]crown-6 forms a 1:1 complex with a potassium cation sitting perfectly in the middle of the macrocycle. Complexes formed between [18]crown-6 and other alkali metal cations, however, are considerably less stable than the potassium complex (<a href="#fig_2.3">Fig. 2.3</a>). For smaller cations, such as sodium, the crown ether distorts, wrapping itself around the metal in an attempt to maximize the electrostatic interactions, but at the same time increasing the strain of the ligand. Larger cations such as caesium have to perch above one face of the macrocycle because they are too large to fit into the cavity. This mode of binding decreases the electrostatic interactions between ion and crown.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Crown ethers may also form complexes of different stoichiometry with alkali metal cations. The crystal structure of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-(benzo[ 15]crown-5)2 (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>) revealed that the potassium cation is sandwiched between two crown ether molecules (i.e. it is too large to fit in the cavity of the macrocycle). The inverse situation also occurs, with large crowns being capable of binding more than one cation at once. Dibenzo[24]crown-8 <b>(<a href="#fig_2.5">2.15</a>),</b> for example, can encapsulate two sodium cations simultaneously (<a href="#fig_2.5">Fig. 2.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The affinity of crown ethers for transition metals can be enhanced by replacing oxygen atoms with softer donor atoms such as sulfur or nitrogen.<a href="#fig_2.7">Figure 2.7</a> shows the binding constants of a variety of crown ethers with potassium and silver. The binding  constant of the silver cation increases at the expense of the affinity of the macrocycle for harder cations such as potassium. This effect can be explained by the <i>&#x2018;hard-soft acid-base' principle</i> with which the reader should be familiar.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Crown ethers do not, however, only bind simple metal ions, they can also bind ammonium and alkylammonium cations. [18]Crown-6 is a complementary receptor for primary ammonium cations as it possesses three oxygen atoms correctly oriented to form three <i>hydrogen bonds</i> with the guest (<a href="#fig_2.8">Fig. 2.8</a>). In this case, therefore, the ammonium ion is being held by a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. [15]Crown-5, however, does not possess C3 symmetry and is therefore not complementary to the guest (the oxygen atoms are not in the correct orientation to form three strong hydrogen bonds). This <i>mismatch in symmetry</i> is reflected in much weaker complexes being formed between the smaller crown ether and ammonium cations.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Crown ethers can also be functionalized with pendant arms containing additional coordinating groups and are then known as <i>lariat</i> crown ethers. Lariat crowns were designed as carrier species for cations across lipophilic membranes, because they possess higher binding constants than regular crowns, but remain kinetically labile (i.e. the rates of complexation and decomplexation are fast - a requirement for efficient transport) due to the flexibility of the arm. The cation is bound by the oxygen atoms in the crown and also by the pendant arm (by groups such as OMe).<a href="#scheme_2.7"> Scheme 2.7</a> shov/s the two possible ways of attaching a pendant arm to the crown ether skeleton, a) <i>via</i> a carbon atom <b>(<a href="#fig_2.7">2.19</a>)</b> and b) using an aza-crown ether with a pendant arm attached to the nitrogen atom <b>(<a href="#fig_2.7">2.20</a>).</b> An example of a carbon pivot lariat crown (<b><a href="#fig_2.10">2.21</a></b>) that is selective for lithium (on the basis of size) is shown in <a href="#fig_2.10">Fig. 2.10</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Crown ethers are now being used by supramolecular chemists in increasingly sophisticated ways. For example, Voyer recently produced synthetic cation channels mimicking those used in biology to span cell membranes, by attaching crown ethers to a polypeptide backbone. A 21 amino acid peptide consisting of 15 hydrophobic L-leucine residues and six [21 ]crown-7-L-phenylalanines was synthesized. The crown ethers were placed in the chain such that when the peptide coils up in an &#x03B1;-helical conformation the crown ethers align to form a channel (<a href="#fig_2.11">Fig. 2.11</a>). The channel was incorporated intosynthetic lipid bilayers and shown by pH techniques to allow ions to pass through. [21]crown-7 was chosen because it is too large to form strong complexes with alkali metal cations. If a smaller crown ether, such as [18]crown-6 were used, a strong complex would be  formed with potassium ions which would block the channel.</p>

Cryptandsxs</h2>




<p class="noindent">In 1969 Lehn and co-workers first reported the synthesis of a new class of molecule which they named &#x2018;<i>cryptands</i>&#x2019;. These receptors effectively moved crown ethers into the third dimension. Cryptands are cage like bicyclic molecules, synthesized by high dilution techniques (<a href="#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a>), and are named according to the number of oxygen atoms in each nitrogen-nitrogen linker (<a href="#fig_2.12">Fig. 2.12</a>). They have been found to complex group 1 and 2 metal cations with very large stability constants, higher than those of analogous crown ethers. In <i>methanol</i> [2.2.2]cryptand <b><a href="#fig_2.12">2.4</a></b> binds potassium cations with a stability constant (log K) of 10.4 (over four orders of magnitude higher than [18]crown-6, logK&#x003D;6.10). The complex of a cryptand is referred to as a cryptate. The stability constants for [2.1.1] <b>(<a href="#fig_2.12">2.22</a>),</b> [2.2.1] <b>(<a href="#fig_2.12">2.23</a>),</b> and [2.2.2] <b>(2.4)</b> cryptands in <i>vmter</i> are shown in <a href="#fig_2.13">Fig. 2.13</a>. The highest stabilities are observed for Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> [2.1.1], Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>[2.2.1] and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>[2.2.2] (<a href="#fig_2.14">Fig 2.14</a>) cryptates which correspond to complementary
 cryptand cavity-cation size.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The high stability constants have been attibuted to a number of factors. Once bound in the cryptand cavity the cation is poorly solvated leading to a positive entropy effect, as solvent is released on binding. There is also less reorganization of the receptor&#x2019;s structure required to coordinate the metal ion than for the crown ethers, thus giving a favourable enthalpic contribution.</p></section>

<p class="noindent">The crystal structures of uncomplexed [18]crown-6 and [2.2.2]cryptand show that their binding sites are not completely convergently arranged (<a href="#fig_2.15">Fig. 2.15</a>). Complexation in solution must therefore 
involve some degree of ligand rearrangement. Donald Cram recognized that ligands which were rigid and contained binding sites fixed in an octahedral arrangement around an enforced cavity should show enhanced binding over flexible ligands. With the help of CPK molecular models he designed a ligand containing an enforced spherical cavity (<b><a href="#fig_2.16">2.26</a></b>: <a href="#fig_2.16">Fig. 2.16</a>). He gave this family of preorganized ligands the name <i>spherand,</i> and the complexes were termed spheraplexes.</p>

As for crown ethers, the spherand cavity size can be tuned to yield selectivity for different cations. For example spherand <b>2.26</b> displays a remarkable selectivity for Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup> over other Group I metal cations.

<h2 class="h2">2.6<span class="space"></span><b>Calixarenes as cation binding agents</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Calix[n]arenes are a family of synthetic macrocyclic receptors consisting of cyclic arrays of <i>n</i> phenol moieties linked by methylene groups. They are formed from the base catalysed condensation of p-tert-butylphenol and formaldehyde. The chemistry of calix[n]arene formation has been studied in great detail by C. David Gutsche and co-workers. They found that by altering the reaction conditions, differently sized calix[n]arenes could be produced.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka">Calix[4]arenes (<a href="#fig_2.17">Fig. 2.17</a>) may adopt one of four conformations: cone, partial cone, 1,2-alternate or 1,3-alternate (<a href="#fig_2.18">Fig. 2.18</a>). <i>p-tert-</i> B utylcalix[4] arene <b><a href="#fig_2.17">2.27</a></b> exists in a cone conformation that is stabilized by an array of hydrogen bonds between the phenolic OH groups at the lower rim of the macrocycle. Deprotonated calixarenes are capable of binding alkali metal cations at the lower rim, and can even act as carriers, transporting these guests through model membrane systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The cone conformation is particularly useful because its &#x2018;bucket&#x2019; shape makes an attractive three dimensional template from which to hang ligating groups. Groups may be appended to the lower rim or, after
 removal of the <i>tert</i>-butyl groups, to the upper rim of the calixarene. For example, ester groups may be attached to the lower rim of <b><a href="#fig_2.17">2.27</a></b> producing the tetraester compound <b><a href="#fig_2.19">2.28</a></b> in the cone conformation. UV spectroscopic techniques show that this receptor is selective for sodium cations over other putative Group 1 guest species (<a href="#fig_2.19">Fig. 2.19</a>). The sodium is coordinated to eight oxygen atoms at the lower rim of the calixarene (<a href="#fig_2.20">Fig. 2.20</a>). In contrast to crown ethers, the coordinating oxygen atoms are not integral parts of a macrocyclic structure but rather, are appended to it.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The aromatic cavities of calixarenes are also capable of coodinating to guest species. An example of a cation included in a calixarene cavity is shown in <a href="#fig_2.21">Fig. 2.21a,</a> in which a caesium cation is held in the cavity of <i>p-</i> tert-butylcalix[4]arene <b><a href="#fig_2.16">2.26</a></b> <i>via n-cation interactions</i> (a molecule of acetonitrile is also coordinated to the metal cation). These&#x03C0;-cation interactions are believed to arise from favourable electrostatic interactions between the electron deficient cation and the electron rich aromatic ring.</p>

<p class="noindent">Iron is an essential element for life (see David Fenton&#x2019;s Biocoordination Chemistry primer). It is, however, particularly difficult for fungi and bacteria to obtain because the hydrolysis of iron(III) limits its concentration to 10<sup>-18</sup> moldm<sup>-3</sup> at pH7. In order to scavenge the available iron, fungi and bacteria therefore produce complexing agents, called <i>siderophores</i> (from the Greek: &#x03C3;&#x1FD0;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;o&#x03C3; (iron) and; &#x0444;o&#x03C1;&#x025B;v&#x03E8; (carrier)) which they release and then reabsorb as an iron complex <i>via</i> an active transport mechanism. The siderophore forms a six-coordinate complex with the iron(III) <i>via</i> hydroxamate or catecholate oxygen atoms (<a href="#fig_2.24">Fig. 2.24</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Enterobactin <b><a href="#fig_2.25">2.34</a></b> is a bacterial siderophore that forms extremely stable complexes with iron(III) (<a href="#fig_2.25">Fig. 2.25</a>), in fact the stability constant of the [enterobactin-Fe]<sup>-3</sup> complex in aqueous solution is 10<sup>52</sup>moldm<sup>-3</sup>. It consists of a cyclic triester linked to three catechol groups <i>via</i> amide bonds. The triester scaffold imposes a &#x0394; configuration of catecholates around the metal. Once inside the bacterium an enzyme breaks the enterobactin skeleton, releasing the iron.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Kenneth Raymond and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley have produced a number of siderophore analogues based on catechol. One such cryptand-like analogue is shown in <a href="#fig_2.25">Figure 2.25d</a>). The catechol cage molecule<a id="page_30" class="page">Page 30, 2 Cation Binding</a><a href="#fig_2.25"><b>2.35</b></a> was synthesized using both high dilution techniques (to form the free ligand) and an iron templated approach (to produce the iron-cage complex). These types of artificial siderophores have carefully tailored recognition sites, and consequently show extremely strong binding with high selectivity.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The coordination chemistry of Fe(III) is similar to that of Pu(IV).Thus artificial siderophores may find applications as sequestering agents for Pu(IV) leading to treatments for plutonium contamination of both people and the environment.</p>
<p class="h2a"><b>Summary and conculsions</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The aim of this chapter has been to demonstrate how receptor structure, complementarity with the substrate, and preorganization influence the strength and selectivity of complexes formed between polydentate receptors and cations. There are many examples of synthetic receptors for cations and this chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the area. Rather it gives a taste of a wide range of systems which will hopefully encourage the reader to consult the literature cited in the section below.</p>
