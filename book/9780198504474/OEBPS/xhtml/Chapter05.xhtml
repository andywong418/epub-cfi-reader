<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>	

<p class="noindent">The previous chapters have focused on the recognition of ionic guests. 
This chapter, however, discusses the recognition of uncharged guests, a goal which requires 
the use of different strategies to achieve strong, selective recognition. Neutral guest binding 
is a difficult task &#x2014; the armoury of non-covalent interactions at our disposal now includes 
hydrogen bonding, <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0;</i> stacking, the hydrophobic effect and charge transfer interactions. 
These interactions are highlighted in the examples illustrated in this chapter.</p>
<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_5.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1 Hydrogen bond</b> receptors</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Biological relevance</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen bonds are essential in biological systems. 
Their <i>directionality</i> means that host and guest must be perfectly 
aligned for interaction to occur and hydrogen bonds therefore help enzymes 
acquire the selectivity they require. An example of the importance which a 
<i>single hydrogen bond</i> <b></b>can possess is provided by vancomycin, 
the current antibiotic of last resort. Vancomycin operates by forming a hydrogen
 bonded complex with a peptide that is terminated by two D-alanine amino acids 
(D-Ala-D-Ala terminus) <b>(5.1).</b> This peptide building block is 
required by
 bacteria for their cell wall synthesis. Vancomycin binding prevents cell wall 
synthesis, killing the bacteria. Bacteria resistant to this powerful antibiotic 
are, however, beginning to emerge. They have evolved to synthesise their cell walls 
using peptides terminated with D-Ala-D-lactate <b>(5.2).</b> In other 
words, one amide group is replaced by an ester. This removes a single hydrogen bond from the
 complex, and prevents vancomycin from destroying the bacteria 
(<a href="#fig_5.1">Fig. 5.1</a>).</p>

the antibiotic Vancomycin.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The exquisite control which hydrogen bonds can yield has appealed to 
supramolecular chemists who want to direct their molecular building blocks as precisely as 
possible. In addition, many <i>biologically important guest molecules</i> <b></b>have multiple 
hydrogen bonding sites.</p>

<p class=""><a id="page_50" class="page" style="width:70%;">Page 50, 5 Neutral guest binding</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Complementary hydrogen bonding receptors</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A well designed hydrogen bonding receptor should possess hydrogen 
bonding groups which are <i>complementary</i> <b></b>to the desired guest. These groups
 must be <i>preorganised</i> <b></b>and <i>rigidly held,</i> <b></b>so that they v/ill 
interact with the guest molecule rather than collapsing down onto each other.
 Receptor <b>5.3</b>, 
synthesised by Andrew Hamilton and co-workers forms six hydrogen bonds with a complementary 
guest, such as a barbiturate in non-competitive solvents 
(<a href="#fig_5.2">Fig. 5.2</a>). Barbiturates are particularly interesting
 substrates due to their medical use as sedative and anti-convulsant drugs. T
he binding constant is highly dependent on the exact structure of the guest indicating 
the importance of good complementarity (<a href="#table_5.1">Table 5.1</a>). The strongest
 binding is observed when
 all six hydrogen bonds can be formed. When two of the carbonyl oxygens are removed, 
the complex formed has two less hydrogen bonds and, as a consequence, is much weaker. 
A crystal structure of the complex was obtained (<a href="#fig_5.3">Fig. 5.3</a>), providing 
further evidence for the binding mode.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Receptor <b>5.4</b> satisfies every possible hydrogen
 bond requirement of its complementary guest, urea (<a href="#fig_5.4">Fig. 5.4</a>). It is
 based on a fused ring system, which provides a high degree of rigidity and consequently,
 <i>preorganisation.</i> The recognition of urea was remarkably strong, with the complex
 even surviving in hot dimethylsulfoxide (this solvent is an excellent hydrogen bond acceptor 
and usually disrupts neutral hydrogen bond receptors). Receptor 
<b>5.4</b> illustrates how, 
with careful design, hydrogen bond recognition can yield a strong complex even in relatively 
competitive solvent media.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Secondary interactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Using arrays of hydrogen bonds, however, is not always as 
straightforward as choosing a complementary host-guest pair. Consider, for example,
 receptor <b>5.5:</b> it possesses Donor-Acceptor-Donor 
(DAD) hydrogen bonding fragments 
complementary to the Acceptor-Donor-Acceptor (ADA) groups of the guest
 (<a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>). Hydrogen bonds have considerable
 <i>electrostatic character,</i> <b></b>being formed between an electropositive 
hydrogen atom and an electronegative heteroatom. As Jorgensen first pointed out,
this electrostatic character
means</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_51" class="page" >Page 51, 5 Neutral guest binding</a></p>

<p class="noindent">that <i>diagonal interactions</i> in the array are also 
important in determining binding strength, and he referred to them as <i>secondary 
electrostatic interactions.</i> In an H-bond array, centres of like charge 
repel one another diagonally, weakening the binding (<a href="#fig_5.5">Fig. 5.5</a>). These 
secondary interactions can also be constructive, with the donors and acceptors organised
 such that all interactions are attractive, strengthening the array 
(<a href="#fig_5.6">Fig. 5.6</a>). Calculations indicated that diagonal secondary
 interactions contribute approximately one third of the strength of the primary 
hydrogen bonds themselves.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The secondary interaction hypothesis was experimentally proven by elegant work from the research group of Steve Zimmerman. The strength of interaction of a range of hosts and guests with different donor-acceptor arrays was investigated. The arrangement of donors and acceptors does indeed play a critical role in controlling the strength of complex formation. This is clearly illustrated by complexes <b>5.5</b> and <b>5.6,</b> which, although both containing three hydrogen bonds, have vastly different formation constants (<a href="#fig_5.7">Fig. 5.7</a>). The DAD* AD A array <b>(5.5)</b> contains only <i>destructive</i> secondary interactions and is weakly held, whilst DDD*AAA <b>(5.6)</b> has only <i>constructive</i> secondary interactions and is consequently favoured. Complexes of the type DDA*AAD <a id="page_52" class="page">Page 52, 5 Neutral guest binding</a>have intermediate binding strengths as two of the secondary interactions are attractive and two repulsive.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Chiral recognition</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters we have introduced optically active receptors,  which are capable of chiral recognition. This is a research target of particular importance because many biologically and medically important molecules exist as enantiomers. The directionality and controllability of hydrogen bonds makes them ideal for achieving chiral discrimination.</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_5.8" style="width:70%;text-align:center">

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Diederich and his research group at ETH Zurich have synthesised receptors for amino acid recognition. Receptor  <b>5.7</b>, for example, provides a cleft environment suitable for binding a dicarboxylic acid (<a href="#fig_5.8">Fig. 5.8</a>). In addition, the twisted binaphthalene unit has a chirality axis, placing the binding site in a chiral environment. Protected L(and D)-aspartic acid (a neurotransmitter) was bound in non-competitive chloroform solution. The enantiomeric receptor bound the two enantiomeric guests with different strengths (<a href="#table_5.2">Table 5.2</a>). The difference in binding strength for the two enantiomers (the enantioselectivity, AAG) was as high as 6.9 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>. The magnitude of this enantioselectivity was dependent on the spacer group (X), which alters the dihedral angle (0), and consequently the relative orientation of the receptor&#x2019;s hydrogen bonding groups (<a href="#table_5.2">Table 5.2</a>). This shows that by tuning the highly directional hydrogen bonding environment, the enantioselectivity can be enhanced.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Sugars are also chiral biological molecules of great importance. They possess a complex, three dimensional skeleton, however, and it is therefore difficult to design a perfect complementary host. Typical approaches to the goal of selective sugar binding have focussed on creating a binding cleft or cavity, such as receptor <b>5.8</b>, which contains a number of convergently focussed hydrogen bonding groups. This macrocyclic host is built from two naturally occurring, cheap, chiral steroid building blocks. It discriminates between&#x03B1; and (&#x03B2;- substituted diastereomeric sugars as well as the L- and D- enantiomers (<a href="#fig_5.9">Fig. 5.9</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Supplementing hydrogen bonds with other interactions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Biological systems, however, are not solely dependent on hydrogen bonds for molecular recognition. Often, hydrogen bonds provide <i>organisation</i> and <i>selectivity,</i> but their strength is enhanced by the use of other intermolecular interactions; in particular, <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0; interactions</i> and <i>hydrophobic effects.</i> Combining interactions in this way can lead to new modes of binding, as well as enhanced binding selectivity and strength.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Andrew Hamilton and co-workers reported a beautiful example of <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0;</i> stacking enhancing hydrogen-bond mediated recognition. Receptor <b>5.9</b> contains a DAD hydrogen bonding array, suitable for binding thymine derivatives (thymine is one of the four DNA bases). The receptor, however, also contains a naphthalene unit attached by flexible spacers, which can <i>n-n</i> stack with the aromatic ring of the bound substrate. Both nmr and crystallography illustrated that the receptor acts as a hinge, with the aromatic ring forming additional interactions with the bound guest 
(<a href="#scheme_5.1">Scheme 5.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Julius Rebek and his research team synthesised 
<i>molecular cleft</i> <b>5.10 </b>which has <i>convergent</i> hydrogen
 bonding groups(<a href="#scheme_5.2">Scheme 5.2</a>). These groups are complementary 
to derivatives of the nucleobase adenine, and the rigidity of the cleft prevents the
 hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from collapsing. Additionally the naphthalene 
spacer group of the receptor can stack with the <i>n</i>-system of the adenine guest species.</p>

the hydrogen bonds to polarise the guest, altering its electronic properties. These
 properties were monitored using electrochemistry, and UV-visible spectroscopy.

<p class="indent3-ka">The receptors discussed thus far operate in <i>non-competitive 
solvents</i> (e.g chloroform) which do not disrupt recognition. It is ultimately desirable, 
however, to bind biologically important guests in competitive solvents such as water 
(the biological medium). The use of the hydrophobic effect is a common feature in
 receptors that achieve this goal.</p>

 to build a macrocycle containing 'greasy' walls with a cavity large enough to 
encapsulate suitable hydrophobic guests.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A <i>cyclophane</i> is a cyclic molecule which possesses at 
least one aromatic
ring bridged by aliphatic chains. In order to bind a guest within the
cyclophane using hydrophobic interactions, we are particularly interested in
cyclophanes which have <i>parallel aromatic vmlls</i> which create a <i>well defined</i>
<i>cavity.</i> This class of molecule has been known for many years, and the
potential for guest encapsulation was considered as early as 1955, but most of
the systems available at this time were too small. The first unambiguous
example of inclusion within a cyclophane cavity (<b><a href="#fig_5.12">5.12</a></b>) was only 
obtained in
1980 by Koga and co-workers (<a href="#fig_5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>). The amines within the cyclophane
cavity mean that the receptor is protonated at low pH, and consequently
soluble in acidic aqueous solution. Binding studies were therefore carried out>
at pH&#x003C;2. <sup>1</sup>H NMR was particularly useful in providing information about the
inclusion complexes, for example the signals of bound 2,7-
dihydroxynaphthalene shifted dramatically 
(<a href="#fig_5.12">Fig. 5.12</a>). An acyclic analogue
exhibited no recognition, showing the importance of having a preorganised
cavity. Crystallography finally provided convincing evidence of the binding
mode with a crystalline complex of stoichiometry 5.12.
durene.4HC1.4H<sub>2</sub>0
being obtained (durene is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene). Durene was deeply
included within the cyclophane cavity (<a href="#fig_5.11">Fig. 5.11</a>). l-Anilinonaphthalene-8-
sulfonate was also used as a guest, its fluorescence spectrum was enhanced in
the presence of the cyclophane. The fluorescence data was used to generate a
binding constant (6250 M<sup>-1</sup>), illustrating the strong binding which can be
provided by hydrophobicity.</p>



<p class="noindent">The aromatic groups in the walls of the cyclophane endow the receptor
with two important features. Firstly, they are rigid, and consequently, the
cyclophane possesses a well defined, preorganised cavity, suitable for guest
binding. Secondly, they are hydrophobic groups and provide the
thermodynamic strength for recognition.</p>

<p class="noindent">After this initial report of hydrophobic guest binding in aqueous solution,
further cyclophanes such as 5.13 followed 
(<b><a href="#fig_5.13">Fig. 5.13</a></b>). The cavity in this
receptor is narrow and flat, and is ideally suited for the incorporation of flat
aromatic guests. Much use has been made of this cyclophane for the
assembly of more complex molecular architectures <i>via</i> charge transfer
interactions, as will be illustrated in Chapter Six.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"> <a id="page_56" class="page">Page 56, 5 Neutral guest binding</a>Cyclophanes 
<b>5.12</b> and <b>5.13</b> are solubilised by
 charged groups in the walls of the cyclophane cavity. These hydrophilic groups, however, reduce
the degree of hydrophobic stabilisation that occurs on guest binding. If the
charges required for solubilisation are held outside the macrocyclic ring they
cannot interfere with either the strength or the selectivity of binding. The first
cyclophanes with <i>external charges</i> were reported by Diederich and co-workers
(<a href="#fig_5.14">Fig. 5.14</a>). Crystallography indicated that their cavities were 
large and open,
preorganised for the recognition of hydrophobic guests. 
Receptor <b>5.14</b> can
solubilise or extract polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into aqueous
solution and binding constants were high. In particular, guests with larger
hydrophobic surfaces (such as pyrene) bind more strongly than smaller guests
(such as durene or naphthalene) due to better stereoelectronic complementarity
(<a href="#fig_5.15">Fig. 5.15</a>). Receptor <b>5.14</b> 
enhances the transport rate of pyrene through an
aqueous phase 430-fold (but durene only by a factor of 2).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Effect of solvent</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Thus far, we have simply stated that cyclophanes bind guests through 
hydrophobic interactions with apolar guests in water. In a key study, Diederich investigated
 the exact role of the solvent in this type of recognition.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The binding constant of a cyclophane-type receptor with pyrene 
was monitored in solvents ranging from very polar H2O/DMSO (99/1) to apolar carbon disulfide 
(CS2). The binding was strongest in water, and generally decreased as the polarity of the
 solvent decreased. Binding still occurs in non- aqueous solvents, however, and the binding 
strength in cyclophanes can therefore be considered to come from a generalised 
&#x2018;solvatophobic&#x2019; effect. Two main conclusions about the role of the solvent were 
drawn from this study: a) if the solvent molecules interact strongly with one another <i>(high 
cohesive interaction strength),</i> then complexation is stronger, because the equilibrium
 in <a href="Chapter01.xhtml#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a> 
(<a href="Chapter01.xhtml">see Chapter One</a>) is pulled to the right; b) 
if the solvent has <i>high 
polarizability,</i> then complexation is weaker as the solvent interacts efficiently 
with the uncomplexed host and guest through van der Waals interactions, pulling the equilibrium 
to the left. In fact, the binding<a id="page_57" class="page">Page 57, 5 Neutral guest binding</a>strength was directly correlated with an empirical solvent parameter (E<sub>T</sub>)
which incorporates these two factors. These observations explain why water
is such an ideal solvent for apolar recognition using cyclophanes. It has
strong cohesive interactions due to its ability to form extended hydrogen bond
networks, and its polarizability is very low. Consequently, guests bind very
strongly in water, and the source of binding strength is specifically referred to
as the &#x2018;hydrophobic&#x2019; effect.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Inclusion within other receptor cavities: cyclodextrins</b></h3>


<p class="noindent">Cyclodextrins are naturally occurring macrocycles composed of sugar units
and were first reported as long ago as 1891. There was at this stage, however,
no inkling of their structure or potential properties. They are obtained by the
enzymatic degradation of starch, a process which yields linear and cyclic
oligomers of glucose (referred to as dextrins and cyclodextrins respectively).
Their purification was achieved in the 1950s, and by the end of the 1960s,
concurrent with the rise of supramolecular chemistry, their potential to act as
host molecules was being actively investigated. There are three particularly
important cyclodextrins: a-Cyclodextrin contains 6 D-glucose units, (&#x03B2;-
cyclodextrin <b>(5.15)</b> 7, and &#x03B3;-cyclodextrin 8 
(<a href="#fig_5.16">Fig. 5.16</a> and <a href="#table_5.3">Table 5.3</a>). One
rim of the cavity possesses secondary hydroxyl groups, whilst the other rim
is functionalised with primary hydroxyl groups. The interior of the cavity is
non-polar and its ability to bind different guests has been of great interest.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Initially, the ability of unfunctionalised cyclodextrins to act as hosts was
investigated with a range of different guests, such as steroids. Steric and
electronic properties of the guest both play important roles. The primary
source of binding strength is a matter of some debate, but the hydrophobic
effect is believed to play a role. Hydrogen bonds or charge stabilisation from
the large number of OH groups can, however, also contribute to the binding
strength and alter the selectivity. Additionally, they permit the coordination
of more polar guests. The hydroxyl groups also allow functionalisation of the
cyclodextrin cavity and many reports have been made, often with the goal of
sensing the presence of the bound guest or enhancing catalysis 
(<a href="Chapter07.xhtml">see Chapter7</a>). Cyclodextrin chemistry is a 
huge and active area of research, primarily due
to the industrial availability of the macrocycles and their extremely low cost.</p>

<p class="noindent">The cation coordination abilities of calix[4]arenes were discussed in 
Chapter Two. Calix[n]arenes, however, are also a type of cyclophane possessing a hydrophobic 
cavity v/ith aromatic walls. They can be synthesised with different ring sizes, the commonest
 being those containing 4, 6 or 8 aromatic rings (calix[4]arene, calix[6]arene and calix[8]arene 
respectively). Calix[4]arenes such as p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene have been shown to bind small
 neutral guests such as toluene in both the solid and solution phase. The crystal structure
 indicated that the aromatic molecule was bound within the calix[4]arene cavity <i>via CH-&#x03C0;</i>
 hydrogen bonds (<a href="#fig_5.17">Fig. 5.17</a>). Solution phase studies indicated very 
weak toluene binding 
(K&#x003D; 1.1 M<sup>-1</sup>) but as the recognition was investigated in chloroform, in which no 
strong solvatophobic effect can operate, this is not surprising.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a id="page_58" class="page">Page 58, 5 Neutral guest binding</a>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the calixarene ring becomes bigger, the potential to bind larger,  more interesting guests increases. In particular, calixarenes have been used to bind fullerenes, a topic which will be discussed further in Chapter Seven.</p>


<h3 class="h3"><b>Inclusion within other receptor cavities: carcerands</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Donald Cram and his research team have specialised in the synthesis of
 unique functional molecular architectures, and as part of this program they developed the 
<i>carcerands</i> <b>(5.16).</b> These receptors are structurally related 
to the calixarenes 
and contain concave internal surfaces suitable for guest recognition. They can be visualised 
as two bowls which have been covalently connected in a &#x2018;head to head&#x2019; manner 
forming a molecular capsule (<a href="#fig_5.18">Fig. 5.18</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">During carcerand synthesis, small molecules such as ethanol, 
dimethyl- formamide (DMF), acetonitrile etc., became <i>trapped</i> inside the
 host. They can interact with the receptor through <i>van der Waals forces,</i> and once
 synthesis is complete, they cannot exit from the sealed capsule for steric reasons. They 
can be considered as &#x2018;incarcerated&#x2019;, and such complexes are referred to as
 carceplexes. Carcerands can be used to alter the properties of the imprisoned guest, for
 example, the rotational energy barrier of DMF is lower in a carceplex than when uncomplexed 
(<a href="#fig_5.19">Fig. 5.19</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Such receptors, however, do not allow recognition to occur once 
they have been synthesised, as the cavity is completely inaccessible. This led Cram and his 
co-workers to synthesise <i>hemi-carcerands,</i> in which some of the spacer groups
 then possess <i>larger entry and exit portals</i> around the recognition site and 
allow slow exchange of guest molecules (heat is required to force the guest out of the cavity
 entropically). These hemi-carcerands show a range of interesting recognition properties,
 including the stabilisation of otherwise unstable guest molecules, such as cyclobutadiene 
(<a href="#fig_5.20">Fig. 5.20</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.3	Coordination through dative bond formation</b></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Coordination chemistry or supramolecular chemistry?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When any new field of chemistry develops, there is naturally some overlap
 with other well established areas. Classical coordination chemistry has had a strong influence 
on supramolecular chemistry. In coordination chemistry, the formation of strong dative bonds
 enables guest binding even in competitive media. Many examples of the use of metal complexes,
 such as metalloporphyrins, for the recognition of small molecules (e.g. O2, NO, CO, substituted 
pyridines etc.) have been reported. There is, however, some debate in this grey area about what 
should be termed supramolecular chemistry.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Metallo-receptor for nucleic acid bases</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">
Receptor <b>5.17</b> which extracts solid nucleobases into acetone provides
 an elegant example of the use of coordination chemistry to assist in binding a neutral substrate. 
Guanine is bound through the formation of three intermolecular interactions: a) metal ion 
coordination of the nitrogen atom, b) hydrogen bonding between amine protons and ether oxygen
 atoms and c) <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0; </i>stacking 
(<a href="#fig_5.21">Fig. 5.21</a>). The coordinate bond orients 
the substrate in a perfect manner for forming the other complementary interactions. Analogous 
receptors which lacked the aromatic rings did not show significant extraction of guanine, 
indicating the important role of <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0;</i> stacking. The binding mode has been proven 
by crystallography. Interestingly, many enzymes use a strong coordinate interaction to support 
other, weaker intermolecular forces, which in turn provide binding selectivity.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Boronic acid receptors for sugars</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another recent use of dative bonds for the coordination of 
relatively complex neutral guest molecules has been pioneered by the research group 
of Seiji Shinkai in Japan. They have made extensive use of the interaction between 
<i>boronic acids</i> and hydroxy groups (Scheme 5.4) in order 
to create a range of 
functional receptors for sugars. Most importantly, the interaction between sugars 
and boronic acids readily occurs in aqueous media. High pH is required in order to 
facilitate the sugar complexation, but the base can also be provided intramolecularly,
 by the incorporation of an amine group in the receptor (e.g. <b>5.18).</b>
 This extends
 the pH range over which the receptor can operate.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The actual design of boronic acid based receptors follows a
 strategy with which we are, by now, familiar. Molecular clefts are synthesised in 
order to orient the recognition units in a <i>convergent</i> manner and, at
 the same time,<a id="page_60" class="page" >Page 60, 5 Neutral guest binding</a>
endow the host with some <i>substrate selectivity.</i> Receptor
 <b>5.18</b> (<a href="#fig_5.22">Fig. 5.22</a>) for example, 
shows a degree of selectivity for D-Glucose (<a href="#table_5.4">Table 5.4</a>). 
whilst other clefts prefer different saccharide guests. What is more, the receptor contains an 
anthracene unit, a fluorescent moiety. The fluorescent properties of this unit change on guest 
binding, and consequently this receptor can sense the presence of glucose molecules <i>via</i> 
a fluorescent response. The design of sensors, an important topic with great potential
 medical and environmental applications, will be discussed further in Chapter Seven.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The great advantage of receptors of this type, utilising relatively strong
dative bonds, is that they can still operate in <i>competitive media,</i> such as
aqueous solution, and therefore are of obvious potential importance and
utility in biological or medical applications.</p>

<p class="noindent">Neutral guests provide supramolecular chemists with some of the toughest
problems in the field of molecular recognition. They are often <i>highly</i>
<i>functionalised, biologically relevant</i> molecules which can be addressed in a
range of different ways. The role of <i>solvent,</i> which can act itself as a small
neutral guest, is critical. The elegant examples discussed in this chapter,
however, show the great strides which have been made into both achieving
and understanding this type of molecular recognition.</p>
