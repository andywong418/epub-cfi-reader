<p class="noindent">This final chapter examines some of the applications of supramolecular chemistry as well as speculating on what the future may hold for molecular assemblies. This includes new separation media for use in chromatography, novel sensors, new catalysts, new pharmaceuticals and even the creation of nanoscale molecular machinery.</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.1	<b>Phase transfer agents</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, we saw that crown ethers can <i>solubilize</i> salts in non-polar solvents. This has allowed their use as phase transfer agents in a number of organic reactions. For example, KF may be solubilized in acetonitrile by the addition of [18]crown-6. In this case, once in solution, the fluoride anion is relatively unsolvated and therefore strongly nucleophilic. (<a href="#scheme_7.1">Scheme 7.1</a>). Similarly, potassium permanganate is solubilized in benzene by dicyclohexyl-[ 18]crown-6. So called &#x2018;purple benzene&#x2019; is a powerful oxidizing reagent as a result of benzene&#x2019;s inability to solvate and stabilize the anion (<a href="#scheme_7.2">Scheme 7.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">7.2 <b>Separation of mixtures</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The production of new materials that allow the separation of one species from a mixture containing many components is of prime importance. For example, removal of pollutants such as toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions is environmentally important. This process involves molecular recognition and therefore lies at the heart of supramolecular chemistry.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Solid supports</b></p>
<p class="noindent">By attaching a receptor to a solid support we create a modified material that can be used for the <i>removal</i> of a particular substrate from a mixture <i>e.g.</i> by adding the modified solid support to a solution containing the target substrate and then filtering off the solid support with the substrate bound to it.</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>Alternatively the modified solid support may be used as a <i>separation medium</i>in chromatography. The modified support is packed into a column and mixtures of substrates passed over it. In this way, separations may be achieved according to the differences in the binding constants of the various substrates with the solid bound receptor species.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Izatt, Bradshaw and Christensen have produced a number of such materials designed to selectively remove or concentrate metal ions in solution, for example silica gel modified with [18]crown-6 (<a href="#scheme_7.3">Scheme 7.3</a>). The metal ion selectivity of the silica bound crown ether was found to be similar to the free crown ether. Aqueous solutions containing mixtures of cations were passed through this material in order determine the selectivity of the gel for particular cations. It was found that Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> was bound 10 times more strongly than Sr<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and 339 times more strongly than Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Therefore when a mixture when a mixture of these cations is run through the crown ether modified silica gel, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is bound most weakly and emerges from the column first. Ba<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is bound most strongly and emerges from the column last.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Using the same strategy, these researchers have attached thiacrown ethers to silica gels and produced materials that are capable of removing precious and/or toxic metals from aqueous solutions. Binding constants for competitive, undesired base metals such as Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Fe<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> were at least 10 orders of magnitude less than constants for precious Au<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and Ag<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, or toxic Pd<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Hg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. An area of intense current activity is the development of solid supported extraction agents for the separation of radioactive metals. Such extraction media would allow removal of uranium and plutonium residues from power station waste, enabling a more efficient treatment of nuclear waste.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Cram and co-workers have attached chiral crown ethers to polystyrene resin and used the resulting materials to achieve chiral chromatographic separations of a-amino acids and ester salts. An example of an <i>RR</i>-binaphthyl crown ether modified support is shown in <a href="#fig_7.1">Fig. 7.1</a>. Chiral substrates passing through a column made of this material interact with the crown ethers forming diastereomeric complexes which have different stability constants. The <i>R</i>-enantiomer forms a thermodynamically more stable complex with the host and is more strongly bound to the column. Therefore, the S-enantiomer emerges from the column first and resolution of the enantiomers is achieved (<a href="#fig_7.2">Fig. 7.2</a>). Chiral chromatographic separations are of great interest to the<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>pharmaceutical industry, which often has to resolve two enantiomers of a chiral drug which possess completely different activities.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This technique is not limited to separating mixtures of cations. Very recently, calixpyrrole (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) modified silica gels have been used to separate anionic mixtures. <a href="#fig_7.3">Figure 7.3</a> shows the separation of short nucleic acid strands (oligonucleotides) with such a gel. The oligonucleotides range from 12 to 18 bases in length and are anionic (they contain negatively charged phosphate groups). The longer oligonucleotides (e.g. the 18-mer) are retained on the column longer than the shorter oligomers. This reflects the fact that the longer oligonucleotides have more phosphate groups and therefore a higher chance of interacting with a particular calixpyrrole.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.3 Molecular sensors</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">A receptor may be used as a sensor if it can report the presence of the guest by some physical means. A sensor should ideally be selective for a particular guest and not only report the presence of the guest molecule, but should also allow the chemist to monitor its concentration. This is important medically (for monitoring indicators of physiological function) and environmentally (monitoring pollutant levels). Two different strategies have been applied to sensor production.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">Firstly, the receptor can be used to create a modified material, for example an electrode. The receptor is incorporated into a polymer electrode, and this modified electrode can then show a selective response to the presence of the ion for which the receptor is selective, allowing the quantitative determination of ion concentrations in solution. This important topic is included in another primer text (Chemical Sensors by R.W. Cattrall) to which the interested reader is directed for further information.</p>





<p class="indent3-ka"><a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alternatively, the sensing function can actually be incorporated at a molecular level. This is achieved by combining a binding site and a reporter group in one molecule (<a href="#scheme_7.5">Scheme<b> 7.5</b></a>). The reporter group is chosen to have electrochemical or spectroscopic properties that are altered by the proximate host-guest interaction. This electrochemical or spectroscopic output can therefore be used to quantitatively detect specific guests.</p>

 such a sensor to be useful, the receptor should be<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"> <i>

 must be <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>coupled</i></span> to the redox reaction; in other words the redox active centre must &#x2018;feel the presence

 ferrocene, quinone and bipyridinium (<a href="#fig_7.4">Fig. 7.4</a>). So far, the coupling has been realized through one or a combination 
of the following four pathways:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a) Through-space electrostatic interaction between the redox centre(s) and the complexed guest molecule (<a href="#fig_7.5"><b>7.5</b></a>);</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A change in the redox properties of the receptor can be detected by an electrochemical technique
 such as cyclic voltammetry (CV). <a href="#fig_7.5">Figure 7.5</a> shows how the cyclic voltammogram of receptor

 of<a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>sodium cations. Changes in the cyclic voltammogram can therefore be used to sense the presence of
 this guest. This approach to sensing has also been extensively used for anionic guests (for example receptors 
<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_40"><b>3.23</b></a>-<a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_40"><b>3.25</b></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Optical sensors</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The commonest type of optical sensor is <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>
fluorescent,</i></span> combining a binding site with a
 fluorescent unit (fiuorophore). If there is efficient coupling between the two, the sensor detects the presence of 
the bound guest through its fluorescent output. Fluorescent sensors are especially attractive as they give a meaningful
 physical output which is easy to measure even at very low concentrations (light can be detected in very small 
quantities). They are, therefore, very <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>sensitive</i></span> and suitable for use in biological systems.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In spite of these advantages, the number of commercial fluorescent sensors on the market is still
 relatively small. Sensor <b>7.9</b> is commercially used to monitor physiological levels of sodium
 ions (<a href="#fig_7.6">Fig. 7.6</a>). The crown
 ether binds the guest cation, the charge on which alters the electric field experienced by the fiuorophore. This 
changes the wavelengths and intensities of fluorescence (absorption/emission) and allows the concentration of sodium 
ions to be determined. The sensor is popular with biologists as it is easily calibrated and can pass through cell 
membranes (when esterified).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Chemists are now developing sensors for more structurally demanding guests in competitive solvents;
 a challenging goal. An excellent example is provided by a sensor for citrate anions developed in research from the 
group of Eric Anslyn. Tridentate guanidinium based receptor <b>7.10</b> shows a high affinity and selectivity for the tricarboxylate citrate anion (<a href="#fig_7.7">Fig. 7.7</a>). Neither of these two components, however, are inherently fluorescent, and in order to convert the receptor into a sensor, a clever strategy was utilized. A mixture of <b>7.10</b> and carboxyfluorescein
(<b>7.11</b>) was made. Substrate <b>7.11</b>, which is fluorescent, binds to the receptor, but quite weakly, as it only possesses
two carboxylate groups. When tricarboxylate citrate is added to the mixture, it therefore displaces 
<b>7.11</b>. The fluorescent properties of <b>7.11</b> change considerably on its release from the complex, and in this way, a sensory 
response to the addition of citrate is obtained. Model solutions showed the sensor to be very accurate and soft 
drinks (including Orange Juice, Coca Cola and Mountain Dew) were then investigated. The sensor detected the<a id="page_87" class="page">Page 87, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>concentration of citrate anions even in the presence of common anionic contaminants present in

<h2 class="h2">7.4<span class="space">&#160;</span> Switches and Molecular Machinery</h2>
<p class="noindent">As computer technology becomes ever more complex and miniaturized, scientists have begun to see the
 limitations of existing technologies for progressing to even smaller, more efficient devices. It has therefore been
 proposed that instead of using silicon chips, the next wave of technology could use individual molecules for contro
lling and storing information, acting as on-off <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>switches</i></span>
 and <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>logic gates.</i> </span>This approach to 
<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>&#x2018;
machines on the nanometre scale&#x2019;</i> </span>s(molecule-sized machines) has generated much excitement, and there are now
 many examples of molecules with controllable and addressable physical properties. In particular, the development of 
devices which use light as the input or output are of interest, as light has maximal velocity and can be easily 
controlled using fibreoptics.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A.P. de Silva and co-workers have developed a series of molecular switches and logic gates.
 Compound <b>7.12</b>, for example, acts as a switch. When no protons are present, the anthracene is not fluorescent, as 
photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the amine nitrogen to the aromatic rings, quenching the fluorescent emission.
 In the presence of protons, however, the nitrogen atom protonates, preventing PET from occurring, and emission from 
the anthracene unit is therefore observed (<a href="#fig_7.8">Fig. 7.8</a>).<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic">
 <i>Protons switch on the fluorescence.</i></span> This molecule could 
be considered as a molecular logic gate, because dependent on proton concentration there are two possible responses: 
on and off (1 and 0).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Using similar principles, an AND logic gate was developed (<b>7.13</b>). This receptor possesses two
 distinct binding sites: an amine group (binds protons) and a crown ether (binds sodium ions). In the absence of 
either guest PET can occur from both of these binding sites to the anthracene unit, and fluorescence is quenched. 
Only when sodium binds to the crown <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>and</i></span> a proton to the amine are <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic">
<i>both</i></span> PET pathways inhibited; the molecule becoming fluorescent (<a href="#fig_7.9">Fig. 7.9</a>). 
The action of this type of switch is reversed by adding free base and cryptands to scavenge the guest ions from the 
switch.</p>

<p class="noindent">This book has particularly focused on molecular recognition. In biology, however, binding is 
often a prelude to catalytic conversion of the bound substrate, and supramolecular chemists have also made a number
 of approaches to achieving the goal of specific, controlled catalytic conversion.</p>

<p class="noindent">The guest may be bound to a receptor in such a way that<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic">

 in Jean-Marie Lehn&#x2019;s research group, illustrates how this approach can lead to bond cleavage. The crown ether 
binds the ammonium cation of the guest, and this orients the guest so that the nucleophilic thiol can attack its labile
 ester carbonyl group releasing <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>para-</i></span>nitrophenol. 
Interestingly, the receptor shows some of the features of an enzyme. It is substrate selective and enhances the 
reaction rate with slow but definite catalytic turnover (<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>i.e

<p class="indent3-ka">In a similar manner, functionalized cyclodextrins (see<a href="Chapter05.xhtml"> Chapter 5</a>) have frequently been used for

</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">Sanders and co-workers used their porphyrin trimer (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_70"><b>6.30</b></a>) to stabilize a transition state in this
 way. The Diels Alder reaction they investigated (<a href="#fig_7.12">Fig.7.12</a>) uses pyridine functionalized substrates which can bind to 
the zinc atoms of <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_70"><b>6.30</b></a>. The reaction has two different products: endo (kinetic product) and exo (thermodynamic
product). Without the catalyst (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_70"><b>6.30</b></a>) at equilibrium the products are in a 
4:1 exo: endo ratio. However in the presence of <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_70"><b>6.30</b></a> the product is purely 
the exo form (no endo product could be detected <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>at any stage
</i> </span>during 
the reaction). The catalyst therefore stabilizes the exo transition state, probably because the pyridine nitrogen 
atoms are more suitably aligned for<a id="page_90" class="page">Page 90, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>
complexation to <a href="Chapter06.xhtml#page_70"><b>6.30</b></a> in this form. This illustrates the
 use of transition state
stabilisation by a supramolecular catalyst to change the outcome of an
organic reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Supramolecular catalysis appeals to the innate interests of chemists
wishing to use structure to control reactivity and also has great potential for
application, particularly when traditionally demanding organic conversions
can be efficiently catalysed, perhaps even with unusual regio- or stereo-
selectivities.</p>

<p class="noindent">Supramolecular chemistry is now at a stage of development where it can be successfully applied in 
the field of pharmaceutical research.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>MRI contrast and anti-cancer agents</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Figure <a href="#fig_7.13">7.13</a> shows some paramagnetic lanthanide complexes which are contrast agents for magnetic 
resonance imaging, some of which are in current clinical use. Contrast agents are designed to accumulate in a 
particular part of the body (e.g. the cardiovascular system, the liver, or in tumours) and enhance visibility in MRI
 (magnetic resonance imaging) scans (due to the high paramagnetism of the lanthanide ion enhancing water proton 
relaxation) so allowing any abnormalities to be seen. An essential feature of these complexes is that they are 
kinetically inert and so do not release toxic lanthanide ions in the body before they are excreted.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Texaphyrin is an expanded porphyrin first synthesized by Sessler and co-workers 
(<a href="#fig_7.14">Fig. 7.14</a>). The two metal complexes Gd-Tex (<b>7.19</b>) and Lu-Tex 
(<b>7.20</b>), shown in <a href="#fig_7.14">Figure 7.14</a>, were found to localize in<span class="noindent"

<p class="indent3-ka">The gadolinium complex Gd-Tex is currently undergoing trials for use as a radiation sensitizer. A
 cancer patient is dosed with <b>7.19</b> which accumulates in the tumour. Later the patient is exposed
 to radiation. It is 
currently thought that Gd-Tex, exists in cells as a dication. When exposed to ionizing<a id="page_91" class="page">Page 91, 7 Present &#x0026; future applications</a>radiation <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>in vivo</i></span> the Gd-Tex molecule captures an electron and becomes a <b>&#x03C0;-</b> radical
 cation. This process of electron capture is thought to augment the effective local concentration of hydroxyl radicals,
 the dominant cytotoxin produced by ionizing radiation. It is also believed that Gd-Tex and its radical cation serve to
 inhibit various repair enzymes including those associated with DNA repair. <a href="#fig_7.15">Figure 7.15</a> shows two brain scans of a 
patient before and after treatment with Gd-Tex. A brain tumour is clearly visible on the upper scan which vanishes 
after treatment with Gd-Tex and exposure to radiation (lower scan).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The lutetium complex (<b>7.20</b>) is currently showing promise as a 
<span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>photodynamic therapy agent</i></span> 
for destroying tumours. This complex also localizes in tumour cells and when exposed to visible light, is excited to
 a short lived exited state that may cross over into a long lived triplet state. The triplet state can convert normal 
triplet oxygen into singlet oxygen (a highly reactive form of oxygen that destroys cellular components, killing the
 tumour). The light can de delivered in a laser beam or along a fibre optic cable and so the site of drug action is
 limited to the tumour itself. Texaphyrin absorbs far out to the red (at 732 nm for the Lu-Tex complex). This is an
 advantage over other currently available PDT agents because at these wavelengths flesh is transparent (if you look 
at a bright lightbulb through your hand, red light will pass through). Therefore Lu-Tex could potentially be used to
 treat tumours that are deeper in the body than other photosensitizer drugs. Another photodynamic therapy agent
 Photofrin&#x2122; (a mixture of porphyrin products) has already received approval for clinical use; the only PDT
 sensitizer to receive such approval so far.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Bicyclam:	anti-HIV activity</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Molecules of interest to supramolecular chemists can also have surprising activity against 
important disease targets. Linked bicyclam <b>7.21</b> (a receptor for two transition metal cations - 
<a href="#fig_7.16">Fig. 7.16</a>) shows 
potent inhibition of the HIV virus at an early stage in its replication cycle. It is possible that this inhibition
is mediated by transition metals. Synthetic chemists have tuned both the properties and activity of the potential 
drug by varying the spacer group.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Drug design</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The pathways of disease are becoming increasingly well understood on the<span class="noindent" 
style="font-family:times-italic"> <i>molecular level.</i></span> 
Many enzymes which play key roles in the development of diseases, such as HIV, have had their structures elucidated. 
A rational approach to curing such diseases is to find a molecule that binds very strongly at the active site of such 
an enzyme, turning off its usual function: an <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>inhibitor.</i>
</span>Therefore, many medicinal chemists look at the structure of the active site to try to &#x2018;design&#x2019; a better inhibitor. This approach requires a precise
 understanding of the interactions between molecules combined with considerable computer power to visualize the 
orientation of modified inhibitors in the binding pocket. This fundamental approach to drug design, however, can 
yield improved inhibitors.</p>

<p class="noindent">Supramolecular chemistry is now a mature research area, and as such, it is surprising that there
 are very few books which attempt to survey the field at an introductory level. We hope that in this short text we have
 provided a guidebook to the principles of molecular recognition, building from simple recognition to more complex, 
functional systems. In this final chapter, we have tried to give an insight into the excitement that drives the field 
forwards, and should, in the near future, lead to an increasing number of &#x2018;supermolecules&#x2019; becoming a
 part of everyday life.</p>
