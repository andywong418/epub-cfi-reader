<p class="noindent">For many years, chemists have synthesized molecules and investigated their physical and chemical properties. The field of <i>supramolecular chemistry,</i> however, has been defined as&#x2018;chemistry beyond the molecule&#x2019;, and involves investigating new molecular systems in which the most important feature is that the components are held together reversibly by <i>intermolecular forces, not by covalent bonds.</i> Chemists working in this area can be thought of as architects combining individual covalently bonded molecular building blocks, designed to be held together by intermolecular forces (supramolecular glue), in order to create functional architectures
 (<a href="#fig_1.1">Fig. 1.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Supramolecular chemistry is a <i>multidisciplinary</i> field, and therefore requires a grasp of a range of basic principles. This introduction describes a generalized approach to supramolecular science and provides an indication of the wide ranging interests of chemists working in this area. Biological systems often provide inspiration, organic and inorganic chemistry are required for the synthesis of the pre-designed supramolecular components, and physical chemistry is used to fully understand their properties. Finally, a degree of technical expertise can lead to functioning devices ready for application to the real world. Perhaps the most important assets of a supramolecular chemist, however, are imagination and creativity, which have given rise to a wide range of beautiful and functional systems, as the remaining chapters of this Primer will illustrate using specific examples.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b> Complementarity in biology; how things fit together</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the most important concepts introduced in this Primer is <i>complementarity.</i> The most elegant examples of complementary molecular systems are biological in origin and so strictly outside the scope of this book. They do, however, provide a deep source of inspiration and lay down a challenging standard for supramolecular chemists to attempt to match.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-7em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">As supramolecular chemistry is a multidisciplinary field, the terminology used has evolved from various sources including inorganic, organic, physical and biological chemistry.
This has lead to a number of different terms being used to describe the host and guest This can be quite confusing if you are new to this area of chemistry. For example, a receptor molecule (an enzyme in biological chemistry) might also be referred to as a host molecule or a binding agent. The substrate that the molecule binds might also be referred to as a guest species.</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">An enzyme may catalyze a single reaction with high or total specificity; the active site of the enzyme being complementary to the substrate (or more specifically to the transition state of the catalysed reaction). In other words, the size, shape and position of the binding sites within the active site are ideal for specific substrate recognition. Emil Fischer described this idea in 1894 as the <i>&#x2018;Lock and Key&#x2019; principle.</i> <a href="#fig_1.2">Figure 1.2</a> shows a stylized representation of the lock and key. The arrangement of binding sites in the host (lock) is complementary to the guest (key) both sterically and electronically.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">An example of the lock and key principle in Nature is provided by carboxypeptidase-A, an enzyme that selectively catalyses the hydrolysis of the C-terminal amino-acid residues of proteins. It is the zinc ion at the enzyme active site that catalyses the removal of an amino-acid residue from the carbon end of the polypeptide chain. <a href="#fig_1.3">Figure 1.3</a> shows an illustration of the active site of carboxypeptidase-A with a bound peptide chain. The anionic carboxylate terminus of this bound peptide is hydrogen bonded to the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg-145 forming a salt-bridge (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml#sec_3.6">Section 3.6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The active site also possesses a hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the side chain of the substrate&#x2019;s C-terminal residue. Therefore, if the C-terminal of the polypeptide chain possesses a hydrophobic residue (e.g. phenylalanine), then the enzyme is more likely to bind that particular peptide chain than one lacking such a group. This hydrophobic pocket<a id ="page_3" class="page">Page 3, 1 Introduction</a> provides the enzyme with a mechanism by which it can select <i>specific peptides</i> for hydrolysis, accomplished by the Lewis acidic zinc centre.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Perhaps the most important example of complementarity, however, is base pairing in the <i>DNA double helix. A</i> single DNA strand is composed of purine and pyrimidine bases linked to a backbone of phosphorylated sugars. The DNA double helix combines two antiparallel strands which are held together by complementary hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases.</p>

<figcaption class="fcaption"><b>Fig. 1.4</b> Hydrogen bonded complementary A-T and G-C base pairs in DNA.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">The hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on the nucleic acid bases are arranged such that adenine (A) forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine (T), whereas guanine (G) complements cytosine (C) with the formation of three hydrogen bonds, therefore only A-T and G-C base pairs usually form (<a href="#fig_1.4">Fig.</a><a id ="page_4" class="page">Page 4, 1 Introduction</a><a href="#fig_1.4">1.4</a>). This complementarity extends from individual base pairs to the whole double helical DNA structure in which one strand (e.g. CCTTATAGAGG) is complementary to the other (e.g. GG A AT ATCTCC).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Valinomycin is a naturally occurring macrocyclic antibiotic, first isolated in 1955, that selectively transports potassium cations across mitochondrial membranes in the presence of sodium cations. It has a cyclic structure consisting of three identical repeated fragments each containing D- hydroxyisovaleric acid, D-valine, L-lactic acidand L-valine (<a href="#fig_1.5">Fig. 1.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is complexed by the electronegative oxygen atoms of the antibiotic
ester groups and once it is encapsulated within the macrocycle it can be efficiently transported through the hydrophobic membrane. The membrane is lipophilic and so will not normally allow charged species to pass through. The exterior of the K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-valinomycin complex, however, has peripheral alkyl groups that are&#x2018;greasy&#x2019; providing the complex with solubility in the membrane and allowing transport of the metal ion. The lipophilic exterior can be seen in the crystal structure of the potassium complex (<a href="#fig_1.6">Fig. 1.6</a>). The conformation adopted by valinomycin on K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> complexation is stabilized by six NCO&#x2014;HN hydrogen bonds around the periphery of the macrocycle.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Non-covalent interactions; the forces at our disposal</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">This book, however, is concerned with the design, synthesis, coordination and assembly properties of molecules <i>designed by the chemist</i>&#x2014; not by Nature. The glue used by supramolecular chemists to hold molecules together is non-covalent, and there are a number of such interactions that can be utilized. They include:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<p class="noindent">(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;electrostatics (ion-ion, ion-dipole and dipole-dipole);</p>
<p class="noindent">(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;hydrogen bonding;</p>
<p class="noindent">(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#x03C0;-&#x03C0; stacking interactions;</p>
<p class="noindent">(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;dispersion and induction forces (van der Waals forces);</p>
<p class="noindent">(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;hydrophobic or solvatophobic effects.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The bond energy of a typical single covalent bond is around 350 kJmol <sup>-1</sup> rising up to 942 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for the very stable triple bond in N<sub>2</sub>. The strengths of many of the non-covalent interactions used by supramolecular chemists are<a id ="page_5" class="page">Page 5, 1 Introduction</a>generally much weaker ranging from 2 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for dispersion forces, through to 20 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for a hydrogen bond to 250 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for an ion-ion interaction. The power of supramolecular chemistry lies in the combination of a number of weak interactions, allowing strong and selective recognition of specific guests to be achieved.</p>

<p class="aside1"><b>Fig. 1.7</b> Electrostatic interactions (ion-ion, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole).</p></figure></aside>

<p class="noindent">&#x2022; <i>Electrostatic interactions</i> (such as the ion-dipole interactions that operate in valinomycin) are based on the Coulombic attraction between opposite charges (<a href="#fig_1.7">Fig. 1.7</a>). Ion-ion interactions are non-directional, whilst for ion-dipole interactions the dipole must be suitably aligned for optimal binding efficiency. The high strength of electrostatic interactions has made them a prized tool amongst supramolecular chemists for achieving strong binding. There are many receptors for cations (crown ethers, cryptands and spherands discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) and anions (protonated or alkylated polyammonium macrobicycles discussed in <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>) which employ electrostatic interactions to hold the guest in place.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; Arrays of <i>hydrogen bonds,</i> such as those employed in biological systems (e.g. the DNA double helix), have been utilized in receptors designed to coordinate neutral organic species such as barbiturates, short chain alcohols and amides (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>), and also anions (<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). The directional nature of hydrogen bonds, combined v/ith the precision with which the individual components can be built into molecular systems has made them especially attractive to molecular designers. This has facilitated the construction of complex architectures (such as rosettes see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>

Attractive interactions can occur in either a&#x2018;face-to-face&#x2019; or&#x2018;edge-to- face&#x2019; manner (for example benzene crystallizes in a&#x2018;herring-bone&#x2019; arrangement maximising edge-to-face contacts). Current theories suggest this attractive force is electrostatic in nature. Some very elegant receptors have been synthesized employing &#x03C0;-&#x03C0; interactions, including a receptor for benzoquinone (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p class="aside1"><b>Fig. 1.9</b> Origin of the hydrophobic effect.</p></figure></aside>

<p class="noindent">&#x2022; <i>Dispersion forces</i> (or induced dipole-induced dipole interactions) are attractive forces between molecules that occur when instantaneous dipoles in the electron clouds around each molecule interact favourably. These van der Waals forces are believed to provide additional enthalpic stabilisation to the coordination of a hydrophobic guest into a hydrophobic cavity. They are, however, of a very general nature and so it is difficult to design receptors specifically to take full advantage of them. One such system may be a self- assembled &#x2018;tennis-ball&#x2019; that can encapsulate xenon atoms (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; The <i>hydrophobic effect</i> (<a href="#fig_1.9">Fig. 1.9</a>) is the specific driving force for the association of apolar binding partners in aqueous solution. Water molecules around the apolar surfaces of a hydrophobic cavity arrange themselves to form a structured array. Upon guest complexation the water molecules are released and become disordered. This results in a favourable increase in entropy. In addition, there is believed to be an enthalpic component to the hydrophobic effect. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules are larger than the interactions between the water molecules and apolar solutes, providing an enthalpic force for apolar guest coordination (i.e. when the water in the apolar cavity is released into the bulk solvent it can maximize its hydrogen bonding<a id ="page_6" class="page">Page 6, 1 Introduction</a>interactions). Receptors containing hydrophobic interior cavities designed to encapsulate organic guest molecules in aqueous solution include the cyclophanes and cyclodextrins (<a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; <i>Classical coordination chemistry</i> (i.e. the coordination of metals by ligands donating two electrons to form a dative bond) although <i>not strictly</i> a non- covalent interaction is also widely used in supramolecular chemistry. The geometric requirements of metal ions, combined with the design of specific ligands has permitted the construction of complex and eye-catching molecular topologies including catenanes, double and triple helices, and molecular grids (<a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x2022; <i>Steric repulsion.</i> This diminishes the strength of interactions as two molecules cannot occupy the same space. As may be expected from the lock and key analogy, however, it can play a very important role in determining the selectivity of a receptor species for a particular substrate and the stability of a specific complex.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka" style="margin-top:1.3em;">The forces described above can be used individually, but it is more usual for the supramolecular chemist to use these forces in concert to maximize the <i>selectivity</i> and <i>tunability</i> of the new receptor and also increase the strength of the complex formed.</p>

<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_1.3">
<h2 class="h2"><b>1.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Design principles: chelate and macrocyciic effects</b></h2>

<p class="noindent">Any architect has certain guiding principles to help design successful structures. The situation is no different for the molecular architect who must employ the non-covalent forces described above in order to recognize and bind a specific guest. <i>Design principles</i> are therefore applied in order to achieve the desired intermolecular interaction, with a number of factors being used to increase the strength of the intended host-guest complex. In particular, chelating or macrocyciic ligands are frequently employed due to the high thermodynamic stability of their complexes.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>chelate effect</i> refers to the enhanced stability of a complex containing chelate rings as compared to a similar system containing fewer or no rings. This is most clearly illustrated by comparing two different ligands: ethylene diamine and ammonia (<a href="#fig_1.10">Fig. 1.10</a>).</p>
<figure class="fig1" id="fig_1.10" style="width:100%;text-align:left;">
<img src="../images/page_6_1.jpg" alt="images"/>
<p class="noindent">&#160;</p>
<figcaption  style="margin-left:-7em;"><b>Fig. 1.10</b> Chelating ligands bind metal ions more strongly.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">The metal complex containing <i>bidentate</i> ethylene diamine (1,2- diaminoethane) is almost ten orders of magnitude more stable than that containing no chelating ligands. The reason for this lies in thermodynamic considerations. An increase in the overall binding constant (&#x03B2;) corresponds to a more negative value of &#916;G&#x00B0; (for a precise definition of &#x03B2; see <a href="#fig_1.11">Fig. 1.11</a>). This would result from either a more negative enthalpy or a more positive entropy on complexation. For ammonia binding, six ligands replace six<a id ="page_7" class="page">Page 7, 1 Introduction</a>waters and so the number of independent species in solution remains the same. Ethylene diamine, however, is bidentate so three ligands displace six waters, increasing the number of independent species in the system and causing an increase in entropy, thus lowering &#916;G&#x00B0;. Enthalpic factors also play a role. The polar amino groups, which are separated in ammonia, are 
covalently brought together in ethylene diamine overcoming a part of their mutual repulsion, making coordination energetically more favourable.Another more subtle factor is the increase in basicity (and consequently metal binding ability) of the ethylene diamine amino groups resulting from the inductive effect of the alkyl bridge.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Interestingly, from five membered chelate rings upwards, the chelate effect decreases in magnitude with increasing ring size (four membered rings are unstable due to extreme ring strain). This can be explained by considering the configurational entropy of the chelate chain. The longer the chain, the higher the configurational entropy and so ring formation becomes increasingly improbable.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">It is perhaps surprising that five membered chelate rings are considerably more stable with large met ions than six membered chelate ring systems. This can be explained by a consideration of ring strain. The chair form of cyclohexane is shown in <a href="#fig_1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>. In an unstrained six membered chelate ring containing sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized atoms the bond angles will be the same as those in the chair form of cyclohexane, namely 109.5&#x00B0;. Therefore in an unstrained six membered chelate ring system (we could imagine replacing one carbon in cyclohexane with a metal and the two adjacent carbon atoms with<a id ="page_8" class="page">Page 8, 1 Introduction</a> nitrogens) the bite size is only 2.5&#x00C5;. However a five membered chelate ring system (we could imagine removing two carbon atoms and replacing themwith a single metal such that the C-C-M bond angles in the ring are 109.5&#x00B0;,then replace the carbon atoms adjacent to the metal with nitrogen atoms) hasa larger bite size of 3.0&#x00C5; and has more space (2.5&#x00C5; compared to 1.6&#x00C5;) toincorporate a metal ion guest without straining the chelate bridge (<a href="#fig_1.12">Fig. 1.12</a>).So five membered chelate rings containing the larger Pb<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> are more stablethan five membered chelate rings containing the smaller Cu<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>macrocyclic effect</i> is related to the chelate effect and refers to the
increased thermodynamic stability of macrocyclic systems compared to their
acyclic analogues. Consider the complexation of zinc (II) by two ligands: one
acyclic (<a href="#fig_1.13"><b>1.1</b></a>) and one macrocyclic (<a href="#fig_1.13"><b>1.2</b></a>) (<a href="#fig_1.13">Fig. 1.13</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The formation of zinc (II) complexes by <a href="#fig_1.13"><b>1.1</b></a> and <a href="#fig_1.13"><b>1.2</b></a> have the thermodynamic parameters shown in <a href="#table_1.1">Table 1.1</a>. In this instance the macrocyclic effect causes an increase in complex stability by just over four orders of magnitude. This increased stability is caused by a combination of enthalpic and entropic factors, with the relative importance of each term varying from case to case, although enthalpy frequently provides a dominant contribution. Macrocylic hosts are less heavily solvated than their acyclic analogues and therefore less energy is required for desolvation (coordination is more enthalpically favourable). Macrocyclic ligands are also less flexible and consequently have less disorder to lose on complexation than their acyclic analogues (in other words, coordination is more entropically favourable because of the relative rigidity of the receptor; see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Sections 2.3</a>, <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.4">2.4</a> and <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.5">2.5</a>). Additionally, macrocyclic complexes are also more kinetically inert than theiracyclic analogues (i.e. their rates of complexation and decomplexation are generally slower).</p>




<p class="indent3-ka">The enhanced binding of guest species provided by chelating or macrocyclic hosts has been employed in the design of many receptors operating through a variety of intermolecular forces. <i>Molecular design</i> is a key theme of this book, and the examples discussed in later chapters are chosen to highlight these and other design principles which supramolecular chemists frequently utilize.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Structural Information</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Crystallography:</i> Perhaps the most convincing evidence of a supramolecular interaction is a crystal structure of the host-guest complex (e.g. <a href="#fig_1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>, see also <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.3">Section 2.3</a>). Crystallography clearly shows the binding site, and if the complex is as planned by the molecular designer. It also gives information about the interactions that hold the guest in place. A crystal structure, however, is only valid for the solid state, as factors such as crystal packing (which do not come into play in solution or the gas phase) may alter the properties of the supermolecule. Supramolecular chemists are often interested in the solution phase, and to understand this, alternative methods are used.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-10em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1"><i>Method of continuous variation:</i> A series of solutions containing [Host]&#x002B;[Guest]&#x003D;Constant is made and the solution properties monitored in order to follow [Complex] against the [Host]/([Host]&#x002B;[Guest]) ratio. When the value of [Complex] reaches a maximum then the value of&#x007B;Host]:[Guest], which is obtained from the [Host]/([Host]&#x002B;[Guest]) ratio, corresponds to the complex stoichiometry. This can be clearly seen graphically, the stoichiometry being read off the graph, which is referred to as a Job plot (<a href="#fig_1.14">Fig. 1.14</a>).</p></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Nmr:</i> Many atomic nuclei (e.g. <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>31</sup>P) possess nuclear spin and are thus detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). The frequency at which a particular nucleus resonates is dependent on the electronic environment in which it finds itself. It is therefore a sensitive technique for monitoring the interactions between molecules. A typical experiment is called an <i>nmr titration.</i> The nmr spectrum of a solution of the host in deuterated solvent is measured, and then the guest is added to this solution in small aliquots. The nmr resonances of the host are monitored, and if binding occurs, the guest perturbs their electronic environments. Protons which form specific hydrogen bonds to the guest, or are located in parts of the receptor with close guest contact are most strongly affected. Structural information about the supermolecule can therefore be obtained. This technique is not limited to <sup>l</sup>H nmr, and titration experiments may be performed by monitoring any nmr active nucleus in the host or the guest provided that the electronic environment of the nucleus is perturbed on binding. Nmr is often used to prove the stoichiometry of binding, which is obtained from the <i>method of continuous variation</i> (<a href="#fig_1.15">Fig. 1.15</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) is also of increasing importance. NOESY provides an nmr spectrum correlating resonances that are physically close together. The geometry of coordination between host and guest can often be exactly defined. This is particularly useful for more complex assembled systems such as helices held together by intermolecular forces, which have non-trivial spectra.</p>

Increasingly, <i>mass</i> <i>spectrometry</i> is being used to ascertain the mass of host-guest complexes, but the ionisation method must be mild, otherwise the complex will be broken into its constituent pieces, rather than flying through the spectrometer as a discrete unit. As the range of supramolecular chemistry expands, and the complexes become ever larger (see <a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>), techniques such as chromatography using <i>size exclusion gel,</i> on which the largest molecules migrate the most rapidly, become increasingly important for finding the
aggregate mass.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-11em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1"><i>Electrospray mass spectrometry</i> has often been used for characterisation, as it provides a mild solution phase method of ionisation. A solution of the complex being investigated is sprayed as a mist into a strong electrostatic field, which ionizes the&#x2018;supermolecule&#x2019;. The solvent then evaporates from the tiny droplets until the charged complexes repel one another and fly into the gas phase, where they can be sampled by the mass spectrometer.</p></aside>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Kinetic Information</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">As explained above, the host&#x2019;s nmr resonances are perturbed by the addition of guest. Complexation is a dynamic exchange between the bound and unbound forms of the host, and the nmr response therefore provides an insight into the binding kinetics.</p>

<figure class="fig2" id="fig_1.16" style="width:70%;text-align:left;">

<p class="indent3-ka">If the binding is <i>kinetically fast</i> compared to the frequency separation of free and complexed host nmr resonances (i.e. complex lifetime &#x003C; 10<sup>-2</sup>- 10<sup>-3</sup>s), then the host&#x2019;s nmr resonances are observed as an average peak. On the<a id ="page_11" class="page">Page 11, 1 Introduction</a>addition of increasing quantities of guest, this time averaged peak shifts continuously until the receptor is saturated. A titration curve having a distinctive shape can then be extracted (<a href="#fig_1.16">Fig. 1.16a</a>). Initially, the host is strongly perturbed by the addition of small amounts of guest, but at higher concentrations, it becomes saturated by the guest, and is not further perturbed.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">If, however, binding is <i>kinetically slov;</i> compared to the nmr timescale, then a time averaged nmr peak is not observed on guest addition. Instead, the resonances for free host gradually diminish in intensity, whilst resonances for the host-guest complex (at different chemical shifts) grow (<a href="#fig_1.16">Fig. 1.16b</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Quantitative information can also be obtained. For any exchange process, such as complexation, the kinetics can be varied by changing the temperature. If a solution exhibiting slow exchange is heated, the two individual peaks gradually broaden and merge. Eventually, a point intermediate betv/een fast and slow exchange is reached at which a single broad peak is observed. This is referred to as <i>coalescence</i> and the rate of complexation at the coalescence temperature can be derived (<a href="#eq_1.3">eqn. 1.3</a> - only applies to 1:1 singlets).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Titration experiments can provide thermodynamic data. Nmr experiments will, once again, be taken as an example. If the binding is kinetically slow, the relative concentrations of host and complex can be obtained from integration of the proton resonances. For a 1:1 complex, this allows direct calculation of the binding constant Kj, as all three concentrations (host, guest and complex) are known. If the binding is kinetically fast, the titration curve
 (<a href="#fig_1.16">Fig. 1.16a</a>) contains all the necessary information. The &#x2018;sharpness&#x2019; of curve reflects the affinity of the host for the guest. <i>Computer programs</i> are routinely used to find the binding constant from this data by using a nonlinear least squares procedure to fit a theoretical model of the complexation process to the experimental data. Performing titration experiments at different temperatures yields different binding constants, and this data can be used to yield values for AH and AS (assuming they remain invariant with temperature) (see <a href="#eq_1.4">eqns. 1.4</a> and <a href="#eq_1.5">1.5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Another method for determining thermodynamic parameters is calorimetry, in which the quantity of heat evolved or absorbed on complex formation is measured. Once again, a titration is performed, with the temperature of a solution of host being measured as a function of the quantity of guest added.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a id ="page_12" class="page">Page 12, 1 Introduction</a>Obviously, the heat change on complexation is directly linked to the desired thermodynamic values.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Potentiometric methods have been particularly important in aqueous solution for the monitoring the binding constants of ionic guests. The Nernst equation (<a href="#eq_1.6">eqn. 1.6</a>) relates the potential of a solution to the activity of a particular ion, which can be approximated by its concentration. If, due to complexation, this concentration varies, then so will the potential of the solution. This potential can be measured by an ion selective electrode (e.g. a pH electrode for protons), and the response of this electrode will then be directly dependent on the degree of complexation of the guest ion. Once again, a titration is performed by addition of guest ions to the host, with the solution potential being monitored. The potentiometric data generated can then be analysed by computer, to yield binding constants. Potentiometry is particularly powerful as it allows the routine thermodynamic treatment of complicated multi-step complexation processes in aqueous solution.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>1.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Solvent Effects</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, the focus has been on the individual components designed to perform specific recognition as if they existed in a vacuum. The <i>solvent,</i> however, is often far from inert, playing an <i>important role</i> in recognition processes (<a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a>). If the solvent strongly solvates either host, guest or complex, or if the solvent interacts strongly with itself, then this can have dramatic effects on the host-guest equilibrium. Desolvation possesses an unfavourable enthalpy (energy is required to break bonds to solvent molecules) and a favourable entropy (increase in disorder on release of solvent). If ignored, the effect of solvent can undermine much of the careful receptor design, making recognition non-specific and inefficient.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 1.17</b> Host-Guest equilibrium including solvent.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="indent3-ka">a)	The <i>hydrophobic effect</i> (<a href="#sec_1.2">Section 1.2</a>) provides an example of the way in which solvent can influence molecular recognition. As discussed above, this source of binding energy is a combination of entropic liberation of water and enthalpically favourable solvent-solvent hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, water can only solvate the large apolar surfaces of the uncomplexed host and guest very poorly. The factors pull the complexation equilibrium (<a href="#fig_1.17">Fig. 1.17</a>) to the right hand side.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">b)	For <i>electrostatic interactions,</i> the <i>dielectric constant</i> (<a href="#table_1.2">Table 1.2</a>) of the solvent plays an important role in controlling binding strength. The dielectric constant of a solvent measures its bulk polarity and reflects the dipole moment of an individual molecule of solvent. Solvents with high dipole<a id ="page_13" class="page">Page 13, 1 Introduction</a>moments interact more effectively with charged (or partially charged) species, shielding them from one another and diminishing the strength of their interactions with each other (<a href="#eq_1.7">eqn. 1.7</a>). This is reflected, for example, in the strength of ion pair formation, which is very high in solvents of low polarity, and diminishes as the dielectric constant increases.</p>

<p class="aside1"><b>Fig. 1.18</b> Donor and acceptor properties of solvents.</p></figure></aside>


<p class="indent3-ka">c) The <i>donor-acceptor ability</i> of the solvent also plays a significant role in controlling molecular recognition (<a href="#fig_1.18">Fig. 1.18</a>). There are a number of different empirical measures of a solvent&#x2019;s ability to donate (or accept) an electron pair. One popular scale is provided by the <i>Gutmann donor and acceptor numbers</i> (<a href="#table_1.2">Table 1.2</a>). A good donor solvent, for example, solvates cationic species very efficiently and will consequently compete against any receptor for such guests, weakening their recognition. A good acceptor solvent,meanwhile, solvates anions very effectively and therefore weakens anion binding. Changing the solvent can also alter the selectivity, as one guest may be more strongly solvated than the other.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Donor-acceptor ability is also of great importance in <i>hydrogen bonding recognition.</i> A good electron pair donor will readily accept a hydrogen bond, whilst a good electron pair acceptor is usually a good hydrogen bond donor (<a href="#fig_1.19">Fig. 1.19</a>). If the solvent is a good hydrogen bond donor or acceptor, this disrupts and weakens any recognition which depends on hydrogen bonds, as the unbound host and guest are solvated more effectively, pulling the equilibrium in <a href="#fig_1.17">Figure 1.17</a> to the left hand side. This problem is particularly acute in aqueous solution, as water is both an excellent hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. Solvents which strongly disrupt molecular recognition in this way are referred to as <i>competitive solvents.</i></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Solvent effects, however, are rarely simple, and often operate in complex combinations.

 Summary and Overview</h2>


<p class="noindent">Supramolecular chemistry concerns the design and synthesis of individual  molecular components which are then used to build non-covalently linked molecular  assemblies. In this chapter we have introduced the approach to supramolecular chemistry  in a general way, showing how biological examples of non-covalently linked molecular systems often provide inspiration that fuels the imagination of the supramolecular chemist.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The remaining chapters of this book focus on specific examples from  supramolecular chemistry in order to illustrate important principles of design and  molecular recognition. Chapters Two and Three discuss the binding of cations and anions respectively, whilst Chapter Four discusses the recognition of both together in the form  of an ion pair or zwitterion. Chapter Five discusses the binding of neutral molecules. Chapter Six aims to bring together themes from the previous Chapters and shows how supramolecular chemistry can build complex, spectacular architectures held together  with a variety of intermolecular forces. Finally, Chapter Seven will present current applications of Supramolecular Chemistry and give a flavour of its exciting prospects for the future.</p>
