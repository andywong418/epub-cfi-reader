<h2 class="h2"  style="margin-top:4em;">4.1<span class="space">&#160;</span> Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The previous two chapters have shown the wide range of receptors for cationic or anionic guests
 which operate through a variety of intermolecular forces. There is, however, another approach to binding charged 
species, and that is to bind the cation and the anion with the same receptor. This type of recognition is referred
 to as <span class="noindent"><i>ditopic.</i></span> Three fundamentally different 
approaches to this goal have been employed; they will be outlined
 briefly here, and then discussed in further detail in the remainder of the Chapter.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The cascade approach</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A receptor capable of binding more than one metal cation in well defined positions is synthesized.
 These &#x2018;recruited&#x2019; metal ions are then used to to form interactions with an anionic guest, co-binding it
 between themselves and within the recognition cavity (<a href="#fig_4.1">Fig. 4.1</a>). The overall complex is 
called a <span class="noindent" ><i>cascade complex,
</i> </span>and models the way substrates are bound by many metallo- enzymes, for example alkaline phosphatase.</p>

<p class="h3">Binding ion pairs using individual binding sites</p>
<p class="noindent">Receptors containing two individual recognition units, one for a cation and one for an anion 
(<a href="#fig_4.2">Fig.4.2</a>), have also been synthesized. A question of crucial importance with such ditopic ion pair receptors is whether the
 binding of the cation enhances the binding of the anion, or vice versa <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic">
<i>&#x007B;cooperative recognition</i></span> through
 favourable electrostatics). There are many applications that could stem from selective ion pair recognition, for
 example, enhanced <span class="noindent" ><i>extraction of toxic species</i></span> from aqueous industrial waste, enabling environmental clean-
up.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Binding zwitterions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many important biological substrates, such as amino acids, contain both acidic and basic groups and consequently exist as zwitterions, with both a positive and a negative charge. For effective zwitterion recognition, the receptor must be designed such that the recognition units have the correct spatial arrangement to bind both charged parts of the molecule (<a href="#fig_4.3">Fig. 4.3</a>). An important goal is the development of substrate selective 
receptors. The selective recognition of medically relevant zwitterionic guests under physiological conditions may 
lead to the development of new <span class="noindent"><i>sensors.</i></span></p>

<h2 class="h2">4.2<span class="space">&#160;</span> The cascade approach</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to form a cascade complex the receptor must be capable of binding more than one metal ion.
 Some of the first such receptors were made by Robson and his co-workers in the early 1970s (<a href="#fig_4.4">Fig. 4.4</a>). Compound <b>4.1  </b>binds two metal ions, both of which are coordinatively saturated, and there is therefore no capacity to co-bind an anion. Compound <b>4.2,</b> however, binds <span class="noindent" ><i>coordinatively unsaturated</i></span> metal ions, and therefore has the ability to co-bind a small anion such as an alkoxide (X) between the two metals.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><b>Fig. 4.4</b> Receptor <b>4.1</b> has no space for substrate binding, whilst receptor <b>4.2</b> contains a pair of coordinatively unsaturated metals and can therefore form cascade complexes.</p></figcaption></figure>



<p class="indent3-ka">It was Jean-Marie Lehn who highlighted the importance of cascade systems to the developing field
 of supramolecular chemistry. His research group then synthesized a range of receptors suitable for cascade complex 
formation.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Receptor <b>4.3</b> (<a href="#scheme_4.1">Scheme 4.1</a>) can bind two copper(II) ions and has an ellipsoidal shape, with
 the metal ions held relatively distant from one another. Ellipsoidal azide guest anions can therefore bridge these
 metal ions, whereas the smaller, spherical chloride anion coordinates to each metal ion individually
 (<a href="#fig_4.5">Figs. 4.5</a> and <a href="#fig_4.6">4.6</a>). Receptor <b>4.3 </b>illustrates 
how a macrocyclic host can control the spacing of metal ions and manipulate the
 selectivity of cascade complex formation. This cascade binding motif is analogous to the way in which some copper
 based enzymes bind azide anions. As well as using macrocyclic ligands for the formation of cascade complexes, 
cryptands have been used to enhance the strength and selectivity of binding.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Recently, more rigid cavities have also been used in order to organize arrays of metal ions. A 
bucket shaped calix-resorcinarene cavity has been used <a id="page_45" class="page" >Page 45, 4 Simultaneous cation and anion binding</a>to organize an array of donor phosphorus atoms around the upper rim (<a href="#fig_4.7">Fig. 4.7</a>). This ligand is 
capable of binding four metal ions (either Cu(I) or Ag(I)), and these in turn can imprison an anion in a cascade
 manner (<a href="#scheme_4.2">Scheme 4.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Receptor<b> 4.4 </b>was treated with copper(I) iodide and pyridinium chloride in
order to discover which anion was selected (<a href="#scheme_4.2">Scheme 4.2</a>). Interestingly, the
four anions (X) around the rim of the receptor were either iodide (2.25 on
average) or chloride (1.75 on average), but the iodide anion was exclusively
bound in the centre of the cavity. This size selective binding mode was
proven by crystallography (<a href="#fig_4.8">Fig. 4.8</a>). In addition, the nucleophilic properties
of the imprisoned anion were dramatically changed. Increasing the number of
metal ions and arranging them around a pre-formed cavity therefore yields
strong and selective anion binding.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Receptor <b>4.5</b> co-binds phosphate anions. If the phosphate anion was a
suitable phosphodiester then the receptor catalysed its intramolecular
hydrolysis (<a href="#fig_4.9">Fig. 4.9</a>). When the catalytic ability of receptor <b>4.5</b> was
compared with a simple analogue capable of binding only one copper(II) ion a
rate enhancement was observed. Many enzymes use metal ions in this way to
recruit substrate anions prior to catalytic transformation. This indicates the
ability of cascade complexes to model not only the recognition properties of
enzymes such as phosphatases, but also their catalytic action</p>

 binidng sub-units. In Chapter Three, compound <b><a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_33">3.3</a> </b>was introduced as an anion receptor operating through dipole-anion 
interactions. This host can also bind cations using its electronegative oxygen atoms. In this case the binding of the
 cation and anion act in opposition to one another and the binding is anti-cooperative (i.e cation binding does not
 enhance the strength of anion recognition or vice versa).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Cooperative ditopic receptors for ion pairs have, however, also been reported. This field of 
study was largely established by Manfred Reetz and his research team, who synthesized receptors such as 
<b>4.7</b> (<a href="#fig_4.12">Fig. 4.12</a>). This molecule contains both a crown ether unit
 (cation binding site) and a Lewis acidic boron atom (anion binding site). Receptor <b>4.7</b> was 
capable of dissolving anhydrous KF in dichloromethane solution. 
<sup>11</sup>B nmr proved anion binding, whilst <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C nmr showed incorporation 
of the potassium ion in the crown. A crystal structure confirmed this mode of binding. The positive effect of 
covalently linking the two binding sites was proven, as the <a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, 4 Simultaneous cation and anion binding</a>ditopic receptor was more efficient than a simple 1:1 mixture of crown ether and boronic acid. 
The ion pair recognition is therefore cooperative. The recognition of other potassium salts was also investigated 
(<a href="#table_4.1">Table 4.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Receptor<b> 4.8, </b>synthesized by Reinhoudt and co-workers, displays very elegant cation-anion cooperativity. The receptor consists of a calix[4]arene with cation binding ester groups at the lower rim and anion binding urea groups at the upper rim. In chloroform solution the two urea groups are hydrogen bonded together, and so are not available for hydrogen bonding to any putative anionic guest species. However when sodium cations are added, they bind to the ester groups of the calixarene, causing the lower rim to contract. This forces apart the urea groups at the upper rim apart which are then available for binding anionic species such as chloride (<a href="#scheme_4.3">Scheme 4.3</a>).</p>

 receptor (<b><a href="Chapter03.xhtml#page_32">3.1a</a></b>) and has been used for the recognition of zwitterionic guests (<a href="#fig_4.13">Fig. 4.13</a>). Both parts of the receptor were 
shown to be important for binding. There was, however, little selectivity between different zwitterions, presumably
 because the 1,4-dimethylbenzene spacer group is flexible, which means the distance between the two recognition units
 can easily vary (<a href="#fig_4.14">Fig. 4.14</a>).</p>

 dichloromethane. The extraction occurred selectively, with a strong preference for amino acids with aromatic side
 chains, such as phenylalanine and tryptophan. A three point binding mode was proposed (<a href="#scheme_4.4">Scheme 
4.4</a>). The carboxylate 
anion is bound by the guanidinium unit, the protonated amine by the aza crown, and <i>&#x03C0;-&#x03C0;</i> interactions between the
 phenyl side chain of the amino acid and the receptor&#x2019;s naphthalene unit enhance the strength and selectivity of
 complex formation. What is more, receptor <b>4.10</b>, which is optically active, was completely selective for L-amino acids 
over D- amino acids, with no extraction of D-amino acids being observed. This indicates the excellent design and 
spatial arrangement of the subunits in the receptor.</p>

<p class="noindent">The simultaneous recognition of cationic and anionic guests is a very young field of research and 
currently extremely vigorous. It is expected that in the coming years, as the individual research areas of cation and 
anion coordination become more sophisticated, research into binding ion pairs and zwitterions will catch up with, and 
probably even extend, the state of the art.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In particular, it is expected that biologically important guests will be bound with ever increasing 
selectivity and that devices suitable for industrial or medical use will be forthcoming.</p>
