<p class="fmnoindent">   Supramolecular chemistry is one of the most important innovations in inorganic, organic and bio-chemistry in the recent past. The techniques of using inter- molecular forces to assemble chemical structures and to form receptor sites offer a new and subtle approach to synthesis. In addition, the receptor sites may be the basis of sequestering agents, chemical sensors or molecular electronics and molecular mechanical devices.</p>
<p class="fmindent">   Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of current understanding of inorganic chemistry. Paul Beer, Phil Gale and David Smith have produced the first accessible text for undergraduates on this area. It will therefore be of great appeal to other academic staff wishing to design courses in the area, as well as for Third or Fourth year students following such a course.</p>
