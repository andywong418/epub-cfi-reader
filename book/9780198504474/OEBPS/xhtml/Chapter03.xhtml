<p class="noindent">In comparison to cation coordination chemistry, the idea of constructing hosts to bind specific negatively charged guests is a recent development. The importance of anions, however, is increasingly recognized, and designing receptors for their recognition is a vigorously active research area.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.1<span class="space"></span><b> Properties of anions: receptor design principles</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Anions have a variety of special features that must be addressed with effective receptor design if they are to be strongly bound.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Charge:</i> The defining feature of an anion is its negative charge. Electrostatic interactions can therefore play an important role in strengthening anion coordination and many receptors utilise them.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Size:</i> Anions are larger than their isoelectronic cations (<a href="#fig_3.1">Fig. 3.1</a>) and therefore recognition cavities must be large enough for guest encapsulation.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>pH dependence:</i> Unlike simple metal cations, many anions (e.g. carboxylates, phosphates, sulphates) only exist over a limited pH range. At low pH they become protonated and consequently lose their negative charge. This is especially important if anion recognition is to occur in v/ater.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Solvation:</i> The solvation of anions depends on the three factors above, and plays an important role in controlling binding selectivity. The degree of aqueous solvation of an anion is reflected by the <i>Hofmeister series,</i> which indicates increasing hydrophobicity (i.e. low aqueous solvation: <a href="#fig_3.2">Fig. 3.2</a>). In a hydrophobic binding site, which solvent cannot enter, the less hydrated anions are bound more strongly. In a cavity which is accessible to polar solvents, however, the more hydrated anions are often more strongly held.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Geometry:</i> Anions exhibit a range of geometries (<a href="#fig_3.3">Fig. 3.3</a>), which challenge the molecular designer to create a complementary binding site.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Examples of the application of these design principles will be illustrated throughout the course of this Chapter.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.2<span class="space"></span> <b>Why bind anions?</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Anions play essential roles in many processes, both chemical and biological, and this makes their strong, selective recognition an area of intense interest.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Chemically,</i> anions play various roles, acting for example as catalysts and bases. The use of a receptor to bind an anion can alter its reactivity. Anion receptors may also assist in the separation of complex chemical mixtures.</p><p class="indent3-ka"><i>Environmentally,</i> anions can pose severe pollution problems. Nitrate anions from fertilisers run off agricultural land into the water supply v/here they have a fertilising effect, leading to eutrophication (excessive plant/algal growth) that disrupts aquatic life cycles. Pertechnetate anions are a toxic,<a id="page_32" class="page">Page 32, 3 Anion binding</a>radioactive by-product of the nuclear power industry.Selective binding, extraction and sensing of such anions are, therefore, important goals.</p>

<p class="aside1"><b>Fig. 3.4</b> Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a biologically important</p>
</figure></aside>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Biologically,</i> 70&#x0025; of all enzyme substrates are negatively charged. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the free energy source of life, is a tetraanion at physiological pH (<a href="#fig_3.4">Fig. 3.4</a>). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is also a polyanion, containing phosphate esters along its ribose backbone. Anion recognition in biology is remarkably subtle, for example all cells must distinguish between anions as similar as Se04<sup>2-</sup>, SO4<sup>2-</sup> and M0O4<sup>2-</sup>. 
Anionic phosphate nucleotides labelled with radioactive <sup>32</sup>P have long been used for tracking reaction progress in biochemical investigations.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><i>Medically,</i> anions play key roles in many diseases. Cystic fibrosis, a genetically inherited disease, is caused by misregulation of chloride channels, yet current methods of chloride analysis are unsuitable for medical use.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">There are therefore many compelling reasons for investigating anion coordination. The applications of supramolecular chemistry are discussed in more detail in Chapter Seven. This Chapter, however, will focus on the use of receptor design principles to achieve selective anion recognition.</p>

<h2 class="h2">3.3<span class="space"></span>	<b>Recognition using electrostatic interactions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the simplest and most obvious way of binding an anion is to use a positive charge to provide a strong <i>electrostatic ion-ion interaction.</i> By extension, an <i>array</i> of positively charged groups should be even more effective. Building a number of positively charged groups into a receptor, however, causes a design problem, as the positive charges will tend to repel one another. The charges are therefore often constrained by a rigid or cyclic system. This has the added advantage of creating a binding cavity.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Schmidtchen and co-workers reported a macrotricyclic receptor for anionic guests with positively charged, quaternized nitrogen atoms at its corners (<a href="#fig_3.5">Fig. 3.5</a>). Receptor <b><a href="#fig_3.5">3.1a</a></b> was prepared as its tetraiodide salt and crystallography located one of the iodide ions as being bound at the centre of the cavity, equidistant from the four positively charged nitrogen atoms (<a href="#fig_3.6">Fig. 3.6</a>). The receptors also formed 1:1 complexes with anionic guests in aqueous solution, the strengths of which are shown in <a href="#table_3.1">Table 3.1.</a> Receptor 3.1a binds anions more strongly than receptor <b><a href="#fig_3.5">3.1b</a></b> as its smaller diameter (4.6A rather than <i>7.6A&#x00B0;)</i> leads to a better fit of the anions into the cavity. Bromide is bound more strongly than chloride or iodide by this smaller host because it has the<a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, 3 Anion binding</a>best steric fit. The larger host, however, forms the strongest complex with the larger iodide anion. This shows how the structure of the receptor directs <i>size selectivity.</i> In addition, <b><a href="#fig_3.5">3.1a</a></b> fails to complex large anions, such as <i>p-</i> nitrophenolate, which the larger <b><a href="#fig_3.5">3.1b</a></b> can bind.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">There is, however, a problem with positively charged anion receptors: they possess a counter anion, which may act as a competitor for the binding site. Schmidtchen and his co-workers addressed this problem by synthesising zwitterionic hosts such as <b><a href="#fig_3.7">3.2</a></b> (<a href="#fig_3.7">Fig. 3.7</a>). This receptor has no net charge, and consequently there is no competitive counter anion. Nmr titrations (<a href="Chapter01.xhtml#sec_1.4">Section 1.4</a>) showed that as a consequence,receptor <b><a href="#fig_3.7">3.2</a></b> bound halide anions more strongly in aqueous solution than <b><a href="#fig_3.5">3.1a</a></b> (<a href="#table_3.1">Table 3.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Dipolar bonds can also be used for electrostatic anion recognition.They must, however, be well aligned and properly oriented for recognition to occur. Receptor <b><a href="#scheme_3.1">3.3</a></b> has its dipoles convergently focussed into a halide binding recognition site below the macrocyclic ring (<a href="#scheme_3.1">Scheme 3.1</a>). Binding constants were measured in a low polarity solvent mixture (CHCl<sub>3</sub>MeOH, 98/2), which does not disrupt electrostatic forces. In spite of this, the binding constants were still relatively small (K&#x003D; 65 M<sup>-1</sup> for CT binding). The recognition is, therefore, much weaker than for positively charged receptors <b>3.1</b> and<b> <a href="#fig_3.7">3.2</a>.</b> Receptor <b><a href="#scheme_3.1">3.3</a> </b>can, however, also bind cations at the same time as anions, through interactions with its electronegative oxygen atoms.

<p class="noindent">Simple electrostatic interactions, however, are not the only way of binding anionic guests. Any anion can be considered as an electron pair donor and it will therefore interact with a suitable electron pair acceptor. Perhaps the simplest such electron pair acceptor is an electropositive hydrogen atom capable of forming a hydrogen bond (O-H, N-H etc.) (<a href="#fig_3.8">Fig. 3.8</a>). Consequently, <i>arrays of hydrogen bonding groups</i> can be used to bind anions.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">As with dipoles, it is important that hydrogen bonds are correctly oriented, with the hydrogen atoms arranged in a <i>convergent</i> manner.

<p class="indent3-ka"><a id="page_34" class="page">Page 34,Cation binding</a> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The directionality of hydrogen bonds introduces the possibility of designing receptors with <i>specific shapes,</i> which are capable of differentiating between anionic guests with different geometries or hydrogen bonding requirements. Trigonal receptors, for example, are of particular interest due to their complementarity with organic phosphate anions, which have a trigonal array of hydrogen bond acceptor groups (<a href="#fig_3.10">Fig. 3.10</a>). Phosphate anions have great biological importance. Receptor<b><a href="#fig_3.11">3.5</a></b> (<a href="#fig_3.11">Fig. 3.11</a>) binds phosphonate and phosphate anions strongly, even in competitive hydrogen bonding solvents such as methanol, which can itself act as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.

<p class="noindent">As discussed above, anions are capable of donating an electron pair to some extent, allowing the use of hydrogen bonds to bind these guests. <i>Lewis acids,</i> however, can also accept an electron pair, and this has led to the development of a rich variety of anion receptors based on heteroelement chemistry.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Organoboron compounds, for example, only contain six electrons in the boron valence shell, rather than the full complement of eight. They are consequently ideal Lewis acids, capable of accepting electron pairs from anionic guests into their vacant orbitals. The first host of this type was the simple ligand,<b> <a href="#fig_3.16">3.8</a></b> reported by Shriver and Biallis in 1967. As such, it was one of the first designed receptors for anions. This <i>chelating</i> ligand can be thought of as an equivalent to ethylene diamine, only instead of donating tv/o electron pairs to a metal ion, it is capable of accepting two electron pairs from an anion (<a href="#fig_3.16">Fig. 3.16</a>). The binding of methoxide anions v/as investigated, and when <b><a href="#fig_3.16">3.8</a></b> was compared with non-chelating, mononuclear boron trifluoride (BF3), a <i>chelate effect</i> was observed. Subsequently, Katz synthesized receptor<b><a href="#fig_3.17">3.9</a></b> which has two boron atoms rigidly held on an aromatic framework, leading to a degree of <i>preorganisation</i> (<a href="#fig_3.17">Fig. 3.17</a>). In particular, &#x2018;hard&#x2019; anions such as hydride and fluoride were bound, as they are electron rich and strong 0 donors. Crystallography showed a bridged chloride complex, with short strong bonds between the anion and both boron atoms.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Other Lewis acids are more robust and have been used to build more structurally complex and selective anion receptors. Newcomb and co-workers have made extensive use of organotin macrocycles and cryptands for anion recognition (<a href="#fig_3.19">Fig. 3.19</a>). Tetravalent organotin, although having a full valence shell of eight electrons, is still capable of accepting additional electron pairs into low-lying unoccupied molecular orbitals and consequently acting as a Lewis acid.

<p class="indent3-ka">Organomercury receptors for anions have been of considerable interest.
 The mercury atom is sp hybridized and therefore contains two unfilled <i>&#x03C0;</i> 
orbitals into which it can readily accept electron pairs without any geometric reorganisation. 
In addition, it possesses a <i>linear geometry</i> and this has allowed the synthesis of large 
macrocyclic receptors. Hawthorne and his research group have assembled eyecatching receptors such as<b> <a href="#fig_3.20">3.12</a></b> (<a href="#fig_3.20">Fig. 3.20</a>). This compound contains
 four carborane clusters, each of which contains
 ten boron atoms and two carbon atoms. These clusters are then bonded to mercury atoms through 
C-Hg-C linkers, leading to a macrocyclic structure. The formation of these macrocycles is 
templated by the presence of chloride anions (see <a href="Chapter02.xhtml#sec_2.2">Section 2.2</a> for an explanation of the template effect). Crystallography showed that the chloride anion binds in the plane of the macrocycle, equidistant from all four mercury atoms (<a href="#fig_3.21">Fig. 3.21</a>). The iodide anion,however, is too large to fit into the cavity and two anions bind to the receptor, one above the plane of the ring, and one below it. This illustrates the importance of anionic radius for these receptors.</p>

<p class="noindent">The strong binding afforded by electrostatic interactions can be enhanced by combination with
 hydrogen bonds. By chance, this powerful combination was actually used to create some of the very first anion hosts,
 which have since developed into one of the most important classes of anion receptor. In 1968, at around the same time
 that Charles Pedersen was reporting the crown ethers as hosts for alkali metal cations 
(<a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Two</a>), Simmons and Park reported a macrotricyclic receptor for anionic guests <b>(<a href="#fig_3.22">3.13</a>).</b> The location of the bound halide anion was
determined by nmr and, eventually, crystallographic methods. It binds in a <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>&#x2018;katapinate&#x2019;</i></span> manner; inside 
the macrotricyclic cavity between the two protonated nitrogen atoms, with the protons on these nitrogens oriented into
 the cavity, forming hydrogen bonds with the bound guest (<a href="#fig_3.22">Fig. 3.22</a>). These hydrogen bonds complement the electrostatic
 forces making a strong complex.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Lehn and his co-workers, realized the importance of Simmons and Park&#x2019;s pioneering work, and
 developed a range of polyazamacrocyclic anion receptors (e.g.<a href="#fig_3.23"> Fig. 3.23</a>). They and others elucidated some key 
properties:</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>Electrostatic interactions are
 important:</i></span> compound <b><a href="#fig_3.23">3.14</a> </b>binds chloride more
 strongly than iodide, because chloride is smaller and therefore presents a higher charge density to the host. This
 inherent electrostatic binding preference, however, can be <span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>
tuned by the receptor structure:</i></span> macrotri
cyclic <a href="#fig_3.23"><b>3.15</b>,</a> for example, selects iodide over chloride.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><span class="noindent" style="font-family:times-italic"><i>Hydrogen bonds are also important:
</i></span>unlike macrocycles such as<b> <a href="#fig_3.23">3.14,</a></b> compound 
<a href="#fig_3.24">3.16</a> does not bind highly charged ATP<sup>4</sup>&#x203E;, even though it possesses a high positive charge. This
 is because <b><a href="#fig_3.24">3.16</a> </b>cannot form hydrogen bonds with the anionic guest (<a href="#fig_3.24">Fig. 3.24</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">These receptors are especially exciting because of their ability to bind <span class="noindent" 
style="font-family:times-italic"><i>biologically relevant anions</i></span> (such as ATP<sup>4</sup>&#x203E;) in water. Receptor <b><a href="#fig_3.25">3.17</a></b> provides a typical example 
(<a href="#fig_3.25">Fig. 3.25</a>). The higher the charge on the phosphate anion, the stronger its recognition by the
 positively charged host, as a result of electrostatic interactions (<a href="#table_3.3">Table 3.3</a>). The receptor
 only operates efficiently at low pH, however, when all the nitrogen atoms are protonated. One way of extending
 operation to higher pH is to use longer alkyl spacers between the nitrogen atoms so that their positive charges do
 not repel one another so strongly. This stabilizes the protonated form of the host and means it exists and can bind 
anions in less acidic solutions (i.e. the pK<sub>a</sub>&#x2019;s of the nitrogen atoms increase).</p>

<p class="noindent">Anion recognition is a relatively new field of study which directly complements its more
 established sister field of cation coordination. Already, however, a dazzling range of anion receptors has been 
designed by supramolecular chemists, with much of the periodic table being utilized in their synthesis. Various
 binding forces have been manipulated, either singly, or in combination, in order to yield strong and sometimes
 selective recognition of anionic guests. As the factors controlling the strength and selectivity of anion coordination
 become better defined, these basic principles are now being used in the development of more complex supermolecules
 made up of multiple individual componenents (see <a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> Six).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Chemists working in the field are also beginning to turn to the development of functional devices
 based on the anion recognition event. This move towards function and applications is discussed further in Chapter 3 
Seven.</p>
