<h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:3em;">6.1<span class="span">&#160;</span><b> An introduction to self-assembly</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">In the previous chapters we have looked at how non-covalent interactions are 
employed in receptors for cations, anions, ion pairs, and neutral species. In this chapter the distinction between host and guest will become blurred as we look at examples of the assembly of 
molecular building blocks to yield new eye-catching architectures. On mixing different appropriately designed components in solution, the intermolecular forces that exist between them control their orientation, leading to the <i>reversible</i> assembly of a specific &#x2018;supermolecule&#x2019;.
</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">There are many examples of self-assembling biological systems. The formation of the DNA double helix from two complementary deoxyribonucleic acid strands is a striking example. Under the right conditions, the thermodynamically stable double helix forms spontaneously and reversibly as the strands are mixed together and hydrogen bonds form between complementary base pairs. As a result of the reversibility of the process, any errors that may have occurred during assembly can be corrected (provided the reversibility is rapid). This type of process has been termed &#x2018;strict self-assembly.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The formation of cell membranes, multi-component enzymes, and viruses are paradigms of the way in which Nature uses a simple, limited range of interactions to produce very complex molecular assemblies. The tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) consists of an RNA strand and 2130 protein subunits. The protein blocks self-assemble around the RNA strand <i>via</i> non-covalent interactions to form the virus superstructure (<a href="#scheme_6.1">scheme 6.1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Self-assembly allows access to new molecular architectures that are inaccessible (or accessible in only very small yields) <i>via</i> traditional multi-step covalent bond making and bond breaking techniques. The new molecular architectures are produced by combining appropriately designed sub-units, which can be quite simple, and yet after the assembly process produce quite complex architectures. These assemblies have many potential uses ranging from information storage to
 drug delivery. Self-assembling systems that can self-replicate (see <a href="#sec_6.4">Section 
6.4</a>) may give us new insights into how life on earth started&#x0021; It is the beauty of many of these systems, and their possible future uses (that can only currently be dreamt of in the pages of a science fiction novel), that really excite the supramolecular chemist and push this area of research forward.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">This chapter is arranged so as to highlight the particular non-covalent interaction used to drive (or <i>template)</i> the formation of the assembly (such as charge transfer, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding or anion coordination). </p></section>

<h3 class="h3">Catenanes and rotaxanes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The synthesis of assemblies in which two molecular components are interlinked, but not physically joined by covalent bonds presents a considerable challenge to the supramolecular chemist. The catenanes (<a href="#scheme_6.2">Scheme 6.2</a>) and rotaxanes 
(<a href="#scheme_6.5">Scheme 6.5</a>) illustrate this challenge most 
clearly.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">[n]Catenanes (from Latin: catena (chain)) consist of n interlocked macrocyclic species. For example a [2]catenane refers to two interpenetrating macrocycles 
(e.g. see <a href="#scheme_6.2">Scheme 6.2</a>). Once a catenane has formed, the only way in which the rings can be removed from one another is by breaking one of the rings open. One can regard the catenane as being held together by a topological bond. One of the forces used to drive the formation of such structures is the self-assembly of aromatic &#x03C0;-donor and &#x03C0;-acceptors.</p>

<figure class="fig1" id="scheme_6.2"><img src="../images/page_62_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-25em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">When synthesizing a macrocycle there is always a chance that a precursor may thread through another macrocycle and ring close forming a catenane. This statistical approach was used to make the first synthetic catenane (<b><a href="#scheme_6.3">Scheme 6.3</a></b>). The yield of this reaction, however, is less than 1 % - clearly illustrating the advantage of using self-assembly techniques in catenane
 synthesis!</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Stoddart and co-workers discovered that bisparaphenylene-[34]crown-10 (BPP[34]C10) will bind a paraquat dication forming a reasonably strong 1:1 complex 
(<b>6.2</b>) in acetonitrile and acetone solution (<a href="#fig_6.1">Fig. 6.1</a>). This complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the acidic aromatic hydrogen atoms of the paraquat and the oxygen atoms of the crown ether and also by a charge transfer n-n stacking interaction from the electron rich crown ether to the electron poor paraquat cation. Similarly electron poor macrocycles have been synthesized which will encapsulate electron rich guests. This type of interaction has been used to synthesize a wide range of rotaxanes and catenanes. The synthesis of a [2]catenane from BPP[34]C10 and compound<b> 6.3 </b>is shown in 
<a href="#scheme_6.4">Scheme 6.4.</a> The pyridine nitrogen of compound
 <b>6.3</b> acts as a nucleophile, displacing a bromine from 1,4-bis(bromomethyl) benzene. The resultant tricationic strand (<b>6.4</b>) assembles with the crown ether present in the reaction mixture, threading through it to form a complex that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding and %-n stacking. This complex is then trapped by a ring closing intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form a [2]catenane 6.5 (isolated as the hexafluorophosphate salt). The crown ether may be regarded as a template around which the pyridinium box forms. This template effect is reflected in the high yield (70%) of the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Catenanes with larger numbers of rings have been produced by analogous methods. The [5]catenane <b>6.6</b> was dubbed olympiadane due to its similarity to the five interlocked Olympic rings. It provides an elegant example of the power of self-assembly and the use of non-covalent interactions to access complex molecular arrays with high molecular mass (<a href="#fig_6.2">Fig. 6.2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Rotaxanes (from Latin: <i>rota</i> (wheel) and <i>axis</i> (axle)) are composed of a macrocyclic component through which an axle or rod is threaded. The ends of the axle are stoppered with bulky groups that prevent the macrocycle slipping off. Therefore the individual components are permanently joined together, but are not linked by an actual covalent bond. The nomenclature [n]rotaxane refers to the total number of non-covalently linked components present in the rotaxane. Thus a [2]rotaxane consists of one macrocycle and one axle.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Strategies for rotaxane synthesis are illustrated in 
<a href="#scheme_6.5">Scheme 6.5.</a> There are two main approaches: <i>threading</i> and <i>clipping.</i> Threading involves mixing self-assembling linear and macrocyclic components to form a pseudorotaxane. The ends of the linear component are then stoppered to prevent the wheel<a id="page_64" class="page">Page 64, 6 Self-assembly</a>
slipping off the axle, producing a [2]rotaxane. For clipping, a &#x2018;pre-stoppered&#x2019; linear component may be mixed with a self-assembling component which undergoes macrocyclic ring closure around the axle. <a href="#scheme_6.6">Scheme 6.6</a> shows the synthesis of rotaxane <b>6.10</b> <i>via</i> both of these routes.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">A third approach to rotaxane synthesis has also been developed by Stoddart&#x2019;s research group. They reasoned that if the stoppers are not too large, then at high temperatures, the macrocyclic component may be able to slip<a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, 6 Self-assembly</a>
over them. The rotaxane is thermodynamically stable compared to the unassembled component parts due to the favourable &#x03C0;-donor-&#x03C0;-acceptor interaction and hydrogen bonding interactions (<a href="#fig_6.3">Fig 6.3</a>). Enough thermal energy must be input in order to traverse the activation barrier to threading.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">More complicated rotaxane systems have been produced, for example [3]rotaxanes (one axle with two macrocycles). Axles containing two possible positions (stations) for one macrocyclic component have been produced and can be considered as molecular shuttles, with the position of the macrocycle on the rod being variable and controllable (<a href="#scheme_6.7">Scheme 6.7</a>). Readers are urged to consult the further reading section at the end of this chapter for more information on these fascinating molecules.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.3<span class="span">&#160;</span><b> Transition metal directed assemblies</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The use of transition metal ions to direct molecular assembly has two major advantages. Firstly, metal-ligand dative bonds are <i>thermodynamically strong</i> interactions, but have <i>varying degrees of lability</i> (providing the supramolecular chemist with a range of kinetic stabilities). They can therefore provide stabilisation energy for a range of different structures. Secondly, due to ligand field effects, transition metal ions often have very <i>specific geometric requirements</i> in their coordination sphere. This gives metal ions the ability to control the geometry of the molecular assembly very precisely. This process can be regarded as an extension of the template effect discussed in <a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2.</a></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Catenates and catenands</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Metal directed assembly also provides an approach to interlocked structures complementary to that described in <a href="#sec_6.2">Section 6.2.</a> Sauvage and his research group have investigated the assembly properties of 2,9-disubstituted 1,10- phenanthroline molecules with copper(I) ions.</p>

Copper(I) has a d<sup>10</sup> electronic configuration and prefers a tetrahedral coordination environment. When phenanthroline <b>6.11 </b>is mixed with 0.5 equivalents of copper (I), the two phenanthroline units are locked together forming the tetrahedral complex <b>
6.12.</b> The subsequent nucleophilic substitution reaction with pentaethylene glycol diiodide forms the interlocked catenate <b>6.13</b> in 27&#x0025; yield. This structure is called a catenate rather than a catenane because it contains a metal ion. Demetallation of the catenate is possible by addition of <b>CN&#x2019;</b> yielding the [2]catenand <b>6.14.</b></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Double and triple helices</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The formation of double and triple helices presents many challenges to the supramolecular chemist. The helices described in this section consist of ligands containing multiple binding sites that self-assemble around metal ions. The formation of helices is permitted in assemblies containing more than one metal ion (<a href="#scheme_6.9">Scheme 6.9</a>). As will be illustrated, both the arrangement of the binding sites on the ligand and the preferred coordination geometry of the metal ion are crucial to successful helicate synthesis.</p>

The quinquepyridine strand <b>6.18,</b> however, possesses five donor nitrogen atoms. Clearly, a double helix with copper&#x00AE; ions analogous to <b>6.17</b> cannot form, as there would be two unsatisfied nitrogen donor atoms.

The Cu(I) ion is in a favourable tetrahedral coordination site occupying the remaining two nitrogens on each quinquepyridine. In this way, both the metal ions are in their preferred geometries and all the donor atoms of the ligand are satisfied.

<p class="indent3-ka">Benzimidazole-pyridine ligands (e.g. <b>6.20)</b> form different types of helicate depending upon the metal ion used to template the self-assembly process. The arrangement of nitrogen atoms in 6.20 provides two metal binding sites, while the inflexibility of the strand forces the formation of dimetallic complexes. The addition of copper(I) ions causes the assembly of a double helical structure, with four coordinate metal ions. However, addition of cobalt (II) ions causes the assembly of a <i>triple helicate</i> <b>6.21</b> (because only then can the metal ions achieve their preferred six-coordinate octahedral geometries (<a href="#fig_6.5">Fig. 6.5</a>).

<p class="noindent">The trefoil knot was an ambitious chemical goal (
<a href="#scheme_6.10">Scheme 6.10</a>). Such a knot contains one single strand which intertwines itself with three crossing points, such that it can not be unwound. Sauvage and his research team reasoned that such a molecule could be approached by combining the concepts of catenane synthesis with the formation of bi-metallic helical complexes (<a href="#scheme_6.10">Scheme 6.10</a>). Initially a double helical structure is assembled around two metal ions. The ends of the helix are then linked together in a cyclization reaction similar to that used in catenate formation and subsequently the metal ions may be removed. In contrast to the catenate topology that is generated when one metal centre is used (<a href="#scheme_6.8">Scheme 6.8</a>) the cyclization step in 
<a href="#scheme_6.10">Scheme 6.10</a> produces not two interlocked rings but one continuous ring that crosses over itself in three places: a trefoil knot.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Molecular macrocycles and boxes</b></h3>

<p class="indent3-ka">The porphyrin-pyridine conjugate <b>6.26</b> is self-complementary due to the subtle use of hydrogen bonds. Pyridine-amide hydrogen bonds (shown as dotted lines in <a href="#scheme_6.12">Scheme 6.12</a>) force the porphyrin and terminal pyridine to be orientated at 90&#x00B0; to one another. This allows the formation of the rectangular macrocyclic species <b>6.27</b> <i>via</i> pyridine coordination to the zinc metal ion bound in the porphyrin ring.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Jeremy Sanders&#x2019; group at Cambridge University have pioneered the use of self-assembly in the synthesis of boxes containing porphyrin binding sites. Addition of the tri-coordinating 1,3,5-tris(4-pyridyl)triazine <b>6.29</b> to the dialkyne metalloporphyrin <b>6.28</b> and subsequent copper catalysed coupling of the alkyne groups forms the trimeric macrocycle <b>6.30</b> (<a href="#scheme_6.13">Scheme 6.13</a>).

<h2 class="h2">6.4&#160;&#160;<b>Hydrogen bond directed assemblies</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The <i>directional nature</i> of hydrogen bonds makes them well suited for the assembly of complex supermolecules. Indeed hydrogen bonding is key to the assembly of perhaps the most beautiful natural supermolecule, the DNA double helix. Supramolecular chemists have also employed hydrogen bonding motifs in the construction of a wide variety of assemblies, a selection of which are described below.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Rosettes and ribbons</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Hydrogen bonds have been used to produce supermolecules incorporating melamine and cyanuric acid derivatives. Melamine  <b>6.43</b> can be regarded as having three faces, each with a donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) triad of hydrogen bonding groups. This is a complementary arrangement to that of cyanuric acid  <b>6.44</b> which possesses an ADA triad. When these two species are mixed together in solution, an insoluble polymeric complex with a &#x2018;rosette-like&#x2019; arrangement of sub-units ( <b>6.45</b>) precipitates (<a href="#scheme_6.17">Scheme 6.17</a>). This complex is held together by the multiple hydrogen bonds between adjacent heterocycles.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">By attaching three derivatized melamine units to a trigonal template (a 1,3,5-substituted benzene ring), a soluble 3:1 complex  <b>6.48</b> was formed with cyanuric acid (<a href="#scheme_6.18">Scheme 6.18</a>). The existence of this assembly was ultimately proven by NOESY nmr experiments, whilst vapour phase osmometry was used to provide an approximate molecular mass for the 3:1 stoichiometry.</p>

<figcaption><b>Scheme 6.18</b> Formation of a soluble 3:1 complex between a melamine tripod and a cyanuric acid derivative.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="indent3-ka">A variation on this hydrogen bonding motif was used by Lehn and co-workers to synthesize molecular ribbons. Compound  <b>6.49 </b>is a barbituric acid derivative, that is similar to compound  <b>6.44</b> except that one of the hydrogen bonding faces of the molecule has been blocked by two alkyl groups. Compound 6.50 is similar to melamine except that an octyl group prevents hydrogen bonding on one face of the heterocycle. Co-crystallization of  <b>6.49 </b>and  <b>6.50</b> produces a molecular ribbon  <b>6.51</b> with the bulky blocking groups protruding from each side of the linear array (<a href="#scheme_6.19">Scheme 6.19</a>). This type of ribbon can be considered as a <i>supramolecular polymer,</i> with the length of the aggregate being dependent on the strength of the hydrogen bonding interactions. Stronger association between the individual components would lead to the formation of longer ribbons.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">One example is shown in <a href="#scheme_6.20">Scheme 6.20</a>. Acylation of the anthracene-amine  <b>6.52 </b>with  <b>6.53</b> in the presence of dibenzo[24]crown-8 affords the rotaxane  <b>6.55</b>	in 22&#x0025; yield in a mixture of chloroform and water. The rotaxane is stabilized by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the ammonium group and the crown ether and also by &#x03C0;-&#x03C0; stacking interactions between the anthracene stopper and a benzo group in the crown ether. The same strategy has been employed in assembling pseudorotaxanes. Complex  <b>6.56	</b>forms spontaneously when dibenzylammonium ions are mixed with dibenzo[24]crown-8 (<a href="#fig_6.7">Fig. 6.7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Catenanes may also be formed <i>via</i> hydrogen bond directed assembly. By altering the synthetic route used to prepare his benzoquinone receptor (see <a href="Chapter05.xhtml#sec_5.1">Section 5.1</a>), Hunter has prepared the [2]catenane  <b>6.58</b> in 34&#x0025; yield (<a href="#scheme_6.21">Scheme 6.21</a>) by reaction of  <b>6.57</b> with isophthaloyl chloride. Hydrogen bonds hold two molecules of  <b>6.57</b> together perpendicular to one another in a semi- interlocked manner, and then isophthaloyl chloride completes macrocycle formation leaving the rings permanently interlocked. The catenane is stabilized by a combination of &#x03C0;-&#x03C0; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Peptide nanotubes</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Ghadiri and his co-workers at The Scripps Research Institute in California have recently reported the self-assembly of cyclic peptides <i>via</i> multiple hydrogen bonds. The peptides consist of a cyclic array of alternating L- and D- amino acids that adopt a conformation such that amide hydrogen bond donor N-H and acceptor C&#x003D;0 groups are oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the macrocycle. Each cyclic peptide can form twenty four hydrogen bonds (twelve &#x2018;up&#x2019; and twelve &#x2018;down&#x2019;), a process which enthalpically drives formation of the tube architecture ( <b>6.59</b>) (<a href="#fig_6.8">Fig. 6.8</a>). The assembly of these nanotubes is tunable, with different sizes of cyclic peptide leading to nanotubes of different<a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, 6 Self-assembly</a>diameter. These nanotubes are especially exciting because of the possibility of transporting molecules through the channel. Nanotubes constructed from hydrophobic amino acids have been suspended in lipid bilayer membranes and shown to transfer glucose molecules through the membrane.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>The tennis bail: encapsulation in a self-assembled capsule</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Rebek and co-workers have synthesized the self-complementary unit  <b>6.60</b> by condensing two molecules of glycoluril with durene tetrabromide. This building block is curved due to steric hindrance between the large number of phenyl groups protruding from one face of the molecule. Two molecules of  <b>6.60</b> self-assemble in solution <i>via</i> the formation of eight hydrogen bonds to make a &#x2018;tennis-ball&#x2019; like molecular capsule  <b>6.61</b> (<a href="#scheme_6.22">Scheme 6.22</a>). The assembled tennis ball is hollow allowing encapsulation of small molecules. Methane and xenon are two guests that have been captured by the use of the van der Waals interactions.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>Self-replicating molecular systems</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The design of molecules that are capable of replication is a research area of great interest to chemists studying the role of self-assembly in the evolution of early life. The concept is to create molecules that upon synthesis, actually enhance their own formation. In other words, the synthesis can feed back and the product molecule can be thought of as making additional copies of itself (self-replication). One such system is shown in <a href="#scheme_6.23">Scheme 6.23</a>. In this case the formation of an imine bond is catalysed by an orientational effect caused by the formation of amidinium-carboxylate salt bridges.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Reaction of 2-formylphenoxyacetate  <b>6.62</b> with 3-aminobenzamidinium  <b>6.63</b> produces the product  <b>6.64</b>.  <b>6.64</b> contains both carboxylate and amidinium groups and so forms a complex with the two individual starting materials  <b>6.62</b>- <b>6.64</b>- <b>6.63</b>. In this complex the amine and aldehyde groups on reagents  <b>6.62</b> and  <b>6.63</b> are held close together, increasing the likelihood of nucleophilic attack leading to imine bond formation (the reaction effectively becomes intra-molecular &#x2014; reducing the entropy costs of bond formation). This system is self-replicating because the product acts as a catalyst for its own formation (autocatalysis).</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.5	<b>Anion directed assemblies</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The role of anions in promoting the formation of self-assembled arrays has only recently begun to be studied. As we have seen in Chapter 3, anions are more challenging to recognize than cations because of their more diffuse nature (small charge to radius ratio), pH sensitivity and generally wider range of geometries. This might explain why very few examples of anion directed assemblies have been reported.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">A striking example of anion directed assembly is shown in <a href="#scheme_6.24">Scheme 6.24</a>. This pentametallic circular helicate  <b>6.65</b> forms when the tris-bipyridine ligand shown in the complex is mixed with an equimolar amount of FeCl<sub>2</sub> in ethylene glycol at 170&#x00B0;C. The structure is related to the helices shown earlier in the Chapter, with interwoven bipyridine strands coordinated to octahedral metal ions. The chloride anion bound in the centre of the helicate cannot be exchanged for other anions such as PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> or CF<sub>3</sub>S0<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> demonstrating the selectivity of the helicate for Cl<sup>-</sup>. If another iron salt is used in the reaction, such as Fe(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the pentametallic structure <i>does not form</i> and instead a hexameric complex is obtained. This clearly demonstrates the role played by the chloride anion in templating the assembly of the pentamer.</p>

<h2 class="h2">6.6 <b>Summary and conclusions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The use of supramolecular methodology in order to control intermolecular interactions has led to a stunning array of different molecular architectures: catenanes, rotaxanes, helices, knots, macrocycles, racks, ladders, grids, tubes... the structures synthesized seem limited only by the imagination of the chemist. The &#x2018;building block&#x2019; approach to these assemblies allows the synthesis of structures which would be inaccessible or non-viable <i>via</i> traditional organic synthesis, which focusses on the formation of individual covalent bonds. What is more, many of the self-assembled systems discussed in this chapter are now exhibiting interesting functions ranging from guest encapsulation or transport through to storage of information at the nanometre level and the self-assembly of zeolite type materials (see margin). The future for self-assembled supramolecular systems appears very bright indeed.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-12.3em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside1">The principles of supramolecular chemistry can be applied to the crystalline state. Hydrogen bonding, metal-ligand coordination and charge transfer interactions are currently being used in an attempt to predict and control the formation of novel three dimensional lattice frameworks. By appropriate design, these zeolite-like materials may exhibit novel inclusion, catalytic, magnetic or electronic properties. This area of chemistry is known as &#x2018;crystal engineering&#x2019; and is unfortunately beyond the scope of this book. Interested readers are however urged to consult the further reading section at the end of this chapter.</p></aside>
