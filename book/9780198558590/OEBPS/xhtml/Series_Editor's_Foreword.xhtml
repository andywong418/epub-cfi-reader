<p class="fmnoindent">The carbonyl ligand acts as a supporting group to stabilize a vast variety of complexes, many of which are polynuclear. The dimers and clusters display an elegant structural chemistry, providing both challenges for contemporary theory and a framework on which to build new organometallic chemistry; this can provide excellent models for species on metal surfaces and heterogenous catalysts.</p>
<p class="fmindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing material that would usually be covered in an 8&#x2013;10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series will provide explanations and rationales that form the framework of the understanding of inorganic chemistry. Following her Primer on <i>Cluster Molecules of the p-block elements</i>, Catherine Housecroft has provided us with another detailed, authoritative description of polynuclear compounds. This will give both those planning courses and undergraduates alike many interesting examples of the chemistry of polynuclear metal carbonyls.</p>
