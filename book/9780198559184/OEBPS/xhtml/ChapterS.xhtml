<p class="noindent">Initially one may think that the coordination geometry which is observed in the solid state for a compound is maintained in solution. After all one knows from organic chemistry that the tetrahedral geometry is almost universal for all saturated carbon atoms. However, spectroscopic measurements have indicated that in many inorganic compounds the coordination polyhedron is not rigid and the geometry of the complex varies with time. Whether these changes are observable by spectroscopic techniques depends on the time scale of the experiment relative to the time required for the molecule to rearrange its coordination polyhedron.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The energetics associated with rearranging coordination geometries depends in part on how much the atoms have to move in order to complete the transformation and also on the symmetries of the orbitals involved. For example, tetrahedral carbon compounds are stereochemically rigid because their interconversion would require an intermediate square-planar geometry which necessitates the formation of dsp<sup>2</sup> hybrids rather than the sp<sup>3</sup> hybrids characteristic of the tetrahedron. Since the d orbitals are very high lying this poses problems for molecules based on carbon or other main group atoms. In contrast there are many examples of tetrahedral and square-planar nickel(II) complexes and in solution they interconvert rapidly on the n.m.r. time scale. Ni<sup>&#x2161;</sup> ions with a 3d<sup>8</sup>4s<sup>0</sup>4p<sup>0</sup> ground state has the valence orbitals readily available to form both tetrahedral and square-planar bonding geometries.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Many five, seven, eight, and nine coordinate compounds are stereochemically non-rigid on the nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) time scale (see the table and note in the margin). For these coordination numbers there are several alternative coordination polyhedra with very similar energies and consequently only minor angular changes are required to interconvert them.</p>

<b>Fig- S.1</b> A mechanism for the interchange of ligands in a trigonal bipyramidal compound
</figcaption>

<p class="indent3-ka">For example, for a trigonal bipyramidal molecule (D<sub>3h</sub>) there a two- distinct symmetry inequivalent sites&#x2014;axial (a) and equatorial (e) in the ratio <a id="page_71" class="page">Page 71, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a>of 2:3. If the axial and two of the equatorial atoms are moved as shown in <a href="#fig_S.1">Fig. S.l</a> the a-M-a angle is reduced from 180&#x00B0; and the e-M-e angle is increased from 120&#x00B0;. A point is reached where both of these angles are equal. At this point the coordination geometry corresponds to a square-pyramid (C<sub>4v</sub>) with the e atom which has remained stationary lying on the four fold symmetry axis.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">Although in the parent trigonal bipyramid the a and e atoms were symmetry distinct four of them are symmetry equivalent in the intermediate square pyramid. If the motions of the a and e atoms are continued then eventually a trigonal bipyramid is formed once more, but it has effectively rotated by 90&#x00B0; relative to the initial trigonal bipyramid. This trigonal bipyramid has the axial atoms now occupying equatorial sites and two of the initial equatorial atoms occupying axial sites. Therefore, the simple motions outlined above provide a mechanism for averaging the equatorial and axial environments.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">The process is described as a Berry pseudo-rotation because R. S. Berry of the University of Chicago was the first to propose that the internal motions within the molecule described above resulted in what is in effect a 90&#x00B0; rotation of the molecule as a whole. There are many examples of stereochemically non-rigid five-coordinate complexes, particularly in phosphorus(V) compounds and d<sup>8</sup> metal complexes. In some cases, e.g. PF<sub>5</sub> and Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>, the activation energy for the rearrangement process is so small that it is not possible to slow down the process sufficiently at low temperatures for the symmetry inequivalent environments to be observed in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Where electronic factors lead to a significant energy difference between trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal geometries (e.g. for low spin d<sup>6</sup> transition metal complexes, 
<a href="ChapterA.xhtml#page_15">see page 15</a>) the activation energy is significantly larger and at room temperature the complexes may appear to be stereochemically rigid.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In summary, five coordinate complexes are generally stereochemically non-rigid because there are two alternative coordination geometries with similar energies. The interconversion of these polyhedra provides a mechanism for permuting the symmetry inequivalent atoms. The process is intramolecular and may be effectively studied by variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance measurements if the frequency of permuting the inequivalent nuclei has the same order of magnitude as the difference in resonance frequencies for the symmetry inequivalent nuclei.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">For seven, eight, and nine coordination the occurrence of alternative coordination geometries with similar energies leads to many examples of stereochemically non-rigid molecules. The following coordination polyhedra are usually involved:</p>

</figure>                       
                        


<p class="indent3-ka">Octahedral complexes with simple ligands are generally stereochemically rigid, because the energy difference between the octahedral and the trigonal prismatic coordination environments is quite large. The repulsions between <a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a>the ligands are much larger in the former and this contributes significantly to the energy difference. However, complexes with bidentate ligands where the ligand atoms involved in chelation are forced to remain at approximately the same distance apart rearrange more readily. The process which is illustrated in <a href="#fig_S.2">Fig. S.2 </a>is described as a <i>Bailar twist.</i></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">It is noteworthy that for the system shown in <a href="#fig_S.2">Fig. S.2 </a>the Bailar twist results in the interconversion of enantiomers. Therefore, if the initial complex is enantiomerically pure and it undergoes a Bailar twist in solution the loss of optical activity provides a means of establishing the rate of the process.</p>

<figcaption class="aside"><b>Fig. S .3 </b>The DSD mechanism</figcaption></figure>
</aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">Many of these rearrangement processes are examples of a more general topological process described as a <i>diamond-square-diamond</i> (DSD) rearrangement. The process is shown in <a href="#fig_S.3">Fig. S.3.</a> For a polyhedron with two adjacent triangular faces then if the edge common to both triangles is broken and remade using the other two vertices then the process converts one diamond shape into a second rotated by 90&#x00B0; via a square intermediate. This process either converts the initial polyhedron into a different polyhedron or into the same polyhedron with the vertices permuted.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">In the process the connectivities (v<sub>m</sub>, v<sub>m&#x002B;1</sub>) of the vertices which define the diamond change. Those that were initially joined reduce their connectivities by one and the other two increase their connectivities by one. Therefore, if the initial polyhedron has exclusively triangular faces then it is only possible for it to rearrange to an identical polyhedron via a single DSD process if there are pairs of opposite vertices which differ in their connectivities by 1 (<a href="#fig_S.3">see Fig. S.3</a>). <a href="#table_S.1">Table S.l</a> summarizes the connectivities of deltahedra, i.e. polyhedra with triangular faces exclusively, and this provides a basis of choosing polyhedra capable of undergoing such rearrangements. The trigonal bipyramid provides such an example since vertices with connectivities of 3 and 4 may be chosen to define the diamond as shown in <a href="#fig_S.4">Fig. S.4.</a> The DSD process illustrated in <a href="#fig_S.4">Fig. S.4</a> is identical to the Berry pseudo-rotation discussed earlier, but it has been defined in terms of the coordination polyhedron rather than alterations in the metal-ligand bond angles. An alternative diamond for the trigonal bipyramid based on 3v<sub>4</sub> and v<sub>3</sub> would not lead to a rearranged trigonal bipyramid, but an alternative and indeed unrealizable polyhedron because the connectivities after the rearrangement would be v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, and 2v<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">For an octahedron the vertices all are four-connected and it is impossible to use a single DSD to generate an equivalent octahedron. A single DSD <a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a>process results in the conversion of the octahedron (6V<sub>4</sub>) into a distinctly different polyhedron with 2v<sub>4</sub>,2v<sub>5</sub>, and 2v<sub>6</sub>&#x2014;a bicapped tetrahedron (<a href="#fig_S.4">see Fig. S.4</a>). Other deltahedra which are capable of rearranging via a single DSD process are the dodecahedron, the tricapped trigonal prism, and the octadecahedron.</p>

<p class="aside1">The discussion may have left the impression that in the solid state all coordination compounds adopt idealised polyhedral structures. However, for those compounds where the potential energy surface connecting the alternative polyhedral geometries is soft then crystal packing effects may favour the adoption of non- regular structures. A careful examination of the structures of a series of related complexes often shows that they have geometries which lie close to the reaction coordinate (the minimum energy path) which interconnects the idealized geometries. These structures therefore give snapshots of the rearrangement process and collectively document the preferred rearrangement pathway.</p>
<p class="aside1" style="text-indent:2em;">The presence of a soft potential energy surface may also lead to the observation of alternative coordination geometries for the same ion within one crystal. For example, [Ni(CN)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3&#x005F;</sup> has been observed in trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal forms within one crystal</p>
</aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">The polyhedra which are not able to rearrange to an identical polyhedron by a single DSD process require multiple and perhaps simultaneous DSD processes to account for their non-rigidity. For example, the Bailar twist illustrated in <a href="#fig_S.2">Fig. S.2</a> corresponds to three DSD processes occurring simultaneously.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Superconductors</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In metals the electrical resistance arises either from impurities in the lattice or vibrations of the metal atoms which produce instantaneous irregularities in the otherwise regular three dimensional lattice. Both of these effects impede the smooth movement of electrons through the lattice. The effect of impurities may be reduced by refining the metals and their influence is independent of temperature. The vibrations of the metal atoms are reduced as the temperature is decreased and therefore in general the resistivity of a metal decreases as shown in <a href="#fig_S.5">Fig. S.5.</a> For certain metals the resistivity show a very dramatic and sudden decrease in resistivity at a critical temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, near absolute zero. The resistivity suddenly falls to zero as shown in <a href="#fig_S.6">Fig. S.6 </a>and the metal becomes a superconductor. Some typical <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> values for metals and alloys are given in <a href="#table_S.2">Table S.2.</a></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The occurrence of superconductivity in metals and alloys is generally interpreted using the BCS (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schieffer) theory which relates the zero resistance to the pairwise motion of the electrons. These electrons pairs are described as Cooper&#x2019;s pairs. The following analogy may be helpful. In motor car rallies which take place on winding roads much higher speeds can be achieved when there are two occupants per car&#x2014;one driving and one navigating&#x2014;than those achieved by cars with a single occupant.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">At normal temperatures the motion of an electron through a lattice is resisted by the large vibrational motions of the atoms, however as the temperature is reduced these motions have smaller amplitudes and the path of the electron through the more regular maze of atoms is made easier. In these circumstances the location of an electron can itself perturb the lattice. For example, an electron in a bonding region between atoms can make the metal atoms move closer together. When the electron moves on it leaves a cavity in the metal lattice which is very attractive towards a second electron. Therefore the first electron has induced a memory effect which facilitates the motion of the second electron. Therefore, the co-operative movements of the electrons and the nuclei can accelerate the motions of the electrons. No resistance is experienced by the electrons as they move through the lattice if the coupling is really effective. The nuclear motions are easing the flow of electrons in much the same way as a sewing needle is moved through a narrow cylinder of material by a concerted series of squeezing motions.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The average distances between Cooper&#x2019;s pairs of electrons is calculated to be rather large up to 100,000 pm and therefore the interactions are rather weak. Consequently they are only usefully considered as a pair at low temperatures when the vibrational energies associated with the movements of the atoms do not swamp out the effects.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Despite the weak nature of the interaction it is useful to consider the Cooper&#x2019;s pair as a quasi-particle with a charge and mass double those of a single electron. Single electrons are classified as <i>fermions</i> and therefore they must conform to the <i>aufbau principle</i> and no two electrons can occupy the same quantum mechanical state (Pauli exclusion principle). A Cooper&#x2019;s pair on the other hand is classified as a <i>boson</i> and the normal aufbau filling of energy states no longer applies because all Cooper&#x2019;s pairs can occupy the most stable energy state. This provides a mechanism for explaining the very dramatic change in resistivity at <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i> When the energies of the vibrational motions of the atoms become smaller than the energies associated with the formation of Cooper&#x2019;s pairs then the band structure of the metal suddenly changes because instead of many energy levels being filled by pairs of electrons with opposing spins one energy level completely filled with Cooper&#x2019;s pairs is formed. The energy level is quite well separated from the next energy state and therefore the Cooper&#x2019;s pairs move through the lattice like a vast mob ignoring all the scattering nuclei which could cause a resistance to their motion.</p>
<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-19em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<p class="aside">All nuclear particles may be classified as <i>fermions</i> or <i>bosons.</i> Their angular momentum is related to their nuclear spin. Electrons, protons, and neutrons are fermions, which in general are associated with an angular momentum of <i>nh</i>/2&#x03C0; (<i>n</i> is a halfinteger multiplier), and are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. Bosons, e.g. mesons, have an angular momentum of zero or <i>nh</i>/2&#x03C0; (where <i>n</i> is an integer multiplier) and do not conform to the exclusion principle</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The zero resistivity associated with superconductivity is experimentally very difficult to measure and therefore the transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, is established by direct current magnetic measurements. A superconductor is a perfect diamagnet and persistent currents on the surface of the material expel <a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a> all magnetic flux. The diamagnetic properties also exhibit some specific hysteresis effects.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Cooling a superconducting sample in the absence of a magnetic field below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> and then measuring the diamagnetism in an applied magnetic field whilst warming is described as a <i>zero field experiment</i> (ZFC). The superconductor exhibits perfect diamagnetism. If the diamagnetism is measured whilst cooling through <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> and then this is followed by measurements on warming they are described as <i>field cooled</i> measurements (FC). The magnetic flux present inside the sample above <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> is trapped inside the shielding currents on the surface below <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i> The FC diamagnetic susceptibility is therefore smaller than the ZFC susceptibility. This hysteresis effect is known as the Meissner effect and is the ultimate proof of superconductivity.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">In recent years a range of materials have been discovered which are not alloys or metals and yet exhibit high <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> values&#x2014;in some instances higher than that of boiling liquid nitrogen. Some of these inorganic and organic compounds are summarized in <a href="#table_S.3">Table S.3.</a> The only two factors they have in common is that they have infinite solid state structures and one of the ions does not have a simple integer oxidation state. The field took an enormous leap forward in 1986 when Bednorz and Muller (IBM, Zurich) reported that a ceramic material based on an lanthanum-barium-copper oxide (see <a href="#fig_S.7">Fig. S.7</a>) became superconducting at 35 K. The discovery of this compound meant that a whole range of substitutional chemistry could be used to introduce variations into the compound&#x2019;s formulae and structures. Indeed, within a year Chu (University of Texas, Houston) had reported that a yttrium-barium- copper oxide had a <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> above the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77.4 K). These &#x2018;high temperature ceramic superconductors&#x2019; therefore display a very dramatic Meissner Effect. If a pellet of the superconductor is placed on a magnet and then the sample and the magnet are cooled by pouring liquid nitrogen over them the pellet is observed to levitate above the magnet when its temperature falls below <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Copper is essential for the observation of superconducting properties in these materials and the introduction of the alternative counter ions has small effects on the copper-copper distances and the structures and these appear to be very important in influencing <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i> The copper-copper distances can also be influenced by putting the ceramic pellets under pressure and generally this has the effect of increasing <i>T<sub>c</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The BCS theory described above which develops the consequences of Cooper&#x2019;s pairs interactions at low temperatures when the atomic vibrations are minimal is clearly not directly applicable to these copper ceramic superconductors. The interaction involving the Cooper&#x2019;s pairs is clearly stronger and this is confirmed by the average distance between the pair of electrons falls to about 3000 pm. It is thought that the anti-ferromagnetic coupling between these copper ions is very important to the formation of the Cooper&#x2019;s pairs in these systems. The oxidation state of copper is crucial in determining whether they are superconducting and their T<sub>c</sub> value. In order for the compound to be superconducting the oxidation state has to be either greater than or less than two but not equal to two.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>Symmetry</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">A chemist intuitively uses symmetry in the process of recognizing which atoms in a molecule are equivalent. For example in SF<sub>5</sub>C1 (<a href="#fig_S.8">Fig. S.8</a>), it is easy to see that there are two sets of equivalent fluorine atoms in a ratio 4:1. The recognition of the number of equivalent sites in a molecule is important for analysing the n.m.r. spectrum and determining the number of isomers that may exist.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Symmetry plays a particularly important role in the determining the structure of molecules by spectroscopic methods. The interpretation of data from IR spectra, UV spectra, dipole moments, and optical activities all depend upon molecular symmetry.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><b>Symmetry elements and operations</b></h3>

<p class="noindent">Symmetry is clearly related to the notion of equivalence but a precise definition of symmetry must establish more precisely the mental operations necessary to demonstrate these equivalencies. It is useful to make a clear distinction between symmetry operations and symmetry elements.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><b>A symmetry operation</b> is defined as a <b>movement</b> <i>of a molecule towards a new orientation in which every point in the molecule is coincident with an equivalent point (or the same point) of the molecule in its original orientation.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><b>A symmetry element</b> is a <b>geometrical entity</b> such as a <b>plane,</b> a</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>point</b> or a <b>line,</b> with respect to which one or more symmetry operations may be carried out.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Symmetry elements and operations define molecular symmetry and are summarised in <a href="#table_S.4">Table S.4.</a> Interestingly, the final operation is a combination of two of the earlier symmetry operations and yet represents an independent process. This is therefore analogous to the movement of a knight on a chess board which involves the combination of north-south and east-west movements in a unique way.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Symmetry operations may be illustrated using some specific examples. <a href="#fig_S.9">Fig. S.9</a> shows the effect of successive symmetry operations on a general point <b>a.</b> Rotation by 90&#x00B0; in a clockwise direction about the <i>z-</i> axis, which is <span class="noindent"><a id="page_77" class="page">Page 77, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a></span>directed into and perpendicular to the plane of the page, generates a new point <b>b,</b> a 180&#x00B0; rotation yields a point <b>c,</b> and a 270&#x00B0; rotation point <b>d.</b> By definition, these four points must be related by the symmetry operations C<sub>4</sub> (rotation by 90&#x00B0;), C<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>(rotation by 2 x 90&#x00B0; &#x003D; 180&#x00B0;) and  C<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup>(rotation by 270&#x00B0;) about the symmetry axis <i>z</i></p>

4.	Every element must have an <i>inverse</i> that is also an element of the group. The inverse <b>S &#x003D; Q</b><sup> -1</sup>of an element <b>Q </b>is defined in the following way: <b>QS &#x003D; SQ &#x003D; E</b></p></aside>

<p class="noindent"><i>A systematic procedure for symmetry classification of molecules</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The following steps provide a systematic methodology for classifying
molecules according to their point groups.</p>
<p class="frc">1.	&#160;&#160;Determine whether the molecule belongs to one of the 'special' groups (<a href="#table_S.5">Table S.5</a>) above), that is C<sub>&#x221E;</sub><sub>v</sub>or D<sub>&#x221E;h</sub>or to one of those with multiple high-order axes. Only <i>linear molecules</i> can belong to C<sub>&#x221E;v</sub> or D<sub>&#x221E;h</sub>.  The especially high symmetry of the others is usually obvious. All of the cubic groups-T, T<sub>h</sub>, T<sub>d</sub>, O, and Oh-require four C<sub>3</sub> axes, while the icosahedral groups, l and l<sub>h</sub> require 10 C<sub>3</sub>' s only and six C<sub>5</sub>'s. These multiple C<sub>3</sub>'s and C<sub>5</sub>'s are the key things to look for. In practice, only molecules built on a central tetrahedron, octahedron, cubeoctahedron, cube, or icosahedron will qualify, and these polyhedra are usually very conspicuous.</p>

<aside class="abc" style="margin-top:-13em;" epub:type="sidebar">
<figure class="fig1" style="width:100%"><img src="../images/page_82_2.jpg" alt="images"/> </figure></aside>

<p class="frc">2. If the molecule belongs to none of the special groups, search for proper or improper axes of rotation. If no axes of either type can be found, look for a plane or centre of symmetry. If a plane only is found, the group is C<sub>s</sub>. If a centre only is found (this is very rare) the group is C<sub>i</sub>.<a id="page_82" class="page">Page 82, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a>
If no symmetry elements at all are evident, the group is the trivial one containing only the identity operation and is designed <i>C<sub>1</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="frc">3. If an <i>even</i>-order improper axis (in practice only <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>6</sub>, and <i>S<sub>8</sub></i> are common) is found but no planes of symmetry or any proper axis except a collinear one (or more) whose presence is automatically required by the improper axis, the group is <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>, <i>S<sub>6</sub>,</i> and <i>S</i><sub>8</sub>.... An <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>- axis requires a <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-axis; an <i>S</i><sub>6</sub>-axis requires a <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>-axis; and an <i>S</i><sub>8</sub>-axis requires both <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axes. The important point here is the <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> <i>(n even)</i> groups consists exclusively of the operations generated by the <i>S</i><sub>n</sub>-axis. If any additional operation is possible, we are dealing with a <i>D</i><sub>n</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>nd</sub>, or <i>D</i><sub>nh</sub> type of group. Molecules belonging to the <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> groups are relatively rare, and the conclusion that a molecule belongs to such a group should be checked thoroughly before it is accepted.</p>

<figcaption class="figcap1"  style="width:100%"><b>Fig. S.17</b> A flow sheet for determining the point group for a molecule</figcaption></figure>

<p class="frc">4. Once it is certain that the molecule belongs to none of the groups so far considered, look for the highest-order proper axis. It is possible that there will be no axis of uniquely high order but instead some three C<sub>2</sub> axes. In such a case, we look to see whether one of them is geometrically unique in some sense, for example collinear with a unique molecular axis. This occurs with the molecule P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, which is<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a>one of the examples to be worked through later. If all the axes appear quite similar to one another, then any one may be selected at random as the axis to which the vertical or horizontal character of the planes is referred. Suppose that <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> is our reference or principal axis. The crucial question now is whether there exists a set of <i>nC<sub>2</sub></i> axes perpendicular to the <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> axis. If so, we proceed to step 5. If not, the molecule belongs to one of the groups <i>C</i><sub>n</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>nv</sub>, or <i>C<sub>nh</sub>.</i> If there are no symmetry elements except the <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> axis, the group is <i>C<sub>n</sub>.</i> If there are <i>n</i> vertical planes, the group is <i>C</i><sub>nv</sub>. If there is a horizontal plane, the group is <i>C</i><sub>nh</sub>.</p>

<p class="frc">5. If, in addition to the principal <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> axis, there are <i>nC<sub>2</sub></i> axes lying in a plane perpendicular to the <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> axis, the molecule belongs to one of the groups <i>D</i><sub>n</sub>, <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i>h</sub>, or <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i>d</sub>. If there are no symmetry elements besides <i>C<sub>n</sub> </i>and the <i>nC<sub>2</sub></i> axes, the group is <i>D<sub>n</sub>.</i> Should there also be a horizontal plane of symmetry, the group is <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i>h</sub> group and will also contain necessarily <i>n</i> vertical planes; these planes contain the <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> axes. If there is no &#x03C3;<sub>h</sub> but there is a set of <i>n</i> vertical planes which pass between the <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> axes, the group is <i>D</i><sub><i>n</i>d</sub>.</p>

We shall deal throughout with molecules which do not belong to any of the special groups, and we shall also omit molecules belonging to<i> C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>s</sub>, and <i>C<sub>i</sub></i> Thus, each illustration will begin at step 3, the search for an even-order <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> axis.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Example 1. The molecule SF<sub>4</sub> is set up as shown with the axial fluorine atoms along the <i>x</i> axis and the equatorial fluorine atoms in the <i>yz</i> plane.</p>

<p class="noindent">Step 4. The highest-order proper axis is a <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axis passing through the sulfur atom and bisecting a line between the equatorial fluorine atoms. There are no other <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axes. Therefore, SF<sub>4</sub>, must belong to <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2v</sub>, or <i>C</i><sub>2h</sub>. Since it has two vertical planes, one of which is the molecular plane <i>(yz),</i> it belongs to the group <i>C</i><sub>2v</sub>.</p>


<p class="indent3-ka">Example 2. The P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> molecule is shown in the margin with a <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> axis passing through the apical phosphorus atom and bisecting the triangle of sulfur atoms.</p>



<p class="noindent">Step 3. There is no improper axis.</p><a id="page_84" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 84, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a><p class="noindent">Step 4. The only proper axis is a <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> axis; there are no <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axes at all. Hence, the point group must be <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3v</sub>, or <i>C</i><sub>3h</sub>. There are three vertical planes, one passing through each P-S-P group. The group is therefore <i>C</i><sub>3v</sub>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Example 3. Two views of the P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> molecule are shown in the margin</p>. 
<p class="noindent">Step 3. There is an <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> axis coinciding with the <i>z</i> axis. However, there are also other symmetry elements besides the <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axis, which is a necessary consequence of the <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>. Most obvious perhaps, are the planes of symmetry passing through the pairs of adjacent P atoms. Thus, although an <i>S<sub>4</sub></i> axis is present, the additional symmetry rules out the point group <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Step 4. In addition to the <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axis lying along the <i>z</i> axis there are two more <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axes perpendicular to this one, as shown in the margin. Thus, the group must be of <i>D</i>-type, and we proceed to step 5.</p>

<p class="noindent">Step 5. Taking the <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axis lying along the <i>z</i> axis of the molecule as the reference axis, we look for a &#x03C3;<sub>h</sub>. One is not present, so the group<i>D</i><sub>2h</sub> is eliminated. There are, however, two vertical planes which lie between the <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> axes, so the group is <i>D</i><sub>2d</sub>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Symmetry and Optical Activity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many substances can rotate the plane of polarization of a ray of polarized light. These substances are said to be optically active. In molecular terms, the one necessary and sufficient condition for a substance to exhibit optical activity is that its molecular structure be such that it cannot be superimposed on its image obtained by reflection in a mirror. When this condition is satisfied the molecular exists in two forms, showing equal but opposite optical properties and the two forms are called <i>enantiomers.</i></p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Whether a molecule is or is not superimposable on its mirror image is a question of symmetry. A molecule that contains a <i>n</i>-fold improper rotation axis of symmetry <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> is always superimposable on its mirror image. This is true because the operation <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> consists of two parts: a rotation <i>C<sub>n</sub></i> and a reflection &#x03C3;. Since reflection creates the mirror image, the operation <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> is equivalent to rotating the mirror image in space. By definition, a molecule containing an <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> axis is brought into coincidence with itself by the operation <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> and hence its mirror image, after rotation, is superimposable. As <i>S<sub>1</sub> &#x003D;</i> &#x03C3; and <i>S<sub>2</sub> &#x003D; i</i>, a molecule with either a plane or a centre of symmetry is also optically inactive. However, the most general and economical rule is that <i>a molecule with an S<sub>n</sub> axis is optically inactive.</i></p>

<p class="aside"><b>Diastereoisomerism</b>
A ligand (or more generally a molecular fragment) which has two groups related by a plane of symmetry will lose this equivalence if coordinated to a metal complex lacking a plane of symmetry.

<h3 class="h3">Descent of symmetry</h3>
<p class="noindent">The idealised geometries described above are not always observed in actual molecules and therefore it is helpful to consider the effect of distortions on the point groups of commonly encountered molecules. For example, a regular octahedron may be distorted either along a four fold symmetry axis or</p><a id="page_86" class="page" style="width:70%">Page 86, Stereochemical non-rigidity</a><p class="noindent">a three fold axis. Further more the distortions may be executed in such a way that the centre of symmetry is retained or lost. The resulting point groups are illustrated in<a href="#fig_s.21"> Figs S.21</a> <a href="#fig_s.22">and S.22</a>. Corresponding distortions of the tetrahedron are illustrated in <a href="#fig_s.23">Fig. S.23</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The reduction in symmetry may also be achieved by substituting some of the atoms in the molecule. For example, the introduction of a single substituent into the octahedron leads to the point group <i>C</i><sub>4v</sub> which is identical to the point group resulting from lengthening a single bond of the octahedron along the four-fold axis. The introduction of two <i>trans-</i> substituents results in a lowering of the symmetry to <i>D</i><sub>4h</sub>, whereas the introduction of two <i>cis</i>-substituents leads to the <i>C</i><sub>2v</sub> point group.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Synergic bonding</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ligands such as CO and N<sub>2</sub> form only very weak complexes with conventional Lewis acids such as BF<sub>3</sub> because their lone pair donor orbitals have high ionization energies and are not effective in donating electron density. They nevertheless form stable complexes with transition metals in low oxidation states. This achieved because the &#x03C3;-donation is supplemented by back donation from filled metal d orbitals to the relatively low lying antibonding  &#x03C0;&#x002A;orbitals of the ligands. The &#x03C3;-donation of electron density from the CO ligand to the metal, and back donation from filled d orbitals on the metal to empty &#x03C0;&#x002A;-orbitals of the ligand both of which have rc-symmetry with respect to the M-C bond are illustrated in <a href="#fig_s.24">Fig. S.24</a> and a valence bond representation of the redistribution of multiple bonds is illustrated in the margin.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The complementary &#x03C3; and &#x03C0; components ensure that the metal remains approximately electroneutral.

<p class="indent3-ka">Since the back donation occurs from filled metal d orbitals to empty CO &#x03C0;&#x002A; orbitals the degree of back donation increases the multiple bonding</p>

Initially it was proposed that the phosphines are able to function as &#x03C0;-acceptors through their empty 3d orbitals as shown on the left hand side of<a href="#fig_S.26"> Fig. S.26</a>. However, these orbitals are at very high energies and the more favoured current</p>


<p class="noindent"><a id="page_89" class="page" >Page 89, Synergic bonding</a>explanation is that they act as &#x03C0;-acceptors through the antibonding P-X molecular orbitals as shown on the right hand side of <a href="#fig_S.26">Fig. S.26</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The symmetries of the orbitals involved are the same and therefore there are few simple experiments which can discriminate between the relative contributions of the alternative interactions. Whatever, the precise mechanism the following relative orders of donor and acceptor abilities may
be proposed:</p>
