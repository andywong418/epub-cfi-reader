<h2 class="h2"><b>Band theory</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Band theory extends the molecular orbital theory ideas which were developed  for simple molecules to infinite solids. It is particularly useful for discussing the electrical conductivity and magnetic properties of compounds where the interactions between the individual components, be they atoms or molecules, are significant. It is therefore useful to briefly review the basic concepts underlying a molecular orbital analysis of the bonding in a simple diatomic molecule derived from second row atoms, e.g. B<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, 0<sub>2</sub>. As the two atoms of the diatomic molecule which are initially a long distance apart are brought together molecular orbitals which are delocalized over the whole molecule are generated by the overlap of symmetry-matching atomic orbitals. The 2s-2s, 2p<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>-2p<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>, and 2p<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>-2p<sub>&#x03C0;</sub> overlaps which fall into this category are shown in <a href="#fig_B.1">Fig. B.l.</a> The resulting molecular orbitals at the equilibrium distance are illustrated in <a href="#fig_B.2">Fig. B.2</a>. Since there are initially 8 valence atomic orbitals 8 molecular orbitals are generated and their symmetries are illustrated in <a href="#fig_B.2">Fig. B.2.</a> The relative energies of the orbitals are determined primarily by the following parameters:</p>



<p class="noindent" style="margin-left:2em;text-indent:-2em;width:65%">1.	The efficiency of orbital overlap between the two atoms, i.e. 2s-2s, 2p<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>-
	2p<sub>&#x03C3;</sub>, and <i>2p<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>-2p<sub>&#x03C0;</sub>.</i> The larger the overlap the greater is the energy

<p class="indent3-ka" >The resulting molecular orbital diagram of <a href="#fig_B.2">Fig. B.2 </a>has ignored the possibility of overlap between an s orbital on one atom and a p orbital on the second and vice versa, which is also symmetry allowed. The extent of interaction depends on the overlaps involved and the 2s-2p orbital separation. This supplementary interaction is introduced into the molecular orbital scheme by allowing molecular orbitals of the same symmetry to interact in such a way that the bonding component is stabilized and the antibonding component is destabilized. These interactions are illustrated on the left-hand side of<a href="#fig_B.2"> Fig. B.2</a> and the atomic orbital overlaps contributing to the mixing of s and p character are shown in <a href="#fig_B.3">Fig. B.3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">This relatively simple molecular orbital analysis is useful because it provides a rationalization of the following experimental features.</p>

 <p class="indent3-ka">These ideas may be extended to an infinite solid where all the atoms are arranged in a closed packed manner with the following modifications. If a large number of atoms are brought together a very closely spaced set of molecular orbitals is generated rather than a few well spaced orbitals.<a href="#fig_B.5"> Fig. B.5</a> illustrates the evolution of molecular orbitals as the number of atoms is increased. This simple picture is based on a string of alkali metal atoms. The resultant spectrum of closely spaced molecular orbitals is described as a <i>band.</i> The width of the band of molecular orbitals is decided primarily by the extent of overlap between the orbitals. Very efficient overlap between the orbitals leads to a large band width, whereas ineffective overlap leads to a narrow band.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_B.5">Fig. B.5</a> suggests that each energy state is associated with only a single molecular orbital, but this is an oversimplification. If the string of alkali metal atoms is studied in more detail it is apparent that there is only one combination of s orbitals which is totally in phase. This is the most stable molecular orbital. Similarly there is only one combination that is totally out-of-phase and this is the least stable molecular orbital. However, for molecular orbitals lying between these extremes, there are a number of permutations of in- and out-of-phase orbitals which have identical energies. For example, there are the two equivalent non-bonding combinations shown in the middle of<a href="#fig_B.6"> Fig. B.6</a>. They have equal energies but the precise location of the nodes differs. Molecular orbitals which lie between the non-bonding levels and the bottom and top of the band have many more equivalent permutations. Therefore, the bands are better represented by the line diagram shown on the left in <a href="#fig_B.7">Fig. B.7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Since the number of atoms in a typical metal approximates to an infinite number the histogram representing the energy levels may be replaced by a density of states diagram such as that shown on the right-hand side of<a href="#fig_B.7"> Fig. B.7</a>. The horizontal axis represents the number of energy levels between <i>E</i> and <i>E</i> &#x002B;<i>&#x03B4;E.</i> The number of states within each band is equal to the total of all
<a id="page_21" class="page">Page 21, Band theory </a>
orbitals contributed by the <i>N</i> atoms. For example, an s band will consist of <i>N</i> states and a p band <i>3N</i> states. Each energy state may be occupied by a pair of electrons with opposing spins, conforming to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and the states are filled in an  <i>aufbau</i> fashion. The bands will generally contain the electrons that resided in the parent atomic orbital, and this can result in empty, partially filled, or totally filled bands. In addition the bands can overlap in much the same way that the s and p atomic orbitals mix in diatomic molecules.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The extent to which the bands remain distinct depends on the s-p orbital separation and the overlaps&#x2014;if the s-p separation is large and the overlaps small then the bands remain distinct (<a href="#fig_B.8">Fig. B.8(a)</a>). Flowever, if the s-p separation is smaller and the overlaps are large then extensive band mixing occurs (<a href="#fig_B.8">Fig. B.8(b)</a>). For the alkaline earth metals and the metals of the main group elements the extent of overlap between the s and p bands is large, i.e. the situation is analogous to that shown on the right-hand side of <a href="#fig_B.8">Fig. B.8(b)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The electronic properties of a solid are closely connected with the band structure. The band that contains the highest energy electrons is called the valence band and the first unoccupied energy levels above these are described as the conduction band.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">There are four basic band structure types and they are shown in <a href="#fig_B.9">Fig. B.9</a>. In (a) the valence band is only partially occupied by electrons. The energy corresponding to the highest occupied state at 0 K is described as the Fermi energy,<i>E<sub>f</sub>.</i></p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Metals such as sodium and copper which have a half-filled s band are well represented by such a diagram. Alkaline earth metals and zinc, cadmium and mercury have just the right number of electrons to fill an s band. However, s-p band mixing of the type illustrated in <a href="#fig_B.8">Fig. B.8</a> occurs and the resultant combined band structure remains incompletely filled and these elements are metallic conductors. The diagram in <a href="#fig_B.9">Fig. B.9(b)</a> is a reasonable representation of this situation. Band theory always associates conductivity with the presence of partially filled bands.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">If the valence states are completely filled and the conduction band is empty then the solid has poor electronic conductivity properties. If the band gap is large (<a href="#fig_B.9">Fig. B.9(c)</a>) the solid is an insulator, whereas if the gap is smaller the solid is a semiconductor (<a href="#fig_B.9">Fig. B.9(d)</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The relationship between the band structure and electrical conductivity needs some further amplification. In order for an electron to become sufficiently free to be accelerated by an external electric field it has to have empty energy states very close to the level associated with the Fermi energy. Once an electron is promoted to these levels it experiences much less attraction from adjacent nuclei and can rapidly migrate through the solid when the electric field is applied. Therefore, conduction can be associated either with a partially filled valence band or the presence of a very small band gap between the valence band and the conduction band. All metals and alloys have partially filled valence bands. Graphite provides an interesting example of a conducting material which has a filled valence band but a zero band gap between the Fermi level and the conduction band.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The resistivity of a metal is influenced by imperfections in the crystal lattice due to impurity atoms, vacancies, interstitial atoms, dislocations, and the thermal vibrations of the atoms. All of these scatter the electron and make it change its direction. The mobility of the electron through the lattice is therefore an important parameter in influencing its resistivity. The number of electron carriers, i.e. the number of free electrons, is also important. The resistivity of a metal increases with temperature primarily because of the increase in the number of defects and the greater amplitudes of motion of the metal atoms in the lattice.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_B.9">Figs. B.9(a)</a> and<a href="#fig_B.9"> B.9(b) </a>illustrate band structures which are appropriate to metals and are associated with partially filled band structures. The band structures in<a href="#fig_B.9"> Figs. B.9(c)</a> and <a href="#fig_B.9">B.9(d)</a> represent situations where the valence band is filled and there is a significant band gap to the conduction band. If the band gap is greater than 3 eV then the material is an insulator. Diamond would provide a good example of such a situation. However, if the band gap is less than 3 eV the pure material is described as an intrinsic semiconductor. The conductivity of a semiconducting material increases with temperature because more electrons will have sufficient energy to be promoted into the conduction band. The conductivity also increases as the band gap decreases, For example, Ge which has a band gap approximately half that of Si has a conductivity four orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The band gap depends not only on the chemical composition of a material but also its physical state. For example, an amorphous material has a smaller band gap than a crystalline material.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">It should be emphasized that effective conduction is achieved in a semiconductor even when relatively few electrons are promoted. For example in pure silicon it has been estimated that there are approximately 1 x 10<sup>16</sup> charge carriers per cubic metre where the total number of atoms is 5 x 10<sup>28</sup>. It is important to note that the promotion of an electron from the valence band into the conduction band not only creates a charge carrier in the conduction band but also leaves a hole in the valence band. This hole provides a vacancy which can promote the movement of electrons in the<a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Band theory </a>
conduction band. The movement of an electron into this hole creates another hole where the electron originally resided. The situation resembles a solitaire board. If all the holes are filled by pegs then it is impossible to start the game, but once a single hole is created at the centre there are a number of moves which allow the pegs to be moved around the board. As the game proceeds the number of possibilities for moving the pegs increases rapidly and it is this which provides the challenge to the player wishing to plot the correct sequence of moves to leave only a single peg. The conductivities of semiconductors are also very sensitive to the presence of impurities. Where an impurity leads to either an occupied level in the band gap just below the conduction band or a vacant level just above the valence band such materials are described as extrinsic semiconductors.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The band model developed above is useful for rationalizing the relative enthalpies of atomization of the elements across rows of the periodic table (See<a href="#fig_B.10"> Fig. B.10</a>). It is noteworthy that for each row the maximum occurs for the Group 14 element which has four valence electrons. This is just the appropriate number for half filling the band structure which develops from the presence of four s and p orbitals per atom. Interestingly the trend appears to be insensitive to whether the element forms a metallic, infinite covalent, or molecular structure in the solid state. The other significant feature of <a href="#fig_B.10">Fig. B.10</a> is that in general the heats of atomization fall on descending a column of the periodic table and this reflects the weaker element-element bonding down a column as the atomic number increases.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The data shown in <a href="#table_B.2">Table B.2</a> for the fourth row elements, which include the first transition series, suggest that in general the melting points, boiling points, and enthalpies of atomization of these elements are closely correlated. The s and d block elements (K to Zn) show an overall increase in &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup> up to V and then there is a marked decrease to zinc.

<p class="indent3-ka">For the transition metals the band structure is dominated by overlapping d and s bands as shown in <a href="#fig_B.11">Fig. B.ll</a>. If the d band of molecular orbitals is filled in an  <i>aufbau</i> fashion the  &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup> should increase from a low initial value for d<sup>0</sup> to a maximum at d<sup>5</sup> (the half-filled shell), and a minimum for the completely filled shell (d<sup>10</sup>) . The s orbitals also generate a band which gives maximum binding energies for s<sup>1</sup> configurations. Therefore, for the transition elements the maximum binding energies (and &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup>  values) should be achieved for the 4s<sup>1</sup>3d<sup>5</sup> configuration and minimum for the 4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>10</sup> configuration (if d-s orbital mixing effects are neglected).</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">Although zinc does have the smallest &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup>, the maximum value is actually achieved for vanadium which has five valence electrons and then dips at chromium and manganese. For the transition elements the 3d electrons have particularly high electron-electron repulsion energies and consequently the idealized  <i>aufbau</i> filling of the band is not always achieved. Some of the molecular orbitals which are metal-metal bonding are only occupied by single electrons and this forces the additional electrons to occupy more antibonding metal-metal orbitals. Although the occupation of these orbitals reduces the metal-metal bonding, their occupation is favoured because the electron-electron repulsion effects are less than if the electrons were forced to occupy a bonding orbital which already contains a single electron.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Such elements therefore have lower than anticipated &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup> values. These  <i>aufbau</i> and non<i>-aufbau</i> fillings of metal orbital bands are illustrated schematically in<a href="#fig_B.12"> Fig. B.12</a>. The large exchange energies associated with the 4s<sup>1</sup>3d<sup>5</sup> (Cr) and 4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>5</sup> (Mn) configurations lead these elements to have non-<i>aufbau</i> configurations when the metallic band structures are populated and therefore they have the anomalously low  &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup>  values shown in <a href="#fig_B.13">Fig. B.13</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka"><a href="#fig_B.14">Fig. B.14</a> illustrates the &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup>  values for the second and third row transition elements respectively. For these elements the larger sizes of the 4d and 5d orbitals (as compared with those of the 3d orbitals) reduces the extent of electron-electron repulsion and the filling of the band structures occurs in a more <i>aufbau</i> fashion. The &#x0394;<sub>at</sub>H<sup>&#x019F;</sup>  values consequently follow the theoretical curve more closely. For the second row the maximum occurs at Nb (5 valence electrons) and W (6 valence electrons) for the third row and only a small dip in the graph is observed for the next metal.

<p class="noindent">In chemical terms this is achieved by intercalating ions between the layers of carbon atoms in graphite. The intercalation process is illustrated schematically in <a href="#fig_B.16">Fig. B.16</a>. For example, the reaction of graphite with potassium gives C<sub>8</sub>K, which in view of the very electropositive nature of potassium is better represented as C<sub>8</sub><sup>-</sup>K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. This means that one eighth of an electron per carbon enters into the conduction band and the density of states resembles that shown in <a href="#fig_B.15">Fig. B. 15(b)</a>. Addition of an oxidizing agent such as bromine results the intercalation of Br<sup>-</sup> ions between the graphitic layers and the formation of a compound with the formula C<sub>8</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>Br<sup>-</sup> and the loss of one eighth of an electron from the valence band of graphite as shown in <a href="#fig_B.15">Fig. 15(c)</a>. In contrast to graphite itself both of these intercalated derivatives are genuine metals and their conductivities are orders of magnitude greater than that of the parent graphitic material.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:-0.5em">The metal oxides, MO, generally have the sodium chloride structure although at times they are not simple stoichiometric compounds. In the sodium chloride structure the octahedral environment around the metal leads to the usual e<sub>g</sub>-t<sub>2g</sub> splitting (see Angular overlap model). The non-bonding t<sub>2g</sub> set point towards the matching orbitals on the adjacent metal ions and the overlap between the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals is small but sufficiently significant for a band structure to develop. The band structure is wider for the earlier metals in the transition series because the effective nuclear charge they experience is smaller and the orbitals are larger and overlap more effectively. These effects

are illustrated for TiO and NiO in <a href="#fig_B.17">Figs B.17</a> and <a href="#fig_B.18">B.18.</a> The resultant band is able to accommodate a total of 6 electrons and consequently for an ion such as Ti<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> it is partially filled and the resultant oxide is an electrical conductor whose conductivity equals 10<sup>3</sup>(&#x2126;cm)<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The other early transition metal oxides are also conductors because the band width is sufficiently large to give rise to effective delocalization of the electron density through the lattice and the bands are partially filled. For Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> however, the band width is much narrower (smaller orbital overlaps) and the t<sub>2g</sub> band is completely filled. The e<sub>g</sub> orbitals which contain two electrons for the d<sup>8</sup> Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ion also give rise to a band structure, but since these orbitals point at the oxide anions rather than adjacent metals they do not create a band which is effectively delocalized over all the metal atoms. Therefore, NiO shows no metallic conduction properties and behaves as an insulator.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The metal trioxides of the transition metals also display some interesting conducting properties. WO<sub>3</sub> is an insulator and is pale yellow in colour. It has the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure based on vertex sharing octahedra shown in <a href="#fig_B.19">Fig. B.19.</a> structure creates a cavity at the centre of the eight octahedra arranged at the vertices of a cube. In these materials the metals have octahedral coordination geometries and the d orbitals split into the usual e<sub>g</sub> and t<sub>2g</sub> sets. However, in the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure the metals are too far apart to overlap directly. The t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals do overlap strongly with the p orbitals of the oxide ions to generate a band structure with a significant width. The relevant orbital interactions are illustrated in<a href="#fig_B.20"> Fig. B.20</a>.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The bonding component of the band is localized primarily on the oxygen atoms and the antibonding component is localized mainly on the metal atoms. In W0<sub>3</sub> (W<sup>VI</sup>- d&#x00B0;) only the bonding component is filled and there is a significant band gap between this filled valence band and the empty
<a id="page_28" class="page">Page 28, Band theory </a>conduction band and therefore it is an insulator. In contrast ReO<sub>3</sub> (Re<sup>VI</sup> - d<sup>1</sup>) has a single electron occupying the band and therefore it is a metallic conductor. The reduced compound Na <sub>0.6</sub>WO<sub>3</sub> is also conducting because the electrons contributed by the sodium atoms enter into this band. The sodium ions are accommodated within the cuboctahedral cavity of the ReO<sub>3</sub> structure. These compounds are described as tungsten bronzes because of their appearance.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:0.5em"><i>Photoconductivity</i></p>
<p class="noindent"  style="margin-top:-0.5em">The discussion of semiconductors given above has concentrated around the excitation of electrons into the conduction band by thermal effects. They can also be excited by the absorption of light giving rise to the phenomenon of photoconductivity. For example, the visible spectrum of GaAs shows a distinct maximum at 1.5 eV (cf. the band gap of 1.42 eV given in <a href="#table_B.1">Table B.l</a>) which can be associated with such an excitation. The promotion of electrons into the conduction band creates pairs of electrons and holes which are held together by their mutual attraction. The application of an electric field causes them to migrate in opposite directions and conduction results. Photoconducting materials are widely used in the photocopying process.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Grey selenium has a structure based on helical chains of atoms and in a crystalline form it is a semiconductor with a band gap of 2.6 eV. The band gap is reduced in amorphous forms to about 1.8 eV. Selenium is laid down to a thickness of 50 m&#x03BC; on an aluminium metal plate by a vapour deposition process and an electrostatic positive charge is induced by a corona discharge on to the plate. In the dark the semiconductor has a poor conductivity and the charge is not dissipated. When light falls on the plate in a fashion which reflects the white and black parts of the paper being photocopied then those areas of selenium exposed to the more intense light become photoconductive. The charge is discharged only perpendicular to the surface and therefore the image is recreated in terms of areas of charged and uncharged selenium particles. The powdered ink adheres to those parts of the plate which have retained an electrostatic charge. The powdered ink is transferred to a fresh piece of paper and the image fixed by heating.</p>

<p class="noindent"  style="margin-top:0.5em"><i>Doped semiconductors</i></p>
<p class="noindent"  style="margin-top:-0.5em">It is noted earlier that pure silicon is a semiconductor. When phosphorus is doped into the silicon lattice the phosphorus atom can occupy some of the tetrahedral sites initially occupied by silicon. The valence band of silicon is full and therefore the additional valence electron of phosphorus must go somewhere. To a first approximation one can say the additional electron just goes into the conduction band, but this is an over-simplification. The phosphorus atom which now has a formal charge of &#x002B;1 exerts a stronger attractive force towards the electron than silicon and therefore this electron is slightly less free than the conduction electrons around silicon and therefore a donor state is created just below the conduction band as illustrated in <a href="#fig_B.21">Fig. B.21(b)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Alternatively an aluminium atom could be introduced into the silicon structure and occupy a tetrahedral site. Since aluminium has one electron
<a id="page_29" class="page">Page 29, Band theory </a>
fewer than silicon a hole in the valence band is created. Again the hole does not occur in the centre of the valence band, but slightly above it because formally the aluminium has been substituted as Al<sup>-</sup>. This acceptor level is illustrated in<a href="#fig_B.21"> Fig. B.21(c)</a>. For narrow band semiconductors such as Si, Ge, GaAs, and PbTe the donor and acceptor levels created in this manner are very close to the edges of the bands and therefore can participate very effectively in conduction processes. In many other semiconductors which have lower dielectric constants the situation is less favourable for conduction.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">The electronic properties of semiconductors are determined by the concentrations of the charge carriers, i.e. the electrons and the holes. In an intrinsic semiconductor the number of holes and electrons is exactly equal, but in extrinsic semiconductors the introduction of impurities leads to an excess of either donor or acceptor sites. n-type semiconductors have extra electrons provided by donor levels and p-type semiconductors have extra holes originating from the acceptor levels.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The <i>p-n</i> junction is fundamental to the working of solid state electronic devices. These junctions are made by diffusing a dopant of one type into a layer of a semiconductor of the other type. Electrons migrate from the <i>n</i> type regions to the <i>p</i> type regions forming a space charge region where there are no carriers. The unbalanced charge of the ionized impurities causes the bands to bend as shown in <a href="#fig_B.22">Fig. B.22 </a>until a point is reached where the Fermi levels are equivalent.</p>

<p class="indent3-ka">The most important property of a  <i>p-n</i> junction is that of rectification, i.e. current is much easier to pass in one direction than the other. The depletion of carriers for the junction effectively forms an insulating barrier. If a positive potential is applied to the <i>n</i> type side the situation known as reverse bias more carriers are removed and the barrier becomes wider. However, under forward bias the <i>n</i> type is made more negative relative to the <i>p</i> side and the energy barrier is decreased and so the carriers may flow through.</p>
<p class="indent3-ka">Electrons passing into  <i>p</i> type semiconductor recombine with holes and the holes vice versa on the other side.</p>
