<p class="fmnoindent">Oxford Chemistry Primers are designed to give a concise introduction to all chemistry students by providing the material that would usually form an 8-10 lecture course. As well as providing up-to-date information, this series expresses the explanations and rationales that form the framework of current understanding of inorganic chemistry.</p>
<p class="fmindent">In his first Primer (OCP28), <i>Essentials of Inorganic Chemistry I</i>, Mike Mingos introduced an alternative style based on a glossary of key terms and concepts within the subject. This book then was a handbook of the basics of this area of chemistry. In 'Essentials 2', he covers some of the more advanced concepts that may be met in the second half of an undergraduate course. The approach again is to give rapid access to these ideas. Mike has himself contributed much to current thinking in the discipline and so is an ideal author for such a book.</p>
