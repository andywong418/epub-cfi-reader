<p class="noindent">Many binary compounds are formed between the Group 1 and 2 elements and Groups 13-15, e.g. Na<sub>3</sub>As, Caln<sub>2</sub>. The Zintl concept utilizes isoelectronic relationships in order to provide some insight into the solid state structures adopted by such compounds. The electronegativity differences between the atoms are sufficiently large in these compounds that, to a first approximation, an ionic formulation is reasonable, e.g. Na<sub>3</sub>As may be written as 3Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>As<sup>3-</sup>. The isoelectronic relationship is then used as a basis for rationalizing the manner in which the Group 13&#x2014;15 elements aggregate in the solid state. For example, NaSi is formulated as Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Si<sup>&#x002D;</sup> and the isoelectronic relationship between Si<sup>&#x002D;</sup> and P suggests that the silicon atoms in NaSi might form Si<sub>4</sub><sup>4-</sup> tetrahedra analogous to the P<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in elemental white phosphorus. This geometry is indeed the one observed in the crystal structure. Using similar reasoning, it could be argued that the phosphorus anions in LiP &#x003D; Li<sup>&#x002B;</sup>P<sup>-</sup> are isoelectronic with S and therefore LiP should have P<sub>8</sub><sup>8-</sup> crowns similar to the S<sub>8</sub> units observed in monoclinic sulfur. Actually, the phosphorus atoms form helical spirals similar to those observed in elemental selenium and tellurium. Therefore, a strict isoelectronic relationship is not observed, but the Zintl concept does suggest possible group structures. A further example is provided by CaSi<sub>2</sub> in which the [Si<sub>n</sub>]<sup>n-</sup> component forms a layer structure resembling that observed in elemental arsenic.</p>

<p class="aside">Many of the anionic species observed in Zintl phases in the solid state are not observed as stable solution species, because their large negative charges make them very nucleophilic and therefore sensitive to the slightest traces of moisture. Their synthesis in the solid state, which involves mixing and heating under dry conditions the appropriate ratios of the elements, is ideal for creating the anhydrous environment necessary for isolating such reactive species</p></aside>

<p class="indent3-ka">In general for M<sub>x</sub>A<sub>y</sub> the total number of electrons in the formula unit may be used to estimate the type of ring or polyhedral molecule found in the structure for the A atoms. If it does not form element-element bonds the total valence electron count is 8, but as the number of electrons is reduced from 8 it can be used as an indicator of the number of A-A bonds which are present in the anionic component. <a href="#table_Z.1">Table Z.l</a> illustrates that when the number of valence electrons per atom is seven, dimeric A&#x2014;A molecules are formed, when it is six, ring compounds are observed, and when it is five, three-connected polyhedral molecules result. Diamond-like lattices are observed for the Ga<sup>-</sup>, In<sup>-</sup>, and Tl<sup>-</sup> anions in the following: NaTl, LiGa, Liln, and BaTl<sub>2</sub> because of the isoelectronic relationships between them and the Group 14 atoms, Ge, Sn, and Pb.</p>
