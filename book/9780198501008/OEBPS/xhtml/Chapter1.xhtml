<p class="noindent">During the 1970&#x2019;s, the mainstays for the treatment of hypertension were diuretics, beta-blockers or a combination of the two. Whilst often effective, these treatments were not without serious side effects such as electrolyte imbalance and lethargy respectively. For some time prior to this period, there had been considerable interest in the role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system (<a href="#fig_1.1">Scheme 1.1</a>) in the control of blood pressure but there had been no real advances for two reasons: (1) It had not been possible to design non-peptide inhibitors of any step of the cascade although peptide analogues of angiotensin-II had been demonstrated to lower blood pressure in hypertensive animals. (2) Many groups had the notion that essential hypertension was mediated through the RA system in only a small proportion of patients and<a id="page_2" class="page">Page 2, Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as effective antihypertensive agents</a>had lost interest. The discovery of captopril <b>1</b>, a landmark in rational drug design, changed all that.</p>

For <b>2, 4, 5 and 6</b>, R &#x003D; H represents the active drug whereas R &#x003D; Et is the prodrug form designed to improve oral bioavailability.

<p class="indent">Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in a cascade of proteolytic reactions which ultimately control the levels of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (&#x0391;-II <a href="#fig_1.1">Scheme 1.1</a>). Starting with angiotensinogen, renin, an aspartyl proteinase synthesised by the kidney but secreted into the plasma, specifically cleaves this protein substrate at the Leu<sup>10</sup>-Val<sup>11</sup> amide bond to produce A-I in the rate limiting step. The resulting decapeptide is further cleaved at Phe<sup>8</sup>-His<sup>9</sup> by ACE acting as a carboxydipeptidase to generate A-II which can elevate blood pressure either directly by activating A-II receptors located on smooth muscle cells in arterioles or indirectly by stimulating the release of aldosterone from the kidney. In turn, aldosterone causes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and water retention thereby increasing blood volume and pressure. Intervention at any point on this cascade should reduce blood pressure in the hypertensive patient. Despite heroic efforts spread over a decade of research, orally active inhibitors of renin proved elusive; in contrast, ACE inhibitors provided an exciting breakthrough<a id="page_3" class="page">Page 3, Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as effective antihypertensive agents</a>in rational drug design In passing, it should be noted that ACE also plays a role in the regulation of levels of the vasodilatory agent, bradykinin; side effects such as cough and angioedema have been attributed to elevated levels of this hormone. Thus, it has been suggested that antagonists of A-II at the receptor level may well have the same efficacy in lowering blood pressure but devoid of these unwanted side effects (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Early clinical trials with captopril were difficult to administer &#x2013; as often happens with the first candidate of a completely novel mechanistic class. Much of the negative points of view focused on the presence of the sulphydryl group in captopril and competitors raced to find an alternative group which could ligand to the active site Zn. The resulting carboxylic acid based inhibitors, enalapril <b>2</b> (R &#x003D; Et; acting as a prodrug form of the active acid, R &#x003D; H), lisonopril <b>3</b>, quinapril <b>4</b>, benazepril <b>5</b> and ramipril <b>6</b>, and the phosphinic acid, fosinopril <b>7</b> (R &#x003D; CH(CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)OCOEt, active form has R &#x003D; H) have also become highly successful products.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">In a pivotal paper demonstrating rational drug design, the active site of ACE was likened to that of carboxypeptidase A (CPA) making due allowance for the fact that the former is a carboxydipeptidase (the enzyme cleaves the peptide substrate two residues from the C-terminus). Noting an observation that D-2-benzylsuccinic acid was a potent inhibitor of CPA, it was postulated to represent a biproduct inhibitor (<a href="#fig_1.3">Scheme 1.3</a>) with the acetic acid entity interacting with the active site Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> atom. Extending the inhibitor by one<a id="page_4" class="page">Page 4, Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as effective antihypertensive agents</a>amino acid residue and taking into account the substrate specificity differences between the two enzymes, the prototypic ACE inhibitor was born. Building on this logic by substituting the carboxylic acid with a thiol group having far greater avidity for Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, led to the discovery of captopril.</p>
<p class="indent">The synthesis of captopril is inherently simple. 3-Acetylthio-2-methylpropionic acid <b>8</b> was coupled with L-proline t-butyl ester (<a href="#fig_1.4">Scheme 1.4</a>) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI). The crude product was taken into TFA and anisole and the resulting acid <b>9</b> purified as the dicyclohexylamine salt. The material that was isolated by crystallisation from acetonitrile afforded the (S,S) diastereomer whilst the (R,S) form could be obtained from the mother liquors. The thiol group was unmasked by treatment of the separated thioacetates with methanolic ammonia being careful to exclude the presence of oxygen to avoid disulphide formation. Notably, the (S,S)-isomer <b>1</b> with a K<sub>i</sub> &#x003D; 1.7 nM was about 100 fold more active than the (R,S) isomer.</p>

<p class="indent">Following literature observations describing the asymmetric synthesis of <i>&#x03B1;</i>-amino acids, a more efficient synthesis of enalapril was devised (<a href="#fig_1.8">Scheme 1.8</a>).

<p class="indent">Because of the functionalised sidechain in lisinopril (4-aminobutyl replaces the &#x2018;alanine&#x2019; methyl of enalapril), a protecting group strategy had to be used for this molecule (<a href="#fig_1.9">Scheme 1.9</a>).

<p class="noindent">Fosinoprilat <b>7</b> (R &#x003D; H) represents an alternative approach to inhibitor design wherein a phosphinic acid moiety replaces the zinc ligand of earlier compounds. When given by the intravenous route (thereby bi-passing the hurdle of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration), the compound was equally as effective as captopril in reducing the pressor (increased blood pressure) response to angiotensin II but with a longer duration of action. The drug was poorly active when given orally however and this problem was alleviated by formation of the phosphinic acid double ester (fosinopril, <b>7</b>, R &#x003D; CH{CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}OCOEt acting as a prodrug of fosinoprilat. This prodrug is only slowly absorbed from the small intestine and is rapidly cleaved to active drug in the plasma.</p>

<p class="indent">4-Ketoproline protected as its benzyloxycarbonyl derivative <b>45</b> was used as the starting material for the C-terminus of the molecule (<a href="#fig_1.13">Scheme 1.13</a>). Addition of phenyl magnesium bromide to <b>45</b> gave the tertiary alcohol which was dehydrated to give <b>46</b> and the double bond hydrogenated exclusively from the side remote from the carboxylic acid to give the cis disubstituted<a id="page_13" class="page">Page 13, Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as effective antihypertensive agents</a>pyrrolidine <b>47</b> as a single enantiomer. The trans isomer <b>48</b> was also prepared from <b>46</b> but using metal &#x2013; ammonia reduction followed by multiple recrystallisation to remove the minor cis isomer. In both cases, reduction of the phenyl ring using platinum catalysed hydrogenation afforded the 4-cyclohexylproline isomers <b>49</b> and <b>50</b> ready for the final coupling reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The second component in the coupling reaction, the substituted phosphinic acid <b>51</b> was available from an Arbuzov reaction on the phosphonous acid ester <b>52</b> (<a href="#fig_1.14">Scheme 1.14</a>). The reaction was carried out in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride and proceeded via the intermediacy of the tervalent phosphonite <b>53.</b> Using carbonyldiimidazole to activate the free carboxylic acid of <b>51</b>, it was possible to prepare <b>54</b> directly without protecting the proline carboxylic acid. The free phosphinic acid <b>7</b> (R &#x003D; H) was released from the ethyl ester by reaction with trimethylsilyl bromide. Surprisingly, it was found that both the cis and trans isomers had similar activity <i>in vivo</i> although it is the (2S,4S)-form which is the marketed product.</p>
<p class="indent">Fosinopril itself was prepared by esterifcation of the phosphinic acid at an early stage (<a href="#fig_1.15">Scheme 1.15</a>) The intermediate <b>55</b>, having two stereogenic centers, consists of two pairs of racemates and these diastereomers were separated by fractional crystallisation from diisopropylether and the resulting racemates resolved using cinchonidine to form the chiral salt. However, the drug is sold as a mixture of isomers in the prodrug form presumably there being little difference in the rate of hydrolysis <i>in vivo</i>.<a id="page_14" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 14, Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as effective antihypertensive agents</a></p>
