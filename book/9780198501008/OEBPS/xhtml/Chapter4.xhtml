<h2 class="h2"><b>4.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Long before the details were known of receptor superfamilies, classification and activation mechanisms, receptors were distinguished by classical pharmacological methods. As an example, histamine was known to stimulate smooth muscle from various organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and the bronchi of the lung and, furthermore, these actions were specifically blocked by the drug mepyramine <b>1</b>. However, there are also other actions of histamine which are mepyramine-insensitive and these include the stimulation of acid secretion in the stomach. To account for such observations, the receptors were assumed to be different and were labeled H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> respectively. Now that the gene (and hence protein) sequences have been to determined, these receptors are known to belong to a large gene superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR&#x2019;s) thus called because agonist occupation (here the agonist is histamine) of the receptor leads to activation of an associated intracellular protein (the &#x2018;G-protein&#x2019;). In this way, an extracellular event (histamine binding to a cell surface receptor) may be transformed into an intracellular signal which forms the basis of the final physiological response &#x2013; release of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> from the parietal cells in the stomach. Since it was known that the excess acid is responsible for the pain associated with peptic ulcers, it was believed that specific H<sub>2</sub> antagonists would both give symptomatic relief to patients and also improve the chances of healing the lesion. These ideas gave rise to the most successful class of drugs to emerge out of research in the 1970&#x2019;s.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_30" class="page">Page 32, Antagonists of histamine receptors as anti-ulcer remedies</a><span class="spacep">&#160;</span>With the hypothesis that antagonists may have some structural similarities to the endogenous ligand, most early studies focussed on making progressive changes to histamine. Although this proved to be a successful strategy, it also generated a dogma that the imidazole ring was crucial for activity and persuaded the original research team that its substitution by other heterocycles such as furan was inappropriate. In doing so, the most commercially successful drug ever launched was missed and handed to the competition. It is also of interest to note that this strategy does not always prove successful &#x2013; note that antagonists for the related H<sub>1</sub> receptor are more structurally diverse (see <b>1</b> and <a href="Chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>) and offer only a distant resemblance to histamine. The prototypic H<sub>2</sub> antagonist, metiamide <b>2</b>, whilst effective in reducing gastric acid secretion in patients, had undesirable side effects possibly associated with the thiourea group. From a systematic search for isoelectronic groups, the cyanoguanidine functionality of cimetidine <b>3</b> was discovered. However, within three years, ranitidine <b>4</b> had emerged as the market leader, at its peak selling over &#x0024;2 billion a year with famotidine <b>5</b> also taking a major slice of the market.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cimetidine was first reported in 1976 and its synthesis started with ethyl ester <b>6</b> (<a href="#fig_4.1">Scheme 4.1</a>) which was originally reduced with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> to give the alcohol<a id="page_33" class="page">Page 33, Antagonists of histamine receptors as anti-ulcer remediess</a><b>7</b>; this procedure is expensive and inconvenient on a large scale. Accordingly, sodium and liquid ammonia with methanol as a proton source became the method of choice. Interestingly, over reduction to give Birch intermediates was not observed although in closely related systems this is indeed a problem. Reaction conditions had to be carefully controlled to minimise formation of the corresponding acid (after workup). It was shown that &#x2018;inverse addition&#x2019; of the ester to sodium in ammonia so that the sodium was always present in high concentration achieved this objective. Acid catalysed displacement
of the primary alcohol with the hydrochloride salt of cysteamine afforded the intermediate primary amine <b>8</b> which reacted under forcing conditions with N-cyano-N&#x2032;-S-dimethylisothiourea <b>9</b>. The cyanoguanidine resulting from an addition-elimination sequence was isolated by chromatography followed by crystallisation from acetonitrile. The isothiourea <b>9</b> was available from methyl isocyanate by reaction first with sodium cyanamide and then methyl iodide. Several alternative methods were used to generate the cyanoguanidine as indicated but the more convergent approach proved most convenient.</p>

<p class="indent">Eventually, an alternative synthon for N-cyanoguanidine was developed to produce a convenient and low cost alternative final step which required diphenylcyanocarbonimidate <b>10</b> (<a href="#fig_4.2">Scheme 4.2</a>; available from cyanamide and dichlorodiphenoxymethane) as the starting material. Two successive displacements which proceed with no gaseous, toxic side products (HSMe), gave cimetidine in high yield.</p>
<p class="indent">During a mechanistic study on the reactivity of 2-(N-cyanoimino)thiazolidine derivatives (e.g. <b>12</b>, <a href="#fig_4.3">Scheme 4.3</a>) towards nucleophiles, an unexpected N to S alkyl transfer reaction occurred that was subsequently utilised in a new synthesis of cimetidine. Thus 4-chloromethyl-5-methylimidazole (as its hydrochloride) was treated with NaH and then with the sodium salt of 2-(N-cyanoimino)thiazolidine <b>11</b> to afford <b>12</b> which was then reacted with methylamine. Of the two electrophilic sites, at C(2) and the nitrile C-atom, reaction occurred exclusively at the former to give <b>13</b>. This material, when exposed to NaH in DMF, rearranged smoothly, possibly by intramolecular alkyl transfer (<b>14</b>), to give cimetidine in high yield.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the shortest route to ranitidine involves a two step sequence starting from the Mannich product, 5-dimethylaminomethylfurfural alcohol (<a href="#fig_4.5">Scheme 4.5</a>). The process was based on the finding that 2-nitroethylenethiazolidine <b>18</b>, when exposed to a primary amine such as methylamine, exists in equilibrium with the addition product <b>19</b> and this may be intercepted with an electrophile such as the chloromethylfuran <b>20</b> thereby driving the reaction to<a id="page_35" class="page">Page 35, Antagonists of histamine receptors as anti-ulcer remediess</a>completion. The intermediate <b>19</b> is unstable, cannot be isolated but, in the presence of air, readily forms the corresponding symmetrical disulphide.</p>

<p class="noindent">A series of functional group modifications characterise the synthesis of famotidine. The aminothiazole <b>21</b> used as the initial building block in the synthetic route (<a href="#fig_4.6">Scheme 4.6</a>) was readily available in one step from thiourea and dichloromethylketone. Whilst one thiourea unit is captured in the aminothiazole ring, the second unit acts as a leaving group in the following reaction &#x2013; incorporation of the propionitrile group to afford <b>22</b>. Next it was necessary to convert the 2-amino group into the guanidine entity of the final drug and this was achieved by reaction first with benzoylisothiocyanate and<a id="page_36" class="page">Page 36, Antagonists of histamine receptors as anti-ulcer remedies</a>the benzoyl group removed by mild base hydrolysis. The newly formed thiourea <b>23</b> was activated by methylation and converted into the guanidine <b>24</b> by reaction with ammonia under pressure. To complete the synthesis, the nitrile function was transformed into the corresponding imino ether and this intermediate treated with sulphamide.</p>
