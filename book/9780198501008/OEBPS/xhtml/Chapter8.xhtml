<section epub:type="chapter" id="sec_8.1">
<h2 class="h2"><b>8.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Histamine is released in a variety of allergic conditions such as seasonal rhinitis (&#x2018;hay fever&#x2019;), urticaria (rash), pruritis and insect stings as well as a reaction to certain drugs such as penicillin and aspirin. The reaction is the result of an inappropriate antibody response: IgE binds to the surface of mast cells which are widely distributed throughout the body after the first exposure to the antigen. After renewed exposure, degranulation of the mast cells causes release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators with histamine being the one of the first &#x2018;on the scene&#x2019;. If the release is localised, then the symptoms associated with allergy become apparent; more general mediator release may cause anaphylactic shock which requires emergency treatment. It turns out that histamine mediates its activity by interaction at H<sub>1</sub> receptors which are GPCR&#x2019;s closely related to, but clearly distinct from, the H<sub>2</sub> receptors at which anti-ulcer drugs bind (see <a href="Chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). Agents which selectively block these receptors are therefore of benefit in histamine-related allergic responses.</p>
<p class="indent">First generation H<sub>1</sub> blockers, which appeared in clinical practice during the 1940&#x2019;s, suffered from two major drawbacks. First they were highly lipid soluble (log P &#x003E; 2) and were able to readily penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB), and their interaction with central H<sub>1</sub> receptors invariably led to side effects such as sedation and psychomotor impairment. In addition, the agents tended to be non-selective for H<sub>1</sub> receptors at the doses given and exhibited anticholinergic (muscarinic) and anti-adrenergic activities adding to the side effect profile. The search for more potent, H<sub>1</sub>-selective and hydrophilic (to prevent transport across the BBB) agents eventually led to terfenadine <b>1</b> (and, more recently, its metabolite fexofenadine <b>2</b>), loratidine <b>3</b>, cetirizine <b>4</b> and astemizole <b>5</b> which are now the most prescribed drugs for seasonal rhinitis.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>8.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Terfenadine and Fexofenadine</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Terfenadine was one of the first second generation H<sub>1</sub> blockers that was free from anticholinergic and CNS-related side effects and was marketed as the racemate. The compound undergoes almost complete first pass metabolism<a id="page_62" class="page">Page 62, Another histamine receptor: blockers of the histamine-1 receptor for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis</a>(99%) to the pharmacologically active acid <b>2</b> (fexofenadine; formally, terfenadine is a pro-drug of fexofenadine) and the inactive N-dealkylated piperidine <b>6</b> by the action of hepatic cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> enzymes. Under certain circumstances, such as hepatic impairment or when co-administered with other drugs which compete for the oxidative metabolism machinery (macrolide antibiotics, antifungal agents), significant concentrations of unchanged terfenadine appear in the plasma. This has been implicated with serious cardiac adverse events resulting in the withdrawal of the compound from the market place during 1998. Fortunately, fexofenadine itself is rapidly absorbed when given orally, does not build up in hepatically impaired patients and is devoid of the cardiac complications associated with terfenadine.</p>

<p class="indent">Resolution of the fexofenadine ethyl ester as its (&#x002B;)-di-para-toluoyltartaric acid salt allowed the absolute stereochemistry of the (&#x2013;)form to be assigned as (S). This enantiomer could be prepared by an asymmetric synthesis wherein the prochiral ketone <b>15</b> (<a href="#fig_8.4">Scheme 8.4</a>) was reduced with diborane in the presence of the oxazaborolidine catalyst <b>16</b>. Thus, the acid chloride <b>17</b> was prepared from the corresponding toluene <b>18</b> by permanganate oxidation followed by exposure to oxalyl chloride and this reacted smoothly in a Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> catalysed Grignard reaction to afford the ketone <b>15</b>. Asymmetric reduction of the ketone gave the (S)-alcohol <b>19</b> which was deprotected under mild acid conditions. The hydrolysis step proceeded with concomitant ring closure to the lactol <b>20</b> without epimerisation of the stereogenic center as assessed by chiral HPLC (96% ee) and by specific rotation of the ester <b>21</b> of the final product. Reductive alkyation of azacyclonol with the lactol followed by saponification of the ethyl ester gave (<b>S</b>)<b>-2</b>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Azatadine (des-chloro-<b>22</b>, <a href="#fig_8.4">Scheme 8.4</a>) is a potent antihistamine but is able to penetrate the BBB and hence has sedative activity quite like the first generation compounds. Using variously substituted derivatives of <b>22</b> as starting points to discover new compounds devoid of the central action, it was discovered that the ethylcarbamate, loratadine <b>3</b>, had this property whilst retaining potent H<sub>1</sub> blocking activity. Interestingly, however, the compound is<a id="page_65" class="page">Page 65, Another histamine receptor: blockers of the histamine-1 receptor for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis</a>rapidly metabolised to the secondary amine by hydrolysis and decarboxylation by P<sub>450</sub> enzymes in the liver.

<p class="indent">The original route to loratidine involved demethylation and carbamoylation of <b>22</b> which had first been prepared as part of structure activity studies of azatadine. Thus it followed closely the synthesis of azatadine but suffered from the reactivity (towards reduction) and asymmetry (during the cyclisation step) imposed by the chloro group (<a href="#fig_8.4">Scheme 8.4</a>). A Wadsworth-Emmons reaction with diethyl 3-chlororbenzylphosphonate on pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde gave the <i>trans</i>-stilbazole <b>23</b> which was hydrogenated and converted to the N-oxide <b>24</b>. O-Methylation of the N-oxide with dimethylsulphate followed by displacement with cyanide gave the 2-cyanopyridine <b>25</b> in admixture with the 6-cyano isomer which had to be removed by careful fractional distillation. Hydrolysis to the acid and activation of <b>26</b> as the acid chloride gave the intermediate necessary for the Friedel Craft&#x2019;s cyclisation reaction and this proceeded to yield a mixture of isomers (4:1 in favour of the 8-chloro isomer) from which desired material <b>27</b> was isolated by crystallisation. The ketone was reacted with the Grignard reagent from 1-methyl-4-chloropiperidine and the resulting benzylic alcohol eliminated under acidic conditions to form <b>22</b>.<a id="page_66" class="page">Page 66, Another histamine receptor</a>Using ethyl chloroformate, the basic nitrogen of <b>22</b> was quaternised and demethylated in situ to yield loratidine.</p>

<p class="indent">To overcome the problems described above, an alternative procedure started with 2-cyano-3-methylpyridine <b>28</b> (<a href="#fig_8.5">Scheme 8.5</a>) which was converted by a Ritter reaction to the corresponding amide <b>29</b> with t-BuOH and acid.

Cyclodehydration was most conveniently performed by superacid catalysis, the preferred reagent being HF/BF<sub>3</sub>, and the overall process was suitable for multi-kilogram scale synthesis.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cetirizine was first prepared and is sold as the racemic mixture (<a href="#fig_8.6">Scheme 8.6</a>). The asymmetric diphenylmethane <b>32</b> can be made by several methods, most conveniently by alkylation of piperazine with 4-chlorobenzhydryl chloride <b>33</b> and Chromatographic purification of the mixture of products. This intermediate was alkylated at the remaining secondary amine with methyl 2-chloroethoxyacetate and the resulting methyl ester hydrolysed under basic conditions to yield cetirizine.</p>
<p class="indent">Separation of the enantiomers of cetirizine by classical resolution of the tartrate salts was low yielding and afforded poor enrichment. However, it had<a id="page_67" class="page">Page 67, Top drugs, top synthetic routes</a>been established that the diarylmethylamine <b>34</b> (<a href="#fig_8.7">Scheme 8.7</a>) could be resolved efficiently by such methods and this was used as the key intermediate in synthesis of (&#x002B;)- and (&#x2013;)-cetirizine on the kilogram scale. Starting from the benzophenone <b>35</b>, reaction with ammonium formate gave the N-formyl derivative <b>36</b> which was hydrolysed with aqueous acid to the arnine. Resolution with either (&#x002B;)- or (&#x2013;)- tartaric acid followed by basification of the separated salts afforded both (&#x002B;)- and (&#x2013;)-amines. After considerable experimentation, it was found that the N-tosyl bis-alkylating agent <b>37</b> in reaction with (&#x2013;)-34 gave the desired piperazine (&#x2013;)-<b>38</b> after deprotection under strongly acidic conditions optimised to avoid epimerisation (&#x003E; 99% ee by chiral HPLC on a kilogram scale). Most conveniently, it was discovered that the reductive removal of the tosyl group was best achieved with HBr in the presence of a phenol such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid which could be easily removed during workup. N-alkylation of the secondary arnine under Finklestein conditions gave (&#x2013;)-<b>39</b>, which, after hydrolysis of the primary amide, afforded the dextrorotatory isomer of the desired acid <b>4</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">The first enantioselective synthesis combined two key observations: (a) &#x03C0;-Cr(CO)3 complexation of one aryl ring in a benzophenone produces &#x2018;electronic dissymmetry&#x2019; and (b) chiral oxazaborolidine reduction of such complexes may be performed enantioselectively. Metalation of benzene chromium tricarbonyl followed by acylation with 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride gave the benzophenone <b>40</b>. This was reduced by catecholborane catalysed by the chiral oxaborolidine reagent wherein the complex formed (<b>41</b>) has the oxaborolidine B-atom complexed to the ketone oxygen adjacent to the less bulky ketone substituent &#x2013; in this case the chlorophenyl moiety. The oxaborolidine was destroyed using tetrafluoroboric acid and the resulting secondary alcohol <b>42</b> reacted with the mono-substituted piperazine <b>43</b> with complete retention of configuration at the benzylic center. In this context, the chromium complex preformed its second role, that is to serve as a &#x2018;stereocontroller&#x2019; during the displacement.
