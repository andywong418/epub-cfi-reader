<h2 class="h2"><b>2.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become first line therapy for the control of high blood pressure and are also important in the treatment of chronic heart failure. ACE, however, is a non-specific protease and includes bradykinin, substance P and enkephalins as additional substrates. The cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy in 5&#x2013;10% of patients has been attributed to bradykinin potentiation; other points for intervention in the renin-angiotensin cascade might overcome this and other side effects. Inhibition of renin, the rate limiting enzyme in the RA cascade, has proved to be one of the most ill-fated drug discovery targets for medicinal chemists because, despite hundreds of man years of synthetic effort, there are no orally effective renin inhibitors on the market. Indeed, the success of tackling proteases as therapeutic targets is, in general, disheartening. Although many highly potent protease inhibitors are known, few have been successful in overcoming the later hurdles in the drug discovery process such as oral bioavailability, duration of action and toxicity. The most notable exception is HIV protease (Chapter 11).</p>
<p class="indent">Although many peptide-based antagonists of angiotensin-II receptors (the AT<sub>1</sub> sub-type predominates in vascular tissue) had been long known, it was not until 1982 that the first, albeit weakly active and non-selective, non-peptide inhibitors (e.g. <b>1</b>) were discovered following the chance observation of cardiovascular properties in molecules originally made as anti-inflammatory agents. This finding taken together with speculations on the active conformation of angiotensin-II (A-II) from molecular modeling eventually led to the synthesis of losartan (<b>2</b>, <a href="#fig_2.1">Scheme 2.1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Losartan is as effective as enalapril in reducing blood pressure in mildly hypertensive patients. Interestingly, it has a longer duration of action than that anticipated from plasma levels of drugs suggesting an active metabolite. It is likely that the acid derived from liver induced oxidative metabolism of the<a id="page_17" class="page">Page 17, Blockade of angiotensin-II receptors</a>parent primary alcohol dominates the therapeutic effects of losartan. Although there are numerous &#x2018;second generation&#x2019; compounds progressing through clinical evaluation, only valsartan is approved to challenge the dominance of losartan.</p>

<p class="noindent">Two key components were required for the convergent route leading to losartan (<a href="#fig_2.1">Scheme 2.1</a>) &#x2013; the preformed imidazole <b>3</b> and a substituted biphenyl derivative <b>4</b>. Valeroamidine hydrochloride was condensed with dihydroxyacetone in liquid ammonia to afford the hydroxymethylimidazole which was chlorinated to give <b>3</b>. The 4<sup>&#x2032;</sup>-bromomethyl-biphenyl <b>4</b> was prepared by the Ullmann biaryl synthesis followed by NBS bromination and this was used to alkylate the foregoing imidazole. The desired 4-chloro-5-hydroxymethylimidazole <b>5</b> was isolated as the major isomer after chromatography. The unwanted regioisomer <b>6</b> was removed by chromatography on silica since it moved significantly slower possibly because the OH group is free to interact<a id="page_18" class="page">Page 18, Blockade of angiotensin-II receptors</a>with the silica whereas that of the major isomer is somewhat shielded by the adjacent functionality. Absolute confirmation of structure was achieved by X-ray crystallography of <b>2</b> and related compounds within the same series.</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly, there are two major limitations to the route that preclude its use on the large scale: the N-alkylation step yielding variable amounts of the undesired regioisomer (often as high as 1:1) and the inefficient, albeit direct, conversion of the nitrile intermediate into the tetrazole. Direct transformation furnished a complex mixture of products after a 9 day reaction from which the tetrazole could be isolated in 32% yield. The latter problem was solved by utilising trimethyltin azide (<a href="#fig_2.2">Scheme 2.2</a>) followed by removal of the trimethyltin group with sodium hydroxide. The product was most conveniently isolated as the triphenylmethyl derivative from which the free tetrazole was released after acid treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">As an alternative to the Ullmann procedure, oxazoline directed alkyation (<a href="#fig_2.3">Scheme 2.3</a>) also allowed access to the biphenyl intermediate.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, to address the regioisomer issue, the intermediacy of the imidazole aldehyde <b>7</b> in the alkylation step was studied since earlier work had suggested that the 5-carboxaldehyde should predominate. Thus, eerie ammonium nitrate oxidation of the alcohol (<b>3</b>, Scheme 2.4) afforded the aldehyde which was<a id="page_19" class="page">Page 19, Blockade of angiotensin-II receptors</a>reacted with the preformed protected tetrazole <b>8</b> to give a 9:1 ratio of the desired N-alkylated product together with its regioisomer. Borohydride reduction and removal of the protecting group completed the synthesis.</p>

<p class="noindent">Valsartan <b>9</b> (<a href="#fig_2.5">Scheme 2.5</a>) was first approved in 1996 and, unlike losartan, it is not a prodrug with the major metabolite, 4-hydroxyvaleryl valsartan, having<a id="page_20" class="page">Page 20, Blockade of angiotensin-II receptors</a>only one tenth of the activity of the parent. Starting with the known bromomethylbiphenyl <b>10</b>, hydrolysis to the primary alcohol via the acetate and Swern oxidation afforded the aldehyde <b>11</b>. This material was reductively aminated with L-valine methyl ester and the resulting secondary amine <b>12</b> was acylated with valeric acid chloride. As we have seen above (Scheme 2), the nitrile was converted into the tetrazole <b>9</b> using tributyltin azide under forcing conditions. The tetrazole moiety, having a pKa approximating to that of a carboxylic acid, is seen as an effective bioisotere of that group with advantages in pharmacokinetic properties.</p>
