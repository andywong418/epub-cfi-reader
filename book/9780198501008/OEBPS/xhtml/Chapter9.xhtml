<h2 class="h2"><b>9.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">HIV is the causative agent of AIDS, which is defined as the development of certain opportunistic infections, cancers and encephalopathy and is associated with a catastrophic depletion of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> lymphocytes. It is not yet understood how HIV causes AIDS and the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the HIV disease are complex. Upon infection of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells, the reverse transcribed RNA genome of HIV is integrated into the host genome. As the genome is integrated and HIV disease is chronic, and since there are no strategies for the excision of viral genomes from the host DNA, it is probable that treatment of HIV infected individuals by anti-viral agents will be lifelong.</p>
<p class="indent">Like other retroviruses, HIV carries its genetic information as (&#x002B;)-strand RNA, two copies of which are contained within the virion protein core along with virally encoded enzymes responsible for transcribing the genetic information into DNA once inside the host cell. Pivotal in the whole replicative process is the role of the HIV enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT). This enzyme is multifunctional having both RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities as well as an inherent RNase H activity. Following formation of the (&#x2013;)-DNA strand, it is the RNase H activity that is necessary to degrade the original viral RNA of the newly formed RNA-DNA heteroduplex so that the double stranded DNA can be prepared ready for integration into the host cell DNA. Nucleoside analogues which are active inhibitors of HIV replication act, after phosphorylation by host cell kinases to their respective 5&#x2032;-triphosphates, as competitive inhibitors and/or chain terminators of HIV-RT. Typically, chain terminators are devoid of the crucial 3&#x2032;-OH group necessary for continued chain extension.</p>
<p class="indent">The first drug shown to have widespread utility in the management of AIDS was zidovudine (<b>1</b>; AZT). The compound had been prepared in 1964 as a potential anti-cancer agent but was shown to be ineffective and was subsequently re-screened as an antiviral as the AIDS epidemic hit Western society during the mid-1980&#x2019;s. It is still the central component in the multitude of combination therapies now approved or still being evaluated clinically. As HIV is highly variable &#x2013; it is an RNA virus with no proofreading function on the RT &#x2013; it is inevitable that drug resistant strains will emerge over long term treatment and hence there is a requirement for a succession of new compounds<a id="page_72" class="page">Page 72, Nucleoside anaologues which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase as anti-AIDS drugs</a>to be developed. One such compound that has been found to be of immense value in combination with AZT is lamivudine ((&#x2013;)<i>-cis</i>-<b>2</b><i>;</i> 3-TC).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Zidovudine (AZT)</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Interestingly, AZT was first prepared not as a biologically active molecule but as an intermediate towards 3&#x2032;-amino nucleotides (i.e. as the monophosphate) in turn projected to act as active site directed inhibitors of nuclear exoribonuclease of unspecified therapeutic utility. The primary alcohol of (2&#x2032;-deoxy-lyxofuranosyl)thymine <b>3</b> (<a href="#fig_9.1">Scheme 9.1</a>) was selectively protected with trityl chloride and the remaining secondary alcohol activated for nucleophilic displacement as the mesyl derivative <b>4</b>. Treatment of <b>4</b> with lithium azide led to <b>5</b> by inversion of configuration which deprotected smoothly under acidic conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">In a second approach (<a href="#fig_9.2">Scheme 9.2</a>), thymidine <b>6</b> acted as the starting material which was again protected as the trityl derivative on the 5-OH and then mesylated to give <b>7</b>, the epimer of the intermediate <b>4</b> described above. In the presence of potassium phthalimide, elimination of sulphonic acid took place to generate the key intermediate anhydro sugar <b>8</b>. Ring opening with sodium azide followed by deprotection gave <b>1</b>. Subsequently it was found that the unprotected anhydro sugar <b>9</b> was available directly from thymidine by displacement of the 3&#x2032;-OH in the presence of chloropentafluorotriethylamine.</p>

<p class="indent">Alternative approaches were investigated to avoid the use of the expensive thymidine starting material; D-mannitol is a readily available alternative which can be converted into the D-glyceraldehyde derivative <b>10</b> (<a href="#fig_9.3">Scheme 9.3</a>) in two steps. A stabilised Wittig reaction introduced the two remaining C-atoms of the developing ribose ring with <b>11</b> being produced as an 8:1 mixture with the<a id="page_73" class="page">Page 73, Nucleoside anaologues which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase as anti-AIDS drugs</a>E-isomer which was removed chromatographically. Acid treatment of <b>11</b> gave the lactone <b>12</b> and this, in protected form, underwent a Michael addition with azide with no sign of the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-adduct since this face is shielded by the bulky 5&#x2032;-protecting group. Reduction at low temperature to the lactol and activation of the anomeric hydroxyl group as the acetoxy derivative <b>13</b> gave the sugar intermediate required for condensation with silylated thymine under Vorbruggen conditions. This reaction proceeded with no stereochemical control giving a 1:1 mixture of <i>&#x03B1;-</i> and <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomers <b>14</b> which could only be separated cleanly after removal of the silyl protecting group in the final product <b>1</b>.</p>

<p class="indent">Although somewhat lengthy, another method based on an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation proved successful. Crotonaldehyde was converted into a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-trimethylsilyloxybutadiene (<a href="#fig_9.4">Scheme 9.4</a>) and treated with orthoformate in the presence of a Lewis acid to give the enal <b>15</b>. Reduction with DIBAL gave <b>16</b> as a 95:5 mixture of (E)- and (Z)-geometric isomers which was subjected to the asymmetric epoxidation conditions of Sharpless. The resulting epoxy alcohol <b>17</b> was opened with azide in the presence of diethylaluminium fluoride to give the (2S,3S) azide <b>18</b>. Acid catalysed ring closure in dilute solution to suppress hexose ring formation gave predominantly the desired furanose <b>19</b> which could be purified chromatographically. After protection of the 5&#x2032;-OH to give <b>20</b>, and using again Vorbruggen conditions, the anomeric methoxy group was displaced by silylated thymine. From the mixture of anomers so obtained, the desired <i>&#x03B2;-</i>anomer <b>1</b>was isolated by flash chromatography.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>9.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Lamivudine (3-TC)</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">BCH-189, the <i>cis</i>-racemate from which 3TC ((&#x2013;)<i>-cis</i>-<b>2</b>) is derived, was first reported in the summer of 1989; it is the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer with ds-stereochemistry around the oxathiolane ring which displays antiviral activity <i>in vitro</i> comparable to AZT. Early approaches to the synthesis of BCH-189 utilised the intermediacy of oxathiolane <b>17</b> obtained as a 1:1 mixture of anomers from reaction of benzoyloxyacetaldehyde <b>15</b> with mercapto-acetaldehyde <b>16</b> (<a href="#fig_9.5">Scheme 9.5</a>). Cytosine, the base required for the coupling reaction was silylated with hexamethyldisilane, and the disilylated material <b>18</b> reacted under Lewis acid catalysis (TMS-triflate) to afford a 1:1 mixture of the <i>cis-</i>and <i>trans</i>-oxathiolane <b>2</b> but only under forcing conditions and with low yield<a id="page_75" class="page">Page 75, Nucleoside anaologues which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase as anti-AIDS drugs</a>(30%).

<p class="indent">To correct two of the deficiencies of the original route, both the leaving group and the Lewis acid used in the coupling reaction were investigated. The yield of the coupling reaction was improved significantly by replacing the leaving group ethoxy with acetoxy (<a href="#fig_9.6">Scheme 9.6</a>). Once it was realised that<a id="page_76" class="page">Page 76, Nucleoside anaologues which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase as anti-AIDS drugs</a>antiviral activity resided in the <i>cis</i>-racemate, various alternative coupling reactions other than the standard Vorbruggen conditions were studied to optimise the proportion of <i>cis</i> being formed. It was shown that the use of SnCl<sub>4</sub>. in place of trimethylsilyltriflate afforded almost exclusively the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer (&#x003E; 300:1 by HPLC and X-ray crystallography on the deprotected nucleoside) possibly by complex formation between the oxathiolane ring and SnCl<sub>4</sub> from the less hindered lower face forcing the incoming silylated base to approach from above <b>20</b>. Thus, allyl alcohol was protected and ozonised to give, after a reductive work up, the aldehyde <b>21</b>. This was condensed with mercaptoacetic acid, the resulting lactone <b>22</b> reduced and the product acetylated to afford <b>23</b> ready for N-glycosylation of silylated cytosine.</p>
<p class="indent">Resolution of BCH-189, first in milligram amounts by preparative HPLC and subsequently in gram quantities by enzymatic methods, showed unexpectedly that both <i>cis</i>-enantiomers had potent antiviral activity. The first enzymatic process (<a href="#fig_9.7">Scheme 9.7</a>) relied upon recognition of the &#x2018;natural&#x2019; enantiomer of BCH189 monophosphate by the 5&#x2032;-nucleotidase from <i>Crotalus atrox</i> venom leaving the &#x2018;unnatural&#x2019; enantiomer as the unchanged monophosphate. Facile separation of these two products and subsequent dephosphorylation using bacterial alkaline phosphatase of promiscuous specificity afforded the separated isomers. Once it was appreciated that the &#x2018;unnatural&#x2019; isomer was the one of real interest, a more direct method using cytidine deaminase (Scheme 4b) from <i>E. coli</i> to degrade the natural isomer to the uridine analogue was employed. Again, ready separation of the resulting mixture afforded (&#x2013;)-BCH-189, 3-TC in greater than 98% ee. Cloning and overexpression of the enzyme under the control of a high level inducible promotor and immobilisation of the enzyme on Eupergit-C to allow it&#x2019;s reuse over many cycles has generated a multikilogram synthesis of essentially enantiomerically pure 3-TC.</p>

<p class="indent">The first enantioselective synthesis of relied upon the preparation of homochiral oxathiolane intermediates which may be coupled to the cytosine base under conditions which preserve stereochemical integrity. From the available chiral pool, (&#x002B;)-thiolactic acid <b>24</b> (<a href="#fig_9.8">Scheme 9.8</a>) was condensed with 2-benzoyloxyacetaldehyde to give a 1:2 mixture of diastereomeric oxathiolane acids <b>25a</b> and <b>25b.</b> Separation and oxidative decarboxylation of <b>25b</b> afforded an anomeric mixture of <i>anti</i> and <i>syn</i> acetates which were coupled with silylated cytosine in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane to give a 1.3:1 mixture of <b>26a</b> and <b>26b.</b> Chromatographic separation of the diastereomers and deprotection yielded 3-TC. The overall efficiency of this process is, however, limited by failure to control the stereochemistry of the base coupling reaction. Coupling in the presence of SnCl<sub>4</sub>, which had previously been shown to offer such control, gave a racemic product possibly because opening and closing of the oxathiolane ring was rapid under these conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, other groups investigated synthetic methods which take advantage of stereochemistry built into carbohydrates. Given that it had been anticipated that antiviral activity would reside in the &#x2018;natural&#x2019; isomer, the (&#x002B;)-enantiomer of 3-TC had already been made by a multistep process from the cheap and readily available D-mannose; L-mannose is too expensive to provide a practical approach to the (&#x2013;)-enantiomer. Instead, L-gulose <b>27</b>, prepared in two steps from L-ascorbic acid (<a href="#fig_9.9">Scheme 9.9</a>), was tosylated on the primary alcohol and then per-acetylated to give <b>28</b>. Displacement of the anomeric acetoxy group by bromine gave <b>29</b> which was reacted with potassium O-ethylxanthate to generate, after deprotection, the thioanhydro-L-gulose <b>30</b>. Next the <i>cis</i>-diol group was reductively cleaved with periodate<a id="page_78" class="page">Page 78, Nucleoside anaologues which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase as anti-AIDS drugs</a>followed by borohydride and the resulting diol <b>31</b> immediately protected as the isopropylidine ketal. The remaining alcohol in <b>32</b> was protected as the silyl ether and the ketal group removed by acidic hydrolysis. Another diol cleavage sequence, this time using Pb(OAc)4, was necessary and the intermediate aldehyde oxidised with pyridinium dichromate without S-oxidation. Oxidative decarboxylation of the acid <b>33</b> provided the key intermediate <b>34</b>, chirally intact at the 2-position, and this was condensed with O-TMS, N-Ac-cytosine which could be taken on to 3-TC as described above. Once again, only limited regio-control was witnessed in the condensation reaction with the desired <i>&#x03B2;</i>-anomer being favoured by a 2:1 ratio.</p>
