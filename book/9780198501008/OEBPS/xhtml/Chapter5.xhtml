<h2 class="h2"><b>5.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Gastric acid has long been identified as a major factor which contributes to peptic ulcer disease and its secretion is stimulated by at least three distinct mechanisms: histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin. Pharmacological inhibition of all three agents has proven effective in reducing acid secretion although inhibition of histamine acting at H<sub>2</sub> receptors has gained more widespread therapeutic acceptance (see <a href="Chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>). In 1977, however, a new class of antisecretory agent was discovered which suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production and thus curbs acid production by all stimulatory mechanisms. Recent clinical experience has indicated that this class of drug, when used in combination with clarithromycin, is an effective treatment of <i>Helicobacterium pylori</i> infections which often accompany duodenal ulcers. <i>H. pylori</i> eradication has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence of duodenal ulcers.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>5.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>The &#x2018;Omeprazole cycle&#x2019;</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Omeprazole, <b>1</b>, was the first proton pump inhibitor to be approved (in 1988) but its mechanism of action is not entirely straightforward and is dependent on a subtle balance of chemical reactivity, controlled by the nature of substituents in the pyridine ring, and enzymatic transformation under the physiological conditions prevailing in the gut and liver. In attempts to improve the potency of the initial lead sulphoxide, <b>2</b>, it was found that electron withdrawing substituents in the pyridine ring which increase the pKa of the pyridine nitrogen also increased activity. Thus methyl in the 3- and/or 5-position and a methoxy group in the 4-position strongly raised the basicity of the pyridine ring although, paradoxically, the substitution pattern of omeprazole acts to force the methoxy group out of the the plane of the ring thereby markedly reducing that substituent&#x2019;s effect.</p>

<p class="noindent">Whilst there have been several hypotheses to explain the mechanism by which omeprazole exerts its action, convincing experimental evidence has confirmed the &#x2018;omeprazole cycle&#x2019; (<a href="#fig_5.1">Scheme 5.1</a>). At the physiological pH of blood (7.4) and within the cytosol of the parietal cell, omeprazole (pKa &#x003D; 4) exists as the neutral species but becomes protonated in the highly acidic environment within the sceretory cannaliculus and becomes trapped there. It is here that the molecule undergoes acid-catalysed transformation (<a href="#fig_5.1">Scheme 5.1</a>) whereby nucleophilic attack of the pyridine-N followed by reversible ring opening to the sulphenic acid <b>3</b> and subsequent dehydration affords the pyridinium suphenamide <b>4</b>. This reactive intermediate may then be intercepted by a sulphydryl group at the active site of the ATPase &#x2013; a process which may be blocked by mercaptoethanol &#x2013; resulting in deactivation of the enzyme over an extended period of time. Note that this intermediate exists as a regioisomeric mixture but that distinction is lost again upon ring opening. Slow reactivation<a id="page_39" class="page">Page 39, Proton pump inhibitors as gastric acid secretion inhibitors</a><i>in vivo</i> may result from disulphide exchange with endogenous mercaptans (such as cysteine and glutathione) and the released product <b>5</b> reconverted into the parent omeprazole by oxidative enzymes in the liver.</p>

<p class="noindent">The process by which omprazole is made remains sketchy since it has not be fully detailed in the scientific literature. 3,5-Dimethylpyridine was first methylated with methyl lithium and then oxidised to the N-oxide <b>6</b> (<a href="#fig_5.2">Scheme 5.2</a>) to facilitate the nitration step and remote functionalisation of the pyridine 2-methyl group. Although apparently circuitous, activation of the pyridine ring by nitration followed by displacement of the nitro group by methoxide proceeded smoothly. Functionalisation of the 2-methyl group was achieved by acetylation of the N-oxide <b>7</b> with acetic anhydride with subsequent rearrangement of the acetoxy group to give <b>8</b>. This material was hydrolysed and the resulting hydroxymethyl group activated by chlorination.<a id="page_40" class="page">Page 40, Proton pump inhibitors as gastric acid secretion inhibitors</a>2-Thio-5-methoxybenzimidazole <b>9</b> (from the corresponding phenylenediamine) was reacted with the chloromethyl intermediate in the presence of sodium hydroxide to afford <b>10</b> which was oxidised under mild conditions with mcpba with careful control of pH by judicious titration of KHCO<sub>3</sub> to maintain a pH of 8.6.</p>

<p class="indent">Omeprazole is a racemic mixture having a stereogenic center at the sulphoxide S atom. Surprisingly, given the acidic nature of the adjacent methylene group, it was found that the two enantiomers are stable towards epimerisation under neutral and basic conditions making it possible to prepare and isolate sodium and magnesium salts of the separated isomers and study their properties <i>in vivo</i>. Separation of the racemic mixture involved reaction of 1-chloromethyl derivative <b>11</b> of omeprazole with either (R)- or (S)-mandelic acid <b>12</b> (<a href="#fig_5.3">Scheme 5.3</a>) to give <b>13</b>. In either case, it proved convenient to isolate the (pure) more hydrophilic isomer after reverse phase HPLC so that (R)-mandelic acid eventually yielded (&#x2013;)-omeprazole whilst (S)-mandelic acid gave the (&#x002B;)-isomer. Thus solvolysis of each separated diastereomer with sodium hydroxide and neutralisation with methylformate gave (&#x2013;)- and (&#x002B;)-omeprazole which were isolated as the sodium salts each having an<a id="page_41" class="page">Page 41, Proton pump inhibitors as gastric acid secretion inhibitors</a>enantiomeric excess (ee) greater than 99.8% but with opposite specific rotation.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to avoid the intermediacy of pyridine-N-oxides, long recognised as toxic, a completely different approach used the pyrone <b>13</b> (<a href="#fig_5.4">Scheme 5.4</a>) as the key intermediate. It was envisaged that the ring O atom of this compound would be the precursor of the pyridine N and that the primary alcohol, once activated, would allow incorporation of the benzimidazole moiety. Starting from 2-methyl-l-penten-3-one <b>14</b>, addition &#x2013; elimination with pyrrolidine in the presence of acid afforded <b>15</b>. This material was treated first with oxalyl chloride to effect the cyclisation and then with methanol to convert the acid chloride to the methyl ester <b>16</b>. Reduction of the ester to the alcohol <b>13</b> set up the pyrone ready for conversion to the pyridone system by aminolysis with ammonia. Aromatisation by treatment of <b>17</b> with POCl<sub>3</sub> gave the pyridine <b>18</b> which reacted with 5-methoxy-mercaptobenzimidaole to yield the coupled product <b>19</b> from which omeprazole was accessible in two steps &#x2013; displacement with methoxide (generated from methanol and KOH in DMSO) followed by S-oxidation as above.</p>

<p class="noindent">Lansoproazole <b>20</b>, a close analogue of omeprazole, has found clinical success without any clear cut benefit over the latter. Its synthesis follows closely that of <b>1</b> but these details are much clearer (<a href="#fig_5.4">Scheme 5.4</a>). Nucleophilic substitution by trifluoroethoxide on the nitropyridine-N-oxide <b>21</b> gave <b>22</b> which was then activated at the 2-position by acetylation of the N-oxide followed by rearrangement. Elaboration of this intermediate proceeded uneventfully to yield lansoprazole as a racemic mixture.</p>
