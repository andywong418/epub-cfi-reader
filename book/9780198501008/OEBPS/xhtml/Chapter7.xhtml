<p class="noindent">The discovery of ligands acting at benzodiazepine receptors is one of many stories where a succession of serendipitous events led to the final breakthrough. The first was the decision to explore novel chemical structures away from the barbiturates and urethanes that represented the standard drugs used at the time, albeit acting by a mechanism then unknown. In a campaign to prepare new benzoheptoxadiazines (e.g. <b>1</b>, <a href="#fig_7.1">Scheme 7.1</a>) based on earlier chemistry that was subsequently shown to be incorrect, chlordiazepoxide <b>2</b><a id="page_53" class="page">Page 53, Hypnotic, anxiolytic anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant agents acting at the benzodiazepine receptor</a>was produced which had remarkable activity in animal models predictive of anxiolytic behaviour and was introduced in 1960. The benzoheptoxadiazine structure was shown to be a quinazoline N-oxide <b>3</b> and this, when reacted with a primary amine, underwent nucleophilic attack at the C-2 center followed by ring expansion to afford the active drug <b>2</b>. By 1963, diazepam was also available followed, over the next decade, by well over 20 other benzodiazepines all finding a role based on their level of efficacy (see below), metabolic fate and duration of action.</p>
<p class="indent">It is now known that benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological effects by interaction at a specific site on the GABA<sub><i>A</i></sub> receptor complex. The GABA<sub><i>A</i></sub> receptor belongs to the superfamily of ligand gated ion channels &#x2013;here the ligand is GABA and the ion channel is a chloride ion channel. The receptor is composed of a hetero-pentameric protein with each monomer (termed <i>a, &#x03B2; &#x03B3;</i> and <i>&#x03B4;)</i> proposed to have four helical domains which become embedded in the cell membrane and together form a pore, or channel. Given that there are multiple sub-types of each sub-unit, the number of variations in the final complex is immense. Detailed mutational analysis has indicated that the binding site for benzodiazepines (and newer, structurally unrelated ligands) is located on the alpha sub-unit and it is now possible to distinguish ligands that have selectivity for a specific alpha sub-unit. Thus, GABA released from a presynaptic neurone activates the postsynaptic GABA receptor and this mediates Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> channel opening which hyperpolarises the cell membrane and causes inhibition of neuronal activity. Depending on the level of efficacy displayed by a given benzodiazepine, the ligand may act as an agonist to enhance the effect of GABA, as a partial agonist to produce an intermediate effect, or as an antagonist which results in no effect other than blocking the benzodiazepine receptor and thus preventing other ligands from interacting at that site. Confused&#x003F; To add to the complication, it is also possible to synthesise benzodiazepines that act as &#x2018;inverse agonists&#x2019; which act to inhibit the GABA-mediated response and hence behave as anxiogenic agents.</p>
<p class="indent">For some time it was hoped that the level of efficacy in benzodiazepine ligands could be titrated to enable new anxiolytic agents to be produced devoid of the side effects common with this class of drugs such as drowsiness, ataxia and dependence. In fact, these are most readily controlled by selection of the drug with the most appropriate combination of half life and metabolism either to active or inactive metabolites. As an example, diazepam <b>4</b> (long half life) is demethylated in the liver to an active metabolite (very long half life, <a href="#fig_7.2">Scheme 7.2</a>) and in turn this is oxidised to oxazepam <b>5</b> (also active but with short duration). For anxiolytic agents, a relatively long duration is preferred to avoid multiple daily dosing, whereas a short duration drug is indicated for hypnotic activity. Other successful variants include lorazepam <b>6</b>, temazepam <b>7</b> and alprazolam <b>8</b>. The receptor antagonist flumezanil <b>9</b> has been used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia. Finally, the current market leader for insomnia with sales in excess of &#x0024;0.5 b is zolpidem, <b>10</b>.<a id="page_54" class="page" style="width:100%;">Page 54, Hypnotic, anxiolytic anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant agents acting at the benzodiazepine receptor</a></p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>7.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Diazepam</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">While chlordiazepoxide was in late stages of clinical development, it became necessary to study different formulations, particularly for pediatric and geriatric use, which would mask the bitter taste of the drug and would prevent decomposition of the drug once dissolved in water. The decomposition product <b>11</b> (<a href="#fig_7.3">Scheme 7.3</a>) had the same level of activity as <b>2</b> and reduction of the N-oxide also afforded a highly active anxiolytic and anticonvulsant agent <b>12</b>. Thus the two features of chlordiazepoxide, the N-oxide and the basic entity, previously thought to be crucial for activity were now shown to be superfluous. Polonovsky rearrangement of the N-oxide in the presence of acetic anhydride followed by basic hydrolysis of the acetyl group gave the 3-hydroxy derivative <b>13</b> which was subsequently developed as oxazepam. As a final discovery from this rich area of chemistry, N-methylation of <b>12</b> gave diazepam which was significantly more active than chlordiazepoxide. The syntheses of lorazepam and temazepam follow similar routes &#x2013; simple N-methylation of <b>13</b> with dimethylsulphate gives temazepam <b>7</b> directly.</p>
<p class="indent">Diazepam was also available by more convenient chemistry (<a href="#fig_7.4">Scheme 7.4</a>) starting with the benzophenone <b>14</b> followed by acylation on the anilino-NH<sub>2</sub> with chloroacetyl chloride. Nucleophilic displacement of the chloro group in liquid ammonia gave the intermediate aminoacylamide <b>15</b> which could be cyclised upon heating. Alternatively, by using NH<sub>3</sub> in ethanol under reflux, cyclisation took place <i>in situ</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">A newer approach employed the isatoic anhydride <b>16</b> and glycine as the reagent inputs (<a href="#fig_7.5">Scheme 7.5</a>). Thus <b>16</b> was first alkyated with methyl iodide and the product treated with the anion of glycine generated by addition of<a id="page_55" class="page">Page 55, Hypnotic, anxiolytic anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant agents acting at the benzodiazepine receptor</a>exactly one equivalent of triethylamine to afford the benzodiazepinedione <b>17</b> directly. In order to avoid the poor yields observed with Grignard addition to <b>17</b>, it was first necessary to form the acetyl derivative <b>18</b> and this reacted smoothly with PhMgBr to give <b>19</b>. Oxime formation and ring closure with sodium hydrogen sulphite gave diazepam possibly via the intermediacy of the sulphamate (C &#x003D; N-SO<sub>3</sub>Na).</p>
