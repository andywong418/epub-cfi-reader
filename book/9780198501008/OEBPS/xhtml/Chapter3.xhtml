<h2 class="h2"><b>3.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">The chest pain associated with angina results from a myocardial oxygen deficiency when the oxygen supply to the heart muscle is compromised because of impeded blood supply. Interventions which reduce oxygen demand and simultaneously improve supply clearly represent an ideal therapy. It is exactly this profile that is achieved by calcium channel modulators (specifically &#x2018;blockers&#x2019;); they reduce heart rate without affecting the force of contraction and have vasodilatory effects on coronary arteries, thereby reducing &#x2018;after load&#x2019; on the heart. Their ability to dilate peripheral blood vessels also enables these agents to be used in hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Two distinct types of calcium channels have been implicated in regulating vascular and cardiac tone: the voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels. The voltage gated channels are activated by changes in electrical potential across the cell membrane; opening of such channels allows calcium to enter the cell and triggers the release of calcium from internal stores. The ligand gated channel is associated with receptors such as the adrenergic receptor which, once activated by noradrenaline for example, also cause an influx of calcium into the cell. The overall effect is to raise the resting levels of intracellular calcium from 10<sup>&#x2013;7</sup>M up to 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup>M leading to formation of a complex of calcium with the intracellular protein calmodulin and this turn sets in motion the cascade of events that lead to muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The drugs reviewed in this section act predominantly on the voltage gated channels. At least three distinct groups of classes of compounds having this property have been identified as represented by nifedipine (and other dihydropyridines), diltiazam and verapamil; whether these operate at the same binding site on the calcuim channel has not been determined.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Nifedipine</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Nifedipine <b>1</b> belongs to the dihydropyridine series and was the first such agent to become approved. The synthesis is implicitly simple &#x2013; a classical Hantzsch condensation gives the dihydropyridine in one step from available starting materials (<a href="#fig_3.1">Scheme 3.1</a>). Given that the dihydropyridine is symmetrical, there is no stereogenic center in the molecule although this is not the case for later drugs of this class (see below). In the course of this synthesis, it was noticed<a id="page_22" class="page">Page 22, Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of angina and hypertension</a>that several products were detected by TLC and these impurities became problematic on a commercial scale. A more preferred method, albeit two stages, involves isolation of the intermediate Knoevenagel product, the benzylidine diester <b>2</b> followed by a Hantzsch reaction with ethyl 3-aminocrotonate (<a href="#fig_3.2">Scheme 3.2</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Amlodipine</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">As almost always happens with the first member of a mechanistic class, certain deficiencies became apparent following the widespread therapeutic use of nifedipine thereby giving the second generation drugs an opportunity to capture a significant share of the market. One such compound is amlodipine <b>3</b> whose success is based on a much longer duration of action in man to the extent that once daily dosing can effectively manage hypertension in most patients. Since the compound is no longer symmetrical, amlodipine exists as a mixture of two enantiomers which, once resolved, display markedly different calcium channel blocking activities with the (&#x2013;)-enantiomer (as the maleate salt) being 1000-fold more active. The drug is sold as the racemate, however, and was first prepared by successive Knoevenagel and Hantzsch reactions (<a href="#fig_3.3">Scheme 3.3</a>). The azide component <b>4</b> was available from 2-azidoethoxide and ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate.</p>
<p class="indent">To achieve the synthesis of the two separated enantiomers of amlodipine it was necessary to distinguish between the two ester groups so that a diastereomeric derivative <b>5(a-b)</b> could be made with the enantiomerically pure<a id="page_23" class="page">Page 23, Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of angina and hypertension</a>(S)-(&#x002B;)-2-phenylethanol (<a href="#fig_3.4">Scheme 3.4</a>). For this reason, the Hantzsch condensation utilised <b>6</b> as the third component and this was derived from the acid <b>7</b> and Meldrum&#x2019;s acid <b>8</b> acting as a two-C source. Careful base hydrolysis of the cyanoethyl ester <b>9</b> afforded the mono-acid <b>10</b> which was activated with carbonyl di-imidazole and coupled with the homochiral alcohol. The diastereomeric diesters <b>5(a-b)</b> were separated by chromatography and individually transesterified and reduced to (&#x2013;)- and (&#x002B;)-amlodipine <b>(3a and 3b).</b> The absolute stereochemistry of the more active (&#x2013;) enantiomer, originally incorrectly assigned, was shown to be (S) by X-ray structure analysis of <b>11</b> using (&#x2013;)-(1S)-camphanic acid chloride <b>12</b> as the chiral probe (<a href="#fig_3.5">Scheme 3.5</a>). Thus the active configuration is in line with other chiral dihydropyridines for which a structure has been determined.</p>

<p class="noindent">Diltiazem <b>13</b> originated from research into a series of benzothiazepines as novel antidepressants some members of which were shown to have potent coronary vasodilatory activity. The marketed drug is the (&#x002B;)-<i>cis</i>-form <b>13</b> which was subsequently shown to be the (2S, 3S)-enantiomer. It is available starting from <i>trans-</i> cinnamic acid methyl ester which was then epoxidised (<a href="#fig_3.6">Scheme 3.6</a>) and the epoxide opened with the anion of 2-nitrothiophenol.

This was then reduced and hydrolysed to the amino acid <b>15</b> and this material cyclised to the key lactam <b>16.</b> Selective N-alkylation of the lactam using dimsyl sodium as the base followed by acetylation afforded diltiazem as the more active (&#x002B;)-<i>cis</i>-isomer.</p>

<p class="indent">After the Sharpless procedure was established, it became possible to prepare the active enantiomer directly by substituting a <i>trans</i>-cinnamyl alcohol as the starting material (<a href="#fig_3.7">Scheme 3.7</a>). In the first step, <i>trans</i>-4-acetoxycinnamyl alcohol was stereoselectively epoxidised and the epoxy alcohol <b>17</b> re<a id="page_26" class="page">Page 26, Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of angina and hypertension</a>oxidised back to the carboxylic acid ester <b>18</b>. Two inversions of configuration at the 3-position (propanoic acid numbering) then followed so that the final configuration at this center was (S) in the thioether <b>19</b> and hence in diltiazem also. The process was regioselective but the reaction product was contaminated with a small amount of the (2S, 3R) isomer of <b>19</b> which was removed by crystallisation. At this stage, alcohol protection using dimethoxymethane followed by deprotection of the phenol group and methylation using diazomethane afforded <b>20</b> ready for reduction of the nitro function. Cyclisation was accomplished by hydrolysis of the methyl ester and activation of the resulting acid as the mixed anhydride. Ditiazem was accessible from <b>21</b> by N-alkylation (see above), deprotection of the secondary alcohol in an exchange reaction catalysed by titanium tetrachloride with concomitant acetylation.</p>

<p class="indent">An alternative enantioselective synthesis exploited asymmetric induction during a Darzen&#x2019;s glycidic ester condensation used to prepare the glycidic ester <b>22a</b> (<a href="#fig_3.8">Scheme 3.8</a>). The success of the approach relied on the serendipitous finding that the diastereoisomers resulting from the Darzen&#x2019;s reaction, wherein the two components were the chloroacetate <b>23</b> and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, were markedly different in their respective solubilities. Additonally, it was the desired diastereomer <b>22a</b> that was the major product and it was conveniently isolated by direct crystallisation. In contrast to the outcome witnessed in the earlier synthesis (<a href="#fig_3.7">Scheme 3.7</a>), where the thiol reaction proceeded with inversion, it was obligatory to develop conditions whereby <b>22a</b> could be converted into <b>24</b> with retention of configuration. Acid- and base-catalysed reactions gave epimerisation and inversion respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_27" class="page">Page 27, Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of angina and hypertension</a>On the other hand, the thermal process ensued with retention (note introduction of the 3-thiol causes a priority change at C-2) by a mechanism postulated to involve firstly protonation of the epoxide by the thiol to give an intermediate <b>25</b> stabilised by quinone methide cation <b>26</b> with the anion being held as a tight as a tight ion pair.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>3.5</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Verapamil</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Verapamil <b>27</b> was the first calcium channel blocker to be approved in the USA although its mechanism of action was not elucidated until that of the dihydropyridines became know. Like many drugs from the 1960&#x2013;1970 era, verapamil is sold as the racemate although it is the (2S)-(&#x2013;)-isomer which is more active at the calcium channel. The first synthesis therefore used racemic <i>&#x03B1;</i>-isopropylveratrylnitrile and <b>28</b> as the key intermediate (<a href="#fig_3.9">Scheme 3.9</a>); alternatively the order of alkylation may be reversed with little change in overall yield.</p>
<p class="indent">The separate enantiomers of <b>27</b> were first prepared (<a href="#fig_3.10">Scheme 3.10</a>) by resolution of the acid <b>31</b> with cinchonidine and this intermediate also allowed the absolute configuration of each enantiomer to be assigned by reference to a homochiral standard (see <a href="#fig_3.12">Scheme 3.12</a>). Although direct alkylation of phenylacetic acid methyl ester often runs the risk of double alkylation, in this instance only the mono-alkylated material <b>32</b> was isolated because of steric hindrance in the product. Under essentially the same reaction conditions but using the more activated allyl bromide, it was possible to generate the tertiary center in <b>33</b> and this could be saponified to the acid <b>31</b> as the racemic mixture. Addition of an equimolar amount of cinchonidine in methanol afforded a precipitate from which (&#x002B;)&#x2013;<b>31b</b> was isolated after two recrystallisations of the salt form and liberation of the free acid. The (&#x2013;)-isomer was accessed from the mother liquors in a similar manner.</p>
