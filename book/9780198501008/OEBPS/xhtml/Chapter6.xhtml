<h2 class="h2"><b>6.1</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Major depression is an extremely prevalent disease affecting over 6% of the world&#x2019;s population and accounting for over &#x0024;40 billion a year in direct health care costs and lost productivity in the US alone. Quite by chance, as an observation in patients taking iproniazid for tuberculosis, it was shown that inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO, iproniazid was subsequently shown to have this activity) had clinical antidepressant activity by raising levels of central monoamines such as noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytrypatmine, 5-HT). Thus, antidepressant efficacy may be achieved by several different pharmacological activities including inhibition of noradrenaline uptake, serotonin uptake and monoamino oxidases. As an example, the postsynaptic activity of 5-HT released after stimulation of serotonergic presynaptic neurones is limited by reuptake into the presynaptic structures; blockade of this process will act to raise and/or prolong the activation of the postsynaptic receptors and hence serotoninergic neurotransmission. Fluoxetine <b>1</b> is one of several drugs which selectively potentiate the central actions of serotonin in this way, and unlike earlier antidepressants such as the tricyclics imipramine and clomipramine, exerts little direct activity at other receptors resulting in a lower occurrence of sedative and cardiovascular side effects.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.2</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Fluoxetine</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">A Mannich reaction on acetophenone <b>2</b> (<a href="#fig_6.1">Scheme 6.1</a>) provided the key starting material <b>3</b> for the first reported synthesis of fluoxetine. Reduction of the ketone with diborane and chlorination of the resulting secondary alcohol <b>4</b> set up the reactive benzylic chloride for nucleophilic displacement with 4-trifluoro-methylphenoxide. Von Braun degradation of the &#x039D;,&#x039D;-dimethylamine afforded the desired drug via the intermediacy of the N-cyano compound <b>5</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Whilst fluoxetine <b>1</b> is marketed as the racemate, it was important to prepare and study the pharmacological behavior of the separated enantiomers. One route (<a href="#fig_6.2">Scheme 6.2</a>) involved the asymmetric reduction of 3-chloropropyl aryl ketones with diisopinocampheylchloroborane to afford the (S)-(&#x2013;)-alcohol <b>6</b> which was reacted first with NaI and then with aqueous methylamine. The resulting amine <b>7</b> was treated with NaH to generate the alkoxide and this nucleophile smoothly displaced fluoro- from 4-fluorobenzotrifluoride. Re-crystallisation of the hydrochloride salt afforded (S)-(&#x2013;)-fluoxetine the<a id="page_44" class="page">Page 44, Modulation of central serotonin in the treatment of depression</a>stereochemical integrity of which was confirmed by conversion to the diastereomeric urea <b>8</b> with (R)-l-(l-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate. HPLC analysis of <b>8</b> showed two peaks in the ratio 96:4 indicating that racemisation had not occurred during synthesis. (R)-fluoxetine was prepared by classical resolution of fluoxetine using D-(&#x2013;)-mandelic acid. Surprisingly, it was shown that the two isomers displayed little difference <i>in vitro</i> (K<sub><i>i</i></sub> as inhibitors of the serotonin uptake carrier in rat cortex were 21 and 33 nM for the (&#x002B;)- and (&#x2013;)-isomers respectively) and in behavioral tests <i>in vivo</i>. Nevertheless, it is (S)-fluoxetine that is the predominant therapeutic enantiomer since this isomer is eliminated more slowly than the (R)-isomer in human beings.</p>

<p class="indent">An alternative procedure which gave access to both enantiomers relied on the asymmetric epoxidation of cinnamyl alcohol and subsequent regioselective reduction of the resulting epoxide with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride (&#x2018;Red-Al&#x2019;, <a href="#fig_6.3">Scheme 6.3</a>). Either chiral epoxide <b>9a</b> or <b>9b</b> is directly available from cinnamyl alcohol by correct choice of epoxidation catalyst. (S)-(&#x2013;)-fluoxetine required the use of D-(&#x2013;)-diisopropyl tartrate to yield <b>9a</b> which was reduced to afford the 1,3-diol <b>10</b> in a 14:1 mixture with the 1,2-diol after much experimentation. The crude diol was reacted selectively at the primary alcohol with 1 equivalent of mesyl chloride, the product purified by chromatography and the mesyl group displaced with methylamine in aqueous THF. Generation of the alkoxide of the secondary alcohol and reaction with p-chlorobenzotrifluoride completed the synthesis. The (R)-(&#x002B;)-isomer was prepared in a similar manner but starting with <b>9b</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">Recent debate has focussed on the (R)-isomer as being the preferred drug and, indeed, this single enantiomer is currently being developed based on the argument that the prolonged duration of the (S)-isomer in man can contribute to the occasional side effects noted since the concentration of that isomer in the body may well build up after multiple doses. As an interesting foot note to the patent that provokes this debate, the claim is to R-(&#x2013;)-fluoxetine but it should be noted that this material, as the HC1 salt, is laevorotatory in methanol but dextrorotatory in water.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>6.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Sertraline</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">Early research showed that <i>trans</i>-N-alkyl-4-phenyl-tetrahydronaphthylamines e.g. <b>11</b> had excellent antidepressant activity acting primarily by blocking synaptosomal noradrenaline uptake &#x2013; and thus associated with the typical range of mechanism-based side effects. The <i>cis</i>-racemates were mainly inactive as noradrenaline uptake blockers and this discouraged detailed<a id="page_46" class="page">Page 46, Modulation of central serotonin in the treatment of depression</a>exploration within the <i>cis</i>-series. As the serotonergic hypothesis became established, these and other analogues were evaluated for the now preferred mechanism and it took almost 8 years to discover that the <i>cis</i>-series, typified by sertraline, <i>cis-</i>(<i>&#x002B;</i>)<i>-</i><b>12</b>, had the better profile. Unlike fluoxetine, sertraline is a single enantiomer with <i>cis</i>-(lS,4S) absolute configuration.</p>

<p class="indent">The starting benzophenone <b>13</b> was readily available on a large scale by AlCl<sub>3</sub> mediated Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with 3,4-dichlorobenzoyl chloride (<a href="#fig_6.4">Scheme 6.4</a>). A Stobbe reaction between benzophenone <b>13</b> and diethylsuccinate afforded the mono acid <b>14</b> which was hydrolysed and decarboxylated under strongly acidic conditions and then hydrogenated to the<a id="page_47" class="page">Page 47, Modulation of central serotonin in the treatment of depression</a>4,4-diarylbutanoic acid <b>15</b>. Exposure to thionyl chloride afforded the acid chloride which was induced to cyclise under Friedel-Crafts conditions on to the more reactive aryl ring. In the case of analogues bearing electron donating groups in place of the 3,4-dichloro arrangement, an alternative process was required since the switch in reactivity gave the undesired cyclisation product. The substituted tetralone <b>16</b> was condensed with methylamine in the presence of the Lewis acid, titanium tetrachloride, and the resulting imine immediately reduced to a mixture of <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-amines <b>12</b>. Using 10% Pd-C as the hydrogenation catalyst gave a 70:30 mixture in favour of the <i>cis</i>-form and this was purified as its hydrochloride salt by fractional crystallisation. The pure <i>cis-</i>racemate was resolved with D-(&#x2013;)-mandelic acid to give the (&#x002B;)-(lS,4S) isomer of <b>12</b> whose absolute configuration was determined by X-ray crystallography. The alternate enantiomer, <i>cis</i>-(&#x2013;)-(lR,4R), could be obtained using L-(&#x002B;)-mandelic acid in place of the D-form.</p>

<p class="indent">The intermediate tetralone <b>16</b> could be made by a more efficient process involving a Friedel-Crafts reaction (<a href="#fig_6.5">Scheme 6.5</a>) using three equivalents of AlCl<sub>3</sub> and 1,2-dichlorobenzene which was acylated with succinic anhydride to give <b>17</b> accompanied by only trace amounts of the ortho-regioisomer. Borohydride reduction of the ketone group and spontaneous lactonisation during the work up gave <b>18</b>. After much experimentation with a variety of protic and Lewis acids, it was shown that <b>18</b> could be converted directly into <b>16</b> by alkylation &#x2013; acylation with benzene in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid presumably through the intermediacy of the diaryl acid <b>19</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, an enantioselective synthesis of sertraline has been described based on the regio- and enantioselective ring opening of oxabenzonorbornenes (such as <b>20</b>, <a href="#fig_6.6">Scheme 6.6</a>) under reductive conditions. Thus, <b>20</b>, readily available from a Diels-Alder reaction between benzyne and furan, was treated with DIBAL in the presence of Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub> and (S)-BINAP, preferably in toluene, to afford <b>21</b> in good yield and 91% ee recrystallisation of which improved the ee to 98%. Protection of the alcohol followed by bromination of the double bond and elimination of HBr with diazbicycloundecane (DBU) gave <b>22</b>. A Stille cross coupling reaction with 3,4-<a id="page_48" class="page">Page 48, Modulation of central serotonin in the treatment of depression</a>dichlorophenyltrimethylstannane and deprotection gave <b>23</b> with the caveat that acetic acid was present to avoid aromatisation following elimination of silanol. The next step required hydrogenation of the double bond directed by the secondary alcohol and this was achieved by hydrogenation catalysed with an iridium complex know as &#x2018;Crabtree&#x2019;s&#x2019; catalyst with high facial selectivity to give <b>24</b> in a ratio of 28:1 trans:cis. Complete inversion of stereochemistry during formation of the azide <b>25</b> gave, after catalytic reduction, the enatiomerically pure primary amine but now with the ring substituents having a <i>cis</i> relationship. This was treated with ethyl chloroformate and the resulting urethane reduced directly to sertraline.</p>

<p class="indent">Another approach involved catalytic asymmetric synthesis to produce the tetralone <b>16</b> with 100% ee of the (S)-enantiomer which could be transformed into (&#x002B;)-<i>cis</i>-sertraline by reductive amination described above.

<p class="indent">The first synthesis of paroxetine and other analogues within the series used a route wherein an intermediate allowed ready separation of the <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-forms each as the racemate (<a href="#fig_6.8">Scheme 6.8</a>). Starting with arecoline <b>32</b>, Michael addition of 4-fluorophenyl magnesium bromide gave <b>33</b> as a mixture of <i>cis-</i>(<b>33a</b>) and <i>trans-</i>(<b>33b</b>). It was found that the <i>cis</i>-form could be isolated pure by equilibration of the mixture with NaOMe in refluxing benzene. The <i>trans</i>-form was available only by separation of the original mixture. The cis material was hydrolysed with aqueous HCl and the resulting acid treated with thionyl chloride to give <b>34</b>. Transformation into diastereomeric menthol esters 35 allowed the isomers to be separated by distillation. The (&#x2013;)-<i>cis</i>-form was hydrolysed under acidic conditions and reduced to the carbinol <b>36</b> which was<a id="page_50" class="page">Page 50, Modulation of central serotonin in the treatment of depression</a>chlorinated with thionyl chloride and etherified with 3,4-methylenedioxyphenol as its sodium salt. Finally, it was necessary to remove the N-methyl group of <b>37</b> and this was achieved by treatment first with phenylchloroformate and then hydrolysis and concomitant decarboxylation of the urethane under forcing conditions. Subsequently, it was found that the use of vinylchloroformate allowed the demethylation process to occur under much milder conditions. Thus the intermediate vinylurethane (<b>38</b>, <a href="#fig_6.9">Scheme 6.9</a>) could be hydrochlorinated with HCl gas and the chloroethylurethane <b>39</b> hydrolysed in refluxing methanol.</p>
