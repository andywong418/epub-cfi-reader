<p class="noindent">During the preparation of aza-analogues of the anti-malarial agent, chloroquine <b>1</b> (<a href="#fig_10.1">Scheme 10.1</a>), the quinolone <b>2</b> was isolated and displayed good antibacterial properties, particularly against some Gram negative bacteria. Further structure activity studies resulted in the synthesis of nalidixic acid <b>3</b>, the prototypic member of this class. Since nalidixic acid was introduced in 1963, hundreds of other analogues have been made and several have been brought to market. Of the first generation, nalidixic acid and its analogues have found most utility in the treatment of infections of the urinary tract where the drug seems to concentrate. To improve the spectrum of activity and to overcome increased levels of resistance, newer agents were sought and the second generation quinolones exemplified by norfloxacin <b>4</b>, ciprofloxacin <b>5</b> and ofloxacin <b>6</b> are now widely used.</p>

<p class="indent">Nalidixic acid was readily synthesised starting with a reaction of 2-amino-6-methylpyridine <b>7</b> with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate. The intermediate enamine <b>8</b> was cyclised at high temperature to the hydroxypyridine 8 hydrolysis and N-alkyaltion of which affored <b>9</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">All drugs of this class, unlike the cephalosporins and penicillins which inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, act as potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA synthesis. Bacterial DNA exists as a negative, right-handed supercoil as a result of the ends being covalently closed to form circular DNA and this &#x2018;compact&#x2019; form of DNA is required so that the genome can be folded into the cell. In addition, the enzyme-catalysed make and break reactions (of double stranded DNA) are required during the replication of DNA and its translation into RNA. The processes are mediated by the poly-functional enzyme, DNA-gyrase and involves sequential DNA cutting, nicking and reunion coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to produce the high energy superhelix. Quinolone antibiotics inhibit DNA gyrase and thus prevent the topological changes needed for DNA replication and RNA transcription and leaves a relaxed form of bacterial DNA which can not yield the correctly folded chromosome.</p>

The 4-hydroxypyridine <b>12</b> was the only product, the alternative cyclisation presumably being inhibited by the presence of the bulky chloro- group, and this was preferentially alkyated on nitrogen by reaction with EtI in the presence of potassium carbonate. The pyridine ester <b>13</b>, now locked in the pyridone form, was hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid and the chlorine displaced by piperazine presumably by an addition &#x2013; elimination reaction with the molecule behaving as a vinylogous acid chloride.</p>

<h2 class="h2"><b>10.3</b><span class="space">&#160;</span><b>Ciprofloxacin</b></h2>
<p class="noindent">It was necessary to use an alternative process for the synthesis of ciprofloxacin <b>3</b> with the N-cyclopropyl substituent being incorporated at an earlier stage (<a href="#fig_10.3">Scheme 10.3</a>). <i>&#x03B2;</i>-Cyclopropylamino propionic acid methyl ester was prepared from methylacrylate and cyclopropylamine and then heated with <b>14</b> to give <b>15</b> as the major product. This material was cyclised to <b>16</b> and oxidised by treatment with bromine followed by elimination to the quinolone <b>17</b>. Once again, nucleophilic displacement of the chloro group by piperazine affored the desired drug <b>5</b>.</p>
<p class="indent">During the 1990&#x2019;s, the concept of combinatorial chemistry, originally developed for peptides and peptidomimetics, was applied to the synthesis of drug like libraries of compounds. An early demonstration of the power of this new technology was provided by a solid phase approach to quinolones which included ciprofloxacin (<a href="#fig_10.4">Scheme 10.4</a>). The ester <b>18</b> was <i>trans</i>-esterified with the benzyl alcohol supported on a Wang resin to give the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto ester <b>19</b> now attached to the resin. Activation of the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto ester with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal and capture of the intermediate with any suitable primary amine (&#x2018;monomers&#x2019;, only 2 were used for this demonstration) gave the corresponding enamides exemplified by <b>20</b>. Both of these enamides were cyclised in a reaction catalysed by tetramethylquanidine to afford the quinolone (e.g. 21) which was then subjected to nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Four different secondary amines were selected; for ciprofloxacin <b>5</b> the required amine was piperazine. All resin bound esters were cleaved from the support by exposure to TFA and the products purified by HPLC; overall yields varied from 6&#x2013;24 %. Given that there are over 1000 primary and secondary amines commercially available, this methodology could, in principle, give access to 1 million analogues. Of course, one would carefully select a small subset of monomer inputs based on computational screening of<a id="page_83" class="page">Page 83, Quinolones as antibacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors</a>the final virtual products so that a maximally informative library would be available for biological screening.</p>

<p class="noindent">Unlike other quinolone antibiotics, ofloxacin has an additional ring (a 1, 4-oxazine) and a stereogenic center which require attention during the synthesis; the drug was developed as the racemate but the more active enantiomer, the (&#x2013;)-form is now sold as levofloxacin. The first synthetic route started from <a class="page" id="page_84">Page 84, Quinolones as antibacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors</a>2, 3, 4-trifluoronitrobenzene which was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to give <b>22</b> as the major product. The outcome of this reaction is predicated by synergistic activation of the 2-F by the ortho-nitro and -fluoro groups but competitive reaction at the 4-position necessitated a chromatographic separation.</p>

<p class="indent">O-Alkylation of the phenol with chloroacetone gave <b>23</b> which was reduced and cyclised spontaneously to the dihydro benzoxazine <b>24</b>. Michael addition of this amine to diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate under forcing conditions gave the adduct <b>25</b> ready for cyclisation to the pyridone using polyphosphoric ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the ethyl ester <b>26</b> under acidic conditions and displacement of 7-fluoro group (quinolone numbering) by N-methyl piperidine afforded <b>6</b> without the formation of the alternative regioisomer.</p>

<p class="indent">An intramolecular cyclisation involving a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group already attached to the preformed quinolone on to the substituted phenyl ring provided an efficient alternative (<a href="#fig_10.6">Scheme 10.6</a>). The keto ester <b>27</b> was readily available from <b>28</b> by reaction with ethoxymagnesium malonate and this was reacted with N-methylpiperazine. Both 2-F and 4-F are activated by the electron withdrawing ketone carbonyl but it was found that regioselective displacement of the desired 4-F occurred when the reaction was performed in acetonitrile in the presence of a weak base such as bicarbonate. The resulting amine <b>29</b> was treated with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal to give the intermediate <b>30</b> which was immediately reacted with 2-amino-1-propanol. The resulting enaminoketone <b>31</b> was treated with KF in DMF with the anticipation that a one step conversion to <b>6</b> would occur as was the case in the model system when the piperazine ring was<a id="page_85" class="page">Page 85, Quinolones as antibacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors</a>replaced by F. Instead, the intermediate <b>32</b> was isolated presumably because the electron donating character of the piperazine ring reduces reactivity towards nucleophilic displacement. However, the synthesis was completed by treatment of <b>32</b> to a stronger base, NaH, and indeed, exposure of <b>31</b> to NaH gave <b>6</b> directly.</p>

<p class="indent">Several methods have been reported for the preparation of the enantiomers of ofloxacin. It is now know from X-ray analysis of the separated enantiomers that the more active isomer is the (S)-(&#x2013;)-form and this is marketed as levofloxacin. Perhaps the route most ammenable to large scale production involves an enzyme catalysed hydrolysis of <b>34</b> selective for one isomer over the other (<a href="#fig_10.7">Scheme 10.7</a>). Starting from 2, 3-difluoro, 6-nitrophenol, 33 was available using chloromethyl acetoxymethylketone as the alkylating agent and the product reduced with Raney Nickel. The resulting amine cyclised <i>in situ</i> to give the benzoxazine <b>34</b> as a mixture of enantiomers. This mixture was incubated with lipoprotein lipase in a biphasic reaction medium, an organic phase of hexane and benzene and an aqueous phase maintained at physiological conditions. For larger scale preparations, the enzyme was adsorbed on to an Amberlite resin and re-used over several cycles. It was discovered that the (R-(&#x002B;)-isomer was hydrolysed to the primary alcohol <b>35</b> leaving the (S)-isomer <b>36</b> unchanged and these products were easily separated by column chromatography. The enantiomerically pure acetate was hydrolysed to <b>37</b> and then treated successively with thionyl chloride and<a id="page_86" class="page">Page 86, Quinolones as antibacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors</a>borohydride to effect conversion to the methyl group seen in the final drug product. The methyl-substituted benzoxazine <b>38</b> was taken through to (<b>S</b>)<b>-</b>(<b>&#x2013;</b>)<b>-6</b> using the chemistry described in <a href="#fig_10.5">Scheme 10.5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="margin-top:1em;">Since both (S)- and (R)-alaninol are readily accessible from the alanine, methods were investigated which used this synthon. Such an approach started with a Michael reaction between (S)-(&#x002B;)-2-aminopropanol and ethyl propiolate (<a href="#fig_10.8">Scheme 10.8</a>) to give after protection of the primary alcohol as the acetate, the acrylate <b>39</b>. This was then reacted with tetrafluorobenzoyl chloride in the presence of base to yield the adduct <b>40</b>. As indicated above, it was possible to effect a double cyclisation of <b>40</b> by first unmasking the primary alcohol under mildly basic conditions followed by more forcing conditions give <b>41</b> without isolation of intermediates. It was subsequently shown that the same homochiral starting material [either (S)- or (R)-alaninol] could be incorporated into (S)- or (R)-<b>6</b> more directly by using the <i>&#x03B2;</i>-keto ester <b>27</b> as the starting material followed by reaction with diethyl ethoxymethylene malonate and then following the chemistry outlined in <a href="#fig_10.6">Scheme 10.6</a>.</p>
